2285,stable regional water resource distribution is essential for ecosystems yet soil water dynamics and groundwater evolutions of check dams remain many uncertainties under natural rainfall reduction in semi arid areas to explore these changeable hydrologic processes continuous fixed point observation and water balance models were introduced in nearly four consecutive hydrological years 2018 2021 the results showed that soil water storage presented a downward fluctuation in each soil layer of all land uses moreover the grassland profile moisture descended slowly and had deeper infiltration depths than others which might be an ideal land use type for the reservoir s sustainable utilization in check dams the results also indicated that surface soil moisture 50 cm could rapidly respond to a single rainfall event 10 mm d 1 whereas deep soil moisture 50 cm and shallow groundwater fluctuations were mainly affected by annual cumulative precipitation furthermore a conceptual hydrological model of rainwater falling to the ground percolating through soil profiles and reaching groundwater through different vegetation covers in check dams has been proposed soil infiltration rates varied under different land use types and depths ranging from 0 82 to 3 47 cm h 1 the groundwater recharge time from accumulated annual rainfall was 69 250 days whereas the discharge time due to vegetation water consumption and groundwater lateral movement was 66 774 days with a decrease in annual rainfall the recharge time gradually increased whereas the discharge time gradually decreased these results

data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction climate change has caused uneven regional rainfall distribution leading to dry regions getting drier and affecting regional water circulation chou et al 2013 liu et al 2013 in parts of semi arid areas soil water and groundwater could not be effectively replenished by the decreased seasonal rainfall temporarily kl√∏ve et al 2014 grillakis 2019 this insufficient rainfall in turn has led to aftereffects such as tree mortality anderegg et al 2015 wang et al 2019 dried soil layers wang et al 2010 shao et al 2018 and groundwater resource shortage peters et al 2005 allen et al 2010 therefore it is imperative to evaluate the impact of reduced rainfall on the hydrological cycles and sustainable vegetation growth in semi arid areas check dams which are essential for water conservation and vegetation restoration in semi arid areas are natural independent hydrologic units for studying the disturbance caused by precipitation events on soil moisture dynamics and shallow groundwater evolutions zhao et al 2017 abbasi et al 2019 luo et al 2020 yao et al 2022 previous studies have demonstrated the crucial efficiency of check dams for gully restoration fang et al 2019 boix fayos et al 2020 water conservation boix fayos et al 2008 vaezi et al 2017 shi et al 2019 soil development wang et al 2011 yao et al 2022 hydrological regulation piton et al 2017 and food security agoramoorthy et al 2008 wang et al 2011 after nearly 30 years of siltation most artificial check dams were silted with sediments in stable conditions the interception ability of check dams has gradually decreased but ecological responses are becoming increasingly evident wang et al 2017 yao et al 2022 these rain fed check dams have been developed for various land uses such as farmland grassland scrubland and shrub grass mixture abandoned land verstraeten and prosser 2008 jin et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 however only a few studies have investigated the regularity and characteristics of profile water variations under different land uses of check dams nevertheless previous scientific literature on other ecosystems of the semi arid areas of the loess plateau provided ponderable references and they concluded that different land uses led to significant differences in hydrological process distributions huang et al 2013 shao et al 2018 huang and shao 2019 wang et al 2020 in general soil moisture was greater in natural vegetation than in artificial vegetation from the perspective of land uses soil moisture showed a preference for rain fed farmland and grassland followed by shrubland and woodland jia et al 2015 huang and shao 2019 and even under the same land use vegetation species and coverage ratio changes also showed diverse potencies d odorico et al 2007 she et al 2014 moreover owing to the threshold limit of soil water carrying capacity for vegetation in the semi arid areas of the loess plateau unreasonable vegetation types would aggravate vegetation evapotranspiration deplete soil reservoirs and eventually leads to soil desiccation and shallow groundwater recession wang et al 2010 huang et al 2013 jia et al 2015 jia et al 2017 shao et al 2018 therefore further exploration is required to determine whether various land uses affect soil moisture and groundwater in check dams as in other geographic locations on the semi arid areas of the loess plateau in recent years precipitation has shown a decreasing trend in semi arid areas however its impact on soil moisture and groundwater resources remains unclear zhao and wu 2013 wang et al 2015a wang et al 2017 in particular in artificial rain fed check dam ecosystems there are more uncertainties in the regional water cycle wang et al 2013a luo et al 2020 previous studies have demonstrated that the responses of soil moisture and groundwater to rainwater are complicated which could have been affected by rainfall characteristics he et al 2012 yang et al 2014b petrie et al 2015 he et al 2020 surface vegetation distributions wang et al 2013a fan et al 2016 and soil conditions jin et al 2018 yang et al 2018 moreover there are deficiencies in the relationships between the reduction of natural rainfall soil water dynamics under different land uses and shallow groundwater evolutions in rain fed check dams nevertheless in situ monitoring data from soil moisture probes and groundwater depth probes might provide sequential evidence of the whole moving process of rainwater from the vegetation canopy to groundwater under natural rainfall reduction the objectives of the present study therefore were to i clarify soil moisture dynamics under natural rainfall reduction scenarios on farmland grassland scrubland and shrub grass mixture abandoned land in rain fed check dams ii elucidate the impact of rainfall reduction on shallow groundwater recharge and discharge and iii construct a conceptual hydrological balance model from rainfall events to vegetation differences soil moisture changes and groundwater fluctuations in check dams this study provides a reference for land use planning and sustainable utilization of underground reservoirs under climate change in future ecological restoration projects to check dams in semi arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions this study was conducted in shaanxi shenmu natural field observation and research station of erosion and environment liudaogou catchment 6 9 km2 38 46 38 51 n 110 21 110 23 e 1094 1274 m a m s l which is located in the typical semi arid loess hilly and gully region fig 1 a the climate of the watershed is dry with little rain in winter and spring while rainy in summer and autumn the annual average precipitation is 452 8 mm 2003 2021 accounting for about 75 from june to september moreover most rainfall occurs in the form of heavy rain the annual average temperature is 8 4 the annual total solar radiation is 5922 mj m 2 the annual average potential evapotranspiration is about 1192 mm and the average aridity index the ratio of annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation is 1 8 fan 2019 the main soil textures are sandy loess and aeolian sandy soil the vegetation types are mainly shrubs and grasses including medicago sativa lespedeza davurica astragalus adsurgens pall stipa bungeana artem isiaordosica incarvillea sinensis lam artemisia gmelinii caragana korshinskii salix psammophila prunusarmeniaca populus simonii fig 1a ge et al 2020 due to its unique geographic location coarse texture and relatively thinner soil layers farmland grassland scrubland and shrub grass mixture abandoned land are the most popular land uses in the artificial rain fed check dams of the semi arid areas of the loess plateau our experiment was carried out on these land uses in two of the largest check dams of liudaogou catchment these two check dams have been built for a long time with stable loess deposition and displayed different land uses which were places of regional representation and demonstration soil physical properties and vegetation types are shown in fig 1 and table 1 in check dam a farmland grassland and scrubland are distributed successively fig 1b farmland accounts for 20 with an average topsoil bulk density of 1 47 g cm 3 rotated annually with corn and potatoes grassland accounts for 36 with an average topsoil bulk density of 1 49 g cm 3 which main species are alfalfa miscanthus and dogstail scrubland accounts for 44 with an average topsoil bulk density of 1 51 g cm 3 of which the main species are caragana and artemisia in check dam b shrub grass mixture abandoned land makes up around 90 area with an average topsoil bulk density of 1 49 g cm 3 fig 1c although the sediment size distribution geographical location and vegetation covering under the two check dams were different the hydrological processes affected by rainfall were also comparable due to the same meteorological conditions 2 2 measurements of volumetric soil water dynamics soil volumetric water content vwc was determined using automated soil moisture probes the vwc in check dam a was measured using a cr200 series datalogger campbell sci inc logan ut usa connected to tdr 315h probes acclima inc meridian idaho usa the tdr 315h probes were installed at 10 20 50 100 200 and 400 cm on farmland label tdr3 as f and grassland label tdr2 as g in check dam a fig 1b given the hard rock two meters underground five probes were installed in the profiles of 10 20 50 100 and 200 cm on the scrubland label tdr1 as s fig 1b these probes became functional on june 15 2018 and were measured hourly the vwc in check dam b was measured using an em50 datalogger meter group inc pullman wa usa connected to ec 5 soil probes decagon devices pullman wa usa the ec 5 soil probes were set at 20 50 100 200 and 400 cm on the shrub grass mixture abandoned land in check dam b fig 1c ec 5 1 was installed at the ditch head of check dam b tagged as sg1 where the ratio of grasses to shrubs was 4 6 ec 5 2 was installed in the middle of check dam b labeled sg2 where the ratio of grasses to shrubs was 7 3 the measurements were logged at half hourly intervals from july 2018 to october 2021 according to data measured by the probes at one soil layer through observation soil water storage sws is determined as follows 1 sws lp vwc lpi 100 where l refers to s g f sg1 and sg2 respectively p is the time of data acquisition from june 2018 to october 2021 i is one of the 10 cm depth intervals from 0 to 10 cm 10 20 cm 390 400 cm respectively vwc lpi is the average moisture of i depth at p time under land use l vwc at each point is obtained by linear interpolation between the two adjacent probes then the vwc lpi is multiplied by the thickness of 10 cm to obtain the sws at the special 10 cm thickness finally swslp is the superposition of each 10 cm soil layer s water storage moreover a uniform baseline facilitated a comprehensive understanding and comparison of the entire soil profile moisture spm under different land uses the effective saturation ratio represents spm garc√≠a gamero et al 2021 equation 2 2 spm Œ∏

and maximum measured vwc through the soil profile in one land use respectively i j represent two different land uses in s g f sg1 and sg2 respectively Œ¥spm200 and Œ¥spm400 are the differences between different land uses in the 200 and 400 cm profiles respectively considering the geological structure there were no soil moisture data at 400 cm in the scrubland and a 200 cm profile was used to compare water differences in all land uses additionally water differences at the 400 cm profile were analyzed except for the scrubland to reflect the effect of deep root activities on spm furthermore soil moisture changes in response time to precipitation srt were calculated as a 10 increase in vwc detty and mcguire 2010 fig 2 a the 10 increase values were chosen to exclude the soil moisture sensor error and reflect the effects of each rainfall event which can be observed during data processing soil infiltration rates ir were then defined as the soil thickness divided by the response time to rainwater it is defined as follows 5 srt a d b d a srt b d c d b 6 ir ba sd b sd a srt b srt a where srta and srtb are the response times to precipitation through the soil thicknesses of sda and sdb respectively da represents the occurrence time of rainfall events db is the start time when soil moisture increases by 10 at the observation point and dc is when soil moisture increases by 10 at the immediate next observation point 2 3 monitoring of groundwater depth evolutions shallow groundwater evolution was performed using hobo u20 001 04 probes onset bourne ma usa every hour every day fig 1b 1c four probes ag80 ag300 ag340 and ag510 were arranged from the trench head to the end of the ditch in check dam a between october 25 2016 and july 5 2017 three probes bg50 bg150 and bg280 were installed in check dam b on october 25 2016 ag refers to the groundwater well in check dam a ag80 was situated in the middle of the scrubland ag300 was located in grassland near the scrubland ag340 was located in the middle of the grassland ag510 was arranged in the middle of the farmland bg refers to the groundwater well in check dam b which was arranged in shrub grass mixture abandoned land moreover the numbers following ag and bg were defined as the distance from the groundwater well to the trench head in this study the same test period data 2018 2021 as the soil moisture were monitored there were apparent differences in the peaks and valleys in the groundwater hydrographs we assumed that the time difference from when groundwater begins to rise to the next trough which indicates the time of the impact of precipitation in an independent hydrological year was taken as the groundwater discharge time dt fig 2b similarly the time rainwater infiltrates through the soil to groundwater from first reaching the trough floor to the starting point of a significant rise was defined as the groundwater recharge time rt fig 2b the formula is expressed as follows 7 dt d n d m 8 rt d k d n where d m indicates the date when the water depth first reached the bottom of the hydrograph of the groundwater fluctuation d n is the date at which the water depth began to increase d k represents the date when the water depth reaches the valley floor through the crest of wave the average discharge time of rainwater to groundwater adt was calculated using the arithmetic mean of multiple discharge times the average recharge time of rainwater to groundwater art was obtained using the arithmetic mean of multiple recharge times 2 4 precipitation characteristics during the observation period 2018 2021 an automatic tipping bucket rain gauge 1 km was installed between check dams a and b these precipitation data effectively represent rainfall events for both check dams the precipitation characteristics during the four observational hydrological years are presented in fig 3 which shows a decreasing trend year by year the year 2018 was a humid year with total precipitation of 676 9 mm the year 2019 was a normal year with precipitation of 423 9 mm 2020 and 2021 were classified as dry years with rainfall of 350 1 mm and 327 mm respectively fig 3a in this study daily rainfall was used to indicate rainfall intensity where 72 4 was in 10 mm d 1 20 2 was 10 25 mm d 1 and 7 was 25 mm d 1 fig 3a table 2 moreover 85 of the annual rainfall occurs between may and october fig 3b therefore the annual decrease in rainfall provided suitable natural conditions for our research which is conducive to fully understanding the response of soil moisture to rainfall reduction in different land uses and the ecological implications of groundwater fluctuations in check dams 2 5 statistical analysis differences in soil profile moisture spm between different land uses were analyzed using the wilcoxon signed rank test with a significance level of Œ± 0 05 garc√≠a gamero et al 2021 the coefficient of variation cv was used to describe the degree of dispersion of groundwater fluctuations the relationships between rainfall events soil moisture variations in different land uses and groundwater fluctuations were characterized using linear regression analysis p 0 05 calculations and graphs were generated using originpro 2021 originlab northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 soil moisture dynamics under different land uses 3 1 1 soil profile moisture differences soil profile moisture spm differences through the 200 cm profiles are shown in fig 4 the impacts of anthropogenic farming activities and land use under natural succession on the soil profile water varied significantly spm of f was significantly higher than g at 55 9 of months fig 4a while lower than s sg1 and sg2 at 68 4 54 3 and 50 2 of months respectively fig 4b 4c 4d spm of g was higher than sg1 at 51 1 of months fig 4f while worse than s and sg2 by 68 6 and 52 8 of months respectively fig 4e 4g spm of sg1 was lower than sg2 by 57 1 of months fig 4h spm of s was better than sg1 and sg2 by 63 2 and 68 0 of months respectively fig 4m 4n months of spm dominated by farmland were primarily concentrated in 2018 and 2019 during which rainfall was relatively abundant however a higher soil moisture of grassland scrubland and shrub grass mixture abandoned land was presented with annual rainfall decreased in 2020 and 2021 therefore with decreasing annual rainfall the soil profile moisture was greater under natural land uses than under farmland to further understand the water information between different land uses in the deeper profile and the effect of deep root distribution on soil water we analyzed the moisture differences in the 400 cm depth profile fig 5 there were significant differences between f and sg1 and the spm months of f were greater than those of sg1 fig 5a spm of f was significantly higher than that of sg2 throughout the monitoring period fig 5b months of spm in f were greater than those in g fig 5c the higher spm months of g were greater than those of sg1 and sg2 fig 5d 5e spm of sg1 was significantly lower than sg2 at 77 09 of the months fig 5f interestingly after increasing the moisture change to 400 cm the overall level of moisture performance in farmland was better than that in scrubland and grassland these results differed from the 200 cm profiles which might be related to the deep root water consumption of shrubs e g caragana or grasses e g alfalfa and water replenishment in previous wet years 2016 2018 nevertheless the deep profile moisture of the grassland gradually showed a higher content under the scenario of reduced annual precipitation 3 1 2 soil water storage changes with a decrease in annual rainfall from 2018 to 2021 sws significantly decreased under different land uses fig 6 in topsoil 0 20 cm the sws of s g f sg1 and sg2 decreased by 15 0 33 5 56 8 25 0 and 70 3 respectively at the depths from 0 cm to 50 cm sws of s g f sg1 and sg2 decreased by 16 3 32 4 49 9 29 8 and 54 8 respectively from 0 cm to 100 cm sws of s g f sg1 and sg2 decreased by 17 3 29 7 46 6 38 7 and 46 1 respectively from 0 cm to 200 cm sws of s g f sg1 and sg2 decreased by 18 8 29 4 43 6 36 6 and 40 5 respectively from 0 cm to 400 cm sws of g f sg1 and sg2 decreased by 26 0 7 1 38 1 and 28 5 respectively owing to the accumulated annual rainfall the sws in the deep profile was gradually replenished in autumn and winter however the seasonal replenishment of rainwater did not meet vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation in the following year consequently sws showed a downward trend as precipitation decreased year by year 3 2 characteristics of shallow groundwater evolutions the shallow groundwater table depth wtd evolutions in check dams a and b are shown in fig 7 shallow groundwater depth showed a decreasing trend with the decrease in annual precipitation and rainwater could not fully replenish to groundwater discharge there were four groundwater depth observation wells in check dam a the wtd of ag80 was from 1 95 m to 3 64 m with an average of 3 11 m of which the cv was 0 11 the wtd of ag300 was from 7 44 m to 8 19 m with an average of 8 00 m and the cv was 0 03 the wtd average of ag340 was 7 10 m with a cv of 0 10 ranging from 6 32 m to 8 45 m the wtd of ag510 was from 4 81 m to 6 94 m with an average of 6 30 m and the cv was 0 07 the four groundwater depth wells had similar decreasing volatility characteristics in check dam a which consistently responded to annual precipitation these wells rapidly responded to rainfall in 2018 reaching peak levels in the middle of the year july and gradually declining until july of the following year the annual precipitation in 2019 decreased by 253 0 mm compared to 2020 the wtd was gradually replenished after lagging in october 2019 however the thickness of the supplementary water table was lower than that in the previous year consequently the thickness of the supplementary water was stable until june of the following year furthermore the annual precipitation in 2020 continued to decrease 73 9 mm less than in 2019 the wtd at each water well lagged after november and the amount of water supplied was less than that in 2019 the amount of replenished water gradually declined in july of the following year check dam b was equipped with three wells to record wtd changes the wtd of bg50 was from 3 58 m to 4 33 m with an average of 4 12 m and the cv was 0 05 the wtd of bg150 was from 3 56 m to 4 55 m with an average of 4 20 m of which the cv was 0 07 the average wtd of bg280 was 4 02 m with a cv of 0 10 ranging from 2 96 m to 4 44 m the three wells in check dam b rapidly responded to rainfall events in 2018 with significant fluctuations whereas the response to rainfall in other years was not noticeable therefore due to decreasing yearly rainfall but relatively stable potential evapotranspiration etp rainwater could not effectively replenish the groundwater and the underground water tables gradually dropped 3 3 relations between precipitation soil moisture variation and groundwater table fluctuation soil moisture variations and groundwater table fluctuations correspond to rainfall events fig 8 the results showed that rainfall significantly affected the surface 50 cm of soil moisture whereas a lagging effect was observed on deep soil water and groundwater fluctuations specifically soil moisture changes at 10 cm could be captured after rainfall events 10 mm d 1 fig 8a moreover soil moisture fluctuations were less correlated with rainfall events at 20 cm than at 10 cm but remained significant fig 8b additionally soil moisture variations also showed a significant correlation with rainfall events at 50 cm but the relationship weakened compared to those at 10 cm and 20 cm fig 8c groundwater table fluctuations were not sensitive to single and small rainfall events but were significantly affected by annual cumulative rainfall furthermore with reduced rainfall every year less rainwater was available to recharge shallow groundwater and the groundwater table lowered considerably fig 8d based on the fluctuation of soil moisture after rainfall events the minimum rainfall threshold to soil moisture response the response time to rainwater at the specific soil layers srt and shallow groundwater recharge and discharge time differences were determined fig 9 the rainfall to soil moisture changes were 10 3 mm d 1 at 10 cm and 13 8 mm d 1 at 20 cm which indicated that a minimum amount of 10 mm d 1 might be the threshold to initiate surface soil 10 cm moisture response fig 9a moreover with the increase in soil depth srt gradually increased whereas different land uses exhibited different srt in the same soil layer fig 9b the response of farmland to rainfall within 20 cm was more rapid than other land uses whereas the response time became longer at 50 cm p 0 05 the change of soil moisture was observed only in the probe at 400 cm of grassland which might be related to the sandier and coarser texture soil in grassland which indicated that overlying grasses were more conducive to rainwater replenishment deep soil water deficiency furthermore the groundwater table variations were not evident after a single and minor rainfall event but had an excellent response to annual cumulative rainfall the recharge and discharge time of rainwater to the groundwater table was quantified as shown in fig 9c the discharge time of all the groundwater wells was longer than the recharge time manifesting a situation of rapid replenishment and slow release the discharge and recharge time of the groundwater wells increased from the ditch head to the ditch tail in both check dams these phenomena also indicated underground horizontal movement of groundwater which could supply the low topographic water depth 3 4 hydrological processes of precipitation vegetation soil water groundwater in check dams a conceptual model that quantified the hydrological processes from rainfall to shallow groundwater was concluded and constructed fig 10 soil moisture was affected by precipitation events 10 mm d 1 and land use differences water movement through the soil layers was dominated by matrix flow soil infiltration rate ranging between 0 82 and 3 47 cm h 1 was different under different land uses and soil depths grassland consumed the least volume of water from the preceding season but could effectively use seasonal rainfall scrubland could utilize part of the deep soil water and shallow groundwater farmland surface soil moisture had the fastest response to precipitation and could quickly reach the root zone utilized by crops moreover accumulated seasonal rainfall could cause recharge evolutions of groundwater depth whereas vegetation water consumption and lateral movement would cause groundwater discharge in check dam a the recharge time was 72 250 days and the discharge time was 66 367 days in check dam b the recharge time was 69 208 days and the discharge time was 193 774 days furthermore with the decrease in rainfall the soil moisture and groundwater depth showed a fluctuating downward trend nonetheless the hydrological changes of check dams are relatively stable and continuous processes which can be adjusted according to the amount of exogenous recharge and discharge the conceptual model might be of reference value to soil water movement under different land uses and would provide positive references to guide vegetation construction in typical rain fed check dams 4 discussion 4 1 land use and precipitation affect soil moisture distributions in check dams the present study verified that land use types affected the horizontal and vertical responses of soil moisture to precipitation in rain fed check dams this effect could be attributed to the differences in vegetation canopy density underground root distribution and soil properties among different land uses fu et al 2003 hu et al 2011 zucco et al 2014 fan et al 2016 sun et al 2018 in farmland topsoil moisture responded quickly to rainfall whereas deep soil moisture changed slowly this discrepancy between the surface and deep distributions was due to artificial cultivation radke and berry 1993 alaoui et al 2011 sun et al 2018 above ground crops do not cover the surface entirely and the tillage layer is relatively loose with higher soil porosity which results in rapid rainwater penetration in long term tillage practices plow pans hinder water infiltration reducing infiltration rates fu et al 2003 kasteel et al 2007 je≈ô√°bek et al 2017 sun et al 2018 in scrubland and grassland surface soil moisture changed slowly after rainfall whereas deep soil moisture exhibited a higher linear variation these changes are due to higher surface coverage blocking rainwater from falling directly to the ground but water moves in the form of a matrix flow once into the homogeneous soil she et al 2014 levia and germer 2015 jin et al 2018 moreover the response of the whole profile to rainfall showed that the infiltration rate in scrubland and grassland was better than that in farmland fig 10 in the semi arid areas of the loess plateau many herbs e g alfalfa and shrubs e g caragana are planted for vegetation restoration fan et al 2016 under water scarcity when seasonal rainfall cannot meet vegetation growth needs they absorb more water by extending the root systems to several to tens of meters wang et al 2015c fan et al 2016 however deep root activity increases soil porosity and preferential flow might exist along the roots ilstedt et al 2007 neris et al 2012 wang et al 2013a sun et al 2018 a previous study also demonstrated that natural grasses presented rapid infiltration rates and the wetting front could reach deeper depths wang et al 2013a furthermore soil moisture in farmland was higher than in grassland and scrubland which was in accordance with the previous studies conducted in the liudaogou watershed showing the order farmland soybean natural grassland stipa bungeana planted grassland alfalfa shrubland caragana wang et al 2010 wang et al 2015b however in the last months topsoil 0 50 cm moisture in farmland decreased and was lower than in grassland and scrubland which indicated natural vegetation had better sustainable water utilization characteristics under decreasing precipitation episodes therefore different vegetation cover types significantly affect the vertical distribution and temporal changes in soil moisture and water infiltration wang et al 2013a wang et al 2015b wang et al 2015c our study also confirmed that the water source of the soil profile and shallow groundwater mainly depended on precipitation in rain fed check dams this finding was consistent with those of previous studies regarding the effects of rainfall on water supplementation in check dams agoramoorthy et al 2008 wang et al 2011 luo et al 2020 moreover the present study showed that only rainfall events that reached an adequate minimum threshold had virtual effects on regional hydrological processes other studies have widely reported the critical role of the rainfall response threshold on soil moisture schwinning and sala 2004 he et al 2012 guti√©rrez jurado et al 2013 wang et al 2013a kl√∏ve et al 2014 yang et al 2014a garc√≠a gamero et al 2021 in this region 10 mm d 1 might be the minimum rainfall threshold to soil moisture response this threshold was relatively conservative but could quantify the effectiveness of rainfall events and provide a reliable reference which was also consistent with similar semi arid regions guti√©rrez jurado et al 2013 jin et al 2018 yang et al 2018 furthermore with the decreasing trend in annual rainfall soil moisture in all land use profiles significantly decreased however all land uses presented a certain degree of drought tolerance with no large scale vegetation death or dry soil layers which differed from previous studies that focused on hillsides and tablelands in the loess plateau wang et al 2017 shao et al 2018 wang et al 2019 owing to the geological differences between the study sites these phenomena are not contradictory check dams are located in gullies and channels with thinner soil layers and shallower groundwater tables whereas hillside and tableland areas have different geographical structures gates et al 2011 li et al 2017 huang et al 2021 therefore soil moisture could be replenished by seasonal rainwater and upward capillary movement of shallow groundwater in check dams wang et al 2013b shao et al 2018 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 nonetheless with the continuous decrease in annual rainfall seasonal rainwater could not meet vegetation growth needs and deep roots e g shrubs began to absorb more water leading to a decrease in deep soil moisture the water conservation advantage of shallow roots e g grasses was gradually highlighted under a rain reduction background therefore grasses with shallow roots might be an ideal vegetation type for ecological restoration in semi arid regions yang et al 2012 wang et al 2013a she et al 2014 huang and shao 2019 bai et al 2020 4 2 rainfall and tectonics dominate shallow groundwater in check dams our study revealed close relationships between rainfall and groundwater evolutions in check dams these reciprocities could be demonstrated by the magnitude of the interannual oscillations of groundwater and changes in the annual cumulative rainfall in fig 8d in contrast cumulative annual rainfall could determine groundwater undulations in check dams previous studies have also reported that runoff decreased or disappeared with the return of farmland to forests and grasslands on the hillslope under reduced precipitation conditions in recent years wang et al 2011 fang et al 2019 dry soil layers on the surrounding slopes hinder the infiltration of precipitation and cannot form a lateral recharge to the check dams shao et al 2018 wang et al 2020 consequently shallow groundwater replenishment pathways are reduced and mainly replenished directly by cumulative annual rainfall precipitation kl√∏ve et al 2014 luo et al 2020 however groundwater fluctuations showed more ecological significance in response to rainfall and vegetation water consumption the rise in the groundwater table originates from seasonal cumulative rainwater recharge whereas the decreases are primarily due to water absorption by vegetation roots and lateral flow numerous studies have reported similar results on the conservation and depletion of groundwater resources in check dams wang et al 2011 yasuda et al 2012 famiglietti 2014 djuma et al 2017 miguez macho and fan 2021 furthermore groundwater fluctuations showed characteristics of rapid replenishment in autumn and winter and slowed release in spring and summer this feature provides a longer time series of available effective water for vegetation growth which is a valuable source for vegetation to cope with drought and seasonal water shortages in semi arid regions luo et al 2020 miguez macho and fan 2021 furthermore the groundwater discharge and recharge time gradually increased from the beginning to end of the ditch which might illustrate the influence of the geologic tectonic structure on the shallow groundwater distributions in check dams check dams are recent anthropogenic constructions in trenches cut into bedrock to reduce erosion piton et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 fang et al 2019 shi et al 2019 the geological profile from top to bottom comprises silted loess weathered bedrock and fresh rock xu et al 2004 galicia et al 2019 yao et al 2022 owing to the water isolation effect of fresh bedrock shallow groundwater is mainly located between layers of soil and weathered bedrock cai and ofterdinger 2016 miguez macho and fan 2021 moreover as the soil thickness increases from the ditch head to the tail in the check dams the groundwater level gradually deepens wu et al 2016 luo et al 2020 cooley et al 2021 therefore for the particular formation processes and structure check dams could conserve more regional water resources regulate the hydrological processes and play an essential role in the expansion of green territory in the semi arid areas of the loess plateau agoramoorthy et al 2008 jin et al 2012 djuma et al 2017 piton et al 2017 4 3 eco hydrological regulation strategies and uncertainties in check dams check dams are widely used for soil and water conservation worldwide boix fayos et al 2008 abbasi et al 2019 wen and zhen 2020 yao et al 2022 it is estimated that 34 000 check dams have been built in the loess plateau in northern shaanxi providing a new land reclamation area of 573 km2 jin et al 2012 wen and zhen 2020 due to its good water conditions agricultural production capacity and ecological construction compensation have increased yearly xu et al 2004 abbasi et al 2019 yao et al 2022 this study has depicted the hydrological processes of precipitation vegetation soil water groundwater which would provide a reference framework for proposing eco hydrological regulation strategies for rain fed check dams therefore it is recommended to reduce the proportion of scrubland increase grassland area incredibly shallow root grasses and appropriate the amount of farmland to meet daily production and life needs vegetation ratios should also be comprehensively determined by considering the local geological structure soil thickness bedrock distribution and precipitation characteristics moreover changes in water resource characteristics should be regularly evaluated based on the relationship between natural rainfall characteristics vegetation covers soil moisture dynamics and groundwater fluctuations for ecological restoration management in addition anthropogenic disturbance to existing grasses or shrubs should be minimized and local vegetation species should be used as much as possible to build a stable naturalized ecosystem in future restoration projects for check dams this study has delineated the entire process from rainfall to groundwater however many scientific issues still exist and require further exploration first the tolerance of various vegetation types to water deficiency must be further clarified fan et al 2016 ge et al 2020 the absorption of a single type of vegetation and water consumption characteristics in check dams remain unclear it is necessary to conduct in depth research using a variety of technical measures such as sap flow zhao and liu 2010 steppe et al 2015 jian et al 2016 and hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic composition separation volkmann et al 2016 tan et al 2017 beyer et al 2020 von freyberg et al 2020 zhao and wang 2021 second the hydrological process changes in check dams caused by irregular rainfall events should be observed for a long time by combining various techniques this study discussed the fluctuation processes of soil moisture changes and shallow groundwater of different land uses caused by rainfall reduction from 2018 to 2021 these results must be validated and supplemented with ten or even twenty years of continuous observation additionally future studies should focus on the role of bedrock groundwater banks et al 2009 mccormick et al 2021 miguez macho and fan 2021 with the background of global warming precipitation in semi arid areas tends to decrease whereas the water in rocks has been proven to provide a certain amount of water support for vegetation growth schwinning 2010 salve et al 2012 rempe and dietrich 2018 nardini et al 2021 check dams have a unique structure in that the bottom is rock and the upper part is silt which might be a potential theoretical site for observing rock moisture 5 conclusion annual precipitation reduction effects on soil moisture dynamics and shallow groundwater evolution of check dams were evaluated in semiarid areas soil water storage showed a fluctuating decreasing trend in all land uses but with the most vital drought tolerance in shrub grass mixture abandoned land moreover a single rainfall event 10 mm d 1 could intuitively affect surface soil moisture whereas deep soil moisture and groundwater fluctuations would be portrayed by annual cumulative precipitation a conceptual model of the hydrological processes of precipitation vegetation soil water and groundwater was then proposed for rain fed check dams rainwater infiltrated the recharge of soil moisture and shallow groundwater mainly through matrix flow soil infiltration rates ranged from 0 82 to 3 47 cm h 1 and the groundwater recharge time was 69 250 days the discharge time of shallow groundwater was 66 774 days predominantly from evapotranspiration and lateral groundwater movement we have recommended increasing the area of shallow root grasses appropriating agricultural activities and reducing deep rooted water intensive shrubs in rain fed check dams this study would provide a theoretical

2285,stable regional water resource distribution is essential for ecosystems yet soil water dynamics and groundwater evolutions of check dams remain many uncertainties under natural rainfall reduction in semi arid areas to explore these changeable hydrologic processes continuous fixed point observation and water balance models were introduced in nearly four consecutive hydrological years 2018 2021 the results showed that soil water storage presented a downward fluctuation in each soil layer of all land uses moreover the grassland profile moisture descended slowly and had deeper infiltration depths than others which might be an ideal land use type for the reservoir s sustainable utilization in check dams the results also indicated that surface soil moisture 50 cm could rapidly respond to a single rainfall event 10 mm d 1 whereas deep soil moisture 50 cm and shallow groundwater fluctuations were mainly affected by annual cumulative precipitation furthermore a conceptual hydrological model of rainwater falling to the ground percolating through soil profiles and reaching groundwater through different vegetation covers in check dams has been proposed soil infiltration rates varied under different land use types and depths ranging from 0 82 to 3 47 cm h 1 the groundwater recharge time from accumulated annual rainfall was 69 250 days whereas the discharge time due to vegetation water consumption and groundwater lateral movement was 66 774 days with a decrease in annual rainfall the recharge time gradually increased whereas the discharge time gradually decreased these results

data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction climate change has caused uneven regional rainfall distribution leading to dry regions getting drier and affecting regional water circulation chou et al 2013 liu et al 2013 in parts of semi arid areas soil water and groundwater could not be effectively replenished by the decreased seasonal rainfall temporarily kl√∏ve et al 2014 grillakis 2019 this insufficient rainfall in turn has led to aftereffects such as tree mortality anderegg et al 2015 wang et al 2019 dried soil layers wang et al 2010 shao et al 2018 and groundwater resource shortage peters et al 2005 allen et al 2010 therefore it is imperative to evaluate the impact of reduced rainfall on the hydrological cycles and sustainable vegetation growth in semi arid areas check dams which are essential for water conservation and vegetation restoration in semi arid areas are natural independent hydrologic units for studying the disturbance caused by precipitation events on soil moisture dynamics and shallow groundwater evolutions zhao et al 2017 abbasi et al 2019 luo et al 2020 yao et al 2022 previous studies have demonstrated the crucial efficiency of check dams for gully restoration fang et al 2019 boix fayos et al 2020 water conservation boix fayos et al 2008 vaezi et al 2017 shi et al 2019 soil development wang et al 2011 yao et al 2022 hydrological regulation piton et al 2017 and food security agoramoorthy et al 2008 wang et al 2011 after nearly 30 years of siltation most artificial check dams were silted with sediments in stable conditions the interception ability of check dams has gradually decreased but ecological responses are becoming increasingly evident wang et al 2017 yao et al 2022 these rain fed check dams have been developed for various land uses such as farmland grassland scrubland and shrub grass mixture abandoned land verstraeten and prosser 2008 jin et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 however only a few studies have investigated the regularity and characteristics of profile water variations under different land uses of check dams nevertheless previous scientific literature on other ecosystems of the semi arid areas of the loess plateau provided ponderable references and they concluded that different land uses led to significant differences in hydrological process distributions huang et al 2013 shao et al 2018 huang and shao 2019 wang et al 2020 in general soil moisture was greater in natural vegetation than in artificial vegetation from the perspective of land uses soil moisture showed a preference for rain fed farmland and grassland followed by shrubland and woodland jia et al 2015 huang and shao 2019 and even under the same land use vegetation species and coverage ratio changes also showed diverse potencies d odorico et al 2007 she et al 2014 moreover owing to the threshold limit of soil water carrying capacity for vegetation in the semi arid areas of the loess plateau unreasonable vegetation types would aggravate vegetation evapotranspiration deplete soil reservoirs and eventually leads to soil desiccation and shallow groundwater recession wang et al 2010 huang et al 2013 jia et al 2015 jia et al 2017 shao et al 2018 therefore further exploration is required to determine whether various land uses affect soil moisture and groundwater in check dams as in other geographic locations on the semi arid areas of the loess plateau in recent years precipitation has shown a decreasing trend in semi arid areas however its impact on soil moisture and groundwater resources remains unclear zhao and wu 2013 wang et al 2015a wang et al 2017 in particular in artificial rain fed check dam ecosystems there are more uncertainties in the regional water cycle wang et al 2013a luo et al 2020 previous studies have demonstrated that the responses of soil moisture and groundwater to rainwater are complicated which could have been affected by rainfall characteristics he et al 2012 yang et al 2014b petrie et al 2015 he et al 2020 surface vegetation distributions wang et al 2013a fan et al 2016 and soil conditions jin et al 2018 yang et al 2018 moreover there are deficiencies in the relationships between the reduction of natural rainfall soil water dynamics under different land uses and shallow groundwater evolutions in rain fed check dams nevertheless in situ monitoring data from soil moisture probes and groundwater depth probes might provide sequential evidence of the whole moving process of rainwater from the vegetation canopy to groundwater under natural rainfall reduction the objectives of the present study therefore were to i clarify soil moisture dynamics under natural rainfall reduction scenarios on farmland grassland scrubland and shrub grass mixture abandoned land in rain fed check dams ii elucidate the impact of rainfall reduction on shallow groundwater recharge and discharge and iii construct a conceptual hydrological balance model from rainfall events to vegetation differences soil moisture changes and groundwater fluctuations in check dams this study provides a reference for land use planning and sustainable utilization of underground reservoirs under climate change in future ecological restoration projects to check dams in semi arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions this study was conducted in shaanxi

loess hilly and gully region fig 1 a the climate of the watershed is dry with little rain in winter and spring while rainy in summer and autumn the annual average precipitation is 452 8 mm 2003 2021 accounting for about 75 from june to september moreover most rainfall occurs in the form of heavy rain the annual average temperature is 8 4 the annual total solar radiation is 5922 mj m 2 the annual average potential evapotranspiration is about 1192 mm and the average aridity index the ratio of annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation is 1 8 fan 2019 the main soil textures are sandy loess and aeolian sandy soil the vegetation types are mainly shrubs and grasses including medicago sativa lespedeza davurica astragalus adsurgens pall stipa bungeana artem isiaordosica incarvillea sinensis lam artemisia gmelinii caragana korshinskii salix psammophila prunusarmeniaca populus simonii fig 1a ge et al 2020 due to its unique geographic location coarse texture and relatively thinner soil layers farmland grassland scrubland and shrub grass mixture abandoned land are the most popular land uses in the artificial rain fed check dams of the semi arid areas of the loess plateau our experiment was carried out on these land uses in two of the largest check dams of liudaogou catchment these two check dams have been built for a long time with stable loess deposition and displayed different land uses which were places of regional representation and demonstration soil physical properties and vegetation types are shown in fig 1 and table 1 in check dam a farmland grassland and scrubland are distributed successively fig 1b farmland accounts for 20 with an average topsoil bulk density of 1 47 g cm 3 rotated annually with corn and potatoes grassland accounts for 36 with an average topsoil bulk density of 1 49 g cm 3 which main species are alfalfa miscanthus and dogstail scrubland accounts for 44 with an average topsoil bulk density of 1 51 g cm 3 of which the main species are caragana and artemisia in check dam b shrub grass mixture abandoned land makes up around 90 area with an average topsoil bulk density of 1 49 g cm 3 fig 1c although the sediment size distribution geographical location and vegetation covering under the two check dams were different the hydrological processes affected by rainfall were also comparable due to the same meteorological conditions 2 2 measurements of volumetric soil water dynamics soil volumetric water content vwc was determined using automated soil moisture probes the vwc in check dam a was measured using a cr200 series datalogger campbell sci inc logan ut usa connected to tdr 315h probes acclima inc meridian idaho usa the tdr 315h probes were installed at 10 20 50 100 200 and 400 cm on farmland label tdr3 as

fig 1b these probes became functional on june 15 2018 and were measured hourly the vwc in check dam b was measured using an em50 datalogger meter group inc pullman wa usa connected to ec 5 soil probes decagon devices pullman wa usa the ec 5 soil probes were set at 20 50 100 200 and 400 cm on the shrub grass mixture abandoned land in check dam b fig 1c ec 5 1 was installed at the ditch head of check dam b tagged as sg1 where the ratio of grasses to shrubs was 4 6 ec 5 2 was installed in the middle of check dam b labeled sg2 where the ratio of grasses to shrubs was 7 3 the measurements were logged at half hourly intervals from july 2018 to october 2021 according to data measured by the probes at one soil layer through observation soil water storage sws is determined as follows 1 sws lp vwc lpi 100 where l refers to s g f sg1 and sg2 respectively p is the time of data acquisition from june 2018 to october 2021 i is one of the 10 cm depth intervals from 0 to 10 cm 10 20 cm 390 400 cm respectively vwc lpi is the average moisture of i depth at p time under land use l vwc at each point is obtained by linear interpolation between the two adjacent probes then the vwc lpi is multiplied by the thickness of 10 cm to obtain the sws at the special 10 cm thickness finally swslp is the superposition of each 10 cm soil layer s water storage moreover a uniform baseline facilitated a comprehensive understanding and comparison of the entire soil profile moisture spm under different land uses the effective saturation ratio represents spm garc√≠a gamero et al 2021 equation 2 2 spm Œ∏

and maximum measured vwc through the soil profile in one land use respectively i j represent two different land uses in s g f sg1 and sg2 respectively Œ¥spm200 and Œ¥spm400 are the differences between different land uses in the 200 and 400 cm profiles respectively considering the geological structure there were no soil moisture data at 400 cm in the scrubland and a 200 cm profile was used to compare water differences in all land uses additionally water differences at the 400 cm profile were analyzed except for the scrubland to reflect the effect of deep root activities on spm furthermore soil moisture changes in response time to precipitation srt were calculated as a 10 increase in vwc detty and mcguire 2010 fig 2 a the 10 increase values were chosen to exclude the soil moisture sensor error and reflect the effects of each rainfall event which can be observed during data processing soil infiltration rates ir were then defined as the soil thickness divided by the response time to rainwater it is defined as follows 5 srt a d b d a srt b d c d b 6 ir ba sd b sd a srt b srt a where srta and srtb are the response times to precipitation through the soil thicknesses of sda and sdb respectively da represents the occurrence time of rainfall events db is the start time when soil moisture increases by 10 at the observation point and dc is when soil moisture increases by 10 at the immediate next observation point 2 3 monitoring of groundwater depth evolutions shallow groundwater evolution was performed using hobo u20 001 04 probes onset bourne ma usa every hour every day fig 1b 1c four probes ag80 ag300 ag340 and ag510 were arranged from the trench head to the end of the ditch in check dam a between october 25 2016 and july 5 2017 three probes bg50 bg150 and bg280 were installed in check dam b on october 25 2016 ag refers to the groundwater well in check dam a ag80 was situated in the middle of the scrubland ag300 was located in grassland near the scrubland ag340 was located in the middle of the grassland ag510 was arranged in the middle of the farmland bg refers to the groundwater well in check dam b which was arranged in shrub grass mixture abandoned land moreover the numbers following ag and bg were defined as the distance from the groundwater well to the trench head in this study the same test period data 2018 2021 as the soil moisture were monitored there were apparent differences in the peaks and valleys in the groundwater hydrographs we assumed that the time difference from when groundwater begins to rise to the next trough which indicates the time of the impact of precipitation in an independent hydrological year was taken as the groundwater discharge time dt fig 2b similarly the time rainwater infiltrates through the soil to groundwater from first reaching the trough floor to the starting point of a significant rise was defined as the groundwater recharge time rt fig 2b the formula is expressed as follows 7 dt d n d m 8 rt d k d n where d m indicates the date when the water depth first reached the bottom of the hydrograph of the groundwater fluctuation d n is the date at which the water depth began to increase d k represents the date when the water depth reaches the valley floor through the crest of wave the average discharge time of rainwater to groundwater adt was calculated using the arithmetic mean of multiple discharge times the average recharge time of rainwater to groundwater art was obtained using the arithmetic mean of multiple recharge times 2 4 precipitation characteristics during the observation period 2018 2021 an automatic tipping bucket rain gauge 1 km was installed between check dams a and b these precipitation data effectively represent rainfall events for both check dams the precipitation characteristics during the four observational hydrological years are presented in fig 3 which shows a decreasing trend year by year the year 2018 was a humid year with total precipitation of 676 9 mm the year 2019 was a normal year with precipitation of 423 9 mm 2020 and 2021 were classified as dry years with rainfall of 350 1 mm and 327 mm respectively fig 3a in this study daily rainfall was used to indicate rainfall intensity where 72 4 was in 10 mm d 1 20 2 was 10 25 mm d 1 and 7 was 25 mm d 1 fig 3a table 2 moreover 85 of the annual rainfall occurs between may and october fig 3b therefore the annual decrease in rainfall provided suitable natural conditions for our research which is conducive to fully understanding the response of soil moisture to rainfall reduction in different land uses and the ecological implications of groundwater fluctuations in check dams 2 5 statistical analysis differences in soil profile moisture spm between different land uses were analyzed using the wilcoxon signed rank test with a significance level of Œ± 0 05 garc√≠a gamero et al 2021 the coefficient of variation cv was used to describe the degree of dispersion of groundwater fluctuations the relationships between rainfall events soil moisture variations in different land uses and groundwater fluctuations were characterized using linear regression analysis p 0 05 calculations and graphs were generated using originpro 2021 originlab northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 soil moisture dynamics under different land uses 3 1 1 soil profile moisture differences soil profile moisture spm differences through the 200 cm profiles are shown in fig 4 the impacts of anthropogenic farming activities and land use under natural succession on the soil profile water varied significantly spm of f was significantly higher than g at 55 9 of months fig 4a while lower than s sg1 and sg2 at 68 4 54 3 and 50 2 of months respectively fig 4b 4c 4d spm of g was higher than sg1 at 51 1 of months fig 4f while worse than s and sg2 by 68 6 and 52 8 of months respectively fig 4e 4g spm of sg1 was lower than sg2 by 57 1 of months fig 4h spm of s was better than sg1 and sg2 by 63 2 and 68 0 of months respectively fig 4m 4n months of spm dominated by farmland were primarily concentrated in 2018 and 2019 during which rainfall was relatively abundant however a higher soil moisture of grassland scrubland and shrub grass mixture abandoned land was presented with annual rainfall decreased in 2020 and 2021 therefore with decreasing annual rainfall the soil profile moisture was greater under natural land uses than under farmland to further understand the water information between different land uses in the deeper profile and the effect of deep root distribution on soil water we analyzed the moisture differences in the 400 cm depth profile fig 5 there were significant differences between f and sg1 and the spm months of f were greater than those of sg1 fig 5a spm of f was significantly higher than that of sg2 throughout the monitoring period fig 5b months of spm in f were greater than those in g fig 5c the higher spm months of g were greater than those of sg1 and sg2 fig 5d 5e spm of sg1 was significantly lower than sg2 at 77 09 of the months fig 5f interestingly after increasing the moisture change to 400 cm the overall level of moisture performance in farmland was better than that in scrubland and grassland these results differed from the 200 cm profiles which might be related to the deep root water consumption of shrubs e g caragana or grasses e g alfalfa and water replenishment in previous wet years 2016 2018 nevertheless the deep profile moisture of the grassland gradually showed a higher content under the scenario of reduced annual precipitation 3 1 2 soil water storage changes with a decrease in annual rainfall from 2018 to 2021 sws significantly decreased under different land uses fig 6 in topsoil 0 20 cm the sws of s g f sg1 and sg2 decreased by 15 0 33 5 56 8 25 0 and 70 3 respectively at the depths from 0 cm to 50 cm sws of s g f sg1 and sg2 decreased by 16 3 32 4 49 9 29 8 and 54 8 respectively from 0 cm to 100 cm sws of s g f sg1 and sg2 decreased by 17 3 29 7 46 6 38 7 and 46 1 respectively from 0 cm to 200 cm sws of s g f sg1 and sg2 decreased by 18 8 29 4 43 6 36 6 and 40 5 respectively from 0 cm to 400 cm sws of g f sg1 and sg2 decreased by 26 0 7 1 38 1 and 28 5 respectively owing to the accumulated annual rainfall the sws in the deep profile was gradually replenished in autumn and winter however the seasonal replenishment of rainwater did not meet vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation in the following year consequently sws showed a downward trend as precipitation decreased year by year 3 2 characteristics of shallow groundwater evolutions the shallow groundwater table depth wtd evolutions in check dams a and b are shown in fig 7 shallow groundwater depth showed a decreasing trend with the decrease in annual precipitation and rainwater could not fully replenish to groundwater discharge there were four groundwater depth observation wells in check dam a the wtd of ag80 was from 1 95 m to 3 64 m with an average of 3 11 m of which the cv was 0 11 the wtd of ag300 was from 7 44 m to 8 19 m with an average of 8 00 m and the cv was 0 03 the wtd average of ag340 was 7 10 m with a cv of 0 10 ranging from 6 32 m to 8 45 m the wtd of ag510 was from 4 81 m to 6 94 m with an average of 6 30 m and the cv was 0 07 the four groundwater depth wells had similar decreasing volatility characteristics in check dam a which consistently responded to annual precipitation these wells rapidly responded to rainfall in 2018 reaching peak levels in the middle of the year july and gradually declining until july of the following year the annual precipitation in 2019 decreased by 253 0 mm compared to 2020 the wtd was gradually replenished after lagging in october 2019 however the thickness of the supplementary water table was lower than that in the previous year consequently the thickness of the supplementary water was stable until june of the following year furthermore the annual precipitation in 2020 continued to decrease 73 9 mm less than in 2019 the wtd at each water well lagged after november and the amount of water supplied was less than that in 2019 the amount of replenished water gradually declined in july of the following year check dam b was equipped with three wells to record wtd changes the wtd of bg50 was from 3 58 m to 4 33 m with an average of 4 12 m and the cv was 0 05 the wtd of bg150 was from 3 56 m to 4 55 m with an average of 4 20 m of which the cv was 0 07 the average wtd of bg280 was 4 02 m with a cv of 0 10 ranging from 2 96 m to 4 44 m the three wells in check dam b rapidly responded to rainfall events in 2018 with significant fluctuations whereas the response to rainfall in other years was not noticeable therefore due to decreasing yearly rainfall but relatively stable potential evapotranspiration etp rainwater could not effectively replenish the groundwater and the underground water tables gradually dropped 3 3 relations between precipitation soil moisture variation and groundwater table fluctuation soil moisture variations and groundwater table fluctuations correspond to rainfall events fig 8 the results showed that rainfall significantly affected the surface 50 cm of soil moisture whereas a lagging effect was observed on deep soil water and groundwater fluctuations specifically soil moisture changes at 10 cm could be captured after rainfall events 10 mm d 1 fig 8a moreover soil moisture fluctuations were less correlated with rainfall events at 20 cm than at 10 cm but remained significant fig 8b additionally soil moisture variations also showed a significant correlation with rainfall events at 50 cm but the relationship weakened compared to those at 10 cm and 20 cm fig 8c groundwater table fluctuations were not sensitive to single and small rainfall events but were significantly affected by annual cumulative rainfall furthermore with reduced rainfall every year less rainwater was available to recharge shallow groundwater and the groundwater table lowered considerably fig 8d based on the fluctuation of soil moisture after rainfall events the minimum rainfall threshold to soil moisture response the response time to rainwater at the specific soil layers srt and shallow groundwater recharge and discharge time differences were determined fig 9 the rainfall to soil moisture changes were 10 3 mm d 1 at 10 cm and 13 8 mm d 1 at 20 cm which indicated that a minimum amount of 10 mm d 1 might be the threshold to initiate surface soil 10 cm moisture response fig 9a moreover with the increase in soil depth srt gradually increased whereas different land uses exhibited different srt in the same soil layer fig 9b the response of farmland to rainfall within 20 cm was more rapid than other land uses whereas the response time became longer at 50 cm p 0 05 the change of soil moisture was observed only in the probe at 400 cm of grassland which might be related to the sandier and coarser texture soil in grassland which indicated that overlying grasses were more conducive to rainwater replenishment deep soil water deficiency furthermore the groundwater table variations were not evident after a single and minor rainfall event but had an excellent response to annual cumulative rainfall the recharge and discharge time of rainwater to the groundwater table was quantified as shown in fig 9c the discharge time of all the groundwater wells was longer than the recharge time manifesting a situation of rapid replenishment and slow release the discharge and recharge time of the groundwater wells increased from the ditch head to the ditch tail in both check dams these phenomena also indicated underground horizontal movement of groundwater which could supply the low topographic water depth 3 4 hydrological processes of precipitation vegetation soil water groundwater in check dams a conceptual model that quantified the hydrological processes from rainfall to shallow groundwater was concluded and constructed fig 10 soil moisture was affected by precipitation events 10 mm d 1 and land use differences water movement through the soil layers was dominated by matrix flow soil infiltration rate ranging between 0 82 and 3 47 cm h 1 was different under different land uses and soil depths grassland consumed the least volume of water from the preceding season but could effectively use seasonal rainfall scrubland could utilize part of the deep soil water and shallow groundwater farmland surface soil moisture had the fastest response to precipitation and could quickly reach the root zone utilized by crops moreover accumulated seasonal rainfall could cause recharge evolutions of groundwater depth whereas vegetation water consumption and lateral movement would cause groundwater discharge in check dam a the recharge time was 72 250 days and the discharge time was 66 367 days in check dam b the recharge time was 69 208 days and the discharge time was 193 774 days furthermore with the decrease in rainfall the soil moisture and groundwater depth showed a fluctuating downward trend nonetheless the hydrological changes of check dams are relatively stable and continuous processes which can be adjusted according to the amount of exogenous recharge and discharge the conceptual model might be of reference value to soil water movement under different land uses and would provide positive references to guide vegetation construction in typical rain fed check dams 4 discussion 4 1 land use and precipitation affect soil moisture distributions in check dams the present study verified that land use types affected the horizontal and vertical responses of soil moisture to precipitation in rain fed check dams this effect could be attributed to the differences in vegetation canopy density underground root distribution and soil properties among different land uses fu et al 2003 hu et al 2011 zucco et al 2014 fan et al 2016 sun et al 2018 in farmland topsoil moisture responded quickly to rainfall whereas deep soil moisture changed slowly this discrepancy between the surface and deep distributions was due to artificial cultivation radke and berry 1993 alaoui et al 2011 sun et al 2018 above ground crops do not cover the surface entirely and the tillage layer is relatively loose with higher soil porosity which results in rapid rainwater penetration in long term tillage practices plow pans hinder water infiltration reducing infiltration rates fu et al 2003 kasteel et al 2007 je≈ô√°bek et al 2017 sun et al 2018 in scrubland and grassland surface soil moisture changed slowly after rainfall whereas deep soil moisture exhibited a higher linear variation these changes are due to higher surface coverage blocking rainwater from falling directly to the ground but water moves in the form of a matrix flow once into the homogeneous soil she et al 2014 levia and germer 2015 jin et al 2018 moreover the response of the whole profile to rainfall showed that the infiltration rate in scrubland and grassland was better than that in farmland fig 10 in the semi arid areas of the loess plateau many herbs e g alfalfa and shrubs e g caragana are planted for vegetation restoration fan et al 2016 under water scarcity when seasonal rainfall cannot meet vegetation growth needs they absorb more water by extending the root systems to several to tens of meters wang et al 2015c fan et al 2016 however deep root activity increases soil porosity and preferential flow might exist along the roots ilstedt et al 2007 neris et al 2012 wang et al 2013a sun et al 2018 a previous study also demonstrated that natural grasses presented rapid infiltration rates and the wetting front could reach deeper depths wang et al 2013a furthermore soil moisture in farmland was higher than in grassland and scrubland which was in accordance with the previous studies conducted in the liudaogou watershed showing the order farmland soybean natural grassland stipa bungeana planted grassland alfalfa shrubland caragana wang et al 2010 wang et al 2015b however in the last months topsoil 0 50 cm moisture in farmland decreased and was lower than in grassland and scrubland which indicated natural vegetation had better sustainable water utilization characteristics under decreasing precipitation episodes therefore different vegetation cover types significantly affect the vertical distribution and temporal changes in soil moisture and water infiltration wang et al 2013a wang et al 2015b wang et al 2015c our study also confirmed that the water source of the soil profile and shallow groundwater mainly depended on precipitation in rain fed check dams this finding was consistent with those of previous studies regarding the effects of rainfall on water supplementation in check dams agoramoorthy et al 2008 wang et al 2011 luo et al 2020 moreover the present study showed that only rainfall events that reached an adequate minimum threshold had virtual effects on regional hydrological processes other studies have widely reported the critical role of the rainfall response threshold on soil moisture schwinning and sala 2004 he et al 2012 guti√©rrez jurado et al 2013 wang et al 2013a kl√∏ve et al 2014 yang et al 2014a garc√≠a gamero et al 2021 in this region 10 mm d 1 might be the minimum rainfall threshold to soil moisture response this threshold was relatively conservative but could quantify the effectiveness of rainfall events and provide a reliable reference which was also consistent with similar semi arid regions guti√©rrez jurado et al 2013 jin et al 2018 yang et al 2018 furthermore with the decreasing trend in annual rainfall soil moisture in all land use profiles significantly decreased however all land uses presented a certain degree of drought tolerance with no large scale vegetation death or dry soil layers which differed from previous studies that focused on hillsides and tablelands in the loess plateau wang et al 2017 shao et al 2018 wang et al 2019 owing to the geological differences between the study sites these phenomena are not contradictory check dams are located in gullies and channels with thinner soil layers and shallower groundwater tables whereas hillside and tableland areas have different geographical structures gates et al 2011 li et al 2017 huang et al 2021 therefore soil moisture could be replenished by seasonal rainwater and upward capillary movement of shallow groundwater in check dams wang et al 2013b shao et al 2018 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 nonetheless with the continuous decrease in annual rainfall seasonal rainwater could not meet vegetation growth needs and deep roots e g shrubs began to absorb more water leading to a decrease in deep soil moisture the water conservation advantage of shallow roots e g grasses was gradually highlighted under a rain reduction background therefore grasses with shallow roots might be an ideal vegetation type for ecological restoration in semi arid regions yang et al 2012 wang et al 2013a she et al 2014 huang and shao 2019 bai et al 2020 4 2 rainfall and tectonics dominate shallow groundwater in check dams our study revealed close relationships between rainfall and groundwater evolutions in check dams these reciprocities could be demonstrated by the magnitude of the interannual oscillations of groundwater and changes in the annual cumulative rainfall in fig 8d in contrast cumulative annual rainfall could determine groundwater undulations in check dams previous studies have also reported that runoff decreased or disappeared with the return of farmland to forests and grasslands on the hillslope under reduced precipitation conditions in recent years wang et al 2011 fang et al 2019 dry soil layers on the surrounding slopes hinder the infiltration of precipitation and cannot form a lateral recharge to the check dams shao et al 2018 wang et al 2020 consequently shallow groundwater replenishment pathways are reduced and mainly replenished directly by cumulative annual rainfall precipitation kl√∏ve et al 2014 luo et al 2020 however groundwater fluctuations showed more ecological significance in response to rainfall and vegetation water consumption the rise in the groundwater table originates from seasonal cumulative rainwater recharge whereas the decreases are primarily due to water absorption by vegetation roots and lateral flow numerous studies have reported similar results on the conservation and depletion of groundwater resources in check dams wang et al 2011 yasuda et al 2012 famiglietti 2014 djuma et al 2017 miguez macho and fan 2021 furthermore groundwater fluctuations showed characteristics of rapid replenishment in autumn and winter and slowed release in spring and summer this feature provides a longer time series of available effective water for vegetation growth which is a valuable source for vegetation to cope with drought and seasonal water shortages in semi arid regions luo et al 2020 miguez macho and fan 2021 furthermore the groundwater discharge and recharge time gradually increased from the beginning to end of the ditch which might illustrate the influence of the geologic tectonic structure on the shallow groundwater distributions in check dams check dams are recent anthropogenic constructions in trenches cut into bedrock to reduce erosion piton et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 fang et al 2019 shi et al 2019 the geological profile from top to bottom comprises silted loess weathered bedrock and fresh rock xu et al 2004 galicia et al 2019 yao et al 2022 owing to the water isolation effect of fresh bedrock shallow groundwater is mainly located between layers of soil and weathered bedrock cai and ofterdinger 2016 miguez macho and fan 2021 moreover as the soil thickness increases from the ditch head to the tail in the check dams the groundwater level gradually deepens wu et al 2016 luo et al 2020 cooley et al 2021 therefore for the particular formation processes and structure check dams could conserve more regional water resources regulate the hydrological processes and play an essential role in the expansion of green territory in the semi arid areas of the loess plateau agoramoorthy et al 2008 jin et al 2012 djuma et al 2017 piton et al 2017 4 3 eco hydrological regulation strategies and uncertainties in check dams check dams are widely used for soil and water conservation worldwide boix fayos et al 2008 abbasi et al 2019 wen and zhen 2020 yao et al 2022 it is estimated that 34 000 check dams have been built in the loess plateau in northern shaanxi providing a new land reclamation area of 573 km2 jin et al 2012 wen and zhen 2020 due to its good water conditions agricultural production capacity and ecological construction compensation have increased yearly xu et al 2004 abbasi et al 2019 yao et al 2022 this study has depicted the hydrological processes of precipitation vegetation soil water groundwater which would provide a reference framework for proposing eco hydrological regulation strategies for rain fed check dams therefore it is recommended to reduce the proportion of scrubland increase grassland area incredibly shallow root grasses and appropriate the amount of farmland to meet daily production and life needs vegetation ratios should also be comprehensively determined by considering the local geological structure soil thickness bedrock distribution and precipitation characteristics moreover changes in water resource characteristics should be regularly evaluated based on the relationship between natural rainfall characteristics vegetation covers soil moisture dynamics and groundwater fluctuations for ecological restoration management in addition anthropogenic disturbance to existing grasses or shrubs should be minimized and local vegetation species should be used as much as possible to build a stable naturalized ecosystem in future restoration projects for check dams this study has delineated the entire process from rainfall to groundwater however many scientific issues still exist and require further exploration first the tolerance of various vegetation types to water deficiency must be further clarified fan et al 2016 ge et al 2020 the absorption of a single type of vegetation and water consumption characteristics in check dams remain unclear it is necessary to conduct in depth research using a variety of technical measures such as sap flow zhao and liu 2010 steppe et al 2015 jian et al 2016 and hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic composition separation volkmann et al 2016 tan et al 2017 beyer et al 2020 von freyberg et al 2020 zhao and wang 2021 second the hydrological process changes in check dams caused by irregular rainfall events should be observed for a long time by combining various techniques this study discussed the fluctuation processes of soil moisture changes and shallow groundwater of different land uses caused by rainfall reduction from 2018 to 2021 these results must be validated and supplemented with ten or even twenty years of continuous observation additionally future studies should focus on the role of bedrock groundwater banks et al 2009 mccormick et al 2021 miguez macho and fan 2021 with the background of global warming precipitation in semi arid areas tends to decrease whereas the water in rocks has been proven to provide a certain amount of water support for vegetation growth schwinning 2010 salve et al 2012 rempe and dietrich 2018 nardini et al 2021 check dams have a unique structure in that the bottom is rock and the upper part is silt which might be a potential theoretical site for observing rock moisture 5 conclusion annual precipitation reduction effects on soil moisture dynamics and shallow groundwater evolution of check dams were evaluated in semiarid areas soil water storage showed a fluctuating decreasing trend in all land uses but with the most vital drought tolerance in shrub grass mixture abandoned land moreover a single rainfall event 10 mm d 1 could intuitively affect surface soil moisture whereas deep soil moisture and groundwater fluctuations would be portrayed by annual cumulative precipitation a conceptual model of the hydrological processes of precipitation vegetation soil water and groundwater was then proposed for rain fed check dams rainwater infiltrated the recharge of soil moisture and shallow groundwater mainly through matrix flow soil infiltration rates ranged from 0 82 to 3 47 cm h 1 and the groundwater recharge time was 69 250 days the discharge time of shallow groundwater was 66 774 days predominantly from evapotranspiration and lateral groundwater movement we have recommended increasing the area of shallow root grasses appropriating agricultural activities and reducing deep rooted water intensive shrubs in rain fed check dams this study would provide a theoretical

2286,the choice of proper input data and suitable calibration schemes is challenging in the hydrological modeling of higher latitude watersheds with their unique hydro climatic conditions based on the soil and water assessment tool swat and sequential uncertainty fitting program sufi2 of the swatcup tool our study revisits various climate data and calibration schemes and develops a more automatic calibration framework to thoroughly assess model performance in simulating snow water equivalent swe and resulting streamflow in a cold region watershed the peace river basin prb in western canada we evaluated the effects of 1 the observed and two widely used gridded climate data sources 2 unrealistic snow parameter combinations arising from sufi2 swatcup parameter sampling and 3 calibration schemes including the choice of i objective function ii number of simulations in each calibration iterations iii regional versus global parameterization and calibration schemes and iv single variable streamflow versus multi variable calibration streamflow and swe model results showed that the gridded era5 data was the best climate input for driving the swat model in prb a modified sufi2 swatcup method to automatically remove unrealistic snow parameter combinations outperformed the standard sufi2 swatcup and it significantly reduced the total number of simulations compared with single variable calibration using streamflow an automatic multi variable calibration using streamflow and swe was shown to effectively limit the uncertainty of snow related parameters and provide better prediction of snow affected spring streamflow the framework developed in our study can help reduce uncertainties in the hydrological modeling of large scale regulated and snow dominated watersheds in higher latitudes and can help the development of reliable strategies for water resources planning and management keywords swat calibration scheme gridded climate data multi variable calibration snow water equivalent peace river basin data availability we have published the code on github and a link is provided in the manuscript 1 introduction distributed and or semi distributed hydrological models are crucial in water resources planning and management and have been widely used in investigating the effects of climate and land use change on water quantity and quality faramarzi et al 2017 gizaw et al 2017 loiselle et al 2020 scheepers et al 2018 yan et al 2013 the reliability and robustness of hydrological models generally depend on accurate model representations appropriate input data and proper model calibration abbaspour et al 2017 beven 2000 faramarzi et al 2015 an accurate model setup is the prerequisite of a successful hydrological model calibration might be of little help if pre calibrated model performance is very poor abbaspour et al 2017 various types of input data e g climate soil and land use could bring in different sources of uncertainties in model results and each type often has more than one data source for a region climate data is crucial for hydrological modelling however it is often difficult to collect high quality observed climate data for large scale regions especially in mountains zaremehrjardy et al 2021 in addition to meteorological data there are numerous gridded climate data products available such as climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr dile and srinivasan 2014 saha et al 2014 and era5 hersbach et al 2020 cfsr is a global reanalysis climate product from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national center for environmental prediction ncep and has been widely used in data scare regions for hydrological model inputs faramarzi et al 2015 jaberzadeh et al 2022 roth and lemann 2016 the era5 recently released by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf hersbach et al 2020 is also a global reanalysis data its performance in hydrological models has drawn much attention globally champagne et al 2021 tarek et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 for example tarek et al 2020 evaluated the performance of the era5 precipitation and temperature data in driving two lumped hydrological models over a large set of watersheds in north america xiang et al 2021 assessed the eight global precipitation datasets including era5 based on a conceptual lumped hydrological model over many catchments in china europe and north america xu et al 2022 evaluated the era5 precipitation in driving a distributed hydrological model mesh over the great lakes basin however the performance of era5 data still needs to be further examined in other popular distributed and or semi distributed hydrological models and more representative cold region watersheds hydrological models can be unreliable if not correctly calibrated model calibration involves several considerations including calibration algorithm parameters to be calibrated and their range calibrating all the parameters together or separately choice of the objective function number of simulations number of objective variables to calibrate the model and sequential calibration of a river basin from upstream to downstream versus calibrating the watershed as a whole arsenault et al 2014 kouchi et al 2017 muleta 2012 yang et al 2008 while most studies reported that different choices could lead to different calibration results the choice of proper input data realistic parameter combination and suitable calibration scheme has remained challenging in hydrological modeling of higher latitude watersheds with their unique hydro climatic conditions despite a wide range of studies on model calibration and uncertainties applying a particular approach or data is often extemporary in process representation particularly in cold watersheds moreover less attention has been paid to the effects of the number of simulations through iterations of the calibration processes the inherent model equifinality issue i e multiple parameter sets provide equally good model performance beven 2006 beven and binley 2014 introduces uncertainty that can deteriorate the reliability of hydrological models in forecasting future water resources ficklin and barnhart 2014 her and seong 2018 this issue can be more critical in cold regions where hydrological cycle is governed by snow processes zaremehrjardy et al 2021 multi site abbaspour et al 2007 nkiaka et al 2018 schuol et al 2008 and multi variable calibration hanzer et al 2016 rajib et al 2016 tuo et al 2018a schemes have been reported as useful means in limiting model equifinality although multiple variables e g soil moisture evapotranspiration and water quality have been used in multi variable calibration cao et al 2006 molina navarro et al 2017 puertes et al 2019 rajib et al 2016 rientjes et al 2013 snow data is seldom utilized in the simulation of cold watersheds snowfall is a vital source of streamflow in cold regions and thus multi variable calibration that considers both streamflow and snow measurements can be beneficial in improving the snow processes of hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat tuo et al 2018b therefore a thorough assessment on the various uncertainties associated with data and calibration schemes for distributed semi distributed hydrological modeling of cold region watersheds is in great need the swat model arnold et al 1998 a semi distributed hydrological model and public domain software has been widely used in various regions from small catchments to continental scale to simulate the streamflow and water quality abbaspour et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2015 ficklin et al 2012 musau et al 2015 neupane et al 2018 tuo et al 2016 the model delineates a basin into many subbasins which are further divided into hydrologic response units hrus each consisting of unique soil land cover and slope combinations swatcup is a program for the calibrations of swat models which provides multiple algorithms such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue markov chain monte carlo mcmc sequential uncertainty fitting program sufi2 and particle swarm optimization pso for performing sensitivity analysis calibration and validation abbaspour 2015 the sufi2 of swatcup is one of the widely used techniques in calibrating the swat model grusson et al 2015 ha et al 2017 yang et al 2008 multi variable calibration considering both streamflow and snow using swat model are minimal tuo et al 2018b especially in large scale watersheds in mid to high latitude regions the snow mass balance simulations in the swat model are sensitive to the snow parameters smfmx and smfmn which are the maximum and minimum snowmelt rates however the standard sufi2 swatcup approach does not systematically assess nor control the relationship between various snow parameters for example if smfmx is greater than smfmn consequently the parameter set generated by swatcup can contain parameter combinations where smfmx is less than smfmn which does not make physical sense for watersheds in the northern hemisphere several recent studies have used snow data as an constraint in addition to streamflow when calibrating the swat model liu et al 2020 used streamflow and snow water equivalent swe to improve the swe prediction reliability of the swat model for upland watersheds in usa but they did not control or exclude the unrealistic snow parameter combinations of smfmx and smfmn other studies peker and sorman 2021 tuo et al 2018a tuo et al 2018b manually adjusted snow parameters to avoid such unrealistic parameter combinations during calibrating swe but they all manually conducted swe calibration before or after completing an automatic streamflow calibration this laborious effort may reduce the reliability of the final calibrated model therefore developing an automatic calibration scheme to reject unrealistic parameter combinations related to snow simulation and simultaneously calibrate streamflow and swe in a multi variable calibration framework is necessary tuo et al 2018b the main objective of this study is to revisit the commonly used climate data and calibration approaches and develop a more automatic calibration framework to improve the snow affected streamflow simulation and advance the application of the swat model in cold region watersheds our specific objectives include 1 evaluate observed and gridded e g era5 climate data to find the optimal weather input as the first necessary step to drive the semi distributed hydrological model swat model before calibration 2 modify swat and or swatcup for automatic elimination of unrealistic snow parameter combinations resulted from sufi2 swatcup parameter sampling and for multi variable calibration of streamflow and swe 3 investigate the uncertainties of various model calibration schemes to answer the following questions a what s the proper number of simulations in each iteration b sequential calibration from upstream to downstream or calibrating a river basin as a whole and c calibrating snow parameters first and then all other hydrological parameters or calibrating all the parameters together 4 improve the simulation of snow affected spring streamflow using multi variable calibration streamflow and swe we focused our modeling efforts on the peace river basin prb in western canada the prb is characterized by heterogeneous soil land use and geospatial conditions and represents cold region hydrology e g pomeroy et al 2007 the basin has also been regulated by several large dams in the upstream therefore the prb is a suitable study area for assessing our research objectives and a watershed worth to be explored 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the peace river basin prb is in western canada and its area is about 306 000 km2 it begins from the rocky mountains in east central british columbia and extends towards the northeast side of alberta the modelled area in this study is around 277 286 km2 fig 1 the altitude varies from 3 286 m in the west to about 200 m on the east side of the prb the river basin is mainly covered by forests over 60 and the majority are evergreen needle leaf and deciduous forests based on the historical climate data from environment and climate change canada eccc for the 2004 2013 period the air temperature ranged from around 50 c in winter to about 30 c in summer and the average annual temperature in the basin was from 1 8 to 3 9 c the range of average annual total precipitation was between 386 mm and 1278 mm across the study area the low temperature in the prb generally lasts from october to april during which snowfall dominates the river basin the watershed typically experiences peak flows during spring due to snowpack melting toth et al 2006 the prb has been regulated by the w a c bennett dam at the williston lake reservoir in the upstream tributaries since 1968 williston reservoir covers approximately 1773 km2 at full pool and has active storage of 39 471 million m3 the peace canyon dam was constructed in 1980 forming the 23 km long dinosaur reservoir just behind w a c bennett dam the dinosaur reservoir covers approximately 9 km2 at full pool and has limited active storage of 24 69 million m3 the site c dam the third dam and hydroelectric generating station located downstream of the two existing dams was approved in december 2014 and construction is expected to be completed in 2025 https www sitecproject com about site c project overview 2 2 swat model the swat2012 model version 670 is a daily continuous time semi distributed and watershed scale hydrologic model arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 simulation of watershed hydrology in swat contains the land phase and the routing phase of the hydrological cycle the first phase controls the amount of water in each subbasin to the main channel and the second phase routes the water to the outlet through the channel network of the watershed the climatic inputs for the model include daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed which provide the moisture and energy that drive all other hydrologic processes in the watershed the model categorizes rain or snow using a user specified threshold value of the mean daily air temperature the stored format of snowfall at the ground surface is a snowpack and the amount of water stored in it is expressed as swe the snowpack increases with snowfall and accumulation or decreases with snowmelt or sublimation the air and snowpack temperature areal coverage of snow and melting rate are the main factors that control the snowmelt process snowmelt and rainfall are contained in the computation of runoff and percolation to account for the orographic effects on both precipitation and temperature the model allows up to 10 elevation bands to be defined in each subbasin temperature maximum and minimum and precipitation are computed for each band as a function of the respective lapse rate and the difference between the station elevation and the average elevation specified for the band reservoirs are impoundments located on the main channel network and they receive water from all upstream subbasins swat provides four methods to calculate the volume of outflow including measured daily outflow measured monthly outflow average annual release rate for the uncontrolled reservoir and controlled outflow with target release more details about the theory of the model can be found in neitsch et al 2011 to automatically calibrate streamflow and subbasin scale swe some changes in the original code of swat were made swat only calculates the swe at the hru scale therefore the swat code was modified to calculate the subbasin swe based on the existing hru data and output to output sub file based on sufi2 swatcup requirements so that the swe can be automatically calibrated together with streamflow the modified swat code is available on github https github com chenyz03 swat swe 2 3 data and model setup data used for building the swat model of the prb are summarized in table 1 the digital elevation model dem at 90 m resolution jarvis et al 2008 was used for sub basin delineation while a detailed stream network was initially delineated using a 30 m resolution dem and used for watershed delineation with the threshold of 100 km2 the study basin was delineated into 808 subbasins which were further divided into 6 243 hrus to accurately simulate snow processes in large mountain basins elevation bands are often used to account for the orographic effects on precipitation and temperature fontaine et al 2002 however there is still no consensus in the literature regarding the recommended number of elevation bands for the swat model grusson et al 2015 pradhanang et al 2011 examined elevation bands of 0 1 3 and 5 in swat model they found that both three and five elevation bands improved simulation five elevation bands showed slight additional improvements while it was more computationally time consuming bhatta et al 2019 compared various number of elevation bands 0 5 and 10 in swat model it was found that elevation bands of 5 and 10 showed comparable model performance considering time consumption and performance five elevation bands were used in this study the land use map was obtained from the geobase land cover product which identified 23 classes of land use and land cover for the study area soil data were from two sources including soil landscapes of canada slc v3 2 from the agriculture agri food canada and fao soil database slc was pre processed by cordeiro et al 2017 in a format that can be easily used in swat and it has a more detailed soil classification and parameterization scheme however the existing slc data does not cover a small portion of the upstream areas and the global fao soil map and its attributed parameters fischer et al 2008 were used to fill this gap for the study period the williston and dinosaur reservoirs need to be considered in the peace river basin the outflow from the williston reservoir flows immediately into the dinosaur reservoir the storage of the dinosaur reservoir can be ignored compared with the storage of the williston reservoir therefore the two reservoirs were considered a combined reservoir in the hydrologic model the reservoir was simulated using the measured daily outflow method and the reservoir input data for swat table 2 was extracted and or estimated from the williston and dinosaur reservoir specifications in a bc hydro report peace river water use plan revised for acceptance by the comptroller of water rights https www bchydro com content dam hydro medialib internet documents environment pdf peace river water use plan pdf the volume of water and the surface area at the emergency principal spillway elevation are not provided in the report in this study the volume of water needed to fill the reservoir to the emergency and principal spillways was estimated based on the stage storage relationship for the williston reservoir provided in the report the reported surface area of the williston reservoir at full pool maximum normal operation elevation is 1773 km2 we used these information to estimate the reservoir surface area at the emergency principal spillway elevation assuming the reservoir is a conical frustum water level data at the wsc station 07ef002 for the williston reservoir was used to estimate the initial reservoir storage on a given date streamflow data at hudson hope 07ef001 several kilometers downstream of the peace canyon dam was used as reservoir outflow weather inputs for swat model include precipitation temperature maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed three data sources were used to assess the uncertainty in weather data including eccc national centers for environmental prediction s climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr and the era5 eccc provides observed climate data over canada while cfsr and era5 are global reanalysis climate data products daily precipitation and temperature data from 136 meteorological stations were obtained from eccc for the study period 2001 2013 only 38 stations had 60 missing values which were used in the model the meteorological stations available from eccc do not have reasonable spatial distribution across the prb as only a few of them are in the mountainous regions and the downstream part of the basin and the observed climate data collected from these stations are dominated by many missing values see fig 1b and c cfsr has all the required weather data for the model in this study the missing solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed data in eccc and era5 were completed from the nearest cfsr grid stations and combined with their precipitation and temperature data to drive swat model in addition the missing values in the precipitation and temperature data of eccc meteorological stations were filled using the weather generator module built in the swat model daily streamflow and swe were used for model calibration and validation 14 wsc stations that had 20 missing values of daily flow during 2004 2013 were used in this study table 3 canadian meteorological centre cmc daily snow depth analysis data https nsidc org data nsidc 0447 versions 1 provides daily snow depth data but swat simulates swe snow density data is required to convert cmc snow depth to swe however snow density can vary spatially temporally and vertically within the snow pack profile bormann et al 2013 era5 has both swe and snow density data allowing us to convert era5 swe to snow depth this conversion was done at 14 point stations near the streamflow stations so that the snow data from era5 could be cross checked with the cmc snow depth data the two data sources were consistent at most stations except for a few in mountainous regions therefore era5 swe data at the 14 point stations were used to calibrate the swat model with streamflow in this study 2 4 model calibration and evaluation schemes the examination of the performance of the swat models in this study is based on their ability to reproduce historical swe and streamflow data considering the available periods of three climate data sources see table 1 2001 2013 was selected as the simulation period the first three years were used as a warm up period to mitigate the effect of the initial condition of the models abbaspour et al 2015 the models were calibrated for 2004 2009 and validated for 2010 2013 periods each period was ensured to include both dry and wet years jaberzadeh et al 2022 the calibration period was longer than the validation period for a better parameterization of the swat model and to reduce the model output uncertainty gashaw et al 2018 the commonly used sufi2 of swatcup was used to perform the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation abbaspour 2015 for the purpose of uncertainty analysis a total of 25 parameters were selected based on an extensive literature review and their values were constrained by the published or physically realistic ranges anand et al 2018 grusson et al 2015 sospedra alfonso et al 2015 zaremehrjardy et al 2021 a sensitivity analysis was performed for three swat projects driven by the cfsr eccc and era5 climate data respectively specifically we used a latin hypercube sampling technique within the sufi2 algorithm to generate 1000 samples of parameter sets from the given ranges and fed them into the models to perform 1000 simulations for each model based on p value and t statistic provided by global sensitivity analysis of the swatcup abbaspour 2015 four insensitive parameters were dropped and the remaining 21 parameters shown in table 4 were used for calibration to evaluate the effects of the objective function on model calibration two commonly used efficiency coefficients were selected as the objective functions including the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns and a modified version of the efficiency criterion br2 defined by krause et al 2005 which integrates the slope of the regression line b and the coefficient of determination r2 during calibration the latin hypercube sampling technique within the sufi 2 algorithm generates samples of parameter sets based on the number of simulations specified by the user the samples of parameter sets can contain both realistic and unrealistic snow parameter combinations i e those containing smfmx smfmn as swatcup does not control the relationship between various snow parameters in this study the parameter sets that contained unrealistic snow parameter combinations were removed after each parameter sampling and the remaining realistic parameter sets were written into the swatcup files par val txt and str txt for further calibration r and batch scripting were used to automatically eliminate unrealistic parameter sets and perform simulations https github com chenyz03 swat swe this new automatic calibration process is referred to as the modified swatcup hereafter to distinguish it from the original one the workflow of this research is summarized in fig 2 the cfsr eccc and era5 data were assessed by checking their magnitude spatial patterns and model performance before calibration the climate data that led to better pre calibration results were used in the subsequent steps step 2 evaluates the various model calibration schemes using the original and modified swatcup step 3 compares the model performance with single variable streamflow and multi variable swe and streamflow calibrations for computational time efficiency a parallel program developed by du et al 2020 was used to parallelize our simulations over multiple cores in an advanced computer the model performance was evaluated using ns coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2015 the evaluation criteria from moriasi et al 2015 were adapted and shown in table 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate data evaluation swat uses the weather station closest to the centroid of each subbasin the daily precipitation and temperature from cfsr eccc and era5 were analyzed for modelled subbasins and displayed in fig 3 precipitation and temperature from the three sources in the western mountain regions where observed data are sparse see fig 1 are significantly different the average annual precipitation from gridded cfsr is larger than eccc and era5 ranging from 358 to 1762 mm per year the observed annual mean precipitation of eccc varies from 386 to 1278 mm overall the gridded era5 precipitation follows a similar pattern as the eccc ranging from 403 to 1386 mm per year across the study region the temperature difference among the three sources is not distinct in regions where there are relatively dense gauging stations the annual average temperature of eccc in the prb varies from 1 8 to 3 9 c the long term average annual temperatures are lower in the gridded cfsr and era5 datasets than eccc data they vary from 4 8 to 3 6 c and 4 3 to 4 2 c across the basin for cfsr and era5 respectively in addition the annual mean temperature of eccc in the western rocky mountains is above zero and higher than cfsr and era5 data it is probably due to very sparse eccc stations available in the mountains and swat used outlying stations for these subbasins the three climate data sources were also assessed by comparing the pre calibrated reservoir outflows fig 4 shows the simulated and observed flow at the peace river at hudson hope 07ef001 taken as the reservoir outflow the era5 data performed the best as most simulated reservoir outflow fit their measured counterparts the eccc data cannot generate enough runoff for the reservoir to discharge while the cfsr data generated too much runoff exceeding the reservoir s capacity likely due to the larger values of precipitation in this dataset fig 5 shows the pre calibration performance of the model based on the three climate data sources the era5 data performed the best judged by any of the three efficiency criteria i e r2 ns and pbias in the study the cfsr data performed better when judged by r2 but worse than the eccc data according to the ns and pbias values it can be seen from fig 4 that using the cfsr data the historical low flows were reproduced but the peak flows were significantly overestimated this likely explains the acceptable r2 values but significantly large negative values for ns and pbias the poor performance of the cfsr data using various model efficiency criteria is likely due to its abnormally large precipitation faramarzi et al 2015 in general era5 climate data shows the best pre calibration performance in driving the swat model simulating daily streamflow this agrees with the findings of tarek et al 2020 which suggested that the lumped hydrological model driven by the era5 data generally performs well over most river basins in north america 3 2 evaluation of various model calibration schemes based on era5 data 3 2 1 results from the original swatcup a total of 14 projects the combinations of 2 objective functions and 7 calibration schemes see table 6 were built based on era5 climate data and calibrated using the original swatcup fig 6 shows the calibration results with the model performance evaluated by the three model efficiency criteria the multi site calibration results showed that the objective function of br2 was more sensitive to the use of various calibration schemes than ns calibration results based on the ns objective function were overall better than those using br2 the objective functions of ns and r2 are both very sensitive to peak flows but r2 can produce very high values of streamflow for some bad model results krause et al 2005 although integrating r2 with the gradient b br2 can somewhat counteract that effect our results showed that br2 still can produce very high values of streamflow for some poorly simulated stations this partly explains why the objective function of ns outperformed the br2 here the results showed that the larger number of simulations did not result in better model performance when br2 was used as the objective function era5 br2 in fig 6 in contrast better model performance was achieved with more simulation numbers in each iteration when the objective function was ns c1 c4 of era5 ns in fig 6 c3 was an exception but its calibrated snow parameters were unreasonable with the objective function of ns see table 6 the unreasonable snow parameter combinations resulting from the original swatcup is likely to complicate the responses of model performance to the choice of simulation number during calibration the calibration scheme c5 using ns as the objective function produced the best performance with reasonable snow parameters and a smaller total number of simulations during model calibration sufi2 of swatcup will suggest a narrower range for the parameters after each iteration and thus a smaller simulation number is often adequate for sampling parameters for the next iteration therefore calibrating swat with decreasing simulation number during the iteration process c5 is probably more reasonable than using equal number of simulations in each iteration however it is almost impossible to determine the accurate number of the simulations to be used in each iteration for a calibrated parameter set as there are too many possibilities of parameters to be calibrated and their ranges the start number of simulations and decreasing step used in calibration scheme c5 is somewhat subjective the sequential calibration scheme from upstream to downstream c6 performed well at the upstream hydrometric stations fixing the parameters of the upper basin and only calibrating those of the lower basin led to difficulty in simulating the downstream stations that are close to the upper basin the overall performance of the sequential calibration was worse than that simultaneously calibrating all hydrometric stations across the entire basin e g c3 c5 versus c6 of era5 ns in fig 6 these results do not agree with nkiaka et al 2018 who found that sequential calibration outperformed simultaneous multi site calibration possible reasons for this inconsistency are that the study site the location and the number of calibrated hydrometric stations are different nkiaka et al 2018 only used three stations to calibrate the swat model and they were mainly in the lower region of the watershed a total of 14 hydrometric stations across the river basin were used for calibration in this study in addition how to separate a river basin into various calibration segments may have also affected the model performance the author of swatcup commented that snow related parameters e g tlaps plaps sftmp smtmp smfmx smfmn and timp should not be calibrated together with other hydrological parameters because they could negatively affect the simulation results abbaspour et al 2017 this was explored by c7 table 6 in which the snow related parameters were calibrated first with fewer number of simulations e g 100 300 and then fixed while calibrating the remaining parameters our results indicated that when examining fewer number of simulations e g 300 in c7 swatcup generally suggested reasonable values for the snow related parameters smfmx does not exceed smfmn in this case the best calibrated parameter set did not contain unreasonable snow parameter combinations however the simulated results in the prb based on the suggestion from abbaspour et al 2017 were not satisfactory compared with other calibration schemes when ns was used as the objective function see c7 in fig 6 individual effects of parameters and their interactive impacts can both be important in model calibration qi et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 calibration scheme c7 does not consider the interactions between the snow related parameters and other hydrological parameters this partly explains its relatively poor performance as compared with other calibration schemes which calibrated all parameters together c7 performed well among those calibration schemes when using the objective function br2 but the overall performance was still worse than those using the ns objective function it was also noted that the optimal calibrated parameter sets resulting from both objective functions contained unreasonable parameter combinations smfmx smfmn when the original swatcup was used see table 6 those parameter sets may be mathematically optimal but not physically meaningful 3 2 2 results from the modified swatcup results from running the scenarios using the original swatcup indicated that calibration scheme c1 has too small simulation number per iteration that can be inadequate for sampling parameters the calibration schemes c6 and c7 which separately calibrate a river basin and parameters are more complicated than those calibrating the whole basin and all parameters together and did not prove to be advantageous over the other schemes therefore only c2 to c5 were selected to evaluate the performance of the modified swatcup all c2 to c5 calibration schemes see table 6 were recalibrated using the modified swatcup and compared with the results obtained from the corresponding calibration schemes using the original swatcup fig 7 symbols of c2 2 c5 2 were used to indicate they were calibrated using the modified swatcup the model results of most calibration schemes using the modified swatcup were significantly improved after removing unreasonable snow parameter combinations this suggested that the unreasonable snow parameter combinations can negatively affect the sufi2 of swatcup making it hard to search for the optimal parameter set while calibrating the hydrological model in addition the models calibrated using ns as the objective function again outperformed those using br2 as the objective function the use of a smaller number of simulations e g c2 2 in fig 7 during calibration was more likely to cause a few poorly simulated stations the calibration scheme with the highest number of simulations 2000 in each iteration c4 2 did not always give the best results for example model performance of c3 2 using 1000 number of simulations in each iteration performed better than that of c4 2 with br2 as the objective function a possible reason is that the large number of simulations during early iterations that can lead sufi2 into local optimal mousavi et al 2012 using ns as the objective function the c4 2 performed the best among all the calibration projects with reasonable calibrated parameters however c5 2 had a similar performance to c4 2 but used only nearly half of the number of simulations the total number of simulations during calibration significantly decreased with the modified swatcup as the unrealistic parameter combinations were automatically removed as can be seen from fig 8 a reduction of the total simulation number from 13 9 to 45 5 was seen among the four calibration schemes this would be very efficient for large swat projects since it can notably save time 3 3 model performance with single variable and multi variable calibration the modified swatcup with the objective function of ns was used to evaluate the model performance with single variable streamflow only and multi variable streamflow and swe calibration the calibration scheme c3 2 is often used in swatcup while c5 2 showed good potential in single variable calibration see details of c3 and c5 in table 6 therefore the calibration schemes of c3 2 and c5 2 were further examined in multi variable calibration 14 stations were calibrated for the single variable streamflow while 28 stations 14 stations of streamflow and 14 stations of swe were calibrated for the multi variable calibration each station was given equal weight during the calibrations the model results for both the calibration and the validation periods are shown in table 7 the calibration scheme c5 2 used a decreasing number of simulations during the iteration process this calibration scheme performed better than when using the same number of simulations in each iteration calibration scheme c3 2 for the single variable calibration p3 during the calibration and validation periods but this was not the case in the multi variable calibration p3multi nonetheless both calibration schemes can provide satisfactory performance for single and multi variable calibration given that the same calibration scheme could perform differently with the single and multi variable calibration it is advisable to use at least two calibration schemes e g c3 2 and c5 2 in order to get a more optimal result fig 9 compares the subbasin swe from the single and multi variable calibration during the calibration and validation periods it can be seen that the simulated swe of multi variable calibration matched well with the observed swe at most stations as compared to using single variable calibration to further explore the significance of using multi variable calibration with both streamflow and swe the observed and simulated spring streamflow of two mainstream hydrometric stations in 2007 in the calibration period and 2013 in the validation period are shown in fig 10 the multi variable calibration with the calibration scheme of either c3 2 or c5 2 had similar performance and thus the calibration scheme c3 2 was selected to compare the spring flow simulated by the single variable and multi variable calibrations it can be seen that the simulated spring streamflow primarily the rising limb based on the multi variable calibration performed much better than using the single variable calibration during the calibration period during the validation period the multi variable calibration model accurately simulated the rising limb of spring flow but underestimated the peaks without the constraint of swe the single variable calibration tried to match the spring peak flow though magnifying the swe and delaying the time of snow melting see fig 9 however the simulated start of the spring freshet was significantly later than the observed for both the calibration and the validation periods moreover it significantly overestimated the peak flow during the validation period fig 10 in a snow dominated river basin like the prb snow is vital in contributing to the streamflow especially to the spring freshet the calibrated parameters from single variable streamflow can not properly represent the actual snow process and thus cannot accurately simulate snow affected spring streamflow calibrating swe together with streamflow can limit the uncertainty of snow related parameters and produce more reasonable parameter sets consequently the spring streamflow simulated by multi variable calibration notably outperformed that using single variable calibration the poorer performance of simulating spring peak flow was likely due to uncertainties and or errors in data source and model structure the precipitation temperature and swe were from era5 reanalysis data although they have a good potential to replace the observations deviations from real values still exist most of the streamflow is derived from the mountain headwaters of the peace river where the data errors can be more significant due to station scarcity in the mountainous regions in addition the method used to calculate the subbasin swe was not very accurate because the snow is not evenly distributed in each subbasin especially in the mountainous regions peace river generally experiences spring peak flow during the river ice breakup period late april to early may for example ice jam events were reported in major tributary smoky river in late april 2013 and main reach fort vermilion in early may 2013 alberta environment and parks peace river ice observation reports 2013 which resulted in spring peak flow combined with snow melting however river ice breakup effects are not appropriately accounted for in the routing process of swat in addition there can be larger uncertainty in the wsc streamflow data when a gauging station is affected by river ice wsc sometimes conducts manual discharge measurements during winter and uses such data to make corrections turcotte and rainville 2022 however the correction can be subjective if such data is not available these above issues increase the uncertainties and difficulties of accurately modelling the spring peak flow the poor prediction of spring streamflow in the prb was also noted by toth et al 2006 they attributed it to the inherent difficulties of hydrological modelling of the complex snowmelt related physical processes the underestimation of high streamflow due to snowmelt by the swat model was also noted by tuo et al 2018b in the alpine catchments though they mainly ascribed it to the effects of river damming rain on snow ros events typically occur during winter and spring and can lead to significantly enhanced snowmelt and cause flooding in some cold regions myers et al 2021 myers et al 2021 and zare et al 2022 have recently incorporated ros into the swat model and found that it helped improve the simulation of the snowmelt process and the corresponding streamflow the impact of ros events on colder continental climates such as the majority of the prb is relatively limited musselman et al 2018 and thus was not included in this study it can be hydrologically relevant to water resources experts and managers il jeong and sushama 2018 liu et al 2016 musselman et al 2018 given the climate keeps becoming warmer and rainfall frequency increases in canada ros events are expected to occur more frequently and should be correctly considered in future work to better simulate both winter and spring streamflow for the prb and other cold regions 4 conclusion this study quantitatively assessed the uncertainties in various climate data sources eccc cfsr and era5 and calibration schemes based on the semi distributed hydrological model swat assessment of the model performance using daily discharge data at 14 hydrometric stations and at the outlet of the reservoir in the study region showed that the gridded era5 precipitation and temperature data performed the best among these three data sources and can be used to drive the swat and other hydrological models in simulating daily streamflow in the peace river basin 14 calibration projects were built and calibrated to investigate the impacts of the objective function ns and br2 and the simulation number of each iteration based on the sufi2 of swatcup the objective function of br2 had greater uncertainty than ns in guiding the sufi2 to search for the best parameter set it was found that the objective function of ns had overall better performance than the br2 during calibration as the objective functions br2 can produce too high peak flow at some poorly simulated stations in multi site calibration the number of simulations during calibration iterations had a notable influence on the model performance lower number of simulations in each iteration such as 200 and 500 could lead to significant uncertainty while larger number of model runs e g 2000 could lead to local optimal the new calibration scheme using a decreasing number of simulations e g from 1500 to 500 by 200 was shown to have good potential in calibrating the streamflow sequential calibration from upstream to downstream did not improve the model performance as expected and could lead to worse performance than calibrating the river basin as a whole calibrating the snow related parameters separately from the other parameters did not perform well compared to calibrating all parameters together when the objective function of ns was used this calibration scheme may have avoided unrealistic snow parameter combinations but it was difficult to get an optimal model performance likely because parameter interactions were not accounted for a modified sufi2 of swatcup approach was developed to automatically remove the unrealistic snow parameter combinations generated by swatcup the modified tool showed improved performance than the original sufi2 swatcup under various calibration schemes and was more computationally efficient as it greatly reduced the number of simulations to limit the model equifinality and parameter uncertainty multi variable calibration streamflow and swe was applied and compared with single variable calibration modification of swat was done to automatically calibrate subbasin swe and streamflow using swatcup providing an efficient tool for calibrating large scale swat models in snow dominated regions it was found that the multi variable calibration better limited the parameter uncertainties and improved the reliability and robustness of the hydrological model in simulating future streamflow simulation of the snow process was improved due to the additional calibration variable of swe consequently the simulated spring streamflow affected by snowmelt was in better agreement with the observed data in addition various calibration schemes e g the choice of the simulation number were shown to have significantly different performances in single variable and multi variable calibrations therefore it is suggested to perform at least two calibration schemes in calibrating a hydrological model to find more optimal results although the calibration framework of this work is applicable for swat and swatcup and in the context of snow simulation it can be examined in calibration of other variables in other semi physical models the work presented in this paper is expected to contribute to water resources planning and management in the peace river basin and provide insights for researchers on modelling and calibrating large scale snow dominated river basins this research can advance the application of swat and similar hydrological models in cold regions by developing an advanced calibration framework that can 1 automatically remove unrealistic snow parameter combinations and avoid their possible negative impacts 2 significantly reduce the total number of simulations and save calibration time and 3 calibrate streamflow and swe simultaneously without using very complex calibration program future studies should focus on further improving the simulation of spring peak flow affected by snowmelt and river ice breakup in addition this study only explored the impact of the individual objective function on model calibration although the single objective function is still widely used in swatcup model calibration abbaspour et al 2017 koltsida et al 2021 sadegh et al 2022 vema and sudheer 2020 the multi objective function is promising in model calibration ji et al 2019 price et al 2012 the effects of single objective and multi objective functions on swatcup model calibration should be further explored in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

gizaw et al 2017 loiselle et al 2020 scheepers et al 2018 yan et al 2013 the reliability and robustness of hydrological models generally depend on accurate model representations appropriate input data

pre calibrated model performance is very poor abbaspour et al 2017 various types of input data e g climate soil and land use could bring in different sources of uncertainties in model results and each type often has more than one data source for a region climate data is crucial for hydrological modelling however it is often difficult to collect high quality observed climate data for large scale

the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf hersbach et al 2020 is also a global reanalysis data its performance in hydrological models has drawn much attention globally champagne et al 2021 tarek et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 for example tarek et al 2020 evaluated the performance of the era5 precipitation and temperature data in driving two lumped hydrological models over a large set of watersheds in north america xiang et al 2021 assessed the eight global precipitation datasets including era5 based on a conceptual lumped hydrological model over many catchments in china europe and north america xu et al 2022 evaluated the era5 precipitation in driving a distributed hydrological model mesh over the great lakes basin however the performance of era5 data still needs to be further examined in other popular distributed and or semi distributed hydrological models and more representative cold region watersheds hydrological models can be unreliable if not correctly calibrated model calibration involves several considerations including calibration algorithm parameters to be calibrated and their range calibrating all the parameters together or separately choice of the objective function number of simulations number of objective variables to calibrate the model and sequential calibration of a river basin from upstream to downstream versus calibrating the watershed as a whole arsenault et al 2014 kouchi et al 2017 muleta 2012 yang et al 2008 while most studies reported that different choices could lead to different calibration results the choice of proper input data realistic parameter combination and suitable calibration scheme has remained challenging in hydrological modeling of higher latitude watersheds with their unique hydro climatic conditions despite a wide range of studies on model calibration and uncertainties applying a particular approach or data is often extemporary in process representation particularly in cold watersheds moreover less attention has been paid to the effects of the number of simulations through iterations of the calibration processes the inherent model equifinality issue i e multiple parameter sets provide equally good model performance beven 2006 beven and binley 2014 introduces uncertainty that can deteriorate the reliability of hydrological models in forecasting future water resources ficklin and barnhart 2014 her and seong 2018 this issue can be more critical in cold regions where hydrological cycle is governed by snow processes zaremehrjardy et al 2021 multi site abbaspour et al 2007 nkiaka et al 2018 schuol et al 2008 and multi variable calibration hanzer et al 2016 rajib et al 2016 tuo et al 2018a schemes have been reported as useful means in limiting model equifinality although multiple variables e g soil moisture evapotranspiration and water quality have been used in multi variable calibration cao et al 2006 molina navarro et al 2017 puertes et al 2019 rajib et al 2016 rientjes et al 2013 snow data is seldom utilized in the simulation of cold watersheds snowfall is a vital source of streamflow in cold regions and thus multi variable calibration that considers both streamflow and snow measurements can be beneficial in improving the snow processes of hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat tuo et al 2018b therefore a thorough assessment on the various uncertainties associated with data and calibration schemes for distributed semi distributed hydrological modeling of cold region watersheds is in great need the swat model arnold et al 1998 a semi distributed hydrological model and public domain software has been widely used in various regions from small catchments to continental scale to simulate the streamflow and water quality abbaspour et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2015 ficklin et al 2012 musau et al 2015 neupane et al 2018 tuo et al 2016 the model delineates a basin into many subbasins which are further divided into hydrologic response units hrus each consisting of unique soil land cover and slope combinations swatcup is a program for the calibrations of swat models which provides multiple algorithms such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue markov chain monte carlo mcmc sequential uncertainty fitting program sufi2 and particle swarm optimization pso for performing sensitivity analysis calibration and validation abbaspour 2015 the sufi2 of swatcup is one of the widely used techniques in calibrating the swat model grusson et al 2015 ha et al 2017 yang et al 2008 multi variable calibration considering both streamflow and snow using swat model are minimal tuo et al 2018b especially in large scale watersheds in mid to high latitude regions the snow mass balance simulations in the swat model are sensitive to the snow parameters smfmx and smfmn which are the maximum and minimum snowmelt rates however the standard sufi2 swatcup approach does not systematically assess nor control the relationship between various snow parameters for example if smfmx is greater than smfmn consequently the parameter set generated by swatcup can contain parameter combinations where smfmx is less than smfmn which does not make physical sense for watersheds in the northern hemisphere several recent studies have used snow data as an constraint in addition to streamflow when calibrating the swat model liu et al 2020 used streamflow and snow water equivalent swe to improve the swe prediction reliability of the swat model for upland watersheds in usa but they did not control or exclude the unrealistic snow parameter combinations of smfmx and smfmn other studies peker and sorman 2021 tuo et al 2018a tuo et al 2018b manually adjusted snow parameters to avoid such unrealistic parameter combinations during calibrating swe but they all manually conducted swe calibration before or after completing an automatic streamflow calibration this laborious effort may reduce the reliability of the final calibrated model therefore developing an automatic calibration scheme to reject unrealistic parameter combinations related to snow simulation and simultaneously calibrate streamflow and swe in a multi variable calibration framework is necessary tuo et al 2018b the main objective of this study is to revisit the commonly used climate data and calibration approaches and develop a more automatic calibration framework to improve the snow affected streamflow simulation and advance the application of the swat model in cold region watersheds our specific objectives include 1 evaluate observed and gridded e g era5 climate data to find the optimal weather input as the first necessary step to drive the semi distributed hydrological model swat model before calibration 2 modify swat

investigate the uncertainties of various model calibration schemes to answer the following questions a what s the proper number of simulations in each iteration b sequential calibration from upstream to downstream or calibrating a river basin as a whole and c calibrating snow parameters first and then all other hydrological parameters or calibrating all the parameters together 4 improve the simulation of snow affected spring streamflow using multi variable calibration streamflow and swe we focused our modeling efforts on the peace river basin prb in western canada the prb is characterized by heterogeneous soil land use and geospatial conditions and represents cold region hydrology e g pomeroy et al 2007 the basin has also been regulated by several large dams in the upstream therefore the prb is a suitable study area for assessing our research objectives and a watershed worth to be explored 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the peace river basin prb is in western canada and its area is about 306 000 km2 it begins from the rocky mountains in east central british columbia and extends towards the northeast side of alberta the modelled area in this study is around 277 286 km2 fig 1 the altitude varies from 3 286 m in the west to about 200 m on the east side of the prb the river basin is mainly covered by forests over 60 and the majority are evergreen needle leaf and deciduous forests based on the historical climate data from environment and climate change canada eccc for the 2004 2013 period the air temperature ranged from around 50 c in winter to about 30 c in summer and the average annual temperature in the basin was from 1 8 to 3 9 c the range of average annual total precipitation was between 386 mm and 1278 mm across the study area the low temperature in the prb generally lasts from october to april during which snowfall dominates the river basin the watershed typically experiences peak flows during spring due to snowpack melting toth et al 2006 the prb has been regulated by the w a c bennett dam at the williston lake reservoir in the upstream tributaries since 1968 williston reservoir covers approximately 1773 km2 at full pool and has active storage of 39 471 million m3 the peace canyon dam was constructed in 1980 forming the 23 km long dinosaur reservoir just behind w a c bennett dam the dinosaur reservoir covers approximately 9 km2 at full pool and has limited active storage of 24 69 million m3 the site c dam the third dam and hydroelectric generating station located downstream of the two existing dams was approved in december 2014 and construction is expected to be completed in 2025 https www sitecproject com about site c project overview 2 2 swat model the swat2012 model version 670 is a daily continuous time semi distributed and watershed scale hydrologic model arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 simulation of watershed hydrology in swat contains the land phase and the routing phase of the hydrological cycle the first phase controls the amount of water in each subbasin to the main channel and the second phase routes the water to the outlet through the channel network of the watershed the climatic inputs for the model include daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed which provide the moisture and energy that drive all other hydrologic processes in the watershed the model categorizes rain or snow using a user specified threshold value of the mean daily air temperature the stored format of snowfall at the ground surface is a snowpack and the amount of water stored in it is expressed as swe the snowpack increases with snowfall and accumulation or decreases with snowmelt or sublimation the air and snowpack temperature areal coverage of snow and melting rate are the main factors that control the snowmelt process snowmelt and rainfall are contained in the computation of runoff and percolation to account for the orographic effects on both precipitation and temperature the model allows up to 10 elevation bands to be defined in each subbasin temperature maximum and minimum and precipitation are computed for each band as a function of the respective lapse rate and the difference between the station elevation and the average elevation specified for the band reservoirs are impoundments located on the main channel network and they receive water from all upstream subbasins swat provides four methods to calculate the volume of outflow including measured daily outflow measured monthly outflow average annual release rate for the uncontrolled reservoir and controlled outflow with target release more details about the theory of the model can be found in neitsch et al 2011 to automatically calibrate streamflow and subbasin scale swe some changes in the original code of swat were made swat only calculates the swe at the hru scale therefore the swat code was modified to calculate the subbasin swe based on the existing hru data and output to output sub file based on sufi2 swatcup requirements so that the swe can be automatically calibrated together with streamflow the modified swat code is available on github https github com chenyz03 swat swe 2 3 data and model setup data used for building the swat model of the prb are summarized in table 1 the digital elevation model dem at 90 m resolution jarvis et al 2008 was used for sub basin delineation while a detailed stream network was initially delineated using a 30 m resolution dem and used for watershed delineation with the threshold of 100 km2 the study basin was delineated into 808 subbasins which were further divided into 6 243 hrus to accurately simulate snow processes in large mountain basins elevation bands are often used to account for the orographic effects on precipitation and temperature fontaine et al 2002 however there is still no consensus in the literature regarding the recommended number of elevation bands for the swat model grusson et al 2015 pradhanang et al 2011 examined elevation bands of 0 1 3 and 5 in swat model they found that both three and five elevation bands improved simulation five elevation bands showed slight additional improvements while it was more computationally time consuming bhatta et al 2019 compared various number of elevation bands 0 5 and 10 in swat model it was found that elevation bands of 5 and 10 showed comparable model performance considering time consumption and performance five elevation bands were used in this study the land use map was obtained from the geobase land cover product which identified 23 classes of land use and land cover for the study area soil data were from two sources including soil landscapes of canada slc v3 2 from the agriculture agri food canada and fao soil database slc was pre processed by cordeiro et al 2017 in a format that can be easily used in swat and it has a more detailed soil classification and parameterization scheme however the existing slc data does not cover a small portion of the upstream areas and the global fao soil map and its attributed parameters fischer et al 2008 were used to fill this gap for the study period the williston and dinosaur reservoirs need to be considered in the peace river basin the outflow from the williston reservoir flows immediately into the dinosaur reservoir the storage of the dinosaur reservoir can be ignored compared with the storage of the williston reservoir therefore the two reservoirs were considered a combined reservoir in the hydrologic model the reservoir was simulated using the measured daily outflow method and the reservoir input data for swat table 2 was extracted and or estimated from the williston and dinosaur reservoir specifications in a bc hydro report peace river water use plan revised for acceptance by the comptroller of water rights https www bchydro com content dam hydro medialib internet documents environment pdf peace river water use plan pdf the volume of water and the surface area at the emergency principal spillway elevation are not provided in the report in this study the volume of water needed to fill the reservoir to the emergency and principal spillways was estimated based on the stage storage relationship for the williston reservoir provided in the report the reported surface area of the williston reservoir at full pool maximum normal operation elevation is 1773 km2 we used these information to estimate the reservoir surface area at the emergency principal spillway elevation assuming the reservoir is a conical frustum water level data at the wsc station 07ef002 for the williston reservoir was used to estimate the initial reservoir storage on a given date streamflow data at hudson hope 07ef001 several kilometers downstream of the peace canyon dam was used as reservoir outflow weather inputs for swat model include precipitation temperature maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed three data sources were used to assess the uncertainty in weather data including eccc national centers for environmental prediction s climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr and the era5 eccc provides observed climate data over canada while cfsr and era5 are global reanalysis climate data products daily precipitation and temperature data from 136 meteorological stations were obtained from eccc for the study period 2001 2013 only 38 stations had 60 missing values which were used in the model the meteorological stations available from eccc do not have reasonable spatial distribution across the prb as only a few of them are in the mountainous regions and the downstream part of the basin and the observed climate data collected from these stations are dominated by many missing values see fig 1b and c cfsr has all the required weather data for the model in this study the missing solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed data in eccc and era5 were completed from the nearest cfsr grid stations and combined with their precipitation and temperature data to drive swat model in addition the missing values in the precipitation and temperature data of eccc meteorological stations were filled using the weather generator module built in the swat model daily streamflow and swe were used for model calibration and validation 14 wsc stations that had 20 missing values of daily flow during 2004 2013 were used in this study table 3 canadian meteorological centre cmc daily snow depth analysis data https nsidc org data nsidc 0447 versions 1 provides daily snow depth data but swat simulates swe snow density data is required to convert cmc snow depth to swe however snow density can vary spatially temporally and vertically within the snow pack profile bormann et al 2013 era5 has both swe and snow density data allowing us to convert era5 swe to snow depth this conversion was done at 14 point stations near the streamflow stations so that the snow data from era5 could be cross checked with the cmc snow depth data the two data sources were consistent at most stations except for a few in mountainous regions therefore era5 swe data at the 14 point stations were used to calibrate the swat model with streamflow in this study 2 4 model calibration and evaluation schemes the examination of the performance of the swat models in this study is based on their ability to reproduce historical swe and streamflow data considering the available periods of three climate data sources see table 1 2001 2013 was selected as the simulation period the first three years were used as a warm up period to mitigate the effect of the initial condition of the models abbaspour et al 2015 the models were calibrated for 2004 2009 and validated for 2010 2013 periods each period was ensured to include both dry and wet years jaberzadeh et al 2022 the calibration period was longer than the validation period for a better parameterization of the swat model and to reduce the model output uncertainty gashaw et al 2018 the commonly used sufi2 of swatcup was used to perform the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation abbaspour 2015 for the purpose of uncertainty analysis a total of 25 parameters were selected based on an extensive literature review and their values were constrained by the published or physically realistic ranges anand et al 2018 grusson et al 2015 sospedra alfonso et al 2015 zaremehrjardy et al 2021 a sensitivity analysis was performed for three swat projects driven by the cfsr eccc and era5 climate data respectively specifically we used a latin hypercube sampling technique within the sufi2 algorithm to generate 1000 samples of parameter sets from the given ranges and fed them into the models to perform 1000 simulations for each model based on p value and t statistic provided by global sensitivity analysis of the swatcup abbaspour 2015 four insensitive parameters were dropped and the remaining 21 parameters shown in table 4 were used for calibration to evaluate the effects of the objective function on model calibration two commonly used efficiency coefficients were selected as the objective functions including the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns and a modified version of the efficiency criterion br2 defined by krause et al 2005 which integrates the slope of the regression line b and the coefficient of determination r2 during calibration the latin hypercube sampling technique within the sufi 2 algorithm generates samples of parameter sets based on the number of simulations specified by the user the samples of parameter sets can contain both realistic and unrealistic snow parameter combinations i e those containing smfmx smfmn as swatcup does not control the relationship between various snow parameters in this study the parameter sets that contained unrealistic snow parameter combinations were removed after each parameter sampling and the remaining realistic parameter sets were written into the swatcup files par val txt and str txt for further calibration r and batch scripting were used to automatically eliminate unrealistic parameter sets and perform simulations https github com chenyz03 swat swe this new automatic calibration process is referred to as the modified swatcup hereafter to distinguish it from the original one the workflow of this research is summarized in fig 2 the cfsr eccc and era5 data were assessed by checking their magnitude spatial patterns and model performance before calibration the climate data that led to better pre calibration results were used in the subsequent steps step 2 evaluates the various model calibration schemes using the original and modified swatcup step 3 compares the model performance with single variable streamflow and multi variable swe and streamflow calibrations for computational time efficiency a parallel program developed by du et al 2020 was used to parallelize our simulations over multiple cores in an advanced computer the model performance was evaluated using ns coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2015 the evaluation criteria from moriasi et al 2015 were adapted and shown in table 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate data evaluation swat uses the weather station closest to the centroid of each subbasin the daily precipitation and temperature from cfsr eccc and era5 were analyzed for modelled subbasins and displayed in fig 3 precipitation and temperature from the three sources in the western mountain regions where observed data are sparse see fig 1 are significantly different the average annual precipitation from gridded cfsr is larger than eccc and era5 ranging from 358 to 1762 mm per year the observed annual mean precipitation of eccc varies from 386 to 1278 mm overall the gridded era5 precipitation follows a similar pattern as the eccc ranging from 403 to 1386 mm per year across the study region the temperature difference among the three sources is not distinct in regions where there are relatively dense gauging stations the annual average temperature of eccc in the prb varies from 1 8 to 3 9 c the long term average annual temperatures are lower in the gridded cfsr and era5 datasets than eccc data they vary from 4 8 to 3 6 c and 4 3 to 4 2 c across the basin for cfsr and era5 respectively in addition the annual mean temperature of eccc in the western rocky mountains is above zero and higher than cfsr and era5 data it is probably due to very sparse eccc stations available in the mountains and swat used outlying stations for these subbasins the three climate data sources were also assessed by comparing the pre calibrated reservoir outflows fig 4 shows the simulated and observed flow at the peace river at hudson hope 07ef001 taken as the reservoir outflow the era5 data performed the best as most simulated reservoir outflow fit their measured counterparts the eccc data cannot generate enough runoff for the reservoir to discharge while the cfsr data generated too much runoff exceeding the reservoir s capacity likely due to the larger values of precipitation in this dataset fig 5 shows the pre calibration performance of the model based on the three climate data sources the era5 data performed the best judged by any of the three efficiency criteria i e r2 ns and pbias in the study the cfsr data performed better when judged by r2 but worse than the eccc data according to the ns and pbias values it can be seen from fig 4 that using the cfsr data the historical low flows were reproduced but the peak flows were significantly overestimated this likely explains the acceptable r2 values but significantly large negative values for ns and pbias the poor performance of the cfsr data using various model efficiency criteria is likely due to its abnormally large precipitation faramarzi et al 2015 in general era5 climate data shows the best pre calibration performance in driving the swat model simulating daily streamflow this agrees with the findings of tarek et al 2020 which suggested that the lumped hydrological model driven by the era5 data generally performs well over most river basins in north america 3 2 evaluation of various model calibration schemes based on era5 data 3 2 1 results from the original swatcup a total of 14 projects the combinations of 2 objective functions and 7 calibration schemes see table 6 were built based on era5 climate data and calibrated using the original swatcup fig 6 shows the calibration results with the model performance evaluated by the three model efficiency criteria the multi site calibration results showed that the objective function of br2 was more sensitive to the use of various calibration schemes than ns calibration results based on the ns objective function were overall better than those using br2 the objective functions of ns and r2 are both very sensitive to peak flows but r2 can produce very high values of streamflow for some bad model results krause et al 2005 although integrating r2 with the gradient b br2 can somewhat counteract that effect our results showed that br2 still can produce very high values of streamflow for some poorly simulated stations this partly explains why the objective function of ns outperformed the br2 here the results showed that the larger number of simulations did not result in better model performance when br2 was used as the objective function era5 br2 in fig 6 in contrast better model performance was achieved with more simulation numbers in each iteration when the objective function was ns c1 c4 of era5 ns in fig 6 c3 was an exception but its calibrated snow parameters were unreasonable with the objective function of ns see table 6 the unreasonable snow parameter combinations resulting from the original swatcup is likely to complicate the responses of model performance to the choice of simulation number during calibration the calibration scheme c5 using ns as the objective function produced the best performance with reasonable snow parameters and a smaller total number of simulations during model calibration sufi2 of swatcup will suggest a narrower range for the parameters after each iteration and thus a smaller simulation number is often adequate for sampling parameters for the next iteration therefore calibrating swat with decreasing simulation number during the iteration process c5 is probably more reasonable than using equal number of simulations in each iteration however it is almost impossible to determine the accurate number of the simulations to be used in each iteration for a calibrated parameter set as there are too many possibilities of parameters to be calibrated and their ranges the start number of simulations and decreasing step used in calibration scheme c5 is somewhat subjective the sequential calibration scheme from upstream to downstream c6 performed well at the upstream hydrometric stations fixing the parameters of the upper basin and only calibrating those of the lower basin led to difficulty in simulating the downstream stations that are close to the upper basin the overall performance of the sequential calibration was worse than that simultaneously calibrating all hydrometric stations across the entire basin e g c3 c5 versus c6 of era5 ns in fig 6 these results do not agree with nkiaka et al 2018 who found that sequential calibration outperformed simultaneous multi site calibration possible reasons for this inconsistency are that the study site the location and the number of calibrated hydrometric stations are different nkiaka et al 2018 only used three stations to calibrate the swat model and they were mainly in the lower region of the watershed a total of 14 hydrometric stations across the river basin were used for calibration in this study in addition how to separate a river basin into various calibration segments may have also affected the model performance the author of swatcup commented that snow related parameters e g tlaps plaps sftmp smtmp smfmx smfmn and timp should not be calibrated together with other hydrological parameters because they could negatively affect the simulation results abbaspour et al 2017 this was explored by c7 table 6 in which the snow related parameters were calibrated first with fewer number of simulations e g 100 300 and then fixed while calibrating the remaining parameters our results indicated that when examining fewer number of simulations e g 300 in c7 swatcup generally suggested reasonable values for the snow related parameters smfmx does not exceed smfmn in this case the best calibrated parameter set did not contain unreasonable snow parameter combinations however the simulated results in the prb based on the suggestion from abbaspour et al 2017 were not satisfactory compared with other calibration schemes when ns was used as the objective function see c7 in fig 6 individual effects of parameters and their interactive impacts can both be important in model calibration qi et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 calibration scheme c7 does not consider the interactions between the snow related parameters and other hydrological parameters this partly explains its relatively poor performance as compared with other calibration schemes which calibrated all parameters together c7 performed well among those calibration schemes when using the objective function br2 but the overall performance was still worse than those using the ns objective function it was also noted that the optimal calibrated parameter sets resulting from both objective functions contained unreasonable parameter combinations smfmx smfmn when the original swatcup was used see table 6 those parameter sets may be mathematically optimal but not physically meaningful 3 2 2 results from the modified swatcup results from running the scenarios using the original swatcup indicated that calibration scheme c1 has too small simulation number per iteration that can be inadequate for sampling parameters the calibration schemes c6 and c7 which separately calibrate a river basin and parameters are more complicated than those calibrating the whole basin and all parameters together and did not prove to be advantageous over the other schemes therefore only c2 to c5 were selected to evaluate the performance of the modified swatcup all c2 to c5 calibration schemes see table 6 were recalibrated using the modified swatcup and compared with the results obtained from the corresponding calibration schemes using the original swatcup fig 7 symbols of c2 2 c5 2 were used to indicate they were calibrated using the modified swatcup the model results of most calibration schemes using the modified swatcup were significantly improved after removing unreasonable snow parameter combinations this suggested that the unreasonable snow parameter combinations can negatively affect the sufi2 of swatcup making it hard to search for the optimal parameter set while calibrating the hydrological model in addition the models calibrated using ns as the objective function again outperformed those using br2 as the objective function the use of a smaller number of simulations e g c2 2 in fig 7 during calibration was more likely to cause a few poorly simulated stations the calibration scheme with the highest number of simulations 2000 in each iteration c4 2 did not always give the best results for example model performance of c3 2 using 1000 number of simulations in each iteration performed better than that of c4 2 with br2 as the objective function a possible reason is that the large number of simulations during early iterations that can lead sufi2 into local optimal mousavi et al 2012 using ns as the objective function the c4 2 performed the best among all the calibration projects with reasonable calibrated parameters however c5 2 had a similar performance to c4 2 but used only nearly half of the number of simulations the total number of simulations during calibration significantly decreased with the modified swatcup as the unrealistic parameter combinations were automatically removed as can be seen from fig 8 a reduction of the total simulation number from 13 9 to 45 5 was seen among the four calibration schemes this would be very efficient for large swat projects since it can notably save time 3 3 model performance with single variable and multi variable calibration the modified swatcup with the objective function of ns was used to evaluate the model performance with single variable streamflow only and multi variable streamflow and swe calibration the calibration scheme c3 2 is often used in swatcup while c5 2 showed good potential in single variable calibration see details of c3 and c5 in table 6 therefore the calibration schemes of c3 2 and c5 2 were further examined in multi variable calibration 14 stations were calibrated for the single variable streamflow while 28 stations 14 stations of streamflow and 14 stations of swe were calibrated for the multi variable calibration each station was given equal weight during the calibrations the model results for both the calibration and the validation periods are shown in table 7 the calibration scheme c5 2 used a decreasing number of simulations during the iteration process this calibration scheme performed better than when using the same number of simulations in each iteration calibration scheme c3 2 for the single variable calibration p3 during the calibration and validation periods but this was not the case in the multi variable calibration p3multi nonetheless both calibration schemes can provide satisfactory performance for single and multi variable calibration given that the same calibration scheme could perform differently with the single and multi variable calibration it is advisable to use at least two calibration schemes e g c3 2 and c5 2 in order to get a more optimal result fig 9 compares the subbasin swe from the single and multi variable calibration during the calibration and validation periods it can be seen that the simulated swe of multi variable calibration matched well with the observed swe at most stations as compared to using single variable calibration to further explore the significance of using multi variable calibration with both streamflow and swe the observed and simulated spring streamflow of two mainstream hydrometric stations in 2007 in the calibration period and 2013 in the validation period are shown in fig 10 the multi variable calibration with the calibration scheme of either c3 2 or c5 2 had similar performance and thus the calibration scheme c3 2 was selected to compare the spring flow simulated by the single variable and multi variable calibrations it can be seen that the simulated spring streamflow primarily the rising limb based on the multi variable calibration performed much better than using the single variable calibration during the calibration period during the validation period the multi variable calibration model accurately simulated the rising limb of spring flow but underestimated the peaks without the constraint of swe the single variable calibration tried to match the spring peak flow though magnifying the swe and delaying the time of snow melting see fig 9 however the simulated start of the spring freshet was significantly later than the observed for both the calibration and the validation periods moreover it significantly overestimated the peak flow during the validation period fig 10 in a snow dominated river basin like the prb snow is vital in contributing to the streamflow especially to the spring freshet the calibrated parameters from single variable streamflow can not properly represent the actual snow process and thus cannot accurately simulate snow affected spring streamflow calibrating swe together with streamflow can limit the uncertainty of snow related parameters and produce more reasonable parameter sets consequently the spring streamflow simulated by multi variable calibration notably outperformed that using single variable calibration the poorer performance of simulating spring peak flow was likely due to uncertainties and or errors in data source and model structure the precipitation temperature and swe were from era5 reanalysis data although they have a good potential to replace the observations deviations from real values still exist most of the streamflow is derived from the mountain headwaters of the peace river where the data errors can be more significant due to station scarcity in the mountainous regions in addition the method used to calculate the subbasin swe was not very accurate because the snow is not evenly distributed in each subbasin especially in the mountainous regions peace river generally experiences spring peak flow during the river ice breakup period late april to early may for example ice jam events were reported in major tributary smoky river in late april 2013 and main reach fort vermilion in early may 2013 alberta environment and parks peace river ice observation reports 2013 which resulted in spring peak flow combined with snow melting however river ice breakup effects are not appropriately accounted for in the routing process of swat in addition there can be larger uncertainty in the wsc streamflow data when a gauging station is affected by river ice wsc sometimes conducts manual discharge measurements during winter and uses such data to make corrections turcotte and rainville 2022 however the correction can be subjective if such data is not available these above issues increase the uncertainties and difficulties of accurately modelling the spring peak flow the poor prediction of spring streamflow in the prb was also noted by toth et al 2006 they attributed it to the inherent difficulties of hydrological modelling of the complex snowmelt related physical processes the underestimation of high streamflow due to snowmelt by the swat model was also noted by tuo et al 2018b in the alpine catchments though they mainly ascribed it to the effects of river damming rain on snow ros events typically occur during winter and spring and can lead to significantly enhanced snowmelt and cause flooding in some cold regions myers et al 2021 myers et al 2021 and zare et al 2022 have recently incorporated ros into the swat model and found that it helped improve the simulation of the snowmelt process and the corresponding streamflow the impact of ros events on colder continental climates such as the majority of the prb is relatively limited musselman et al 2018 and thus was not included in this study it can be hydrologically relevant to water resources experts and managers il jeong and sushama 2018 liu et al 2016 musselman et al 2018 given the climate keeps becoming warmer and rainfall frequency increases in canada ros events are expected to occur more frequently and should be correctly considered in future work to better simulate both winter and spring streamflow for the prb and other cold regions 4 conclusion this study quantitatively assessed the uncertainties in various climate data sources eccc cfsr and era5 and calibration schemes based on the semi distributed hydrological model swat assessment of the model performance using daily discharge data at 14 hydrometric stations and at the outlet of the reservoir in the study region showed that the gridded era5 precipitation and temperature data performed the best among these three data sources and can be used to drive the swat and other hydrological models in simulating daily streamflow in the peace river basin 14 calibration projects were built and calibrated to investigate the impacts of the objective function ns and br2 and the simulation number of each iteration based on the sufi2 of swatcup the objective function of br2 had greater uncertainty than ns in guiding the sufi2 to search for the best parameter set it was found that the objective function of ns had overall better performance than the br2 during calibration as the objective functions br2 can produce too high peak flow at some poorly simulated stations in multi site calibration the number of simulations during calibration iterations had a notable influence on the model performance lower number of simulations in each iteration such as 200 and 500 could lead to significant uncertainty while larger number of model runs e g 2000 could lead to local optimal the new calibration scheme using a decreasing number of simulations e g from 1500 to 500 by 200 was shown to have good potential in calibrating the streamflow sequential calibration from upstream to downstream did not improve the model performance as expected and could lead to worse performance than calibrating the river basin as a whole calibrating the snow related parameters separately from the other parameters did not perform well compared to calibrating all parameters together when the objective function of ns was used this calibration scheme may have avoided unrealistic snow parameter combinations but it was difficult to get an optimal model performance likely because parameter interactions were not accounted for a modified sufi2 of swatcup approach was developed to automatically remove the unrealistic snow parameter combinations generated by swatcup the modified tool showed improved performance than the original sufi2 swatcup under various calibration schemes and was more computationally efficient as it greatly reduced the number of simulations to limit the model equifinality and parameter uncertainty multi variable calibration streamflow and swe was applied and compared with single variable calibration modification of swat was done to automatically calibrate subbasin swe and streamflow using swatcup providing an efficient tool for calibrating large scale swat models in snow dominated regions it was found that the multi variable calibration better limited the parameter uncertainties and improved the reliability and robustness of the hydrological model in simulating future streamflow simulation of the snow process was improved due to the additional calibration variable of swe consequently the simulated spring streamflow affected by snowmelt was in better agreement with the observed data in addition various calibration schemes e g the choice of the simulation number were shown to have significantly different performances in single variable and multi variable calibrations therefore it is suggested to perform at least two calibration schemes in calibrating a hydrological model to find more optimal results although the calibration framework of this work is applicable for swat and swatcup and in the context of snow simulation it can be examined in calibration of other variables in other semi physical models the work presented in this paper is expected to contribute to water resources planning and management in the peace river basin and provide insights for researchers on modelling and calibrating large scale snow dominated river basins this research can advance the application of swat and similar hydrological models in cold regions by developing an advanced calibration framework that can 1 automatically remove unrealistic snow parameter combinations and avoid their possible negative impacts 2 significantly reduce the total number of simulations and save calibration time and 3 calibrate streamflow and swe simultaneously without using very complex calibration program future studies should focus on further improving the simulation of spring peak flow affected by snowmelt and river ice breakup in addition this study only explored the impact of the individual objective function on model calibration although the single objective function is still widely used in swatcup model calibration abbaspour et al 2017 koltsida et al 2021 sadegh et al 2022 vema and sudheer 2020 the multi objective function is promising in model calibration ji et al 2019 price et al 2012 the effects of single objective and multi objective functions on swatcup model calibration should be further explored in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

2287,droughts constrain environmental economic and social development around the world reservoir hedging rules are commonly used to reduce the risk of severe water shortages but the effects are closely related to the characteristic of the reservoir water supply system previous studies have limited understanding of the key system characteristics that help to determine whether hedging rules are beneficial for drought mitigation to fill this gap this study carries out experiments with a hedging rule triggered by drought limited water level dlwl we explore the impact of dlwl on system performance i e water supply reliability resilience and vulnerability with a range of hypothetical reservoirs propose the criterion to decide whether the dlwl is applicable and identify characteristics of reservoirs where dlwl is not applicable via a scenario discovery method three types of reservoirs where dlwl is not applicable are identified type ‚Ö∞ and type ‚Ö± experience structural deficits type ‚Ö∞ is characterized by scarce water resources m 0 44 and high inflow uncertainty cv 0 60 type ‚Ö± is mainly characterized by the low reservoir regulation capacity si 0 35 in

influence of changing hydrologic and socioeconomic conditions on optimal seasonal dlwls results indicate that to cope with increasing water supply pressure featured by increasing total demand decreasing streamflow and higher streamflow uncertainty dlwl during the high water demand periods ought to be raised and dlwl during the dry season that guides water supply for several months ought to be lowered insights from this work have general merit for instructing reservoir managers to take effective drought mitigation measures keywords reservoir operation drought management hedging rule water supply multiobjective optimization data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought is one of the most harmful hazards in the world borgomeo et al 2015 veldkamp et al 2015 over the past decades under the influence of global climate change and human activities droughts have become longer more intense and more frequent bracken et al 2014 turner and galelli 2016 at the same time with population growth socio economic development and environmental degradation water demand has increased dramatically herman et al 2014 kasprzyk et al 2013 severe water shortage caused by an intensifying imbalance between water availability and demand is expected to greatly constrain social and economic development reservoirs are important water supply infrastructures that serve to regulate runoff and satisfy water demands for agricultural public and environmental sectors he et al 2022 effective reservoir operation rules can mitigate drought impacts through the reasonable temporal allocation of water resources among competing water users hedging rules are widely used for drought mitigation shih and revelle 1994 1995 tu et al 2003 tu et al 2008 you and cai 2008a the primary concept of hedging rules in water supply operations is to accept slight water shortages currently to avoid a severe water shortage in the future you and cai 2008a zhao et al 2011 previous research mainly focuses on developing high efficiency optimization algorithms to derive optimal hedging rules underlying complex hydrologic and engineering constraints shih and revelle 1994 1995 tu et al 2003 tu et al 2008 for example shih and revelle 1994 1995 put forward single objective optimization methods to derive hedging rules for a single reservoir tu et al 2003 2008 proposed multi objective optimization methods to determine hedging rules for multiple reservoirs hereafter some scholars constructed economic analytical frameworks to derive optimal hedging rules draper and lund 2004 shiau 2011 you and cai 2008a 2008b it is demonstrated that optimal hedging rules should follow the principle of equal marginal benefits of release and carryover storage this analytical view of hedging rules helps to improve the understanding of optimal hedging and simplify numerical optimization taking advantage of these optimization methods the impact of hedging rules on water supply performances has been investigated bayazit and unal 1990 zhang et al 2017 water supply performance is usually measured by different dimensions of water shortage risks since water supply failure could induce severe damage and irreversible consequences to society the commonly used risk based criteria are reliability resilience and vulnerability which evaluate water shortage frequency severity and duration respectively studies have shown that there exist tradeoffs between these criteria bayazit and unal 1990 hashimoto et al 1982 moy et al 1986 zhang et al 2017 hedging rules help to improve vulnerability by reducing the risk of severe shortages while deteriorating reliability by inducing more frequent mild shortages bayazit and unal 1990 zhang et al 2017 therefore it is not always beneficial to implement hedging rules the performance of hedging rules is significantly affected by many factors such as water availability and water demand you and cai 2008a when the water availability is too scarce it always leads to a structural deficit where the hedging rule cannot make all performance metrics reach a satisfactory compromise when the water availability is too abundant demands can always be met and it is unnecessary to implement hedging rules cai et al 2008a explored the range of water availability suitable for employing hedging rules with a conceptual two period model this range aids in choosing the proper operating policy between hedging rules and standard operating policy during real time reservoir operation however it cannot provide a direct guide to determining whether hedging rules for reservoirs or other engineering measures such as reservoir expansion and water diversion projects should be employed to alleviate droughts in a drought region therefore the purpose of the presented research is to identify the characteristics of the reservoir water supply systems that determine the role of hedging rules propose effective drought mitigation measures for systems where hedging rules are of trivial value put forward the modification method of the optimal hedging rule to adapt to the potential changes in hydrology and socioeconomic conditions for the systems where hedging is applicable to address the above issues the trigger of the hedging rule indicating the timing to initiate and terminate hedging needs to be determined first when the trigger reaches a prescribed threshold the system switches from normal water supply modes to emergency modes and imposes water supply restrictions this study employs the commonly used water level as the trigger named drought limited water level dlwl to establish a zone based hedging rule for simplicity dlwl is used to represent the hedging rule triggered by drought limited water level in the following context first the impact of dlwl on the system performance is analyzed through a range of hypothetical reservoirs which are built with the key characteristic parameters describing inflow conditions water demand and reservoir capacity then the characteristics of reservoirs in which dlwl is not applicable are identified with a scenario discovery method for these reservoirs the main influencing characteristics parameters that challenge the use of dlwl are revealed and used to inform effective drought management measures for the rest reservoirs where dlwl is applicable a multi objective dlwl optimization method is put forward qinghe reservoir located in northeast china is taken as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the model and the effect of changing hydrologic and socioeconomic conditions on optimal seasonal dlwls is investigated the results of these analyses help to take effective drought mitigation measures for various water supply systems such as inter basin water transfer expanding established reservoirs applying hedging rules or modifying the existing dlwl 2 methodology 2 1 methodology framework 2 1 1 definition of drought limited water level the drought limited water level dlwl serves as a warning of operational drought when anomalous water supply failure may occur and triggers hedging when the reservoir water level is higher than dlwl it indicates that there is sufficient water to be supplied as demanded when the water level is lower than dlwl it means the water storage in the reservoir is deficient possibly leading to a serious water shortage in the future to relieve possible future deficits the current water supply should be limited influenced by the seasonal variations of streamflow and socio economic water demands water shortage could exhibit significant seasonal variations in general water deficits occur more frequently and more severely in dry seasons than in wet seasons thus this paper determines different dlwls for different periods of the year meanwhile different water storages of the same period indicate different capacities to satisfy water demands in the future to retain a certain amount of water while avoiding unnecessary water deficits different water supply limitations should be imposed for different water storage the limitations are usually determined by the water supply requirements of different water users for example restrictions on agricultural water supply can be heavier and taken earlier than public water users which are of higher priority in this paper we propose two drought limit water levels namely drought warned water level dwwl and drought protected water level dpwl as shown in fig 1 dwwl is higher than dpwl when the reservoir water level is lower than dwwl there is a small risk of severe deficit happening later and it warns that light water supply restrictions should be imposed when the reservoir water level is lower than dpwl there is a moderate risk of severe deficit happening later and moderate restrictions should be imposed to protect the future water supply in the following part dlwl refers to both dwwl and dpwl when it is necessary to refer to a certain dlwl dwwl or dpwl is used 2 1 2 overview of the framework this study aims to explore the role of hedging in drought mitigation for different reservoir water supply systems propose effective drought management measures for systems where hedging is of trivial value and suggest the modification of current hedging rules to adapt to a changing environment for systems where hedging is applicable to realize this goal we conduct two experiments based on the hedging rule triggered by dlwl as displayed in fig 2 in the first experiment the effect of dlwl on water supply performance is investigated with a variety of hypothetical reservoir water supply systems these hypothetical systems are generated by sampling the key characteristics of inflow demand and reservoir capacity with the monte carlo method described in section 2 2 reliability resilience and vulnerability that depict different dimensions of water deficit risk are adopted to evaluate water supply performance described in section 2 3 based on the influence of dlwl on water supply reliability which is the primary request for water supply management the inapplicable conditions of dlwl are put forward following this the systems where dlwl is trivial are labeled then a scenario discovery method is employed to identify the characteristics of these systems and discover the controlling factors that challenge system performance the results of this analysis presented in section 4 1 could be used to determine the most effective drought management measures for different reservoir water supply systems the rest systems are defined as those in which dlwl is applicable for these systems the second experiment is conducted to investigate the modification method of dlwl under changing hydrologic and socioeconomic conditions first a multi objective optimization model is established by applying this model to a typical water supply reservoir the contribution of optimal dlwl for drought mitigation is analyzed then the optimal dlwls under different water supply scenarios are derived these scenarios are obtained by perturbing the typical system s configuration with a comprehensive sample of statistical parameters depicting inflow conditions and water demand the relationships between changing conditions i e inflow demand and seasonal dlwls are analyzed with regression techniques relevant results are provided in section 4 3 2 2 hypothetical reservoir water supply system specifications besides reservoir operation rules the performance of a reservoir water supply system is affected by hydrology social economy and engineering factors to reflect these impacts we use key statistical parameters to describe the inflow condition water demand and reservoir capacity which constitute the characteristics of a reservoir water supply system the ranges of these statistical parameters are determined according to the characteristics of 29 reservoirs in china and 5000 reservoirs in the united states that are mainly operated for water supply vogel et al 1999 as listed in table 1 in our experimental design we take a typical reservoir water supply system as the base case and alter its characteristic parameters to build a variety of hypothetical reservoir water supply systems or water supply scenarios in the first experiment we use the monte carlo method to generate 10 000 hypothetical reservoir water supply systems by sampling characteristic parameters uniformly within their bounds in the second experiment we build different water supply scenarios of the base case by changing one statistical parameter depicting inflow condition and water demand at a time the abstraction of the reservoir water supply system is reasonable as it includes all the principal characteristic indicators which determine reservoir water supply performance and complies with standard techniques in mainstream literature mcmahon et al 2006 turner et al 2017 vogel et al 1995 2 2 1 inflow condition among the statistical indicators that describe the inflow conditions the mean and coefficient of variation of annual inflows have the most significant impact on water supply performance mcmahon et al 2007 they describe the magnitude and uncertainty of annual runoffs respectively these two parameters are adopted to describe the inflow condition of a water supply system 2 2 2 water demand in general a water supply system serves to meet the water demand of agriculture public and ecologic water users the ecological demand is considered to be the minimum streamflow that should always be satisfied to protect the health of ecosystems in this research agricultural and public water supplies can be curtailed moderately during water shortage periods and public water users usually have higher requirements on water supply reliability and vulnerability which has higher priority therefore a larger proportion of public water demand means a heavier water supply burden even for the same amount of total water demand to fully depict the characteristics of water demand we use the yield ratio yi to describe the quantity of total water demand relative to the annual inflow and employ the public demand ratio k to describe the distribution of water demand among different users 1 yi y Œº 2 y d pub d agr d ecol 3 k d pub d pub d agr where y is annual water demand Œº is the mean value of annual inflow dpub is annual public water demand dagr is annual agriculture water demand and decol is annual ecological water demand 2 2 3 reservoir capacity the reservoir capacity determines the regulation ability of the reservoir with a big capacity the reservoir can store more water in the wet periods for the dry periods the storage coefficient si the ratio between active storage capacity i e denoted by sact and mean annual inflow is used to assess the regulation capacity of a water supply system 4 si s act Œº 2 2 4 comprehensive indicator a comprehensive parameter namely standard net inflow m is used to reflect both the influence of inflow and demand it is the inverse of the coefficient of variation of the net input which is the difference between annual runoff and demand pegram 1980 a higher value of m indicates more abundant water resources in the system 5 m 1 y i c v where cv is the coefficient of variation of annual inflows 2 3 performance metrics reliability resilience and vulnerability have been extensively utilized to evaluate water supply performance hashimoto et al 1982 moy et al 1986 ren et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 they describe the frequency duration and severity of water shortage events respectively the following definitions of each metric are utilized to provide a holistic picture of different water supply risks for a certain water supply process the periods when water demand can be met are referred to as satisfactory periods otherwise they are referred to as failure periods 2 3 1 reliability reliability denoted by rel illustrates the probability or frequency of water demand being satisfied the system is more reliable with fewer water supply failures 6 rel n s n where n is the number of simulation periods and ns is the number of satisfactory periods when the water demand is satisfied in full 2 3 2 resilience resilience describes how quickly a system recovers from a failure event it can be defined by the duration of continuous failure sequences the system is more resilient with shorter failures we use two indicators res 1 and res 2 to describe the resilience of a water supply system res 1 which depicts the extreme water deficit situation is defined as the inverse of the maximum failure duration res 2 which depicts the general deficit situation is defined as the inverse of the average failure duration 7 re s 1 1 max d m m 1 2 m 8 re s 2 1 m m 1 m d m 1 where dm is the duration of the m th continuous failure sequence and m is the number of continuous failure sequences 2 3 3 vulnerability vulnerability illustrates the severity of the water supply deficit when a failure occurs the system is more vulnerable to more severe water shortages we use two indicators vul 1 and vul 2 to describe the vulnerability of a water supply system vul 1 depicts the extreme deficit situation and is defined as the mean of the maximum deficit ratio the ratio of water shortage to demand for a single period for each continuous failure vul 2 depicts the general deficit situation and is defined as the mean deficit ratio of each failure period 9 vu l 1 1 m m 1 m v m max 10 vu l 2 1 n f n 1 n v n where vm max is the largest deficit ratio for a single period during m th continuous failure sequence vn is the deficit ratio of period n nf is the number of failure periods 2 4 scenario discovery after analyzing the effect of dlwl on water supply performance we propose the criterion to decide when dlwl is considered to be of trivial value then we use the scenario discovery method to identify the characteristic of these systems the scenario discovery method utilizes statistical cluster analysis on water supply simulation results to determine the combinations of characteristic parameters that illuminate system performance most bryant and lempert 2010 herman et al 2014 kasprzyk et al 2013 ren et al 2019 fig 3 shows a fabricated example of the discovery method in the first step the cluster of systems where dlwl is trivial is chosen according to the previously proposed criterion in the second step the patient rule induction method prim bryant and lempert 2010 is used to automatically explore scenario boxes that best explain the characteristics of these systems of interest as shown in the third step a scenario box provides easy to understand descriptions of system characteristics by depicting the ranges of relevant characteristics parameters prim employs three conflicting metrics to measure how well a scenario box captures the systems of interest which are coverage density and interpretability coverage illustrates how many of the systems of interest are captured within a scenario box density quantifies how many of the captured systems within a scenario box are the systems of interest interpretability which expresses how easily the identified characteristics can be understood is highly subjective it is usually considered to decrease with an increasing number of parameters prim works by imposing thresholds on each parameter to shrink the original scenario box defined by the initial ranges of all characteristic parameters as the process goes on the density of the scenario box increases and coverage of the scenario box decreases finally a set of alternative candidate scenario boxes that tradeoff coverage density and interpretability are provided from which stakeholders can choose a box according to their interests by analyzing variables constrained in the scenario box and the marginal contribution of each constraint we can determine which parameter is most important to explain the characteristics of selected systems and propose effective drought mitigation measures accordingly scenario discovery with prim can be implemented through the r toolkit developed by bryant bryant and lempert 2010 2 5 dlwl optimization the optimal hedging rule triggered by dlwl is designed with evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps which is a parameterization simulation optimization approach giuliani et al 2016 this method first parameterizes the hedging rule with the dlwl that determines the timing of implementing hedging and the rationing factors that indicate the exact amount of water supplied to each water user once the water supply is curtailed then it develops a multi objective optimization model aiming at improving all the system performance metrics for both public water users and agricultural water users with the public water demand being prioritized finally optimize dlwls and rationing factors that are served as the decision variables by the epsilon non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii Œµ nsgaii based on the performance obtained via simulation problem formulation and evolutionary algorithm are introduced in detail in the following subsections 2 5 1 problem formulation 1 objectives take both agricultural and public water supply performance into consideration for each water user the optimization objective is to maximize the metrics of water supply reliability and resilience and to minimize the metrics of water supply vulnerability the objective function vector f is shown as follows 11 f re l agr v u l agr 1 v u l agr

kasprzyk et al 2012 kasprzyk et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 it is a top performing search tool among state of the art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms reed et al 2013 exploiting an Œµ dominance archive and adaptive population sizing the Œµ nsgaii guarantees both convergence and diversity of the pareto approximate set and it maintains reliable and controllable search even when dealing with 10 objectives thus it is suitable for optimizing dlwl for parameter settings of this algorithm please refer to previous research zhang et al 2017 to eliminate the effect of population generation uncertainty 10 random seed runs are exploited for each run Œµ nsgaii is implemented for 500 000 evaluations the final pareto approximate set is obtained by combining the best individuals across all runs with a nondominated sort in the optimization process all constraints other than water supply performance limits are considered after obtaining the pareto approximation set the performance limits are satisfied by removing unsatisfactory solutions 3 base case qing river reservoir is taken as the base case on which hypothetical reservoir water supply systems in experiment 1 and water supply scenarios in experiment 2 are built it is one of the most important water control projects in the liao river basin northeast china it receives water from a catchment of about 2376 km2 with a mean annual inflow volume of 495 million m3 this watershed is characterized by a temperate continental monsoon climate consisting of cold and dry winters and hot and wet summers and thus the streamflow is unevenly distributed within a year and between years about 70 to 80 of annual runoff concentrates in the period from june to september fig 3 qing river reservoir is mainly operated for water supply and flood control it has over year active storage of 574 million m3 and the active storage changes to 489 million m3 in flood season for flood control it serves to meet the demand of agriculture public and ecology water user fig 4 the annual amount of agriculture public and ecology demand comprise 52 32 and 16 of the annual total water demand respectively public demands and ecology demands are evenly distributed throughout the year but agriculture demand varies throughout the seasons reaching its peak in may followed by june the minimum ecological water demand should always be satisfied to maintain a healthy ecosystem even though a moderate water shortage is allowed for the other water users frequent and severe water shortage is required to be avoided by imposing constraints on reliability and maximum vulnerability for agriculture water supply the reliability should be higher than 75 and the maximum vulnerability should be lower than 50 for public water supply the reliability should be higher than 95 and the maximum vulnerability should be lower than 10 to evaluate the long term performance of the reservoir water supply system a 68 year 1950 2017 monthly inflow obtained from the basin management administration is used other than it this study also uses monthly precipitation and reservoir water level data 1961 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of reservoirs where dlwl is applicable we investigate the effect of dlwl on water supply performance with a variety of hypothetical reservoir water supply systems generated by varying key characteristic parameters of the base case since synthetic streamflow generation is relatively complex to simplify the generation of the hypothetical systems while keeping the diversity of their inflow condition we first generate 300 streamflow sequences to build a synthetic streamflow database which is described in detail in the next paragraph the streamflow of each hypothetical system is randomly selected from it then we generate a total of 10 000 hypothetical systems from a monte carlo sample across the yield ratio yi public demand ratio k and the storage coefficient si ranges given in table 1 and the index range of the synthetic streamflow database 1 300 sampling all factors uniformly within their bounds next we use the plausible range of the comprehensive indicator namely standard net inflow m to test the rationality of these samples if a sample is tested to be unreasonable it is removed and we resample until the expected number of hypothetical systems is obtained to build the synthetic streamflow database we first generate a synthetic streamflow sequence built to qing river reservoir s conditions and then vary the key parameters based on the regression analysis the annual streamflow sequence of qing river reservoir exhibits a second order autoregressive process with a significance level of 0 1 and it follows pearson type iii distribution p iii through the kolmogorov smirnov test therefore the synthetic annual streamflow sequence can be generated with a second order autoregressive markov model first and then converted the generated sequence to p iii distribution with the principle of equivalent probability using the method of fragments generated annual streamflow sequences are disaggregated into monthly streamflow sequences the mean and coefficient of variation of annual inflow are varied to generate different streamflow sequences with the rest parameters being unchanged employing 20 mean values 356 376 396 416 736 million m3 a and 15 coefficient of variations of annual streamflow 0 15 0 25 0 35 0 45 1 55 300 sequences of monthly streamflow are generated the length of each sequence is 2000 years to ensure the convergence of statistical parameters of obtained streamflow sequences for simplicity the dlwl of each hypothetical system is calculated with the following method simulate the water supply process guided by standard operating policy sop over the 2000 year streamflow sequence for each system rank the water level process under the sop of each month in descending order the dwwl of each month is determined to be the water level ranked at 75 which equals the minimum request of agriculture water supply reliability the dpwl of each month is determined to be the water level ranked at 95 which equals the minimum request of public water supply reliability then the water supply process of each hypothetical system is simulated with the predetermined dlwl in the simulation when the water level is lower than dwwl curtail the agricultural water supply by the proportion that equals the maximum agriculture vulnerability limit when the water level is lower than dpwl curtail the public water supply by the proportion that equals the maximum public vulnerability limit finally the system performance in terms of water supply reliability vulnerability and resilience with dlwl and without dlwl i e under sop are calculated as shown in fig 5 as displayed in fig 5 dlwl improves the vulnerability of most systems at the cost of worsening reliability and resilience this is because dlwl contributes to adopting a proactive water supply restriction strategy which helps to reserve water for later use and reduce the severity of future water shortages while increasing the number of failure periods and the duration of continuous failure and this result is in agreement with prior studies conducted with a specific reservoir bayazit and unal 1990 moy et al 1986 however due to the exploration of a variety of different reservoir water supply systems we also find that the reliability of a few systems gets better with dlwl this is because with the help of previously remaining water the demand in later periods originally lacking water gets satisfied in general there is a probability of 90 for water supply reliability getting worse or staying the same since reliability is the primary request for water supply we propose the first case where dlwl is not applicable when guided by sop water supply reliability cannot meet the requirement furthermore when there is abundant water and the system does not suffer from water shortage dlwl would cause unnecessary water shortage events in turn according to this situation we propose the second case where dlwl is not applicable when guided by sop water demand can be fully satisfied the remaining water supply systems are defined as those dlwl can be applied with performance thresholds indicated by these two cases the patient rule induction method is adopted to identify the water systems where dlwl is not applicable and the dominant parameters challenging the application of dlwl since the identified systems are suggested not to apply the hedging rule triggered by dlwl but take other effective drought mitigation measures density is more important than coverage when choosing scenario boxes in this study the scenario boxes with a density higher than 95 and a high degree of confidence are selected the characteristics of identified systems are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a shows the combinations of the parameter ranges that define each type of water system namely a scenario box in this figure the x axis is normalized between the maximum and minimum of each parameter the bar represents the identified range of each parameter and d and c on the right side mean the values of density and coverage of the discovered scenario box after imposing constraints on each parameter type i and type ii are identified according to the first case and type iii is identified according to the second case fig 6 b visually displays identified characteristics of different systems according to the common parameters to type ii and type iii namely standard net inflow m and storage capacity coefficient si since type i only imposes constraints on the common parameter m the range of si for type i in fig 6 b is the originally prescribed range it is worth noting that fig 6 b does not illustrate the identified systems exactly but fig 6 a does the quantitative characteristics of these reservoirs where dlwl is inapplicable are in line with the qualitative conclusions drawn in the previous study you and cai 2008b 2008a which is hedging is trivial for either extremely high or low water stress level the characteristics of each kind of system are further analyzed as follows 1 for the type i systems the standard net inflow m 0 44 indicates the scarcity of available water resources and the coefficient of variations of the annual inflows cv 0 60 indicates high inflow uncertainty the lack of water resources is the main reason for poor water supply performance in these systems for this kind of system water supply reliability cannot meet the requirement even when guided by sop compared to sop the hedging rule triggered by dlwl improves system vulnerability but would decrease the reliability of the unsatisfactory situation therefore it is inapplicable measures such as inter basin water transfer should be adopted to mitigate the negative effect of droughts 2 for the type ii systems the standard net inflow m 0 44 indicates the abundance of water resources but the storage coefficient si 0 35 implies poor regulation capacity and the yield ratio yi 0 24 implies a certain high level of water demand both si and yi increase water supply stress to determine the dominant parameters we analyze each parameter s marginal contribution to explaining the system performance imposing thresholds on standard net inflow m provides a scenario with a density of 26 when adding constraints on the storage coefficient si the density increases by 61 from 26 to 87 yet the identified scenario only gains an additional 8 from 87 to 95 density by adding constraints on the yield ratio yi this result demonstrates that the low regulation capacity is the dominant factor for unsatisfactory water supply performance in this system therefore measures such as the expansion of reservoirs should be adopted to improve water supply performance 3 for the type iii systems the standard net inflow m 0 98 illustrates the abundance of water resources and the storage coefficient si 1 02 implies adequate regulation capacity there is no water shortage event in these systems and hedging rules are not beneficial 4 the remaining systems other than type i type ii and type iii systems where dlwl can be applied are denoted as type iv this main class contains five subclasses whose characteristics are stated as follows ‚ë† the standard net inflow m 0 44 indicates the scarcity of available water resources but the cv 0 60 indicates low inflow uncertainty ‚ë° the standard net inflow 0 44 m 0 98 indicates moderate water resources and the yield ratio yi 0 24 indicates a low level of water demand ‚ë¢ the standard net inflow 0 44 m 0 98 indicates moderate water resources the yield ratio yi 0 24 indicates a high level of water demand and the storage coefficient si 0 35 implies not small regulation capacity ‚ë£ the standard net inflow m 0 98 illustrates the abundance of water resources the yield ratio yi 0 24 indicates a low level of water demand and si 1 02 implies not huge regulation capacity ‚ë§ the standard net inflow m 0 98 illustrates the abundance of water resources the yield ratio yi 0 24 indicates a high level of water demand and 0 35 si 1 02 implies moderate regulation capacity 4 2 optimal dlwl for qing river reservoir the values of standard net inflow and storage coefficient in qing river reservoir are 0 6782 and 1 15 respectively and dlwl is applicable according to fig 6 first the seasonality of dlwl is identified with fisher s optimal partitioning algorithm considering both regional hydrometeorological conditions represented by monthly precipitation inflow and regulation influence represented by monthly reservoir water level and water demand the water year is divided into 5 periods rain season july august refill season september october dry season november april peak irrigation season may and irrigation season june then the seasonal dlwls are optimized and the pareto approximate set of solutions is shown in fig 7 the objectives are arranged to make the direction of preference upward and the utopia solution is a horizontal line at the top each line connecting the ten axes represents a solution and the spread of the lines represents the whole pareto frontier this figure indicates the following results 1 the maximum vulnerability of all the pareto approximate dlwl solutions meets designated requirements at the cost of lower water supply reliability but as shown in table 2 without dlwl i e under sop the maximum vulnerability for each water user does not meet requirements and the environmental water supply experiences a severe water shortage with a 29 13 maximum water shortage ratio so dlwl is effective in drought mitigation 2 tradeoffs between objectives are indicated by crossing lines for agriculture water users clear tradeoffs exist between reliability and vulnerability criteria relagr and vulagr 1 between reliability and mean resilience criteria relagr and resagr 2 and between mean resilience and vulnerability criteria resagr 2 and vulagr 1 a synergetic relationship exists between mean vulnerability and maximum vulnerability vulagr 1 and vulagr 2 the previous study zhang et al 2017 showed that reliability has a conflicting relationship with vulnerability criteria reliability has both a synergetic and conflicting relationship with mean resilience and mean resilience has both a synergetic and conflicting relationship with mean vulnerability in contrast to it the synergetic relationships between mean resilience and reliability between mean resilience and mean vulnerability criteria are not observed this is because the synergetic relationship between mean resilience and reliability exists when the value of reliability is small and the synergetic relationship between mean resilience and mean vulnerability exists when the value of vulnerability is large but this study adds constraints on the minimum of reliability and the maximum of vulnerability which makes solutions exhibiting those relationships infeasible for public water users there are no significant relationships between objectives the conflicting relationship between water users is reflected in tradeoffs between mean agriculture vulnerability and maximum public resilience vulagr 2 and respub 1 when there is a more severe agricultural water shortage more water is saved for the public water supply which contributes to a shorter time interval of public water shortage a typical solution with the maximum sum of agriculture reliability and public reliability and relatively small vulnerability is selected from fig 7 to further elaborate on the effect of dlwl the objectives are listed in table 2 as can be seen after being instructed by dlwl performance metrics other than agriculture reliability get better or remain the same it demonstrates that operation with dlwl effectively reduces the severity and duration of water shortages at the cost of more frequent water deficits the typical dlwl is the highest in may during the peak irrigation season fig 8 this is because increasing dlwl in a period increases the frequency of water supply restrictions when rationing factors are the same in each period curtailing the water supply in a period with high water demand helps to save more water than in periods with lower water demand thereby reducing the severity of water shortage to further understand the benefits of dlwl in guiding water supply we compare the water supply processes operated with and without dlwl during a multiyear drought event 2000 2003 fig 9 under the sop rule the available storage is fully exploited with a total storage depletion lasting for 5 month causing both agriculture supply and public supply to be cut off entirely in 2003 and even the entire agriculture cutback lasts for several consecutive months on the contrary the hedging rule with dlwl instructs the implementation of small restrictions on agriculture supply when the water level is lower than dlwl and this helps to maintain a reliable water supply to public water users as a consequence there is only one mild public water shortage and a less severe agricultural water shortage 4 3 impact of changing demand and supply conditions on the optimal dlwls climate change land use change growing population and developing economy are introducing deep uncertainties into water supply systems in terms of inflow conditions and water demands giuliani and castelletti 2016 herman et al 2014 for a rapidly evolving system optimal water supply policies developed upon the current condition may not be able to reduce water shortage risks efficiently in the future and need to be modified to inform the adaptive adjustment of dlwl to future scenarios we build different water supply scenarios by perturbing the qing river reservoir s characteristic parameters and investigating the impact of changing inflow conditions and water demands on the optimal seasonal dlwls first the reasonable range of inflow and demand characteristic parameters are determined to ensure the existence of optimal seasonal dwwls and dpwls under each scenario a reasonable scenario should be where the dlwl optimization model has feasible solutions and both dwwl and dpwl play a role in drought mitigation then the effect of each characteristic parameter is investigated individually we build different water supply scenarios within the reasonable range of the target parameter while keeping other parameters unchanged and optimize seasonal dlwls under each scenario finally we explore the relationship between changing characteristic parameters and optimal seasonal dlwls by regression analysis to reduce the burden of calculation water supply scenarios are firstly constructed with coarse discrete precision in the whole plausible ranges shown in table 1 after determining the reasonable ranges of the characteristic parameters the water supply scenarios are further constructed with finer discrete precision 4 3 1 reasonable range of the inflow and demand characteristic parameters the demand characteristic can be represented by the total water demand and the proportion of different water consumers i e the yield ratio and the public demand ratio in this study we build different water demand scenarios by discretizing the yield ratio with a precision of 0 05 and discretizing the public demand ratio with a precision of 0 2 since the mean annual inflow has already been reflected in the yield ratio we build different inflow scenarios by discretizing the coefficient of variation of annual inflows with a precision of 0 1 to eliminate the effect of uncertainty in synthetic streamflow generation 5 random runs are adopted for each variation coefficient we optimize dlwl under each inflow scenario and obtain the pareto approximate set by combining the best individuals across all optimizations with a nondominated sort for each scenario the dlwl optimization model in section 2 5 is implemented if there exist feasible dlwl solutions and both agriculture and public water demand cannot be met by 100 the value of characteristic parameters in this scenario belongs to the reasonable range otherwise the value of characteristic parameters in the scenario does not belong to the reasonable range when there is no feasible dlwl solution the scenario is considered to be extremely dry when the water supply reliabilities for all users can reach 100 the scenario is thought to have abundant water and both dwwl and dpwl are inoperative when only the public water supply reliability reaches 100 it demonstrates that dwwl is inoperative and only dpwl plays a role in drought mitigation fig 10 shows the recognized reasonable ranges for the inflow and demand characteristic parameters as shown in fig 9 a the yield ratio is only reasonable between 0 6 and 0 75 with different reasonable ranges of public demand ratio when the yield ratio is higher the corresponding reasonable demand ratio is lower it is because a higher value for both parameters implies higher water supply stress a higher yield ratio may be indicative of a larger water demand or smaller annual inflow a higher public demand ratio implies supplying more water to high requirement users which increases the overall water supply requirement when the yield ratio is smaller than 0 5 for all public demand ratios there is no water deficit in the scenario when the yield ratio is higher than 0 8 it is considered to be extremely dry regardless of public demand ratios it demonstrates that the yield ratio has a greater impact on water supply as shown in fig 9 b the coefficient of variation is only reasonable between 0 45 and 0 55 it owes to the fact that a lower value of the coefficient of variation indicates a lower uncertainty in inflow which makes water supply less stressful and is beneficial to meeting water demands 4 3 2 the impact of changing water demand on optimal dlwl 1 the impact of yield ratio on optimal dlwl the yield ratio is discretized in its reasonable range with a finer interval of 0 01 and the pareto approximate optimal seasonal dlwls under each scenario are displayed in fig 11 the black dashed lines show the fitted linear regression relationships between median dlwls of the pareto approximate set and the yield ratio the f test shows that these relationships are statistically significant at a 95 confidence level the t test shows that the estimated parameters are also statistically significant at a 95 confidence level as shown in fig 11 with a rising yield ratio both dwwls and dpwls in the peak irrigation season irrigation season and the rain season increase and both dwwls and dpwls in the dry season decrease the reason is that the water shortage tends to become more severe with an increasing yield ratio which indicates higher water supply stress to avoid the damaging severe water shortage dlwl needs to be raised to trigger more current water curtailment and reserve more water for the future and the increase of dlwl in the periods of high water demand including the peak irrigation season irrigation season and the rain season helps to reserve more water with the same number of curtailment events other than that the tradeoff relationships between the performance metrics intensify with higher water supply stress tang et al 2017 to reach a new balance between these metrics the dlwl in the dry season that influences supply policy for several months is decreased at the same time the slope of the regression line is significantly higher in the peak irrigation season than in other periods indicating that the dlwl in this period was the most sensitive to changes in yield ratio 2 the impact of public demand ratio on optimal dlwl the public demand ratio is discretized in its reasonable range with a finer interval of 0 05 and the pareto approximate optimal seasonal dlwls under each scenario are displayed in fig 12 as shown in the figure when the public demand ratio is 0 5 and agriculture water demand is dominant dwwl which triggers agriculture water demand restriction exhibits a significant trend with changing public demand ratio it increases with a rising public demand ratio during the peak irrigation season irrigation season and rain season meanwhile dpwl in these seasons increases with a rising public demand ratio for the entire reasonable range of the public demand ratio this is because public water supply has higher requirements on reliability and vulnerability a larger proportion of public water supply implies higher overall supply stress to meet water demands in the new stressful water supply situation dlwl needs to be increased to trigger more water curtailment and reserve more water for the future and increasing dlwl in periods of high water demand is more efficient to save water as illustrated in section 3 3 2 1 4 3 3 the impact of changing inflow conditions on optimal dlwl the coefficient of variation of annual inflows is discretized in its reasonable range with a finer interval of 0 03 and the pareto approximate optimal seasonal dlwls under each scenario are displayed in fig 13 as shown in the figure with a rising variation coefficient both dwwls and dpwls in the peak irrigation season irrigation season and the rain season increase while both dwwls and dpwls in the dry season decrease this is because a larger coefficient of variation indicates more uncertain inflow which makes water supply more stressful it is necessary to increase dlwl in high demand periods to save water efficiently and decrease dlwl in the dry season influences supply policy for longer periods to reach a new balance between performance metrics as illustrated in section 3 3 2 1 5 conclusion in this work we seek to investigate the characteristic of reservoir water supply systems that determine the role of hedging rules propose effective drought mitigation measures for systems where hedging rules are of trivial value and put forward the modification method of optimal hedging rules to adapt to changing water supply conditions for the systems where hedging is applicable to achieve this two experiments are conducted with a zone based hedging rule triggered by drought limited water level dlwl in the first experiment we systematically analyze the impact of dlwl on water supply performance with a range of hypothetical reservoirs and find that dlwl improves the vulnerability at the cost of worsening reliability and resilience for most systems combining this impact and the primary water supply requirement three types of reservoir water supply systems in which dlwl is not applicable are identified with a scenario discovery method type ‚Ö∞ and type ‚Ö± experience water deficits that cannot be relieved by dlwl type ‚Ö∞ is characterized by scarce water resources m 0 44 and high inflow uncertainty cv 0 60 for these systems measures such as inter basin water transfer rather than applying hedging rules should be adopted for drought mitigation type ‚Ö± is mainly characterized by the low reservoir regulation capacity si 0 35 for these systems measures such as reservoir expansion should be adopted type iii is characterized by the abundance of water resources m 0 98 and adequate regulation capacity si 1 02 where water demand can always be satisfied and hedging rules are unnecessary this result can be used to efficiently determine the applicability of hedging rules according to the value of reservoir characteristics parameters the second experiment is conducted for the reservoirs where dlwl is applicable for these reservoirs a multi objective dlwl optimization model considering the conflicts between several water users is established the comparison of water supply operation with and without optimal dlwl for qing river reservoir demonstrates the effectiveness of optimal dlwl in drought mitigation the effect of changing inflow conditions and water demand on optimal dlwls is investigated and the modification methods of seasonal dlwls are suggested for maintaining good water supply performance when water supply environment changes results show that 1 if system water supply stress increases with increasing total demand decreasing streamflow and higher streamflow uncertainty both dwwls and dpwls in periods of high water demand should be raised and both dwwls and dpwls in dry seasons influencing water supply decision for several months should be lowered 2 the yield ratio has a higher impact than the public demand ratio on water supply if water supply stress increases with an increasing public demand ratio dpwls in periods of high water demand should be raised but dwwls informing agriculture curtailment policy are only influenced when the public demand ratio is 0 5 and should be increased in periods with higher public demand these results have important implications for reservoir water supply systems to adapt to a changing world rather than conducting the complex optimization process again with the updated system characteristics a much simpler and less costly measure can be taken by modifying the previously determined optimal dlwl with the suggested method it is worth mentioning that the possible changes in future water supply scenarios could be more complex than that explored in this study several water supply factors may change at the same time thus the interactions between the different factors remain to be considered when studying the effect of changing water supply conditions and such analyses will be conducted in future work moreover the water supply performance of the hedging rule triggered by dlwl can be improved by the intelligent utilization of skillful hydrological forecasts and the operation of several connected reservoirs these remain topics for future research credit authorship contribution statement chengxin luo conceptualization methodology software data curation writing original draft bo xu

2287,droughts constrain environmental economic and social development around the world reservoir hedging rules are commonly used to reduce the risk of severe water shortages but the effects are closely related to the characteristic of the reservoir water supply system previous studies have limited understanding of the key system characteristics that help to determine whether hedging rules are beneficial for drought mitigation to fill this gap this study carries out experiments with a hedging rule triggered by drought limited water level dlwl we explore the impact of dlwl on system performance i e water supply reliability resilience and vulnerability with a range of hypothetical reservoirs propose the criterion to decide whether the dlwl is applicable and identify characteristics of reservoirs where dlwl is not applicable via a scenario discovery method three types of reservoirs where dlwl is not applicable are identified type ‚Ö∞ and type ‚Ö± experience structural deficits type ‚Ö∞ is characterized by scarce water resources m 0 44 and high inflow uncertainty cv 0 60 type ‚Ö± is mainly characterized by the low reservoir regulation capacity si 0 35 in the type iii systems water demand can always be satisfied and is characterized by the abundance of water resources m 0 98 and adequate regulation capacity si 1 02 for the rest of the reservoirs where dlwl is applicable a multi objective dlwl optimization method is put forward qing river reservoir in northeast china is taken as a base case to demonstrate the effectiveness of dlwl and study the influence of changing hydrologic and socioeconomic conditions on optimal seasonal dlwls results indicate that to cope with increasing water supply pressure featured by increasing total demand decreasing streamflow and higher streamflow uncertainty dlwl during the high water demand periods ought to be raised and dlwl during the dry season that guides water supply for several months ought to be lowered insights from this work have general merit for instructing reservoir managers to take effective drought mitigation measures keywords reservoir operation drought management hedging rule water supply multiobjective optimization data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought is one of the most harmful hazards in the world borgomeo et al 2015 veldkamp et al 2015 over the past decades under the influence of global climate change and human activities droughts have become longer more intense and more frequent bracken et al 2014 turner and galelli 2016 at the same time with population growth socio economic development and environmental degradation water demand has increased dramatically herman et al 2014 kasprzyk et al 2013 severe water shortage caused by an intensifying imbalance between water availability and demand is expected to greatly constrain social and economic development reservoirs are important water supply infrastructures that serve to regulate runoff and satisfy water demands for agricultural public and environmental sectors he et al 2022 effective reservoir operation rules can mitigate drought impacts through the reasonable temporal allocation of water resources among competing water users hedging rules are widely used for drought mitigation shih and revelle 1994 1995 tu et al 2003 tu et al 2008 you and cai 2008a the primary concept of hedging rules in water supply operations is to accept slight water shortages currently to avoid a severe water shortage in the future you and cai 2008a zhao et al 2011 previous research mainly focuses on developing high efficiency optimization algorithms to derive optimal hedging rules underlying complex hydrologic and engineering constraints shih and revelle 1994 1995 tu et al 2003 tu et al 2008 for example shih and revelle 1994 1995 put forward single objective optimization methods to derive hedging rules for a single reservoir tu et al 2003 2008 proposed multi objective optimization methods to determine hedging rules for multiple reservoirs hereafter some scholars constructed economic analytical frameworks to derive optimal hedging rules draper and lund 2004 shiau 2011 you and cai 2008a 2008b it is demonstrated that optimal hedging rules should follow the principle of equal marginal benefits of release and carryover storage this analytical view of hedging rules helps to improve the understanding of optimal hedging and simplify numerical optimization taking advantage of these optimization methods the impact of hedging rules on water supply performances has been investigated bayazit and unal 1990 zhang et al 2017 water supply performance is usually measured by different dimensions of water shortage risks since water supply failure could induce severe damage and irreversible consequences to society the commonly used risk based criteria are reliability resilience and vulnerability which evaluate water shortage frequency severity and duration respectively studies have shown that there exist tradeoffs between these criteria bayazit and unal 1990 hashimoto et al 1982 moy et al 1986 zhang et al 2017 hedging rules help to improve vulnerability by reducing the risk of severe shortages while deteriorating reliability by inducing more frequent mild shortages bayazit and unal 1990 zhang et al 2017 therefore it is not always beneficial to implement hedging rules the performance of hedging rules is significantly affected by many factors such as water availability and water demand you and cai 2008a when the water availability is too scarce it always leads to a structural deficit where the hedging rule cannot make all performance metrics reach a satisfactory compromise when the water availability is too abundant demands can always be met and it is unnecessary to implement hedging rules cai et al 2008a explored the range of water availability suitable for employing hedging rules with a conceptual two period model this range aids in choosing the proper operating policy between hedging rules and standard operating policy during real time reservoir operation however it cannot provide a direct guide to determining whether hedging rules for reservoirs or other engineering measures such as reservoir expansion and water diversion projects should be employed to alleviate droughts in a drought region therefore the purpose of the presented research is to identify the characteristics of the reservoir water supply systems that determine the role of hedging rules propose effective drought mitigation measures for systems where hedging rules are of trivial value put forward the modification method of the optimal hedging rule to adapt to the potential changes in hydrology and socioeconomic conditions for the systems where hedging is applicable to address the above issues the trigger of the hedging rule indicating the timing to initiate and terminate hedging needs to be determined first when the trigger reaches a prescribed threshold the system switches from normal water supply modes to emergency modes and imposes water supply restrictions this study employs the commonly used water level as the trigger named drought limited water level dlwl to establish a zone based hedging rule for simplicity dlwl is used to represent the hedging rule triggered by drought limited water level in the following context first the impact of dlwl on the system performance is analyzed through a range of hypothetical reservoirs which are built with the key characteristic parameters describing inflow conditions water demand and reservoir capacity then the characteristics of reservoirs in which dlwl is not applicable are identified with a scenario discovery method for these reservoirs the main influencing characteristics parameters that challenge the use of dlwl are revealed and used to inform effective drought management measures for the rest reservoirs where dlwl is applicable a multi objective dlwl optimization method is put forward qinghe reservoir located in northeast china is taken as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the model and the effect of changing hydrologic and socioeconomic conditions on optimal seasonal dlwls is investigated the results of these analyses help to take effective drought mitigation measures for various water supply systems such as inter basin water transfer expanding established reservoirs applying hedging rules or modifying the existing dlwl 2 methodology 2 1 methodology framework 2 1 1 definition of drought limited water level the drought limited water level dlwl serves as a warning of operational drought when anomalous water supply failure may occur and triggers hedging when the reservoir water level is higher than dlwl it indicates that there is sufficient water to be supplied as demanded when the water level is lower than dlwl it means the water storage in the reservoir is deficient possibly leading to a serious water shortage in the future to relieve possible future deficits the current water supply should be limited influenced by the seasonal variations of streamflow and socio economic water demands water shortage could exhibit significant seasonal variations in general water deficits occur more frequently and more severely in dry seasons than in wet seasons thus this paper determines different dlwls for different periods of the year meanwhile different water storages of the same period indicate different capacities to satisfy water demands in the future to retain a certain amount of water while avoiding unnecessary water deficits different water supply limitations should be imposed for different water storage the limitations are usually determined by the water supply requirements of different water users for example restrictions on agricultural water supply can be heavier and taken earlier than public water users which are of higher priority in this paper we propose two drought limit water levels namely drought warned water level dwwl and drought protected water level dpwl as shown in fig 1 dwwl is higher than dpwl when the reservoir water level is lower than dwwl there is a small risk of severe deficit happening later and it warns that light water supply restrictions should be imposed when the reservoir water level is lower than dpwl there is a moderate risk of severe deficit happening later and moderate restrictions should be imposed to protect the future water supply in the following part dlwl refers to both dwwl and dpwl when it is necessary to refer to a certain dlwl dwwl or dpwl is used 2 1 2 overview of the framework this study aims to explore the role of hedging in drought mitigation for different reservoir water supply systems propose effective drought management measures for systems where hedging is of trivial value and suggest the modification of current hedging rules to adapt to a changing environment for systems where hedging is applicable to realize this goal we conduct two experiments based on the hedging rule triggered by dlwl as displayed in fig 2 in the first experiment the effect of dlwl on water supply performance is investigated with a variety of hypothetical reservoir water supply systems these hypothetical systems are generated by sampling the key characteristics of inflow demand and reservoir capacity with the monte carlo method described in section 2 2 reliability resilience and vulnerability that depict different dimensions of water deficit risk are adopted to evaluate water supply performance described in section 2 3 based on the influence of dlwl on water supply reliability which is the primary request for water supply management the inapplicable conditions of dlwl are put forward following this the systems where dlwl is trivial are labeled then a scenario discovery method is employed to identify the characteristics of these systems and discover the controlling factors that challenge system performance the results of this analysis presented in section 4 1 could be used to determine the most effective drought management measures for different reservoir water supply systems the rest systems are defined as those in which dlwl is applicable for these systems the second experiment is conducted to investigate the modification method of dlwl under changing hydrologic and socioeconomic conditions first a multi objective optimization model is established by applying this model to a typical water supply reservoir the contribution of optimal dlwl for drought mitigation is analyzed then the optimal dlwls under different water supply scenarios are derived these scenarios are obtained by perturbing the typical system s configuration with a comprehensive sample of statistical parameters depicting inflow conditions and water demand the relationships between changing conditions i e inflow demand and seasonal dlwls are analyzed with regression techniques relevant results are provided in section 4 3 2 2 hypothetical reservoir water supply system specifications besides reservoir operation rules the performance of a reservoir water supply system is affected by hydrology social economy and engineering factors to reflect these impacts we use key statistical parameters to describe the inflow condition water demand and reservoir capacity which constitute the characteristics of a reservoir water supply system the ranges of these statistical parameters are determined according to the characteristics of 29 reservoirs in china and 5000 reservoirs in the united states that are mainly operated for water supply vogel et al 1999 as listed in table 1 in our experimental design we take a typical reservoir water supply system as the base case and alter its characteristic parameters to build a variety of hypothetical reservoir water supply systems or water supply scenarios in the first experiment we use the monte carlo method to generate 10 000 hypothetical reservoir water supply systems by sampling characteristic parameters uniformly within their bounds in the second experiment we build different water supply scenarios of the base case by changing one statistical parameter depicting inflow condition and water demand at a time the abstraction of the reservoir water supply system is reasonable as it includes all the principal characteristic indicators which determine reservoir water supply performance and complies with standard techniques in mainstream literature mcmahon et al 2006 turner et al 2017 vogel et al 1995 2 2 1 inflow condition among the statistical indicators that describe the inflow conditions the mean and coefficient of variation of annual inflows have the most significant impact on water supply performance mcmahon et al 2007 they describe the magnitude and uncertainty of annual runoffs respectively these two parameters are adopted to describe the inflow condition of a water supply system 2 2 2 water demand in general a water supply system serves to meet the water demand of agriculture public and ecologic water users the ecological demand is considered to be the minimum streamflow that should always be satisfied to protect the health of ecosystems in this research agricultural and public water supplies can be curtailed moderately during water shortage periods and public water users usually have higher requirements on water supply reliability and vulnerability which has higher priority therefore a larger proportion of public water demand means a heavier water supply burden even for the same amount of total water demand to fully depict the characteristics of water demand we use the yield ratio yi to describe the quantity of total water demand relative to the annual inflow and employ the public demand ratio k to describe the distribution of water demand among different users 1 yi y Œº 2 y d pub d agr d ecol 3 k d pub d pub d agr where y is annual water demand Œº is the mean value of annual inflow dpub is annual public water demand dagr is annual agriculture water demand and decol is annual ecological water demand 2 2 3 reservoir capacity the reservoir capacity determines the regulation ability of the reservoir with a big capacity the reservoir can store more water in the wet periods for the dry periods the storage coefficient si the ratio between active storage capacity i e denoted by sact and mean annual inflow is used to assess the regulation capacity of a water supply system 4 si s act Œº 2 2 4 comprehensive indicator a comprehensive parameter namely standard net inflow m is used to reflect both the influence of inflow and demand it is the inverse of the coefficient of variation of the net input which is the difference between annual runoff and demand pegram 1980 a higher value of m indicates more abundant water resources in the system 5 m 1 y i c v where cv is the coefficient of variation of annual inflows 2 3 performance metrics reliability resilience and vulnerability have been extensively utilized to evaluate water supply performance hashimoto et al 1982 moy et al 1986 ren et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 they describe the frequency duration and severity of water shortage events respectively the following definitions of each metric are utilized to provide a holistic picture of different water supply risks for a certain water supply process the periods when water demand can be met are referred to as satisfactory periods otherwise they are referred to as failure periods 2 3 1 reliability reliability denoted by rel illustrates the probability or frequency of water demand being satisfied the system is more reliable with fewer water supply failures 6 rel n s n where n is the number of simulation periods and ns is the number of satisfactory periods when the water demand is satisfied in full 2 3 2 resilience resilience describes how quickly a system recovers from a failure event it can be defined by the duration of continuous failure sequences the system is more resilient with shorter failures we use two indicators res 1 and res 2 to describe the resilience of a water supply system res 1 which depicts the extreme water deficit situation is defined as the inverse of the maximum failure duration res 2 which depicts the general deficit situation is defined as the inverse of the average failure duration 7 re s 1 1 max d m m 1 2 m 8 re s 2 1 m m 1 m d m 1 where dm is the duration of the m th continuous failure sequence and m is the number of continuous failure sequences 2 3 3 vulnerability vulnerability illustrates the severity of the water supply deficit when a failure occurs the system is more vulnerable to more severe water shortages we use two indicators vul 1 and vul 2 to describe the vulnerability of a water supply system vul 1 depicts the extreme deficit situation and is defined as the mean of the maximum deficit ratio the ratio of water shortage to demand for a single period for each continuous failure vul 2 depicts the general deficit situation and is defined as the mean deficit ratio of each failure period 9 vu l 1 1 m m 1 m v m max 10 vu l 2 1 n f n 1 n v n where vm max is the largest deficit ratio for a single period during m th continuous failure sequence vn is the deficit ratio of period n nf is the number of failure periods 2 4 scenario discovery after analyzing the effect of dlwl on water supply performance we propose the criterion to decide when dlwl is considered to be of trivial value then we use the scenario discovery method to identify the characteristic of these systems the scenario discovery method utilizes statistical cluster analysis on water supply simulation results to determine the combinations of characteristic parameters that illuminate system performance most bryant and lempert 2010 herman et al 2014 kasprzyk et al 2013 ren et al 2019 fig 3 shows a fabricated example of the discovery method in the first step the cluster of systems where dlwl is trivial is chosen according to the previously proposed criterion in the second step the patient rule induction method prim bryant and lempert 2010 is used to automatically explore scenario boxes that best explain the characteristics of these systems of interest as shown in the third step a scenario box provides easy to understand descriptions of system characteristics by depicting the ranges of relevant characteristics parameters prim employs three conflicting metrics to measure how well a scenario box captures the systems of interest which are coverage density and interpretability coverage illustrates how many of the systems of interest are captured within a scenario box density quantifies how many of the captured systems within a scenario box are the systems of interest interpretability which expresses how easily the identified characteristics can be understood is highly subjective it is usually considered to decrease with an increasing number of parameters prim works by imposing thresholds on each parameter to shrink the original scenario box defined by the initial ranges of all characteristic parameters as the process goes on the density of the scenario box increases and coverage of the scenario box decreases finally a set of alternative candidate scenario boxes that tradeoff coverage density and interpretability are provided from which stakeholders can choose a box according to their interests by analyzing variables constrained in the scenario box and the marginal contribution of each constraint we can determine which parameter is most important to explain the characteristics of selected systems and propose effective drought mitigation measures accordingly scenario discovery with prim can be implemented through the r toolkit developed by bryant bryant and lempert 2010 2 5 dlwl optimization the optimal hedging rule triggered by dlwl is designed with evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps which is a parameterization simulation optimization approach giuliani et al 2016 this method first parameterizes the hedging rule with the dlwl that determines the timing of implementing hedging and the rationing factors that indicate the exact amount of water supplied to each water user once the water supply is curtailed then it develops a multi objective optimization model aiming at improving all the system performance metrics for both public water users and agricultural water users with the public water demand being prioritized finally optimize dlwls and rationing factors that are served as the decision variables by the epsilon non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii Œµ nsgaii based on the performance obtained via simulation problem formulation and evolutionary algorithm are introduced in detail in the following subsections 2 5 1 problem formulation 1 objectives take both agricultural and public water supply performance into consideration for each water user the optimization objective is to maximize the metrics of water supply reliability and resilience and to minimize the metrics of water supply vulnerability the objective function vector f is shown as follows 11 f re l agr v u l agr 1 v u l agr

kasprzyk et al 2012 kasprzyk et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 it is a top performing search tool among state of the art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms reed et al 2013 exploiting an Œµ dominance archive and adaptive population sizing the Œµ nsgaii guarantees both convergence and diversity of the pareto approximate set and it maintains reliable and controllable search even when dealing with 10 objectives thus it is suitable for optimizing dlwl for parameter settings of this algorithm please refer to previous research zhang et al 2017 to eliminate the effect of population generation uncertainty 10 random seed runs are exploited for each run Œµ nsgaii is implemented for 500 000 evaluations the final pareto approximate set is obtained by combining the best individuals across all runs with a nondominated sort in the optimization process all constraints other than water supply performance limits are considered after obtaining the pareto approximation set the performance limits are satisfied by removing unsatisfactory solutions 3 base case qing river reservoir is taken as the base case on which hypothetical reservoir water supply systems in experiment 1 and water supply scenarios in experiment 2 are built it is one of the most important water control projects in the liao river basin northeast china it receives water from a catchment of about 2376 km2 with a mean annual inflow volume of 495 million m3 this watershed is characterized by a temperate continental monsoon climate consisting of cold and dry winters and hot and wet summers and thus the streamflow is unevenly distributed within a year and between years about 70 to 80 of annual runoff concentrates in the period from june to september fig 3 qing river reservoir is mainly operated for water supply and flood control it has over year active storage of 574 million m3 and the active storage changes to 489 million m3 in flood season for flood control it serves to meet the demand of agriculture public and ecology water user fig 4 the annual amount of agriculture public and ecology demand comprise 52 32 and 16 of the annual total water demand respectively public demands and ecology demands are evenly distributed throughout the year but agriculture demand varies throughout the seasons reaching its peak in may followed by june the minimum ecological water demand should always be satisfied to maintain a healthy ecosystem even though a moderate water shortage is allowed for the other water users frequent and severe water shortage is required to be avoided by imposing constraints on reliability and maximum vulnerability for agriculture water supply the reliability should be higher than 75 and the maximum vulnerability should be lower than 50 for public water supply the reliability should be higher than 95 and the maximum vulnerability should be lower than 10 to evaluate the long term performance of the reservoir water supply system a 68 year 1950 2017 monthly inflow obtained from the basin management administration is used other than it this study also uses monthly precipitation and reservoir water level data 1961 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of reservoirs where dlwl is applicable we investigate the effect of dlwl on water supply performance with a variety of hypothetical reservoir water supply systems generated by varying key characteristic parameters of the base case since synthetic streamflow generation is relatively complex to simplify the generation of the hypothetical systems while keeping the diversity of their inflow condition we first generate 300 streamflow sequences to build a synthetic streamflow database which is described in detail in the next paragraph the streamflow of each hypothetical system is randomly selected from it then we generate a total of 10 000 hypothetical systems from a monte carlo sample across the yield ratio yi public demand ratio k and the storage coefficient si ranges given in table 1 and the index range of the synthetic streamflow database 1 300 sampling all factors uniformly within their bounds next we use the plausible range of the comprehensive indicator namely standard net inflow m to test the rationality of these samples if a sample is tested to be unreasonable it is removed and we resample until the expected number of hypothetical systems is obtained to build the synthetic streamflow database we first generate a synthetic streamflow sequence built to qing river reservoir s conditions and then vary the key parameters based on the regression analysis the annual streamflow sequence of qing river reservoir exhibits a second order autoregressive process with a significance level of 0 1 and it follows pearson type iii distribution p iii through the kolmogorov smirnov test therefore the synthetic annual streamflow sequence can be generated with a second order autoregressive markov model first and then converted the generated sequence to p iii distribution with the principle of equivalent probability using the method of fragments generated annual streamflow sequences are disaggregated into monthly streamflow sequences the mean and coefficient of variation of annual inflow are varied to generate different streamflow sequences with the rest parameters being unchanged employing 20 mean values 356 376 396 416 736 million m3 a and 15 coefficient of variations of annual streamflow 0 15 0 25 0 35 0 45 1 55 300 sequences of monthly streamflow are generated the length of each sequence is 2000 years to ensure the convergence of statistical parameters of obtained streamflow sequences for simplicity the dlwl of each hypothetical system is calculated with the following method simulate the water supply process guided by standard operating policy sop over the 2000 year streamflow sequence for each system rank the water level process under the sop of each month in descending order the dwwl of each month is determined to be the water level ranked at 75 which equals the minimum request of agriculture water supply reliability the dpwl of each month is determined to be the water level ranked at 95 which equals the minimum request of public water supply reliability then the water supply process of each hypothetical system is simulated with the predetermined dlwl in the simulation when the water level is lower than dwwl curtail the agricultural water supply by the proportion that equals the maximum agriculture vulnerability limit when the water level is lower than dpwl curtail the public water supply by the proportion that equals the maximum public vulnerability limit finally the system performance in terms of water supply reliability vulnerability and resilience with dlwl and without dlwl i e under sop are calculated as shown in fig 5 as displayed in fig 5 dlwl improves the vulnerability of most systems at the cost of worsening reliability and resilience this is because dlwl contributes to adopting a proactive water supply restriction strategy which helps to reserve water for later use and reduce the severity of future water shortages while increasing the number of failure periods and the duration of continuous failure and this result is in agreement with prior studies conducted with a specific reservoir bayazit and unal 1990 moy et al 1986 however due to the exploration of a variety of different reservoir water supply systems we also find that the reliability of a few systems gets better with dlwl this is because with the help of previously remaining water the demand in later periods originally lacking water gets satisfied in general there is a probability of 90 for water supply reliability getting worse or staying the same since reliability is the primary request for water supply we propose the first case where dlwl is not applicable when guided by sop water supply reliability cannot meet the requirement furthermore when there is abundant water and the system does not suffer from water shortage dlwl would cause unnecessary water shortage events in turn according to this situation we propose the second case where dlwl is not applicable when guided by sop water demand can be fully satisfied the remaining water supply systems are defined as those dlwl can be applied with performance thresholds indicated by these two cases the patient rule induction method is adopted to identify the water systems where dlwl is not applicable and the dominant parameters challenging the application of dlwl since the identified systems are suggested not to apply the hedging rule triggered by dlwl but take other effective drought mitigation measures density is more important than coverage when choosing scenario boxes in this study the scenario boxes with a density higher than 95 and a high degree of confidence are selected the characteristics of identified systems are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a shows the combinations of the parameter ranges that define each type of water system namely a scenario box in this figure the x axis is normalized between the maximum and minimum of each parameter the bar represents the identified range of each parameter and d and c on the right side mean the values of density and coverage of the discovered scenario box after imposing constraints on each parameter type i and type ii are identified according to the first case and type iii is identified according to the second case fig 6 b visually displays identified characteristics of different systems according to the common parameters to type ii and type iii namely standard net inflow m and storage capacity coefficient si since type i only imposes constraints on the common parameter m the range of si for type i in fig 6 b is the originally prescribed range it is worth noting that fig 6 b does not illustrate the identified systems exactly but fig 6 a does the quantitative characteristics of these reservoirs where dlwl is inapplicable are in line with the qualitative conclusions drawn in the previous study you and cai 2008b 2008a which is hedging is trivial for either extremely high or low water stress level the characteristics of each kind of system are further analyzed as follows 1 for the type i systems the standard net inflow m 0 44 indicates the scarcity of available water resources and the coefficient of variations of the annual inflows cv 0 60 indicates high inflow uncertainty the lack of water resources is the main reason for poor water supply performance in these systems for this kind of system water supply reliability cannot meet the requirement even when guided by sop compared to sop the hedging rule triggered by dlwl improves system vulnerability but would decrease the reliability of the unsatisfactory situation therefore it is inapplicable measures such as inter basin water transfer should be adopted to mitigate the negative effect of droughts 2 for the type ii systems the standard net inflow m 0 44 indicates the abundance of water resources but the storage coefficient si 0 35 implies poor regulation capacity and the yield ratio yi 0 24 implies a certain high level of water demand both si and yi increase water supply stress to determine the dominant parameters we analyze each parameter s marginal contribution to explaining the system performance imposing thresholds on standard net inflow m provides a scenario with a density of 26 when adding constraints on the storage coefficient si the density increases by 61 from 26 to 87 yet the identified scenario only gains an additional 8 from 87 to 95 density by adding constraints on the yield ratio yi this result demonstrates that the low regulation capacity is the dominant factor for unsatisfactory water supply performance in this system therefore measures such as the expansion of reservoirs should be adopted to improve water supply performance 3 for the type iii systems the standard net inflow m 0 98 illustrates the abundance of water resources and the storage coefficient si 1 02 implies adequate regulation capacity there is no water shortage event in these systems and hedging rules are not beneficial 4 the remaining systems other than type i type ii and type iii systems where dlwl can be applied are denoted as type iv this main class contains five subclasses whose characteristics are stated as follows ‚ë† the standard net inflow m 0 44 indicates the scarcity of available water resources but the cv 0 60 indicates low inflow uncertainty ‚ë° the standard net inflow 0 44 m 0 98 indicates moderate water resources and the yield ratio yi 0 24 indicates a low level of water demand ‚ë¢ the standard net inflow 0 44 m 0 98 indicates moderate water resources the yield ratio yi 0 24 indicates a high level of water demand and the storage coefficient si 0 35 implies not small regulation capacity ‚ë£ the standard net inflow m 0 98 illustrates the abundance of water resources the yield ratio yi 0 24 indicates a low level of water demand and si 1 02 implies not huge regulation capacity ‚ë§ the standard net inflow m 0 98 illustrates the abundance of water resources the yield ratio yi 0 24 indicates a high level of water demand and 0 35 si 1 02 implies moderate regulation capacity 4 2 optimal dlwl for qing river reservoir the values of standard net inflow and storage coefficient in qing river reservoir are 0 6782 and 1 15 respectively and dlwl is applicable according to fig 6 first the seasonality of dlwl is identified with fisher s optimal partitioning algorithm considering both regional hydrometeorological conditions represented by monthly precipitation inflow and regulation influence represented by monthly reservoir water level and water demand the water year is divided into 5 periods rain season july august refill season september october dry season november april peak irrigation season may and irrigation season june then the seasonal dlwls are optimized and the pareto approximate set of solutions is shown in fig 7 the objectives are arranged to make the direction of preference upward and the utopia solution is a horizontal line at the top each line connecting the ten axes represents a solution and the spread of the lines represents the whole pareto frontier this figure indicates the following results 1 the maximum vulnerability of all the pareto approximate dlwl solutions meets designated requirements at the cost of lower water supply reliability but as shown in table 2 without dlwl i e under sop the maximum vulnerability for each water user does not meet requirements and the environmental water supply experiences a severe water shortage with a 29 13 maximum water shortage ratio so dlwl is effective in drought mitigation 2 tradeoffs between objectives are indicated by crossing lines for agriculture water users clear tradeoffs exist between reliability and vulnerability criteria relagr and vulagr 1 between reliability and mean resilience criteria relagr and resagr 2 and between mean resilience and vulnerability criteria resagr 2 and vulagr 1 a synergetic relationship exists between mean vulnerability and maximum vulnerability vulagr 1 and vulagr 2 the previous study zhang et al 2017 showed that reliability has a conflicting relationship with vulnerability criteria reliability has both a synergetic and conflicting relationship with mean resilience and mean resilience has both a synergetic and conflicting relationship with mean vulnerability in contrast to it the synergetic relationships between mean resilience and reliability between mean resilience and mean vulnerability criteria are not observed this is because the synergetic relationship between mean resilience and reliability exists when the value of reliability is small and the synergetic relationship between mean resilience and mean vulnerability exists when the value of vulnerability is large but this study adds constraints on the minimum of reliability and the maximum of vulnerability which makes solutions exhibiting those relationships infeasible for public water users there are no significant relationships between objectives the conflicting relationship between water users is reflected in tradeoffs between mean agriculture vulnerability and maximum public resilience vulagr 2 and respub 1 when there is a more severe agricultural water shortage more water is saved for the public water supply which contributes to a shorter time interval of public water shortage a typical solution with the maximum sum of agriculture reliability and public reliability and relatively small vulnerability is selected from fig 7 to further elaborate on the effect of dlwl the objectives are listed in table 2 as can be seen after being instructed by dlwl performance metrics other than agriculture reliability get better or remain the same it demonstrates that operation with dlwl effectively reduces the severity and duration of water shortages at the cost of more frequent water deficits the typical dlwl is the highest in may during the peak irrigation season fig 8 this is because increasing dlwl in a period increases the frequency of water supply restrictions when rationing factors are the same in each period curtailing the water supply in a period with high water demand helps to save more water than in periods with lower water demand thereby reducing the severity of water shortage to further understand the benefits of dlwl in guiding water supply we compare the water supply processes operated with and without dlwl during a multiyear drought event 2000 2003 fig 9 under the sop rule the available storage is fully exploited with a total storage depletion lasting for 5 month causing both agriculture supply and public supply to be cut off entirely in 2003 and even the entire agriculture cutback lasts for several consecutive months on the contrary the hedging rule with dlwl instructs the implementation of small restrictions on agriculture supply when the water level is lower than dlwl and this helps to maintain a reliable water supply to public water users as a consequence there is only one mild public water shortage and a less severe agricultural water shortage 4 3 impact of changing demand and supply conditions on the optimal dlwls climate change land use change growing population and developing economy are introducing deep uncertainties into water supply systems in terms of inflow conditions and water demands giuliani and castelletti 2016 herman et al 2014 for a rapidly evolving system optimal water supply policies developed upon the current condition may not be able to reduce water shortage risks efficiently in the future and need to be modified to inform the adaptive adjustment of dlwl to future scenarios we build different water supply scenarios by perturbing the qing river reservoir s characteristic parameters and investigating the impact of changing inflow conditions and water demands on the optimal seasonal dlwls first the reasonable range of inflow and demand characteristic parameters are determined to ensure the existence of optimal seasonal dwwls and dpwls under each scenario a reasonable scenario should be where the dlwl optimization model has feasible solutions and both dwwl and dpwl play a role in drought mitigation then the effect of each characteristic parameter is investigated individually we build different water supply scenarios within the reasonable range of the target parameter while keeping other parameters unchanged and optimize seasonal dlwls under each scenario finally we explore the relationship between changing characteristic parameters and optimal seasonal dlwls by regression analysis to reduce the burden of calculation water supply scenarios are firstly constructed with coarse discrete precision in the whole plausible ranges shown in table 1 after determining the reasonable ranges of the characteristic parameters the water supply scenarios are further constructed with finer discrete precision 4 3 1 reasonable range of the inflow and demand characteristic parameters the demand characteristic can be represented by the total water demand and the proportion of different water consumers i e the yield ratio and the public demand ratio in this study we build different water demand scenarios by discretizing the yield ratio with a precision of 0 05 and discretizing the public demand ratio with a precision of 0 2 since the mean annual inflow has already been reflected in the yield ratio we build different inflow scenarios by discretizing the coefficient of variation of annual inflows with a precision of 0 1 to eliminate the effect of uncertainty in synthetic streamflow generation 5 random runs are adopted for each variation coefficient we optimize dlwl under each inflow scenario and obtain the pareto approximate set by combining the best individuals across all optimizations with a nondominated sort for each scenario the dlwl optimization model in section 2 5 is implemented if there exist feasible dlwl solutions and both agriculture and public water demand cannot be met by 100 the value of characteristic parameters in this scenario belongs to the reasonable range otherwise the value of characteristic parameters in the scenario does not belong to the reasonable range when there is no feasible dlwl solution the scenario is considered to be extremely dry when the water supply reliabilities for all users can reach 100 the scenario is thought to have abundant water and both dwwl and dpwl are inoperative when only the public water supply reliability reaches 100 it demonstrates that dwwl is inoperative and only dpwl plays a role in drought mitigation fig 10 shows the recognized reasonable ranges for the inflow and demand characteristic parameters as shown in fig 9 a the yield ratio is only reasonable between 0 6 and 0 75 with different reasonable ranges of public demand ratio when the yield ratio is higher the corresponding reasonable demand ratio is lower it is because a higher value for both parameters implies higher water supply stress a higher yield ratio may be indicative of a larger water demand or smaller annual inflow a higher public demand ratio implies supplying more water to high requirement users which increases the overall water supply requirement when the yield ratio is smaller than 0 5 for all public demand ratios there is no water deficit in the scenario when the yield ratio is higher than 0 8 it is considered to be extremely dry regardless of public demand ratios it demonstrates that the yield ratio has a greater impact on water supply as shown in fig 9 b the coefficient of variation is only reasonable between 0 45 and 0 55 it owes to the fact that a lower value of the coefficient of variation indicates a lower uncertainty in inflow which makes water supply less stressful and is beneficial to meeting water demands 4 3 2 the impact of changing water demand on optimal dlwl 1 the impact of yield ratio on optimal dlwl the yield ratio is discretized in its reasonable range with a finer interval of 0 01 and the pareto approximate optimal seasonal dlwls under each scenario are displayed in fig 11 the black dashed lines show the fitted linear regression relationships between median dlwls of the pareto approximate set and the yield ratio the f test shows that these relationships are statistically significant at a 95 confidence level the t test shows that the estimated parameters are also statistically significant at a 95 confidence level as shown in fig 11 with a rising yield ratio both dwwls and dpwls in the peak irrigation season irrigation season and the rain season increase and both dwwls and dpwls in the dry season decrease the reason is that the water shortage tends to become more severe with an increasing yield ratio which indicates higher water supply stress to avoid the damaging severe water shortage dlwl needs to be raised to trigger more current water curtailment and reserve more water for the future and the increase of dlwl in the periods of high water demand including the peak irrigation season irrigation season and the rain season helps to reserve more water with the same number of curtailment events other than that the tradeoff relationships between the performance metrics intensify with higher water supply stress tang et al 2017 to reach a new balance between these metrics the dlwl in the dry season that influences supply policy for several months is decreased at the same time the slope of the regression line is significantly higher in the peak irrigation season than in other periods indicating that the dlwl in this period was the most sensitive to changes in yield ratio 2 the impact of public demand ratio on optimal dlwl the public demand ratio is discretized in its reasonable range with a finer interval of 0 05 and the pareto approximate optimal seasonal dlwls under each scenario are displayed in fig 12 as shown in the figure when the public demand ratio is 0 5 and agriculture water demand is dominant dwwl which triggers agriculture water demand restriction exhibits a significant trend with changing public demand ratio it increases with a rising public demand ratio during the peak irrigation season irrigation season and rain season meanwhile dpwl in these seasons increases with a rising public demand ratio for the entire reasonable range of the public demand ratio this is because public water supply has higher requirements on reliability and vulnerability a larger proportion of public water supply implies higher overall supply stress to meet water demands in the new stressful water supply situation dlwl needs to be increased to trigger more water curtailment and reserve more water for the future and increasing dlwl in periods of high water demand is more efficient to save water as illustrated in section 3 3 2 1 4 3 3 the impact of changing inflow conditions on optimal dlwl the coefficient of variation of annual inflows is discretized in its reasonable range with a finer interval of 0 03 and the pareto approximate optimal seasonal dlwls under each scenario are displayed in fig 13 as shown in the figure with a rising variation coefficient both dwwls and dpwls in the peak irrigation season irrigation season and the rain season increase while both dwwls and dpwls in the dry season decrease this is because a larger coefficient of variation indicates more uncertain inflow which makes water supply more stressful it is necessary to increase dlwl in high demand periods to save water efficiently and decrease dlwl in the dry season influences supply policy for longer periods to reach a new balance between performance metrics as illustrated in section 3 3 2 1 5 conclusion in this work we seek to investigate the characteristic of reservoir water supply systems that determine the role of hedging rules propose effective drought mitigation measures for systems where hedging rules are of trivial value and put forward the modification method of optimal hedging rules to adapt to changing water supply conditions for the systems where hedging is applicable to achieve this two experiments are conducted with a zone based hedging rule triggered by drought limited water level dlwl in the first experiment we systematically analyze the impact of dlwl on water supply performance with a range of hypothetical reservoirs and find that dlwl improves the vulnerability at the cost of worsening reliability and resilience for most systems combining this impact and the primary water supply requirement three types of reservoir water supply systems in which dlwl is not applicable are identified with a scenario discovery method type ‚Ö∞ and type ‚Ö± experience water deficits that cannot be relieved by dlwl type ‚Ö∞ is characterized by scarce water resources m 0 44 and high inflow uncertainty cv 0 60 for these systems measures such as inter basin water transfer rather than applying hedging rules should be adopted for drought mitigation type ‚Ö± is mainly characterized by the low reservoir regulation capacity si 0 35 for these systems measures such as reservoir expansion should be adopted type iii is characterized by the abundance of water resources m 0 98 and adequate regulation capacity si 1 02 where water demand can always be satisfied and hedging rules are unnecessary this result can be used to efficiently determine the applicability of hedging rules according to the value of reservoir characteristics parameters the second experiment is conducted for the reservoirs where dlwl is applicable for these reservoirs a multi objective dlwl optimization model considering the conflicts between several water users is established the comparison of water supply operation with and without optimal dlwl for qing river reservoir demonstrates the effectiveness of optimal dlwl in drought mitigation the effect of changing inflow conditions and water demand on optimal dlwls is investigated and the modification methods of seasonal dlwls are suggested for maintaining good water supply performance when water supply environment changes results show that 1 if system water supply stress increases with increasing total demand decreasing streamflow and higher streamflow uncertainty both dwwls and dpwls in periods of high water demand should be raised and both dwwls and dpwls in dry seasons influencing water supply decision for several months should be lowered 2 the yield ratio has a higher impact than the public demand ratio on water supply if water supply stress increases with an increasing public demand ratio dpwls in periods of high water demand should be raised but dwwls informing agriculture curtailment policy are only influenced when the public demand ratio is 0 5 and should be increased in periods with higher public demand these results have important implications for reservoir water supply systems to adapt to a changing world rather than conducting the complex optimization process again with the updated system characteristics a much simpler and less costly measure can be taken by modifying the previously determined optimal dlwl with the suggested method it is worth mentioning that the possible changes in future water supply scenarios could be more complex than that explored in this study several water supply factors may change at the same time thus the interactions between the different factors remain to be considered when studying the effect of changing water supply conditions and such analyses will be conducted in future work moreover the water supply performance of the hedging rule triggered by dlwl can be improved by the intelligent utilization of skillful hydrological forecasts and the operation of several connected reservoirs these remain topics for future research credit authorship contribution statement chengxin luo conceptualization methodology software data curation writing original draft bo xu

2288,the discharge of groundwater to the lake is a mixed process of two different kinds of water and the hydrochemical action at the contact interface of them may lead to the migration and transformation of carbon however the input of carbon from groundwater to surface water is usually measured by the product of dissolved carbon dc concentration and water volume at present and there are few reports on the physicochemical reactions in the mixing process in this paper taking daihai lake as an example the principle of mass conservation and hydrogeochemical simulation were used to construct the carbon balance equation of the groundwater and lake water mixing zone and the mechanism of carbon fixation and emission in the mixing process was analyzed the results show that the precipitation of calcium carbonate was the main hydrochemical reaction controlling the migration and transformation of dissolved inorganic carbon dic after mixing groundwater with alkaline lake water a large amount of hco3 in the lake was transformed into caco3 and co2 under the action of groundwater the total amount of dic discharged by groundwater to daihai lake was 770 t a due to the water chemical reaction at the interface between groundwater and lake water the carbon removed by caco3 precipitation and co2 emission was 645 t a respectively the mixture of the two kinds of water resulted in a net reduction of 520 t a of dic in daihai lake ca2 concentration in groundwater was the main factor affecting dic migration and transformation in the mixing process of the groundwater and lake water with the increase of ca2 concentration in groundwater more carbon in the form of hco3 would be separated from lake water this study has important significance for revealing the impact of groundwater on the lake carbon cycle and the role of groundwater in the global carbon cycle keywords groundwater carbon cycle dic lake carbon cycle mixed action data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the dc in terrestrial hydrological systems migrate and transform with environmental changes in hydrological cycles especially the water exchange process between different types of water such as groundwater recharge to surface water precipitation recharge to groundwater etc is often accompanied by significant carbon fixation or emission as an important part of inland waters lakes receive transform and release large amounts of terrestrial carbon c and thus play an important role in the carbon cycle at both regional and global scales li et al 2022 raymond et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 at present a large number of studies have been carried out on the carbon cycle in lakes from multiple perspectives such as biological effects seasonal changes climate lake hydrology inflow rivers lake water hydrochemistry and lake bottom sediments wang et al 2008 hillman et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 qi et al 2019 cole et al 2007 yang et al 2021 pacheco et al 2014 some research shows that the hydrological cycle and sediment characteristics of lakes have a close interaction with groundwater gibert et al 2002 branchu et al 2010 however many mechanisms of groundwater affecting lake carbon cycle have not been clarified generally the carbon in lakes mainly comes from the inflow of rivers groundwater precipitation microbial decomposition of lake sedimentary organic matter and the photosynthesis of aquatic organisms jin 2010 ni et al 2021 nydahl et al 2020 raymond et al 2000 the runoff discharge of groundwater under natural conditions can be used as a hidden way to transport dic and dissolved organic carbon doc to inland and lake water lupon et al 2019 there are generally three migration and transformation ways of dic with groundwater entering lakes i exist in the lake water in the form of dic cai et al 2003 ii precipitate into sediments in the form of carbonate or enter the atmosphere in the form of co2 einarsdottir et al 2017 vinnarasi et al 2021 iii convert into organic carbon and becomes a part of organisms berggren et al 2010 talling 2006 groundwater runoff discharge to the lake is first mixed with the lake water due to the differences in ph ion concentration temperature and partial pressure of gas between the two kinds of water new water with different chemical characteristics will be produced after mixing hagerthey and kerfoot 1998 which may be accompanied by hydrochemical reactions affecting the transformation of carbon forms chaplot and mutema 2021 at the same time the mixing ratio of groundwater and lake water also affects the chemical characteristics of mixed water and then affects the carbon cycle of lake water katz and bullen 1996 groundwater seepage is slow and its physicochemical reaction in the process of recharging to the lake mainly occurs at the interface between the lake water and the aquifer exposed by groundwater in this contact zone the carbon transported by groundwater to the lake may be fixed and emitted therefore revealing the physical and chemical effects related to carbon in the groundwater lake water mixed zone the groundwater lake contact interface is of great significance to deeply understand the influence of groundwater on the lake carbon cycle daiha lake is a typical small with an area of less than 100 km2 alkaline lake in the semi arid area of northern china taking daihai lake as an example this paper constructs a mass balance and migration transformation model of carbon in the mixed zone of groundwater and lake and analyzes the carbon morphological transformation induced in the process of groundwater discharge to the lake so as to reveal the influence mechanism of groundwater on the carbon cycle of the lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the study area daihai basin 112 21 e 112 54 e 40 11 n 40 50 n is located in wulanchabu city inner mongolia china with area of 2313 km2 this area has a mid temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 395 mm and annual average evaporation of 1820 mm which measured by the evaporation pan with 20 cm in diameter zhang et al 2021 the general terrain trend of the daihai basin is surrounded by mountains the middle is an alluvial plain and lacustrine plain and the elevation is 1210 m 1293 m fig 1 daihai lake is the lowest terrain in the region according to the sedimentary core the silt layer in daihai lake basin is generally characterized by a thick lake center more than 10 m and a thin lake shore less than 30 cm wang et al 1990 cao et al 2000 sun and xiao 2006 sediment lithology in the deep water area of the daihai lake is mainly silt and silty fine sand one of the factors affecting the grain size is the strength of hydrodynamic transport conditions sun et al 2001 the sedimentary carbonates in deep water area are mainly authigenic carbonates produced by chemical and biological processes of lakes and their formation is closely related to the temperature with the increase of temperature evaporation is enhanced carbonate solubility decreases which is conducive to the formation of carbonate precipitation chen et al 2013 in recent years the water surface elevation is about 1219 m the area is about 56 km2 and the deepest part of the lake is 9 2 m the recharge sources of daihai lake are mainly precipitation groundwater and surface rivers seasonal rivers such as buliang river no 5 river and tianchenggou river and evaporation is the only discharge route fractured aquifer systems are mainly distributed in the eastern northern and western mountainous areas of daihai basin and the lithology is mainly archean gneiss the southern basalt platform is mainly distributed with hole fissure aquifer system which is covered on the cretaceous and archean strata in a surface shape with great differences in water yield and poor groundwater connectivity the pore aquifer system is distributed from the periphery of daihai lake to the piedmont which is a water bearing rock formation formed by the interbedding of sand gravel and cohesive soil the main recharge ways of groundwater in the area are precipitation infiltration piedmont lateral recharge and gully recharge in wet periods the main discharge ways of groundwater are evaporation and pumping wang 2021 2 2 sample collection twelve groundwater sampling points and twelve lake water sampling points were set up in daihai basin in august 2019 to better understand the exchange relationship between groundwater and lake the selected groundwater sampling wells were as close to the lake as possible 20 350 m away from the lake and the surface water was collected at the edge of the lake corresponding to the groundwater sampling point fig 1 groundwater samples were collected by a sampling pump and the depths of monitoring wells ranged between 5 and 10 m pump water continuously until the readings of various parameters of groundwater are stable and then collect water samples and use water samples to clean the pre sterilized polyethylene bottles after sampling the water samples were filtered with 0 45 Œºm filter membranes and put into pre sterilized and sterilized 5l polyethylene bottles lake water samples were collected using 5l polyethylene bottles that were pre rinsed three times with raw lake water the collection and analysis methods of groundwater samples adopted the specific methods in technical specifications for environmental monitoring of groundwater of the ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china promulgated in 2004 gps was used to locate the location of sampling points lake water samples were collected at 2 m below the lake surface the temperature ph eh and ec values of water samples were monitored on site by portable instruments multy8330 ponsel odeon france all samples were stored at 4 c before the analysis and were analyzed within 4 days in the laboratory tds total dissolved solid was measured by gravimetric method soluble metals ca2 mg2 na and k in water samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp oes optima7000dv perkinelmer usa soluble anions such as cl and so4 2 were analyzed through ion chromatography metrohm 761 813 hco3 and co3 2 were determined by acid base indicator titration the analytical accuracy was 0 01 mg l for major cations and anions and the measured data were tested by the cation anion balance method which the relative error was within 5 indicating that the measured data were reliable 2 3 the balance model of carbon mass generally the carbon in groundwater is mainly dic and the content of organic carbon is very low heine and einsiedl 2021 dong et al 2022a feng et al 2023 therefore this study mainly discusses the migration and transformation of the inorganic carbon groundwater immediately mixes with some lake water after entering the lake in this mixing process the amount of dic converted into organic carbon is very small karolina et al 2017 the migration and transformation reactions of dic in mixed zone include i it still exists in the form of dic ii co2 is absorbed by water or emit to the atmosphere iii form carbonate precipitation fig 2 according to the law of conservation of mass the mass variation of carbon in lake water due to recharge from groundwater to lake is formula 1 m m1 m2 m3 1 where m is the change of carbon in the lake water caused by groundwater recharge kg m1 is the total mass of dic transferred from groundwater to lake kg m2 is the mass of carbon absorption or emission in the form of co2 in the mixed zone absorption is represented as and emission as kg m3 is the carbon amount of carbonate precipitation leaving the water in the mixed area kg among them the carbon in m2 and m3 may come from groundwater or the original lake water in the calculation of carbon mass balance the contents of hco3 h2co3 and co3 2 in groundwater are firstly monitored and then dic is calculated the mass balance equation of carbon in the mixed area is m qf m2 m3 2 q is the amount of groundwater recharge to the lake m3 f is the dic concentration in groundwater recharged to the lake kg m3 when the groundwater flows slowly into the lake it first mixes with the lake in contact with the rock wall the mixed water continues to mix with other water in lakes therefore in large lakes the change of groundwater seepage recharge on water quality of lakes is slow shaw et al 2013 in this study it is considered that the groundwater is mixed with the lake water at the time of exposure from the rock wall or lake bottom and then the hydrochemical reaction occurs if the effective porosity of the aquifer is assumed to be n the mixing ratio of groundwater and water on the rock wall per unit area where the water bearing medium contacts the lake water is n 1 fig 3 the main chemical reaction related to carbon due to groundwater discharge to alkaline lake is carbonate precipitation in the mixed zone formula 3 4 5 the ratio of carbon emission co2 and precipitation mg co3 caco3 or camg co3 2 by these reactions is 1 1 thus m2 m3 in formula 1 ca2 2hco3 caco3 co2 h2o 3 mg2 2hco3 mgco3 co2 h2o 4 ca2 mg2 4hco3 camg co3 2 2co2 h2o 5 according to the mixed ratio of groundwater and lake water is n 1 then the total volume of mixed water produced by mixing q volume groundwater and lake water is 1 1 n q if the amount of carbon emission by carbonate precipitation per unit volume of water in the mixed zone is s kg m3 then m2 m3 1 1 n qs 6 and the equation 1 can be rewritten as m qc 2 1 1 n qs 7 the s can be calculated by mix module in phreeqc phreeqc is a computer software developed by the united states geological survey usgs to calculate various low temperature hydrogeochemical reactions it is a computer program written in c language which can carry out forward simulation and reverse simulation the mix module is used for mixing two or more aqueous solutions and calculating the chemical component content of the resulting solution in this study the mix module in phreeqc was used to simulate the impact of minerals in mixed water on lake water when they reach equilibrium the concentration of mg2 in daihai lake water is much higher than that of ca2 it indicates that the lake is still in the stage of mg2 accumulation and caco3 supersaturation according to cao jianting s research cao et al 2000 on the sediments of daihai lake the carbonate in the sediments 0 28 cm at the bottom of the lake is microcrystalline calcite and cryptocrystalline calcite 28 48 cm is microcrystalline calcite cryptocrystalline calcite and aggregate granular carbonate phreeqc analysis shows that the mixing of groundwater and daihai lake water also mainly produces calcium carbonate precipitation therefore in equilibrium phases only the pure phase state was defined as calcite and the mineral was set to be saturated according to the lithologic characteristics of aquifer and porosity the porosity of aquifer near lake in this area is about 0 2 thus the mixed ratio of groundwater and lake water was set as 1 5 according to the carbon balance equation equation 7 of the mixed zone of groundwater and lake water the change of groundwater recharge to the lake has a great impact on the calculation result m groundwater recharge to lakes is affected by many factors such as seasonal changes and human activities therefore long time series water level observation is an important means to obtain accurate flow in the calculation based on year the model accuracy can be effectively improved by using multiple periods of abundant water season normal water season and low water season for flow calculation 3 result 3 1 chemical characteristics of groundwater and lake water from the statistical results of water quality monitoring indicators the average ph value of daihai lake water is 9 01 and the tds is 11305 12321 mg l therefore it belongs to an alkaline salt water lake the main cations in lake water are na and mg2 and the main anions are cl and hco3 the concentration of ca2 in the lake water is much lower than that of mg2 it indicates that it is in the stage of calcite supersaturation and mg2 accumulation the standard deviation of monitoring indicators and the piper diagram show that the water quality of daihai lake is relatively uniform table 1 fig 4 the average ph of groundwater is 7 89 which is obviously lower than that of lake water the average concentration of ca2 in groundwater is 59 8 mg l which is higher than 21 6 mg l in lake water the average mg2 concentration is 22 6 mg l which is far lower than 264 3 mg l of the lake from the piper diagram groundwater in most areas is hco3 ca2 type while lake water is cl na type fig 4 therefore the discharge of groundwater to daihai lake is a mixture of two different chemical types of water 3 2 migration and transformation of carbon after mixing groundwater and lake water 3 2 1 water balance of daihai lake daihai lake is a typical closed lake the recharge items of daihai mainly include atmospheric precipitation surface runoff ecological water supplement and groundwater recharge the discharge items mainly includes evaporation and human activities in recent years affected by extreme climate the icebound period of daihai lake is as long as six months in a year during which the evaporation of daihai lake is very small 17 30 mm per month on average the average annual evaporation is about 650 mm the lake surface evaporation in the water discharge item of daihai is about 36 40 106m3 a daihai lake water used by human is 8 96 106m3 a the precipitation supplement is 22 12 106m3 a ecological water supplement is 3 50 106m3 a surface runoff inflow 5 50 106m3 a so according to the principle of water balance the groundwater discharge to daihai lake is about 14 24 106m3 a this value is consistent with the calculation result of darcy s law and has been confirmed in the research results of other scholars wang 2021 the section map of groundwater flow path and sampling points is shown in fig 5 the equation 8 for calculating the annual recharge of groundwater to the lake in each section with darcy s law is as follows q kibl 8 q is the amount of groundwater recharge to the lake m3 k is the permeability coefficient of aquifer m d i is hydraulic gradient l is the length of overflow section m b is the thickness of aquifer m the values of specific parameters are shown in table 2 3 2 2 the amount of dic caco3 and co2 according to the hydrochemical characteristics of the lake water and groundwater the main reaction related to carbon after mixing was mainly caco3 precipitation the model calculated the amount of carbon migration and transformation in water after mixing 1 l of groundwater with 5 l of lake water table 3 as shown in table 3 the dic recharged by groundwater to lake water in other sections is less than the carbon discharged by caco3 and co2 after mixing the two kinds of water except for section d11 in other words the dic in daihai lake decreased due to the recharge of groundwater in most sections darcy s law was used to calculate the annual recharge of groundwater to the lake in each section then the dic discharge from groundwater to the lake caco3 and co2 generated by the mixed liquid were calculated table 4 according to the calculation results the amount of groundwater recharge to daihai is about 1 4 1010l a 1400 104m3 a and the dic discharged to daihai is 6 4 107 mol a 770 t a caco3 precipitated by chemical reaction is 5 4 107 mol a 5400 t a and co2 emission is 5 4 107 mol a 2376 t a both of them remove 645 tons of dic from water per year the net reduction of dic in daihai due to the mixing of two kinds of water is 4 4 107mol a 520 t a 4 discussion 4 1 effects of groundwater and lake water quality characteristics on the lake carbon cycle although lakes continuously emit co2 into the atmosphere through the water air interface the carbon deposition in lakes is also an important part of the earth s carbon sink wang et al 2021 tranvik et al 2009 xu and xu 2018 in the majority of lakes dic loading is the decisive factor of co2 fluxes across the air water interface of lake sun et al 2021 li et al 2022 the formation of endogenous organic carbon and the deposition and dissolution of inorganic carbon akhtar et al 2021 maavara et al 2020 the discharge of groundwater to lake are usually the mixing process between two different kinds of water and the migration and transformation of dic caused by this is mainly controlled by the dissolution precipitation balance of carbonate rock the temperature ph and the concentration of ca2 mg2 and hco3 of groundwater and lake water may have a significant effect on the migration and transformation of dic in mixed water the model is used to analyze the carbon fixation or emission caused by the changes of ph temperature and ca2 mg2 hco3 concentration the results show table 5 when the ph of the lake increases or decreases by 0 1 the precipitation of caco3 in the mixed water increases by 0 97 or decreases by 1 31 with the global climate change the lake temperature will change by a large margin when the temperature of the lake water increases or decreases by 2 the precipitation of caco3 in the mixed water increases by 0 30 or decreases by 0 36 when the temperature of the lake water increases or decreases by 3 the precipitation of caco3 in the mixed water increases by 0 44 or decreases by 0 54 when the concentration of ca2 in groundwater increases or decreases by 5 the precipitation of caco3 in the mixed water increases by 1 85 or decreases by 1 85 when the concentration of mg2 and hco3 in groundwater increases or decreases by 5 respectively it has no effect on the dissolution and precipitation of carbonate rock the analysis shows that the ph and the concentration of mg2 and hco3 in the alkaline lake are high and the concentration of ca2 is low therefore the change of ca2 concentration in groundwater has the most significant impact on the transformation of carbon in mixed water the higher ca2 concentration in groundwater the more carbon in the lake will precipitate in the form of carbonate and emit in the form of co2 the discharge of inland lake is mainly evaporation which is an alkaline salt lake with low ca2 content dehbandi et al 2019 butturini et al 2020 chen et al 2020 ph can change the physical and chemical environment of water and play an important role in regulating the dynamic balance and distribution of the carbonate system in water when the ph of groundwater is lower than that of lake water and the ca2 is opposite caco3 precipitation is easy to occur when groundwater recharges lakes yang et al 2021 in the daihai basin groundwater is discharged into the lake water with high tds strong alkalinity low concentration of ca2 high concentration of mg2 and hco3 after two different kinds of water are mixed it is equivalent to adding more ca2 to the water that is already in calcite supersaturation and the precipitation reaction will occur resulting in the migration and transformation of dic in the lake water the temperature of lake not only affects the dissolution precipitation of carbonate rocks in the mixing process of groundwater and lake water but also affects the migration of co2 generated by reaction in water the solubility of co2 in water is obviously affected by temperature and it decreases as the temperature increases generally fan et al 2011 when the mixing of groundwater and surface water changes the temperature of local lake water the dissolution or emission of co2 in the mixing zone will change xiao et al 2014 some studies have pointed out the co2 emission of surface water in summer will be higher than that in winter akhtar et al 2021 raymond and cole 2001 when the temperature of the lake water is low the ph is high which will increase the co2 absorption capacity wu et al 2014 therefore the temperature can change the ph of water by affecting the activity of h thereby driving the absorption and release of co2 yang et al 2021 in addition the cold environment is conducive to the preservation of organic carbon in the sediments of high latitude lakes while the warm inland waters show strong organic degradation and enhance carbon emissions marotta et al 2014 4 2 influence of biogeochemistry at the groundwater lake water contact interface on the lake carbon cycle generally the seepage of groundwater is slow sadat noori et al 2021 dong et al 2022b it cannot go deep into the lake area and fully mix with the lake water like surface water carlson mazur et al 2019 so the influence area of groundwater on the lake carbon cycle is mainly distributed in the contact zone between the lake water and the rock wall including the lake bottom the groundwater lake contact interface is usually considered as a confluence zone of shallow and deep groundwater where groundwater from different sources mixes near the lake shore karan et al 2014 the difference in groundwater and lake water quality in this zone triggers hydrogeochemical effect that will lead to carbon fixation and emission shapley et al 2005 its rate of carbon migration and transformation is more stable due to the slow groundwater flow rate and the stability of recharge the infiltration rate of groundwater into lakes depends on the water level difference between the two water bodies kidmose et al 2011 norrstr√∂m and jacks 1996 permeability of aquifer schneider et al 2005 norrstr√∂m and jacks 1996 and other factors when identifying the amount of carbon input from groundwater to lakes the carbon loading input from groundwater to lakes is determined by factors such as groundwater discharge intensity dissolved inorganic organic carbon concentration and lake sediment characteristics wang et al 2021 in particular there are often significant geochemical gradients temperature dissolved oxygen organic matter etc at the contact interface between two chemical types of water bodies driving complex biogeochemical processes have a significant impact on the carbon cycle of lakes wang et al 2022 when the groundwater lake interface is gravel layer and the groundwater flow rate is fast dic will enter the lake directly with the groundwater crossing the interface with the acceleration of groundwater flow rate the dic entering the lake per unit time is also increasing herczeg et al 2003 at the same time the groundwater lake interface is aerobic doc will be directly input into the lake through groundwater that will promote carbon respiration in the lake system maher et al 2015 and accelerate the emission of co2 from the lake when the sludge layer in the lake is thick the flow rate of groundwater through the sludge is affected the lake sediment has more inorganic carbon and rich microorganisms which is the boundary of aerobic and anaerobic with strong mineralization and complex material exchange and property changes yang 2020 on the one hand groundwater carries dic and penetrates the silt layer into the lake or dissolves carbonate minerals in sediments into the lake increasing the concentration of dic in the lake appelo and postma 2004 on the other hand the lower sediments in the lake are anoxic groundwater carried doc undergoes anaerobic biodegradation of organic carbon when it passes through the sediment water interface thus releasing co2 into the lake marotta et al 2014 groundwater is one of the main recharge sources of daihai lake after entering the lake groundwater only reacts with the water at the edge of the lake resulting in caco3 precipitation and co2 overflow therefore for small alkaline lakes the migration and transformation of carbon produced by dic recharged by groundwater mainly occurs at the contact interface between groundwater and lake water the interaction between sediment and water on the groundwater lake interface and microbial activity will have an impact on the migration and transformation of carbon especially when the silt is thick the impact on the transformation of dic in groundwater is more obvious liu et al 2017 small lakes such as daihai are widely distributed in the world they are embedded in the terrestrial ecosystem and the ecological environment load is small making the lake carbon cycle system more sensitive to changes in groundwater organic carbon inorganic carbon etc input into the basin marsay et al 2015 these replenishments not only directly increase the exogenous carbon input in the lake carbon pool but also aggravate the eutrophication of the lake and the algae bloom caused by it and also increase the generation of endogenous carbon galy et al 2015 moreover the ratio of sediment to water in small shallow lakes is larger than that in large lakes and sediments in small lakes form a huge carbon pool yu et al 2022 a study in finland concluded that the carbon pool 19 kg c m2 contained in lake sediments is larger than that in forests 7 2 kg c m2 for soil and 3 4 kg c m2 for trees carbon transport and transformation in small lake sediments are more sensitive to external input or response kortelainen et al 2004 therefore the role of small lakes widely distributed in regulating global carbon cycle and climate change cannot be underestimated 4 3 influence of lake hydrodynamic conditions on carbon migration and transformation between groundwater and lake lake hydrodynamic conditions affect the characteristics of lake water quality in the contact zone between lake and groundwater it will affect the physicochemical reaction in the mixing of groundwater and lake water and then affect the lake carbon cycle if the hydrodynamic conditions of the lake are poor the water quality of the lake at the groundwater lake contact interface will be obviously affected by the groundwater quality so that their water quality convergence and the hydrochemical reaction will slow down if the hydrodynamic conditions of the lake are good the water quality of the lake at the groundwater lake contact interface will be continuously updated and the hydrochemical reaction will remain stable in large lakes thermal stratification often occurs in lakes due to the poor hydrodynamic conditions wang et al 2019 andrade et al 2021 the separation of surface and lower limnology caused by thermal stratification is one of the most critical physical processes to control lake carbon flux lin et al 2021 √•berg et al 2010 andersen et al 2019 when the stratification of the lake occurs the carbon including the co2 generated by the reaction from the groundwater entering the lake at the contact interface will also enter the upper or lower layer respectively the carbon discharged above the thermocline will increase the emission of co2 and the carbon under the thermocline will be stored in water typically the stratification of lakes is obvious from spring to summer stratification inhibits the vertical mixing of dic between the upper and lower layers lin et al 2022 the photosynthesis will significantly reduce pco2 in surface lakes during the day lin et al 2021 andersen et al 2019 resulting in lower dic levels on the surface of lakes and a large amount of dic stored in the lower layer in autumn and winter the solar radiation is weakened and the monsoon is enhanced so that the lake is well mixed at this time no stratification occurs in the lake the carbon entering the lake from the contact interface of groundwater is evenly distributed in the water body due to vertical mixing and participates in the carbon cycle of the lake lin et al 2021 li et al 2016 li s research cdom chromophoric dissolved organic matter spm suspended particular matter chl a tn tp no3 n nh3 n codmn from daihai lake water showed better hydrodynamic conditions in summer and autumn lake water was mixed well under wind force and solute distribution in water was uniform li 2021 therefore the good hydrodynamic conditions of daihai lake keep the water body on the contact interface between the lake water and groundwater in a state of continuous renewal and the hydrochemical reaction in the mixing process of groundwater and lake water can remain stable at the same time homogeneous lake water is also conducive to the emission of co2 generated in the mixing process to the atmosphere and then affect the carbon cycle in the lake 5 conclusion the water quality hydrodynamic conditions and sediment characteristics of lakes are the key factors affecting the migration and transformation of carbon in the process of groundwater discharge to lakes the discharge of groundwater to alkaline lakes is a mixture of two different water in which carbon fixation and emission is easy to occur the mass conservation principle and hydrogeochemical model were applied to construct a carbon balance equation for the groundwater lake water mixing zone and calculate the migration transformation of carbon occurring during the recharge of groundwater to daihai lake the results show that the annual recharge of groundwater to daihai lake is 1400 104m3 and the discharged dic is 770 t a the chemical action in the mixing zone produces caco3 precipitation of 5400 t a and co2 emission of 2376 t a the total amount of dic removed from the water is 1290 t a the mixing of the two kinds of water makes the net reduction of dic in daihai lake 520 t a ca2 concentration in groundwater is a key ion affecting the carbon cycle in lakes and as ca2 concentration in groundwater increases more carbon in lakes in the form of hco3 will leave the water in the form of caco3 or co2 the contact interface between groundwater and lake water is an important area affecting the lake carbon cycle revealing the migration and transformation mechanism of carbon on this interface is of great significance to study the impact of groundwater lake system on the global carbon cycle credit authorship contribution statement

2288,the discharge of groundwater to the lake is a mixed process of two different kinds of water and the hydrochemical action at the contact interface of them may lead to the migration and transformation of carbon however the input of carbon from groundwater to surface water is usually measured by the product of dissolved carbon dc concentration and water volume at present and there are few reports on the physicochemical reactions in the mixing process in this paper taking daihai lake as an example the principle of mass conservation and hydrogeochemical simulation were used to construct the carbon balance equation of the groundwater and lake water mixing zone and the mechanism of carbon fixation and emission in the mixing process was analyzed the results show that the precipitation of calcium carbonate was the main hydrochemical reaction controlling the migration and transformation of dissolved inorganic carbon dic after mixing groundwater with alkaline lake water a large amount of hco3 in the lake was transformed into caco3 and co2 under the action of groundwater the total amount of dic discharged by groundwater to daihai lake was 770 t a due to the water chemical reaction at the interface between groundwater and lake water the carbon removed by caco3 precipitation and co2 emission was 645 t a respectively the mixture of the two kinds of water resulted in a net reduction of 520 t a of dic in daihai lake ca2 concentration in groundwater was the main factor affecting dic migration and transformation in the mixing process of the groundwater and lake water with the increase of ca2 concentration in groundwater more carbon in the form of hco3 would be separated from lake water this study has important significance for revealing the impact of groundwater on the lake carbon cycle and the role of groundwater in the global carbon cycle keywords groundwater carbon cycle dic lake carbon cycle mixed action data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the dc in terrestrial hydrological systems migrate and transform with environmental changes in hydrological cycles especially the water exchange process between different types of water such as groundwater recharge to surface water precipitation recharge to groundwater etc is often accompanied by significant carbon fixation or emission as an important part of inland waters lakes receive transform and release large amounts of terrestrial carbon c and thus play an important role in the carbon cycle at both regional and global scales li et al 2022 raymond et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 at present a large number of studies have been carried out on the carbon cycle in lakes from multiple perspectives such as biological effects seasonal changes climate lake hydrology inflow rivers lake water hydrochemistry and lake bottom sediments wang et al 2008 hillman et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 qi et al 2019 cole et al 2007 yang et al 2021 pacheco et al 2014 some research shows that the hydrological cycle and sediment characteristics of lakes have a close interaction with groundwater gibert et al 2002 branchu et al 2010 however many mechanisms of groundwater affecting lake carbon cycle have not been clarified generally the carbon in lakes mainly comes from the inflow of rivers groundwater precipitation microbial decomposition of lake sedimentary organic matter and the photosynthesis of aquatic organisms jin 2010 ni et al 2021 nydahl et al 2020 raymond et al 2000 the runoff discharge of groundwater under natural conditions can be used as a hidden way to transport dic and dissolved organic carbon doc to inland and lake water lupon et al 2019 there are generally three migration and transformation ways of dic with groundwater entering lakes i exist in the lake water in the form of dic cai et al 2003 ii precipitate into sediments in the form of carbonate or enter the atmosphere in the form of co2 einarsdottir et al 2017 vinnarasi et al 2021 iii convert into organic carbon and becomes a part of organisms berggren et al 2010 talling 2006 groundwater runoff discharge to the lake is first mixed with the lake water due to the differences in ph ion concentration temperature and partial pressure of gas between the two kinds of water new water with different chemical characteristics will be produced after mixing hagerthey and kerfoot 1998 which may be accompanied by hydrochemical reactions affecting the transformation of carbon forms chaplot and mutema 2021 at the same time the mixing ratio of groundwater and lake water also affects the chemical characteristics of mixed water and then affects the carbon cycle of lake water katz and bullen 1996 groundwater seepage is slow and its physicochemical reaction in the process of recharging to the lake mainly occurs at the interface between the lake water and the aquifer exposed by groundwater in this contact zone the carbon transported by groundwater to the lake may be fixed and emitted therefore revealing the physical and chemical effects related to carbon in the groundwater lake water mixed zone the groundwater lake contact interface is of great significance to deeply understand the influence of groundwater on the lake carbon cycle daiha lake is a typical small with an area of less than 100 km2 alkaline lake in the semi arid area of northern china taking daihai lake as an example this paper constructs a mass balance and migration transformation model of carbon in the mixed zone of groundwater and lake and analyzes the carbon morphological transformation induced in the process of groundwater discharge to the lake so as to reveal the influence mechanism of groundwater on the carbon cycle of the lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the study area daihai basin 112 21 e 112 54 e 40 11 n 40 50 n is located in wulanchabu city inner mongolia china with area of 2313 km2 this area has a mid temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 395 mm and annual average evaporation of 1820 mm which measured by the evaporation pan with 20 cm in diameter zhang et al 2021 the general terrain trend of the daihai basin is surrounded by mountains the middle is an alluvial plain and lacustrine plain and the elevation is 1210 m 1293 m fig 1 daihai lake is the lowest terrain in the region according to the sedimentary core the silt layer in daihai lake basin is generally characterized by a thick lake center more than 10 m and a thin lake shore less than 30 cm wang et al 1990 cao et al 2000 sun and xiao 2006 sediment lithology in the deep water area of the daihai lake is mainly silt and silty fine sand one of the factors affecting the grain size is the strength of hydrodynamic transport conditions sun et al 2001 the sedimentary carbonates in deep water area are mainly authigenic carbonates produced by chemical and biological processes of lakes and their formation is closely related to the temperature with the increase of temperature evaporation is enhanced carbonate solubility decreases which is conducive to the formation of carbonate precipitation chen et al 2013 in recent years the water surface elevation is about 1219 m the area is about 56 km2 and the deepest part of the lake is 9 2 m the recharge sources of daihai lake are mainly precipitation groundwater and surface rivers seasonal rivers such as buliang river no 5 river and tianchenggou river and evaporation is the only discharge route fractured aquifer systems are mainly distributed in the eastern northern and western mountainous areas of daihai basin and the lithology is mainly archean gneiss the southern basalt platform is mainly distributed with hole fissure aquifer system which is covered on the cretaceous and archean strata in a surface shape with great differences in water yield and poor groundwater connectivity the pore aquifer system is distributed from the periphery of daihai lake to the piedmont which is a water bearing rock formation formed by the interbedding of sand gravel and cohesive soil the main recharge ways of groundwater in the area are precipitation infiltration piedmont lateral recharge and gully recharge in wet periods the main discharge ways of groundwater are evaporation and pumping wang 2021 2 2 sample collection twelve groundwater sampling points and twelve lake water sampling points were set up in daihai basin in august 2019 to better understand the exchange relationship between groundwater and lake the selected groundwater sampling wells were as close to the lake as possible 20 350 m away from the lake and the surface water was collected at the edge of the lake corresponding to the groundwater sampling point fig 1 groundwater samples were collected by a sampling pump and the depths of monitoring wells ranged between 5 and 10 m pump water continuously until the readings of various parameters of groundwater are stable and then collect water samples and use water samples to clean the pre sterilized polyethylene bottles after sampling the water samples were filtered with 0 45 Œºm filter membranes and put into pre sterilized and sterilized 5l polyethylene bottles lake water samples were collected using 5l polyethylene bottles that were pre rinsed three times with raw lake water the collection and analysis methods of groundwater samples adopted the specific methods in technical specifications for environmental monitoring of groundwater of the ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china promulgated in 2004 gps was used to locate the location of sampling points lake water samples were collected at 2 m below the lake surface the temperature ph eh and ec values of water samples were monitored on site by portable instruments multy8330 ponsel odeon france all samples were stored at 4 c before the analysis and were analyzed within 4 days in the laboratory tds total dissolved solid was measured by gravimetric method soluble metals ca2 mg2 na and k in water samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp oes optima7000dv perkinelmer usa soluble anions such as cl and so4 2 were analyzed through ion chromatography metrohm 761 813 hco3 and co3 2 were determined by acid base indicator titration the analytical accuracy was 0 01 mg l for major cations and anions and the measured data were tested by the cation anion balance method which the relative error was within 5 indicating that the measured data were reliable 2 3 the balance model of carbon mass generally the carbon in groundwater is mainly dic and the content of organic carbon is very low heine and einsiedl 2021 dong et al 2022a feng et al 2023 therefore this study mainly discusses the migration and transformation of the inorganic carbon groundwater immediately mixes with some lake water after entering the lake in this mixing process the amount of dic converted into organic carbon is very small karolina et al 2017 the migration and transformation reactions of dic in mixed zone include i it still exists in the form of dic ii co2 is absorbed by water or emit to the atmosphere iii form carbonate precipitation fig 2 according to the law of conservation of mass the mass variation of carbon in lake water due to recharge from groundwater to lake is formula 1 m m1 m2 m3 1 where m is the change of carbon in the lake water caused by groundwater recharge kg m1 is the total mass of dic transferred from groundwater to lake kg m2 is the mass of carbon absorption or emission in the form of co2 in the mixed zone absorption is represented as and emission as kg m3 is the carbon amount of carbonate precipitation leaving the water in the mixed area kg among them the carbon in m2 and m3 may come from groundwater or the original lake water in the calculation of carbon mass balance the contents of hco3 h2co3 and co3 2 in groundwater are firstly monitored and then dic is calculated the mass balance equation of carbon in the mixed area is m qf m2 m3 2 q is the amount of groundwater recharge to the lake m3 f is the dic concentration in groundwater recharged to the lake kg m3 when the groundwater flows slowly into the lake it first mixes with the lake in contact with the rock wall the mixed water continues to mix with other water in lakes therefore in large lakes the change of groundwater seepage recharge on water quality of lakes is slow shaw et al 2013 in this study it is considered that the groundwater is mixed with the lake water at the time of exposure from the rock wall or lake bottom and then the hydrochemical reaction occurs if the effective porosity of the aquifer is assumed to be n the mixing ratio of groundwater and water on the rock wall per unit area where the water bearing medium contacts the lake water is n 1 fig 3 the main chemical reaction related to carbon due to groundwater discharge to alkaline lake is carbonate precipitation in the mixed zone formula 3 4 5 the ratio of carbon emission co2 and precipitation mg co3 caco3 or camg co3 2 by these reactions is 1 1 thus m2 m3 in formula 1 ca2 2hco3 caco3 co2 h2o 3 mg2 2hco3 mgco3 co2 h2o 4 ca2 mg2 4hco3 camg co3 2 2co2 h2o 5 according to the mixed ratio of groundwater and lake water is n 1 then the total volume of mixed water produced by mixing q volume groundwater and lake water is 1 1 n q if the amount of carbon emission by carbonate precipitation per unit volume of water in the mixed zone is s kg m3 then m2 m3 1 1 n qs 6 and the equation 1 can be rewritten as m qc 2 1 1 n qs 7 the s can be calculated by mix module in phreeqc phreeqc is a computer software developed by the united states geological survey usgs to calculate various low temperature hydrogeochemical reactions it is a computer program written in c language which can carry out forward simulation and reverse simulation the mix module is used for mixing two or more aqueous solutions and calculating the chemical component content of the resulting solution in this study the mix module in phreeqc was used to simulate the impact of minerals in mixed water on lake water when they reach equilibrium the concentration of mg2 in daihai lake water is much higher than that of ca2 it indicates that the lake is still in the stage of mg2 accumulation and caco3 supersaturation according to cao jianting s research cao et al 2000 on the sediments of daihai lake the carbonate in the sediments 0 28 cm at the bottom of the lake is microcrystalline calcite and cryptocrystalline calcite 28 48 cm is microcrystalline calcite cryptocrystalline calcite and aggregate granular carbonate phreeqc analysis shows that the mixing of groundwater and daihai lake water also mainly produces calcium carbonate precipitation therefore in equilibrium phases only the pure phase state was defined as calcite and the mineral was set to be saturated according to the lithologic characteristics of aquifer and porosity the porosity of aquifer near lake in this area is about 0 2 thus the mixed ratio of groundwater and lake water was set as 1 5 according to the carbon balance equation equation 7 of the mixed zone of groundwater and lake water the change of groundwater recharge to the lake has a great impact on the calculation result m groundwater recharge to lakes is affected by many factors such as seasonal changes and human activities therefore long time series water level observation is an important means to obtain accurate flow in the calculation based on year the model accuracy can be effectively improved by using multiple periods of abundant water season normal water season and low water season for flow calculation 3 result 3 1 chemical characteristics of groundwater and lake water from the statistical results of water quality monitoring indicators the average ph value of daihai lake water is 9 01 and the tds is 11305 12321 mg l therefore it belongs to an alkaline salt water lake the main cations in lake water are na and mg2 and the main anions are cl and hco3 the concentration of ca2 in the lake water is much lower than that of mg2 it indicates that it is in the stage of calcite supersaturation and mg2 accumulation the standard deviation of monitoring indicators and the piper diagram show that the water quality of daihai lake is relatively uniform table 1 fig 4 the average ph of groundwater is 7 89 which is obviously lower than that of lake water the average concentration of ca2 in groundwater is 59 8 mg l which is higher than 21 6 mg l in lake water the average mg2 concentration is 22 6 mg l which is far lower than 264 3 mg l of the lake from the piper diagram groundwater in most areas is hco3 ca2 type while lake water is cl na type fig 4 therefore the discharge of groundwater to daihai lake is a mixture of two different chemical types of water 3 2 migration and transformation of carbon after mixing groundwater and lake water 3 2 1 water balance of daihai lake daihai lake is a typical closed lake the recharge items of daihai mainly include atmospheric precipitation surface runoff ecological water supplement and groundwater recharge the discharge items mainly includes evaporation and human activities in recent years affected by extreme climate the icebound period of daihai lake is as long as six months in a year during which the evaporation of daihai lake is very small 17 30 mm per month on average the average annual evaporation is about 650 mm the lake surface evaporation in the water discharge item of daihai is about 36 40 106m3 a daihai lake water used by human is 8 96 106m3 a the precipitation supplement is 22 12 106m3 a ecological water supplement is 3 50 106m3 a surface runoff inflow 5 50 106m3 a so according to the principle of water balance the groundwater discharge to daihai lake is about 14 24 106m3 a this value is consistent with the calculation result of darcy s law and has been confirmed in the research results of other scholars wang 2021 the section map of groundwater flow path and sampling points is shown in fig 5 the equation 8 for calculating the annual recharge of groundwater to the lake in each section with darcy s law is as follows q kibl 8 q is the amount of groundwater recharge to the lake m3 k is the permeability coefficient of aquifer m d i is hydraulic gradient l is the length of overflow section m b is the thickness of aquifer m the values of specific parameters are shown in table 2 3 2 2 the amount of dic caco3 and co2 according to the hydrochemical characteristics of the lake water and groundwater the main reaction related to carbon after mixing was mainly caco3 precipitation the model calculated the amount of carbon migration and transformation in water after mixing 1 l of groundwater with 5 l of lake water table 3 as shown in table 3 the dic recharged by groundwater to lake water in other sections is less than the carbon discharged by caco3 and co2 after mixing the two kinds of water except for section d11 in other words the dic in daihai lake decreased due to the recharge of groundwater in most sections darcy s law was used to calculate the annual recharge of groundwater to the lake in each section then the dic discharge from groundwater to the lake caco3 and co2 generated by the mixed liquid were calculated table 4 according to the calculation results the amount of groundwater recharge to daihai is about 1 4 1010l a 1400 104m3 a and the dic discharged to daihai is 6 4 107 mol a 770 t a caco3 precipitated by chemical reaction is 5 4 107 mol a 5400 t a and co2 emission is 5 4 107 mol a 2376 t a both of them remove 645 tons of dic from water per year the net reduction of dic in daihai due to the mixing of two kinds of water is 4 4 107mol a 520 t a 4 discussion 4 1 effects of groundwater and lake water quality characteristics on the lake carbon cycle although lakes continuously emit co2 into the atmosphere through the water air interface the carbon deposition in lakes is also an important part of the earth s carbon sink wang et al 2021 tranvik et al 2009 xu and xu 2018 in the majority of lakes dic loading is the decisive factor of co2 fluxes across the air water interface of lake sun et al 2021 li et al 2022 the formation of endogenous organic carbon and the deposition and dissolution of inorganic carbon akhtar et al 2021 maavara et al 2020 the discharge of groundwater to lake are usually the mixing process between two different kinds of water and the migration and transformation of dic caused by this is mainly controlled by the dissolution precipitation balance of carbonate rock the temperature ph and the concentration of ca2 mg2 and hco3 of groundwater and lake water may have a significant effect on the migration and transformation of dic in mixed water the model is used to analyze the carbon fixation or emission caused by the changes of ph temperature and ca2 mg2 hco3 concentration the results show table 5 when the ph of the lake increases or decreases by 0 1 the precipitation of caco3 in the mixed water increases by 0 97 or decreases by 1 31 with the global climate change the lake temperature will change by a large margin when the temperature of the lake water increases or decreases by 2 the precipitation of caco3 in the mixed water increases by 0 30 or decreases by 0 36 when the temperature of the lake water increases or decreases by 3 the precipitation of caco3 in the mixed water increases by 0 44 or decreases by 0 54 when the concentration of ca2 in groundwater increases or decreases by 5 the precipitation of caco3 in the mixed water increases by 1 85 or decreases by 1 85 when the concentration of mg2 and hco3 in groundwater increases or decreases by 5 respectively it has no effect on the dissolution and precipitation of carbonate rock the analysis shows that the ph and the concentration of mg2 and hco3 in the alkaline lake are high and the concentration of ca2 is low therefore the change of ca2 concentration in groundwater has the most significant impact on the transformation of carbon in mixed water the higher ca2 concentration in groundwater the more carbon in the lake will precipitate in the form of carbonate and emit in the form of co2 the discharge of inland lake is mainly evaporation which is an alkaline salt lake with low ca2 content dehbandi et al 2019 butturini et al 2020 chen et al 2020 ph can change the physical and chemical environment of water and play an important role in regulating the dynamic balance and distribution of the carbonate system in water when the ph of groundwater is lower than that of lake water and the ca2 is opposite caco3 precipitation is easy to occur when groundwater recharges lakes yang et al 2021 in the daihai basin groundwater is discharged into the lake water with high tds strong alkalinity low concentration of ca2 high concentration of mg2 and hco3 after two different kinds of water are mixed it is equivalent to adding more ca2 to the water that is already in calcite supersaturation and the precipitation reaction will occur resulting in the migration and transformation of dic in the lake water the temperature of lake not only affects the dissolution precipitation of carbonate rocks in the mixing process of groundwater and lake water but also affects the migration of co2 generated by reaction in water the solubility of co2 in water is obviously affected by temperature and it decreases as the temperature increases generally fan et al 2011 when the mixing of groundwater and surface water changes the temperature of local lake water the dissolution or emission of co2 in the mixing zone will change xiao et al 2014 some studies have pointed out the co2 emission of surface water in summer will be higher than that in winter akhtar et al 2021 raymond and cole 2001 when the temperature of the lake water is low the ph is high which will increase the co2 absorption capacity wu et al 2014 therefore the temperature can change the ph of water by affecting the activity of h thereby driving the absorption and release of co2 yang et al 2021 in addition the cold environment is conducive to the preservation of organic carbon in the sediments of high latitude lakes while the warm inland waters show strong organic degradation and enhance carbon emissions marotta et al 2014 4 2 influence of biogeochemistry at the groundwater lake water contact interface on the lake carbon cycle generally the seepage of groundwater is slow sadat noori et al 2021 dong et al 2022b it cannot go deep into the lake area and fully mix with the lake water like surface water carlson mazur et al 2019 so the influence area of groundwater on the lake carbon cycle is mainly distributed in the contact zone between the lake water and the rock wall including the lake bottom the groundwater lake contact interface is usually considered as a confluence zone of shallow and deep groundwater where groundwater from different sources mixes near the lake shore karan et al 2014 the difference in groundwater and lake water quality in this zone triggers hydrogeochemical effect that will lead to carbon fixation and emission shapley et al 2005 its rate of carbon migration and transformation is more stable due to the slow groundwater flow rate and the stability of recharge the infiltration rate of groundwater into lakes depends on the water level difference between the two water bodies kidmose et al 2011 norrstr√∂m and jacks 1996 permeability of aquifer schneider et al 2005 norrstr√∂m and jacks 1996 and other factors when identifying the amount of carbon input from groundwater to lakes the carbon loading input from groundwater to lakes is determined by factors such as groundwater discharge intensity dissolved inorganic organic carbon concentration and lake sediment characteristics wang et al 2021 in particular there are often significant geochemical gradients temperature dissolved oxygen organic matter etc at the contact interface between two chemical types of water bodies driving complex biogeochemical processes have a significant impact on the carbon cycle of lakes wang et al 2022 when the groundwater lake interface is gravel layer and the groundwater flow rate is fast dic will enter the lake directly with the groundwater crossing the interface with the acceleration of groundwater flow rate the dic entering the lake per unit time is also increasing herczeg et al 2003 at the same time the groundwater lake interface is aerobic doc will be directly input into the lake through groundwater that will promote carbon respiration in the lake system maher et al 2015 and accelerate the emission of co2 from the lake when the sludge layer in the lake is thick the flow rate of groundwater through the sludge is affected the lake sediment has more inorganic carbon and rich microorganisms which is the boundary of aerobic and anaerobic with strong mineralization and complex material exchange and property changes yang 2020 on the one hand groundwater carries dic and penetrates the silt layer into the lake or dissolves carbonate minerals in sediments into the lake increasing the concentration of dic in the lake appelo and postma 2004 on the other hand the lower sediments in the lake are anoxic groundwater carried doc undergoes anaerobic biodegradation of organic carbon when it passes through the sediment water interface thus releasing co2 into the lake marotta et al 2014 groundwater is one of the main recharge sources of daihai lake after entering the lake groundwater only reacts with the water at the edge of the lake resulting in caco3 precipitation and co2 overflow therefore for small alkaline lakes the migration and transformation of carbon produced by dic recharged by groundwater mainly occurs at the contact interface between groundwater and lake water the interaction between sediment and water on the groundwater lake interface and microbial activity will have an impact on the migration and transformation of carbon especially when the silt is thick the impact on the transformation of dic in groundwater is more obvious liu et al 2017 small lakes such as daihai are widely distributed in the world they are embedded in the terrestrial ecosystem and the ecological environment load is small making the lake carbon cycle system more sensitive to changes in groundwater organic carbon inorganic carbon etc input into the basin marsay et al 2015 these replenishments not only directly increase the exogenous carbon input in the lake carbon pool but also aggravate the eutrophication of the lake and the algae bloom caused by it and also increase the generation of endogenous carbon galy et al 2015 moreover the ratio of sediment to water in small shallow lakes is larger than that in large lakes and sediments in small lakes form a huge carbon pool yu et al 2022 a study in finland concluded that the carbon pool 19 kg c m2 contained in lake sediments is larger than that in forests 7 2 kg c m2 for soil and 3 4 kg c m2 for trees carbon transport and transformation in small lake sediments are more sensitive to external input or response kortelainen et al 2004 therefore the role of small lakes widely distributed in regulating global carbon cycle and climate change cannot be underestimated 4 3 influence of lake hydrodynamic conditions on carbon migration and transformation between groundwater and lake lake hydrodynamic conditions affect the characteristics of lake water quality in the contact zone between lake and groundwater it will affect the physicochemical reaction in the mixing of groundwater and lake water and then affect the lake carbon cycle if the hydrodynamic conditions of the lake are poor the water quality of the lake at the groundwater lake contact interface will be obviously affected by the groundwater quality so that their water quality convergence and the hydrochemical reaction will slow down if the hydrodynamic conditions of the lake are good the water quality of the lake at the groundwater lake contact interface will be continuously updated and the hydrochemical reaction will remain stable in large lakes thermal stratification often occurs in lakes due to the poor hydrodynamic conditions wang et al 2019 andrade et al 2021 the separation of surface and lower limnology caused by thermal stratification is one of the most critical physical processes to control lake carbon flux lin et al 2021 √•berg et al 2010 andersen et al 2019 when the stratification of the lake occurs the carbon including the co2 generated by the reaction from the groundwater entering the lake at the contact interface will also enter the upper or lower layer respectively the carbon discharged above the thermocline will increase the emission of co2 and the carbon under the thermocline will be stored in water typically the stratification of lakes is obvious from spring to summer stratification inhibits the vertical mixing of dic between the upper and lower layers lin et al 2022 the photosynthesis will significantly reduce pco2 in surface lakes during the day lin et al 2021 andersen et al 2019 resulting in lower dic levels on the surface of lakes and a large amount of dic stored in the lower layer in autumn and winter the solar radiation is weakened and the monsoon is enhanced so that the lake is well mixed at this time no stratification occurs in the lake the carbon entering the lake from the contact interface of groundwater is evenly distributed in the water body due to vertical mixing and participates in the carbon cycle of the lake lin et al 2021 li et al 2016 li s research cdom chromophoric dissolved organic matter spm suspended particular matter chl a tn tp no3 n nh3 n codmn from daihai lake water showed better hydrodynamic conditions in summer and autumn lake water was mixed well under wind force and solute distribution in water was uniform li 2021 therefore the good hydrodynamic conditions of daihai lake keep the water body on the contact interface between the lake water and groundwater in a state of continuous renewal and the hydrochemical reaction in the mixing process of groundwater and lake water can remain stable at the same time homogeneous lake water is also conducive to the emission of co2 generated in the mixing process to the atmosphere and then affect the carbon cycle in the lake 5 conclusion the water quality hydrodynamic conditions and sediment characteristics of lakes are the key factors affecting the migration and transformation of carbon in the process of groundwater discharge to lakes the discharge of groundwater to alkaline lakes is a mixture of two different water in which carbon fixation and emission is easy to occur the mass conservation principle and hydrogeochemical model were applied to construct a carbon balance equation for the groundwater lake water mixing zone and calculate the migration transformation of carbon occurring during the recharge of groundwater to daihai lake the results show that the annual recharge of groundwater to daihai lake is 1400 104m3 and the discharged dic is 770 t a the chemical action in the mixing zone produces caco3 precipitation of 5400 t a and co2 emission of 2376 t a the total amount of dic removed from the water is 1290 t a the mixing of the two kinds of water makes the net reduction of dic in daihai lake 520 t a ca2 concentration in groundwater is a key ion affecting the carbon cycle in lakes and as ca2 concentration in groundwater increases more carbon in lakes in the form of hco3 will leave the water in the form of caco3 or co2 the contact interface between groundwater and lake water is an important area affecting the lake carbon cycle revealing the migration and transformation mechanism of carbon on this interface is of great significance to study the impact of groundwater lake system on the global carbon cycle credit authorship contribution statement

2289,in this study we developed a deep learning dl framework with a multi channel three dimensional convolutional neural network mc3d cnn to predict well performance and thereby assist future environmental remediation design such prediction of extraction well performance at designated locations is critical for configuring pump and treat p t well network design and operation setting reasonable target closure dates for overall remedying and estimating remedy costs the framework is developed with operational and monitoring data routinely collected during p t remedy operations including well extraction and injection rates as well as in situ contaminant concentrations traditionally the collected data were rarely used for purposes other than assessing past well performance and the accuracy of the conceptual site model however recent advances in data driven computational approaches enable better use of the large datasets to inform future well performance enhance site characterization and improve remediation planning in this study we established a dl framework to integrate transient three dimensional contaminant plumes and multiple aquifer properties e g hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic maps to identify characteristic patterns controlling and representing extraction well mass recovery aiming at providing future mass recovery estimates for existing wells and candidate wells at any proposed locations we evaluated our framework by using a realistic synthetic dataset generated from a well calibrated flow and transport model used in the 200 west area of the u s department of energy s hanford site in southeastern washington state the multi channel feature in our framework allows integration of various types and temporal densities of training datasets for dl model development overall we found that the trained dl model achieved an accuracy of over 90 in ranking extraction well performance in validation datasets and over 80 in predicting high performance ranking well locations this data informed approach provides a flexible tool to support adaptive site management streamline decision making and potentially reduce remediation time and costs our dl framework can be used as a filtering tool to improve the current p t network optimization design by reducing the number of candidate well locations keywords multi channel three dimensional convolutional neural network mc3d cnn deep learning groundwater remediation multi class classification pump and treat remediation performance assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in this study we detail a new framework for improving prediction of future well performance by using a deep learning dl model to discover the relationship between historical pump and treat p t records and related contamination distribution hydrostratigraphic units and hydraulic conductivity maps p t is one common approach used to hydraulically contain and remediate groundwater contaminant plumes at many waste sites mckinney and lin 1996 national research 2013 truex et al 2017 statistics show that p t is employed in approximately 40 of contaminated groundwater sites epa 2002 in a typical p t system the contaminated groundwater is extracted to the ground surface by pumping and then treated using a filtering or stripping system the treated water is then injected into the aquifer for groundwater recharge and or to hydraulically contain the remaining contaminant plumes epa 2005 the efficiency of p t systems heavily depends on the performance of extraction wells i e how much contaminant mass can be pumped from the aquifer within a reasonable time frame knowing extraction well performance at designated locations is critical for planning and modifying p t systems setting reasonable target closure dates for remedy operation and estimating remedy costs zheng and wang 2002 while large amounts of historical well performance data are often routinely recorded under regulatory requirements such information is mainly used for monitoring purposes only over the past four decades a variety of methods have been developed to simulate predict the performance of extraction wells for remedy design including the classical batch flushing analytical equation haley et al 1989 national research 1994 analytic element method gaur et al 2011 majumder and eldho 2016 matott et al 2006 boundary element method kontos and katsifarakis 2017 semi analytical solutions ameli and craig 2018 cardiff et al 2010 and more complex numerical fate and transport f t models such as modflow estomp pflotran itough2 and many other simulators finsterle 2006 finsterle and zhang 2011 hammond and lichtner 2010 neville and tonkin 2004 white and oostrom 2003 among these approaches the numerical f t models usually provide more comprehensive representations of complex site features such as three dimensional nonuniform distribution of the contaminant plume heterogeneous aquifer hydrogeological properties dynamic groundwater gradient and geochemical and or biogeochemical reactions in the aquifer finsterle and zhang 2011 huang and mayer 1997 minsker et al 2004 however calibrating a numerical model is not trivial and can be time consuming and site specific in many cases site measurements are inadequate to fully constrain model parameters which results in non unique solutions and high predictive uncertainties of numerical models carrera 1993 singh and minsker 2008 wu and zeng 2013 reactive transport modeling is especially hard because of its large problem dimension e g number of reactants and possible pathways and high computational costs mayer et al 2001 steefel et al 2015 tsang et al 2015 because of these difficulties simplified well models are still widely used for remedy planning epa 2005 in addition one commonly used phased strategy in remedy design is to move from simple calculations to analytical models and finally to a more detailed p t system design mcmahon et al 2001 in spite of the great value and wide application of simplified well models in remedy design it is widely acknowledged that the existing simplified models lack representation of some important site features especially the nonuniform distribution of contaminant plumes and heterogeneous aquifer hydrogeological properties which can lead to overestimation of extraction well performance and then underestimation of cleanup time and cost brusseau 1996 hadley and newell 2012 national research 1994 these over simplifications can be alleviated by adjusting empirical parameters and adding additional components to the analytical solutions to mimic more complex site behaviors sv√°b et al 2008 recently machine learning ml techniques have drawn increasing attention in water and geoscience research shen 2018 tahmasebi et al 2020 one popular application of ml methods in geoscience is to construct surrogate models to substitute for computationally expensive f t models razavi et al 2012 yadav et al 2018 in such cases hundreds or a few thousand realizations of physical f t were created by perturbing model parameters well configurations and or initial conditions and then the simulated modeling results were used as training datasets to feed into regression ml models the trained ml models have several advantages including high accuracy in reproducing the f t model training dataset low computational requirements relative to f t models and the capability to generate new predictions almost instantaneously mainly due to their high efficiency the ml based surrogate models became popular in computationally demanding f t optimization applications a variety of ml methods such as artificial neural networks gaur et al 2013 rogers and dowla 1994 yan and minsker 2006 extreme learning machine majumder and lu 2021 and deep neural network models chen et al 2022 yu et al 2020 have been used to train surrogate models and coupled with global optimization models e g evolution algorithms for p t network design to alleviate the potential bias of surrogate models it was also proposed to combine multiple types of ml models and form more reliable ensemble surrogates yin and tsai 2020 zounemat kermani et al 2021 one drawback of these surrogating approaches is that they lack physical representation and may produce physically unrealistic results e g violating mass conservation law and there is significant interest in enforcing physical laws to these black box models through physics informed ml methods such as employing metamodels soriano et al 2021 or minimizing the residual of physical equations tartakovsky et al 2020 wang et al 2021 among others in addition to being employed as emulators for f t simulations ml methods are also used as novel inverse models in subsurface science by creating bidirectional mappings between physical parameters e g hydraulic conductivity and facies structures and model state variables e g hydraulic head mo et al 2019 sun 2018 wang et al 2021 ml models have also been used to improve monitoring and site characterization of active and closed p t sites by optimizing monitoring network design kontos et al 2022 meray et al 2022 improving plume source identification kontos et al 2022 and filling data gaps ren et al 2022 one recent intriguing topic of ml application in groundwater remediation is the use of pure data informed approaches instead of explicitly implementing physical constraints in ml models or learning from physical f t simulation results these data informed approaches seek to directly link the model outcome of interest and its controlling factors under ml frameworks for better groundwater contaminant estimation and remediation design the selection of the controlling factors is not arbitrary but rather is based on the understanding of causal relations ofthe aquifer system and physical laws thus the ml algorithms are performed as a way of data mining to extract and formulate hidden relations and patterns between the variables of concern and their controlling factors a predictive model of groundwater nitrate pollution was built using random forest r f regression by examining nitrate concentrations with 24 related site parameters such as intrinsic hydrogeologic properties driving forces remotely sensed variables and physical chemical variables rodriguez galiano et al 2014 mcconnell and others trained regression based ml models prophet model and damped holt s exponential smoothing model to predict future carbon tetrachloride ccl4 plumes using historical ccl4 concentration samples mcconnell et al 2022 their models can achieve satisfactory prediction of site closure time without solving governing transport equations with sufficient spatial and temporal density of data wu and others applied r f methods for classifying high health risk areas using various groundwater chemistry measurements and demonstrated that an r f model with four types of the most important chemistry measurements can achieve a classification accuracy of 88 21 for groundwater quality wu et al 2020 the aforementioned applications focused on estimating the extent of a current contaminant plume and or predicting future plume migration no studies has been reported that predict the performance of the p t system using data driven approaches with the rapid advance in ml applications in contaminant migration modeling and remediation design one important dataset historical p t records has been under utilized under regulatory requirements large amounts of extraction and injection records such as flow rate and contaminant concentration are routinely collected as a standard practice in most p t remediation sites these data are mainly used to monitor contaminant rate mass removal while they directly reflect the response of the aquifer and potentially can be mined to support better decision making for future remedies brusseau 2013 truex et al 2017 on the contrary the historical well production data have already been proven to be very useful in the gas and oil industry to predict future oil production rates and guide future well drilling e g hirschmiller et al 2019 li et al 2019 our dl approach allows integration of multi type multi resolution p t monitoring and site characterization data addresses the limitations of the analytical and semi analytical solutions in representing heterogenous field characteristics and avoids solving expensive governing transport equations an image based dl model convolutional neural networks cnns was developed and integrated to extract the hidden spatiotemporal correlations between physical control factors and historical records of p t well performance the model is evaluated using a realistic synthetic dataset generated from a calibrated f t model for a site with historical contamination the effects of training dataset type and temporal data density are also interrogated to understand potential improvements in model performance given the large amount of p t records generated at many waste sites for monitoring purposes and the increasing automatic collection and digitalization of these records data informed approaches such as our multi channel cnn create opportunities to improve our understanding of contaminant transport and site management streamline decision making and potentially reduce future remediation costs 2 methods we developed a multi channel three dimensional 3d cnn mc3d cnn dl architecture to extract important features from transient plume distributions and aquifer hydrogeological properties that control extraction well performance the trained dl model can be used as a prediction model that provides favorable locations for future wells to maximize contaminant mass recovery shorten the operational time of the p t system and reduce total remediation cost section 2 1 introduces the dl background and key configurations of cnn and section 2 2 describes the architecture of the mc3d cnn model fig 1 and its major hyperparameters implementation of the cnn classification model for predicting well performance with physical model simulations and physical properties is illustrated in fig 2 and discussed in section 2 3 2 1 deep learning and cnn configurations dl is a sub field of ml which has been designed to reveal the hidden controlling mechanism in high dimensional and nonlinear complex systems typical dl approaches such as fully connected neural networks fc nns cnn and long short term memory can automatically find the most salient features to be learned these approaches have demonstrated tremendous success in a variety of applications such as speech recognition computer vision and natural language processing cnn has outperformed other dl methods in predictive capability in many image related applications including medical imaging material structure object recognition and others rao and liu 2020 cnn was first developed for visual imagery analysis and feature extraction lecun et al 2015 the visual geometry group vgg block wise model architecture is adopted to push the model depth toward high accuracy simonyan and zisserman 2015 the vgg model architecture includes a series of convolutional blocks containing multiple convolutional layers followed by batch normalization pooling and dropout layers within each block and then connected to flatten and dense layers vgg model architecture needs to be adjusted according to the characteristics of the datasets the number of convolutional filters is incremented layer by layer to make sure that the increasingly richer features are properly extracted such layered organizations can learn hierarchical representations the neurons of adjacent layers are connected by assigning weights and biases w i b i i 1 m where m is the number of layers in neural network n n m the initial layer is the input layer constructed in image sets and the last layer is the output defined as the classification labels the predicted outcome is compared with the label and a measure is calculated representing the performance of the cnn the categorical cross entropy class is chosen for the multi label classification problems it computes the cross entropy loss between the labels and model predictions and the calculation of the loss function requires that the last dense layer be configured with the total number of classes this enables softmax activation to predict the probability for each class in between are hidden layers transforming the feature space of the input such that it matches the output max pooling is performed to reduce the data size using spatial down sampling while preserving discriminant information the normalization of output from previous layers allows the neural network to learn the pattern more independently dropout as a common regularization technique is also used to introduce stochasticity to make model performance more robust and prevent overfitting 2 2 multi channel 3d cnn architecture three dimensional 3d cnn is needed to take labeled 3d images for feature extraction but it is computationally and memory exhausting because of its much larger number of trainable parameters compared to the regular two dimensional 2d cnn variant recent advances in computational hardware especially general purpose graphics processing units have made 3d cnn computationally affordable zhao et al 2019 in a typical 3d cnn design a 3d image passes through a series of blocks of convolutional layers to extract feature maps as shown by the architecture illustrated in fig 1 multiple 3d image datasets including different data types and their temporal and spatial components are fed into our multi channel 3d cnn under such architecture the ensemble of sub cnns per channel are trained simultaneously to learn the spatiotemporal features ingested from various sources e g plume distribution hydrostratigraphic unit map and match the features to the predefined labels e g well performance ranking index hyperparameter searching is needed to optimize the mc3d cnn model configuration a series of configuration parameters were explored including batch size kernel size number of layers number of neurons in each convolutional block and dropout rate the optimal configuration was then chosen by comparing the performance metrics of various hyperparameter combinations on training and validation datasets the final mc3d cnn model was then evaluated with an independent testing dataset 2 3 dl framework for well performance classification fig 2 illustrates the overall workflow for training mc3d cnn and predicting future performance ranking three physical attributes plume concentration hydrostratigraphic unit and hydraulic conductivity were used to compose the 3d training images in this study a synthetic modeling dataset was used to generate the 3d training images for each extraction well as detailed in section 3 2 2 the accumulative mass recovery was categorized into three levels of performance which serve as the image labels for cnn supervised learning the raw pixel data from the 3d training images were fed into the 3d cnn model which can integrate various sources of data representing different aspects of system behaviors and dynamics related to well performance 3 case design and model evaluation criteria a suitable example for demonstrating the mc3d cnn model is the remediation of the central plateau at the u s department of energy doe hanford site section 3 1 here we extracted the simulated ccl4 plumes from an f t model covering the central plateau section 3 2 to compose a synthetic dataset for model testing the advantage of using synthetic data from the f t model is that it can provide a known reference for evaluating the accuracy of the dl model section 3 3 presents the details of the dl model setup and model parameters for the synthetic case the criteria used to measure the performance of the dl model are described in section 3 4 section 3 5 illustrates how to use the trained dl model to predict well performance ranking 3 1 site description the doe hanford site located in southeastern washington state holds radioactive waste from the disposal of nuclear fuel fabrication wastes from 1943 to 1975 fig 3 the central plateau is an informal geographic designation given to the broad central portion of the hanford site that encompasses the 200 west and 200 east areas the central platea area is one of the most complex environmental remediation sites in the world with shallow sources e g waste tanks persisting and recalcitrant deep vadose zone residual sources large scale groundwater plumes e g carbon tetrachloride ccl4 technetium 99 tc 99 iodine 129 i 129 and nitrate no3 and subsurface heterogeneity demirkanli and freedman 2021 groundwater with several contaminants of concern cocs has been treated by the 200 west p t facility in the central plateau since 2012 the 200 west p t facility is designed to capture and treat contaminated groundwater to reduce the mass of selected cocs such as ccl4 no3 tc 99 and i 129 by at least 95 within 25 years from the startup demirkanli et al 2018 the locations of extraction wells are shown as green diamonds in fig 3b 3 2 synthetic dataset generation the plateau to river groundwater model p2r model budge and nichols 2020 has been developed for the central plateau and extends eastward to the columbia river figure s1 the p2r model was calibrated using hundreds of monitoring wells the model primarily provides the computational basis for simulating the f t of contaminants in groundwater within the near and far field portion of the affected aquifer in the central plateau and is currently used to support ongoing remedial activities on the central plateau more details of the p2r model can be found elsewhere budge and nichols 2020 3 2 1 well performance ranking while the p2r model simulated groundwater f t of multiple contaminants in the central plateau this study only focused on the ccl4 removal data in the 200 west area for demonstration purposes the performance of each well is ranked as high medium or low according to the well s ccl4 recovery these well rankings were used as labels in the dl classification model it is noticed that the ranking of each well varies over time where a typical well might be ranked as a high performance well in its early years of operation then its performance will decrease over the years with the removal of surrounding ccl4 therefore performance of each well is distinguished and labeled at multiple time segments fig 4 shows the simulated annual ccl4 mass recovery of 28 existing extraction wells from the p2r model each of the 28 extraction wells was then labeled as high medium or low performance according to its 5 year cumulative mass recovery eq 1 as r low m i j c 1 r medium c 1 m i j c 2 1 r high c 2 m i j where c 1 k g and c 2 k g are predefined threshold values r low r medium and r high denote the performance indicator values corresponding to low medium and high performance respectively m i j is a moving sum calculated from the annual ccl4 mass recovery 2 m i j k j 1 j n m i k f o r j n n where m i k k g is the ccl4 mass recovery of well i in year k m i j is the ccl4 mass recovery of well i for the following n year starting in year j n y e a r is the time window for moving sum which is 5 years in this study and n y e a r is total number of years for example the future performance rank of a well in 2012 is evaluated using its total mass recovery between 2012 and 2017 we chose a 5 year moving time window because more than half of the wells reached their peak performance around year 5 fig 4 the values of c1 and c2 are 30 k g and 200 k g respectively which are chosen based on the statistical distribution and derived quantiles of the cumulative mass recovery and the pre designed evenly distributed members in each class figure s2 the purpose is to make a balanced classification system to improve the predictive performance and avoid model bias fig 5 shows the calculated ranking for each well in different years it is not surprising that most of the 28 wells move from medium high performance to low medium performance rankings over decades of remediation however there are still a few wells that move from low medium to medium high rankings e g 299 w11 49 and 200 w11 97 this is because the plume spreading increases the ccl4 concentration in those wells and thus improves their ccl4 extraction rates 3 2 2 3d image sets under different scenarios around each well three types of model parameters and variables plume concentration hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic unit were extracted from the p2r model configuration and output files the horizontal and vertical lengths of the 3d images are 1000 m and 80 m respectively as selected by model sensitivity test three scenarios have been designed to test different combinations of these datasets on dl model performance scenario 1 s1 uses the current snapshot of plume concentration only scenario 2 s2 adds two earlier time steps to s1 as the model inputs such a setup considers the temporal impact for model prediction scenario 3 s3 adds hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic units to s2 both hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic units are static over time examples of different data sources are illustrated in fig 6 at three wells representing different performance indicators in the year 2021 the performance wells 299 w14 20 299 w14 73 and 299 w 15 225 are ranked as medium high and low respectively in the year 2026 the performance rankings of the three wells change to low medium and low respectively in the year 2031 all three wells are ranked as low performance 3 3 dl model setup based on the performance ranking rule defined in section 3 1 a total of 486 pairs of label performance ranking and training image datasets were created for the 28 wells at 18 timesteps note that not all wells were operated throughout the entire simulation time frame we first used 80 of the dataset for model training and validation year 2015 2029 and the remaining 20 of the dataset for model testing year 2029 2032 each scenario described in section 3 2 shares the same 3d cnn model architecture and grid searching in the hyperparameter tuning process to make a fair comparison across different scenarios 3 4 model accuracy measures the accuracy of the trained ml model was evaluated in the testing datasets which are the last 20 of the synthetic data year 2029 2032 the direct model predictions were plotted in corresponding years to examine misclassified testing points spatiotemporally the commonly used confusion matrix was applied to quantify the mc3d cnn model performance using the testing set the confusion matrix visualizes the accuracy of a classifier by comparing the actual and predicted classes e g well performance rankings in this study for a binary classification problem the four types of events in its confusion matrix and their meanings are as follows 1 true positive t p correctly predicted true positives 2 false negative f n true positives predicted as negative values 3 false positive f p true negatives values predicted as positives 4 true negatives t n correctly predicted true negatives for multi class classification t p f n f p and t n need to be determined for each class separately by lumping all other classes into one class then the confusion matrix was used to assess the accuracy precision sensitivity and specificity of each class to diagnose the model performance accuracy represents the percentage of correctly labeled events within the whole pool of events precision uses the portion between t p and t p f p to assess how good the model is at assigning positive events to the positive classes sensitivity is the fraction between t p and t p f n which measures how proper the model is for detecting events in the positive class specificity is the ratio of t n and t n f p which evaluates how exact the assignment to the negative class is 3 5 future well performance prediction the trained dl model was used to predict the future well performance ranking in year 2022 for the entire model domain to demonstrate the usage of this model the unconfined aquifer in the 200 west area was first discretized to a structured grid with a spatial resolution of 100 100 5 m imaginary wells were placed in each grid node with a predefined screen length of 48 m which is the medium value of the existing wells same as the training dataset a series of 10 10 13 image sets were extracted from ccl4 plume hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic unit datasets as inputs for model prediction the future well performance ranking was then generated using the trained mc3d cnn model for each of the gridded locations which were then used to create a map of well performance ranking 4 results we trained dl models for the three designed model configurations and in section 4 1 we evaluate their accuracy the trained models achieved over 90 accuracy on the training and validation datasets and provided satisfactory results on the testing set the trained dl models were then used to provide a site wide ranking map to illustrate the usage of this method section 4 2 4 1 model evaluation under different scenarios the cnn model was trained with various configurations for well performance evaluation and the optimal model configuration was applied to the third independent testing dataset the model training history and class statistics were calculated and are illustrated in fig 7 fig 7 a c represents the influence of the optimized model configurations e g the model accuracy vs epochs curves with three settings scenarios of predictors single plume s1 multi step plume s2 and multi step plume with field properties s3 both the training and validation accuracy increased with epochs and converged at or above 90 for all three scenarios with more data channels added to the training pool the model accuracy increased although the s3 model has the highest training and validation accuracy the overall averaged accuracy for all three models was satisfactory without noticeable over fitting it is not surprising that s2 and s3 yielded similar learning results because 1 plume distribution is the most important control factor on extraction well performance and 2 the impacts of hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic units have been implicitly represented in the multi year plume variations figure 7 d f is a multi class confusion matrix for the testing set specifically the diagonal line stands for the matched cases between predictions and targets for each class the upper corners are the overestimated cases and the lower corners are the underestimated cases in general the results show that the testing accuracy across the three scenarios is lower than training and validation accuracy the reason is that the model was trained using 12 years of historical data to predict 4 years of future behaviors this indicates that the aquifer conditions were nonstationary due to the continuous decrease of ccl4 inventory for the single plume scenario s1 the overall model accuracy for the testing dataset is 67 the model has about 23 underestimation on well performance where 7 high performance ranking cases and 14 medium performance ranking cases were classified as low performance ranking the model has good performance in controlling the overestimation with only 8 low performance ranking cases classified as medium after adding multi time channel data s2 and s3 the averaged model accuracy increases to 73 and the improvement is observed for both medium and high classes the underestimated rate was reduced to 14 which is 8 6 lower than s1 the overestimated rate was 2 higher compared to the single plume scenario the dl models trained by s2 and s3 have comparable performance figure 7 g h shows class statistics using four metrics calculated from the confusion matrix for the single plume scenario s1 the sensitivity for the high and medium classes is low because the number of t p for both classes is small which means the model needs to be improved to better detect high and medium performance cases the specificity of the low class is 46 which means the model cannot assign low class exactly in this case medium and high performance ranking cases are likely to be predicted as low performance all four performance statistics improve after adding multi step temporal information s2 model in the high performance ranking class of the s2 model accuracy and precision reached 82 and 80 respectively the high precision in predicting the high performance ranking well locations means that the model is good at predicting high performance ranking cases the s3 model demonstrates slightly better sensitivity for the low performance ranking class and its overall statistical performance is similar to that of the s2 model based on the comparisons of the above statistical performance metrics s3 was selected and applied to the testing dataset and the field prediction described in the following sections fig 8 shows the spatial distributions of correct prediction underestimation and overestimation cases by the s3 model each dot under the subplots represents a testing well location for a particular year in general model predictions match the label references for most wells however since the mass recovery data extracted from the p2r model tends to decrease over time and the model predicts future well performance the s3 model tends to underestimate for later years these results suggest that the deep learning model could be further improved by including more representative spatiotemporal samples into the training dataset 4 2 well performance ranking prediction the predicted well performance ranking map covering the entire field is obtained using the well trained model based on the input dataset requirements of our model the entire field is sliced into 10x10x13 image sets within the 200 west area each image set is assigned a performance ranking for the next 5 years predicted by the mc3d cnn model as a potential well location with a given plume concentration image at any time step hydrostratigraphic unit and hydraulic conductivity fig 9 presents the resulting performance ranking prediction which can be used to assist in future well planning the centroid plume concentration of each grid in fig 9 was clustered according to its performance ranking the results are shown in fig 10 using a violin plot which is a hybrid of a boxplot and kernel density plot that can visualize the distribution of a numeric variable in different groups it is not surprising that the low ranking grids have much lower concentration compared to the medium and high ranking grids the concentration distributions of the medium and high classes are similar it is interesting to see that many grids with high concentration were ranked as medium while many other grids with lower concentration were ranked as high this highlights the value of using image based classification instead of point measurement for decision making 5 conclusion and discussion we propose a dl framework that can predict the future performance of extraction wells by mining the hidden relationship between historical p t records and contaminant plume distribution and aquifer hydrogeological properties inspired by the success of dl applications in computer image recognition applications we formulated the well performance prediction as a classification problem similar to image recognition the resulting dl model can identify key patterns of subsurface properties that control well extraction by learning from pre labeled historical records and paired subsurface property images the trained dl model can capture such key patterns around new wells and classify them as high medium and low performance ranking locations the advantage of this dl method compared to analytical well models is that it can look deep into the heterogeneous nature of aquifer conditions although rigorous physical constraints were not explicitly imposed in the dl framework they were implicitly included by selecting the key physical factors as the training image for model inputs the deep learning framework is also adaptive to integrate new data once they become available to retrain and update the deep learning model with improved performance compared to numerical f t models this approach is much more portable and makes full use of historical p t records and thus is suitable for data driven decision making and adaptive site management asm to reduce remediation time and cost as discussed in section 5 1 the future development of this method is also discussed in section 5 1 and the limitations are discussed in section 5 2 5 1 application scenario of the well performance ranking tool the data driven and portable features of the dl approach made it a useful tool for asm here we refer to asm as a systematic and iterative management strategy that routinely re evaluates and prioritizes site remedial actions and characterization activities to expedite the remediation of large and or complex sites demirkanli and freedman 2021 prediction of extraction well performance at specific locations is critical for asm for evaluating and revising p t well network design and operation setting reasonable remedy targets and estimating remedy costs although this method is data driven it doesn t incur additional costs for collecting new data because the well mass recovery records are often routinely recorded during the p t operation subject to the regulatory requirement the dl model can also be easily re trained with better accuracy for continuous planning whenever new data are available during the routine evaluation of remediation progress the updated well performance ranking map can assist in planning new well locations rebalancing the pumping rates for existing wells or even turning off some low performance ranking wells to better use their treating volume for high performance wells another application scenario for this performance prediction model is to integrate it with optimization workflows for p t well network design there is a long history of developing and applying integrated simulation based optimization approach for p t system design khan et al 2004 maskey et al 2002 mayer et al 2002 mckinney and lin 1996 wagner and gorelick 1987 zheng and wang 2002 in a typical simulation based optimization application optimization search algorithms e g differential evolution bayer 2010 generic evolution park 2016 particle swarm mategaonkar and eldho 2014 firefly kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015 and others are used to drive a groundwater simulator iteratively to check whether the environmental and or hydraulic constraints were met with certain p t configuration parameters e g new well location pumping rates and pumping duration and then adjust these configuration parameters accordingly the computational cost of the optimization problem grows exponentially with the number of parameters and makes formal optimization nearly impossible for complex waste sites with a large number of wells the data driven md3d cnn model is much more portable comparing to expensive numerical f t models and it is also more adaptive to integrate new data once they become available these make it ideal as a filtering tool to reduce the number of candidate well locations for the optimization search algorithms so that limited computational resources can be concentrated on more promising well installation plans the performance prediction model can also be integrated into groundwater simulators e g the hanford site s p2r model and provide direct on the fly optimization in such cases the model can be used as a wrapper of the groundwater simulator that pauses the simulator periodically and then rebalances the extraction rates among wells based on their performance ranking to achieve better mass recovery 5 2 limitations and future development we demonstrated this performance prediction model using the model simulated ccl4 of a real complex remediation project located on the hanford site the model simulation results provided a known answer so that accuracy and mismatch of the dl models could be precisely measured and traced although the scope of this study is limited to developing and demonstrating the new method one question to answer is how to apply this method in field as there are no known subsurface images such as the exact plume distribution provided by the calibrated p2r model our next step will address this question with the following three approaches geostatistical simulation and ensemble prediction due to the limited sampling and monitoring data in any real remediation site it is clearly impossible to have exact plume distribution for the performance prediction model as model input however a remediation project always has some type of estimation of the plume distribution which is essential for decision making such a plume distribution estimation can be used as a training image for the performance ranking tool an even better method would be to train multiple dl models using the geostatistical realization of the plume distribution murray and bott 2008 to augment the training pool to correct model bias the site uncertainty can be reduced by combining all the dl model results to provide a more representative or accurate ensemble prediction incorporating multiple data inputs although the demonstration case only used three key aquifer properties as inputs the mc3d cnn architecture is flexible and can be readily extended to include other variables one important potential training image dataset is geophysical investigations which can provide high spatial temporal resolution snapshots of subsurface measurements training the dl model with the aid of numerical model results in sites with very limited subsurface measurement numerical simulation results can be added as a supplementary dataset for model training this study provides a dl framework to make better use of p t records for future remediation design p t remedy monitoring and operational data along with site investigation information applied to data informed approaches such as the one tested in this study can create opportunities to improve our understanding of contaminant transport provide flexible tools for site management

2289,in this study we developed a deep learning dl framework with a multi channel three dimensional convolutional neural network mc3d cnn to predict well performance and thereby assist future environmental remediation design such prediction of extraction well performance at designated locations is critical for configuring pump and treat p t well network design and operation setting reasonable target closure dates for overall remedying and estimating remedy costs the framework is developed with operational and monitoring data routinely collected during p t remedy operations including well extraction and injection rates as well as in situ contaminant concentrations traditionally the collected data were rarely used for purposes other than assessing past well performance and the accuracy of the conceptual site model however recent advances in data driven computational approaches enable better use of the large datasets to inform future well performance enhance site characterization and improve remediation planning in this study we established a dl framework to integrate transient three dimensional contaminant plumes and multiple aquifer properties e g hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic maps to identify characteristic patterns controlling and representing extraction well mass recovery aiming at providing future mass recovery estimates for existing wells and candidate wells at any proposed locations we evaluated our framework by using a realistic synthetic dataset generated from a well calibrated flow and transport model used in the 200 west area of the u s department of energy s hanford site in southeastern washington state the multi channel feature in our framework allows integration of various types and temporal densities of training datasets for dl model development overall we found that the trained dl model achieved an accuracy of over 90 in ranking extraction well performance in validation datasets and over 80 in predicting high performance ranking well locations this data informed approach provides a flexible tool to support adaptive site management streamline decision making and potentially reduce remediation time and costs our dl framework can be used as a filtering tool to improve the current p t network optimization design by reducing the number of candidate well locations keywords multi channel three dimensional convolutional neural network mc3d cnn deep learning groundwater remediation multi class classification pump and treat remediation performance assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in this study we detail a new framework for improving prediction of future well performance by using a deep learning dl model to discover the relationship between historical pump and treat p t records and related contamination distribution hydrostratigraphic units and hydraulic conductivity maps p t is one common approach used to hydraulically contain and remediate groundwater contaminant plumes at many waste sites mckinney and lin 1996 national research 2013 truex et al 2017 statistics show that p t is employed in approximately 40 of contaminated groundwater sites epa 2002 in a typical p t system the contaminated groundwater is extracted to the ground surface by pumping and then treated using a filtering or stripping system the treated water is then injected into the aquifer for groundwater recharge and or to hydraulically contain the remaining contaminant plumes epa 2005 the efficiency of p t systems heavily depends on the performance of extraction wells i e how much contaminant mass can be pumped from the aquifer within a reasonable time frame knowing extraction well performance at designated locations is critical for planning and modifying p t systems setting reasonable target closure dates for remedy operation and estimating remedy costs zheng and wang 2002 while large amounts of historical well performance data are often routinely recorded under regulatory requirements such information is mainly used for monitoring purposes only over the past four decades a variety of methods have been developed to simulate predict the performance of extraction wells for remedy design including the classical batch flushing analytical equation haley et al 1989 national research 1994 analytic element method gaur et al 2011 majumder and eldho 2016 matott et al 2006 boundary element method kontos and katsifarakis 2017 semi analytical solutions ameli and craig 2018 cardiff et al 2010 and more complex numerical fate and transport f t models such as modflow estomp pflotran itough2 and many other simulators finsterle 2006 finsterle and zhang 2011 hammond and lichtner 2010 neville and tonkin 2004 white and oostrom 2003 among these approaches the numerical f t models usually provide more comprehensive representations of complex site features such as three dimensional nonuniform distribution of the contaminant plume heterogeneous aquifer hydrogeological properties dynamic groundwater gradient and geochemical and or biogeochemical reactions in the aquifer finsterle and zhang 2011 huang and mayer 1997 minsker et al 2004 however calibrating a numerical model is not trivial and can be time consuming and site specific in many cases site measurements are inadequate to fully constrain model parameters which results in non unique solutions and high predictive uncertainties of numerical models carrera 1993 singh and minsker 2008 wu and zeng 2013 reactive transport modeling is especially hard because of its large problem dimension e g number of reactants and possible pathways and high computational costs mayer et al 2001 steefel et al 2015 tsang et al 2015 because of these difficulties simplified well models are still widely used for remedy planning epa 2005 in addition one commonly used phased strategy in remedy design is to move from simple calculations to analytical models and finally to a more detailed p t system design mcmahon et al 2001 in spite of the great value and wide application of simplified well models in remedy design it is widely acknowledged that the existing simplified models lack representation of some important site features especially the nonuniform distribution of contaminant plumes and heterogeneous aquifer hydrogeological properties which can lead to overestimation of extraction well performance and then underestimation of cleanup time and cost brusseau 1996 hadley and newell 2012 national research 1994 these over simplifications can be alleviated by adjusting empirical parameters and adding additional components to the analytical solutions to mimic more complex site behaviors sv√°b et al 2008 recently machine learning ml techniques have drawn increasing attention in water and geoscience research shen 2018 tahmasebi et al 2020 one popular application of ml methods in geoscience is to construct surrogate models to substitute for computationally expensive f t models razavi et al 2012 yadav et al 2018 in such cases hundreds or a few thousand realizations of physical f t were created by perturbing model parameters well configurations and or initial conditions and then the simulated modeling results were used as training datasets to feed into regression ml models the trained ml models have several advantages including high accuracy in reproducing the f t model training dataset low computational requirements relative to f t models and the capability to generate new predictions almost instantaneously mainly due to their high efficiency the ml based surrogate models became popular in computationally demanding f t optimization applications a variety of ml methods such as artificial neural networks gaur et al 2013 rogers and dowla 1994 yan and minsker 2006 extreme learning machine majumder and lu 2021 and deep neural network models chen et al 2022 yu et al 2020 have been used to train surrogate models and coupled with global optimization models e g evolution algorithms for p t network design to alleviate the potential bias of surrogate models it was also proposed to combine multiple types of ml models and form more reliable ensemble surrogates yin and tsai 2020 zounemat kermani et al 2021 one drawback of these surrogating approaches is that they lack physical representation and may produce physically unrealistic results e g violating mass conservation law and there is significant interest in enforcing physical laws to these black box models through physics informed ml methods such as employing metamodels soriano et al 2021 or minimizing the residual of physical equations tartakovsky et al 2020 wang et al 2021 among others in addition to being employed as emulators for f t simulations ml methods are also used as novel inverse models in subsurface science by creating bidirectional mappings between physical parameters e g hydraulic conductivity and facies structures and model state variables e g hydraulic head mo et al 2019 sun 2018 wang et al 2021 ml models have also been used to improve monitoring and site characterization of active and closed p t sites by optimizing monitoring network design kontos et al 2022 meray et al 2022 improving plume source identification kontos et al 2022 and filling data gaps ren et al 2022 one recent intriguing topic of ml application in groundwater remediation is the use of pure data informed approaches instead of explicitly implementing physical constraints in ml models or learning from physical f t simulation results these data informed approaches seek to directly link the model outcome of interest and its controlling factors under ml frameworks for better groundwater contaminant estimation and remediation design the selection of the controlling factors is not arbitrary but rather is based on the understanding of causal relations ofthe aquifer system and physical laws thus the ml algorithms are performed as a way of data mining to extract and formulate hidden relations and patterns between the variables of concern and their controlling factors a predictive model of groundwater nitrate pollution was built using random forest r f regression by examining nitrate concentrations with 24 related site parameters such as intrinsic hydrogeologic properties driving forces remotely sensed variables and physical chemical variables rodriguez galiano et al 2014 mcconnell and others trained regression based ml models prophet model and damped holt s exponential smoothing model to predict future carbon tetrachloride ccl4 plumes using historical ccl4 concentration samples mcconnell et al 2022 their models can achieve satisfactory prediction of site closure time without solving governing transport equations with sufficient spatial and temporal density of data wu and others applied r f methods for classifying high health risk areas using various groundwater chemistry measurements and demonstrated that an r f model with four types of the most important chemistry measurements can achieve a classification accuracy of 88 21 for groundwater quality wu et al 2020 the aforementioned applications focused on estimating the extent of a current contaminant plume and or predicting future plume migration no studies has been reported that predict the performance of the p t system using data driven approaches with the rapid advance in ml applications in contaminant migration modeling and remediation design one important dataset historical p t records has been under utilized under regulatory requirements large amounts of extraction and injection records such as flow rate and contaminant concentration are routinely collected as a standard practice in most p t remediation sites these data are mainly used to monitor contaminant rate mass removal while they directly reflect the response of the aquifer and potentially can be mined to support better decision making for future remedies brusseau 2013 truex et al 2017 on the contrary the historical well production data have already been proven to be very useful in the gas and oil industry to predict future oil production rates and guide future well drilling e g hirschmiller et al 2019 li et al 2019 our dl approach allows integration of multi type multi resolution p t monitoring and site characterization data addresses the limitations of the analytical and semi analytical solutions in representing heterogenous field characteristics and avoids solving expensive governing transport equations an image based dl model convolutional neural networks cnns was developed and integrated to extract the hidden spatiotemporal correlations between physical control factors and historical records of p t well performance the model is evaluated using a realistic synthetic dataset generated from a calibrated f t model for a site with historical contamination the effects of training dataset type and temporal data density are also interrogated to understand potential improvements in model performance given the large amount of p t records generated at many waste sites for monitoring purposes and the increasing automatic collection and digitalization of these records data informed approaches such as our multi channel cnn create opportunities to improve our understanding of contaminant transport and site management streamline decision making and potentially reduce future remediation costs 2 methods we developed a multi channel three dimensional 3d cnn mc3d cnn dl architecture to extract important features from transient plume distributions and aquifer hydrogeological properties that control extraction well performance the trained dl model can be used as a prediction model that provides favorable locations for future wells to maximize contaminant mass recovery shorten the operational time of the p t system and reduce total remediation cost section 2 1 introduces the dl background and key configurations of cnn and section 2 2 describes the architecture of the mc3d cnn model fig 1 and its major hyperparameters implementation of the cnn classification model for predicting well performance with physical model simulations and physical properties is illustrated in fig 2 and discussed in section 2 3 2 1 deep learning and cnn configurations dl is a sub field of ml which has been designed to reveal the hidden controlling mechanism in high dimensional and nonlinear complex systems typical dl approaches such as fully connected neural networks fc nns cnn and long short term memory can automatically find the most salient features to be learned these approaches have demonstrated tremendous success in a variety of applications such as speech recognition computer vision and natural language processing cnn has outperformed other dl methods in predictive capability in many image related applications including medical imaging material structure object recognition and others rao and liu 2020 cnn was first developed for visual imagery analysis and feature extraction lecun et al 2015 the visual geometry group vgg block wise model architecture is adopted to push the model depth toward high accuracy simonyan and zisserman 2015 the vgg model architecture includes a series of convolutional blocks containing multiple convolutional layers followed by batch normalization pooling and dropout layers within each block and then connected to flatten and dense layers vgg model architecture needs to be adjusted according to the characteristics of the datasets the number of convolutional filters is incremented layer by layer to make sure that the increasingly richer features are properly extracted such layered organizations can learn hierarchical representations the neurons of adjacent layers are connected by assigning weights and biases w i b i i 1 m where m is the number of layers in neural network n n m the initial layer is the input layer constructed in image sets and the last layer is the output defined as the classification labels the predicted outcome is compared with the label and a measure is calculated representing the performance of the cnn the categorical cross entropy class is chosen for the multi label classification problems it computes the cross entropy loss between the labels and model predictions and the calculation of the loss function requires that the last dense layer be configured with the total number of classes this enables softmax activation to predict the probability for each class in between are hidden layers transforming the feature space of the input such that it matches the output max pooling is performed to reduce the data size using spatial down sampling while preserving discriminant information the normalization of output from previous layers allows the neural network to learn the pattern more independently dropout as a common regularization technique is also used to introduce stochasticity to make model performance more robust and prevent overfitting 2 2 multi channel 3d cnn architecture three dimensional 3d cnn is needed to take labeled 3d images for feature extraction but it is computationally and memory exhausting because of its much larger number of trainable parameters compared to the regular two dimensional 2d cnn variant recent advances in computational hardware especially general purpose graphics processing units have made 3d cnn computationally affordable zhao et al 2019 in a typical 3d cnn design a 3d image passes through a series of blocks of convolutional layers to extract feature maps as shown by the architecture illustrated in fig 1 multiple 3d image datasets including different data types and their temporal and spatial components are fed into our multi channel 3d cnn under such architecture the ensemble of sub cnns per channel are trained simultaneously to learn the spatiotemporal features ingested from various sources e g plume distribution hydrostratigraphic unit map and match the features to the predefined labels e g well performance ranking index hyperparameter searching is needed to optimize the mc3d cnn model configuration a series of configuration parameters were explored including batch size kernel size number of layers number of neurons in each convolutional block and dropout rate the optimal configuration was then chosen by comparing the performance metrics of various hyperparameter combinations on training and validation datasets the final mc3d cnn model was then evaluated with an independent testing dataset 2 3 dl framework for well performance classification fig 2 illustrates the overall workflow for training mc3d cnn and predicting future performance ranking three physical attributes plume concentration hydrostratigraphic unit and hydraulic conductivity were used to compose the 3d training images in this study a synthetic modeling dataset was used to generate the 3d training images for each extraction well as detailed in section 3 2 2 the accumulative mass recovery was categorized into three levels of performance which serve as the image labels for cnn supervised learning the raw pixel data from the 3d training images were fed into the 3d cnn model which can integrate various sources of data representing different aspects of system behaviors and dynamics related to well performance 3 case design and model evaluation criteria a suitable example for demonstrating the mc3d cnn model is the remediation of the central plateau at the u s department of energy doe hanford site section 3 1 here we extracted the simulated ccl4 plumes from an f t model covering the central plateau section 3 2 to compose a synthetic dataset for model testing the advantage of using synthetic data from the f t model is that it can provide a known reference for evaluating the accuracy of the dl model section 3 3 presents the details of the dl model setup and model parameters for the synthetic case the criteria used to measure the performance of the dl model are described in section 3 4 section 3 5 illustrates how to use the trained dl model to predict well performance ranking 3 1 site description the doe hanford site located in southeastern washington state holds radioactive waste from the disposal of nuclear fuel fabrication wastes from 1943 to 1975 fig 3 the central plateau is an informal geographic designation given to the broad central portion of the hanford site that encompasses the 200 west and 200 east areas the central platea area is one of the most complex environmental remediation sites in the world with shallow sources e g waste tanks persisting and recalcitrant deep vadose zone residual sources large scale groundwater plumes e g carbon tetrachloride ccl4 technetium 99 tc 99 iodine 129 i 129 and nitrate no3 and subsurface heterogeneity demirkanli and freedman 2021 groundwater with several contaminants of concern cocs has been treated by the 200 west p t facility in the central plateau since 2012 the 200 west p t facility is designed to capture and treat contaminated groundwater to reduce the mass of selected cocs such as ccl4 no3 tc 99 and i 129 by at least 95 within 25 years from the startup demirkanli et al 2018 the locations of extraction wells are shown as green diamonds in fig 3b 3 2 synthetic dataset generation the plateau to river groundwater model p2r model budge and nichols 2020 has been developed for the central plateau and extends eastward to the columbia river figure s1 the p2r model was calibrated using hundreds of monitoring wells the model primarily provides the computational basis for simulating the f t of contaminants in groundwater within the near and far field portion of the affected aquifer in the central plateau and is currently used to support ongoing remedial activities on the central plateau more details of the p2r model can be found elsewhere budge and nichols 2020 3 2 1 well performance ranking while the p2r model simulated groundwater f t of multiple contaminants in the central plateau this study only focused on the ccl4 removal data in the 200 west area for demonstration purposes the performance of each well is ranked as high medium or low according to the well s ccl4 recovery these well rankings were used as labels in the dl classification model it is noticed that the ranking of each well varies over time where a typical well might be ranked as a high performance well in its early years of operation then its performance will decrease over the years with the removal of surrounding ccl4 therefore performance of each well is distinguished and labeled at multiple time segments fig 4 shows the simulated annual ccl4 mass recovery of 28 existing extraction wells from the p2r model each of the 28 extraction wells was then labeled as high medium or low

moving sum which is 5 years in this study and n y e a r is total number of years for example the future performance rank of a well in 2012 is evaluated using its total mass recovery between 2012 and 2017 we chose a 5 year moving time window because more than half of the wells reached their peak performance around year 5 fig 4 the values of c1 and c2 are 30 k g and 200 k g respectively which are chosen based on the statistical distribution and derived quantiles of the cumulative mass recovery and the pre designed evenly distributed members in each class figure s2 the purpose is to make a balanced classification system to improve the predictive performance and avoid model bias fig 5 shows the calculated ranking for each well in different years it is not surprising that most of the 28 wells move from medium high performance to low medium performance rankings over decades of remediation however there are still a few wells that move from low medium to medium high rankings e g 299 w11 49 and 200 w11 97 this is because the plume spreading increases the ccl4 concentration in those wells and thus improves their ccl4 extraction rates 3 2 2 3d image sets under different scenarios around each well three types of model parameters and variables plume concentration hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic unit were extracted from the p2r model configuration and output files the horizontal and vertical lengths of the 3d images are 1000 m and 80 m respectively as selected by model sensitivity test three scenarios have been designed to test different combinations of these datasets on dl model performance scenario 1 s1 uses the current snapshot of plume concentration only scenario 2 s2 adds two earlier time steps to s1 as the model inputs such a setup considers the temporal impact for model prediction scenario 3 s3 adds hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic units to s2 both hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic units are static over time examples of different data sources are illustrated in fig 6 at three wells representing different performance indicators in the year 2021 the performance wells 299 w14 20 299 w14 73 and 299 w 15 225 are ranked as medium high and low respectively in the year 2026 the performance rankings of the three wells change to low medium and low respectively in the year 2031 all three wells are ranked as low performance 3 3 dl model setup based on the performance ranking rule defined in section 3 1 a total of 486 pairs of label performance ranking and training image datasets were created for the 28 wells at 18 timesteps note that not all wells were operated throughout the entire simulation time frame we first used 80 of the dataset for model training and validation year 2015 2029 and the remaining 20 of the dataset for model testing year 2029 2032 each scenario described in section 3 2 shares the same 3d cnn model architecture and grid searching in the hyperparameter tuning process to make a fair comparison across different scenarios 3 4 model accuracy measures the accuracy of the trained ml model was evaluated in the testing datasets which are the last 20 of the synthetic data year 2029 2032 the direct model predictions were plotted in corresponding years to examine misclassified testing points spatiotemporally the commonly used confusion matrix was applied to quantify the mc3d cnn model performance using the testing set the confusion matrix visualizes the accuracy of a classifier by comparing the actual and predicted classes e g well performance rankings in this study for a binary classification problem the four types of events in its confusion matrix and their meanings are as follows 1 true positive t p correctly predicted true positives 2 false negative f n true positives predicted as negative values 3 false positive f p true negatives values predicted as positives 4 true negatives t n correctly predicted true negatives for multi class classification t p f n f p and t n need to be determined for each class separately by lumping all other classes into one class then the confusion matrix was used to assess the accuracy precision sensitivity and specificity of each class to diagnose the model performance accuracy represents the percentage of correctly labeled events within the whole pool of events precision uses the portion between t p and t p f p to assess how good the model is at assigning positive events to the positive classes sensitivity is the fraction between t p and t p f n which measures how proper the model is for detecting events in the positive class specificity is the ratio of t n and t n f p which evaluates how exact the assignment to the negative class is 3 5 future well performance prediction the trained dl model was used to predict the future well performance ranking in year 2022 for the entire model domain to demonstrate the usage of this model the unconfined aquifer in the 200 west area was first discretized to a structured grid with a spatial resolution of 100 100 5 m imaginary wells were placed in each grid node with a predefined screen length of 48 m which is the medium value of the existing wells same as the training dataset a series of 10 10 13 image sets were extracted from ccl4 plume hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic unit datasets as inputs for model prediction the future well performance ranking was then generated using the trained mc3d cnn model for each of the gridded locations which were then used to create a map of well performance ranking 4 results we trained dl models for the three designed model configurations and in section 4 1 we evaluate their accuracy the trained models achieved over 90 accuracy on the training and validation datasets and provided satisfactory results on the testing set the trained dl models were then used to provide a site wide ranking map to illustrate the usage of this method section 4 2 4 1 model evaluation under different scenarios the cnn model was trained with various configurations for well performance evaluation and the optimal model configuration was applied to the third independent testing dataset the model training history and class statistics were calculated and are illustrated in fig 7 fig 7 a c represents the influence of the optimized model configurations e g the model accuracy vs epochs curves with three settings scenarios of predictors single plume s1 multi step plume s2 and multi step plume with field properties s3 both the training and validation accuracy increased with epochs and converged at or above 90 for all three scenarios with more data channels added to the training pool the model accuracy increased although the s3 model has the highest training and validation accuracy the overall averaged accuracy for all three models was satisfactory without noticeable over fitting it is not surprising that s2 and s3 yielded similar learning results because 1 plume distribution is the most important control factor on extraction well performance and 2 the impacts of hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic units have been implicitly represented in the multi year plume variations figure 7 d f is a multi class confusion matrix for the testing set specifically the diagonal line stands for the matched cases between predictions and targets for each class the upper corners are the overestimated cases and the lower corners are the underestimated cases in general the results show that the testing accuracy across the three scenarios is lower than training and validation accuracy the reason is that the model was trained using 12 years of historical data to predict 4 years of future behaviors this indicates that the aquifer conditions were nonstationary due to the continuous decrease of ccl4 inventory for the single plume scenario s1 the overall model accuracy for the testing dataset is 67 the model has about 23 underestimation on well performance where 7 high performance ranking cases and 14 medium performance ranking cases were classified as low performance ranking the model has good performance in controlling the overestimation with only 8 low performance ranking cases classified as medium after adding multi time channel data s2 and s3 the averaged model accuracy increases to 73 and the improvement is observed for both medium and high classes the underestimated rate was reduced to 14 which is 8 6 lower than s1 the overestimated rate was 2 higher compared to the single plume scenario the dl models trained by s2 and s3 have comparable performance figure 7 g h shows class statistics using four metrics calculated from the confusion matrix for the single plume scenario s1 the sensitivity for the high and medium classes is low because the number of t p for both classes is small which means the model needs to be improved to better detect high and medium performance cases the specificity of the low class is 46 which means the model cannot assign low class exactly in this case medium and high performance ranking cases are likely to be predicted as low performance all four performance statistics improve after adding multi step temporal information s2 model in the high performance ranking class of the s2 model accuracy and precision reached 82 and 80 respectively the high precision in predicting the high performance ranking well locations means that the model is good at predicting high performance ranking cases the s3 model demonstrates slightly better sensitivity for the low performance ranking class and its overall statistical performance is similar to that of the s2 model based on the comparisons of the above statistical performance metrics s3 was selected and applied to the testing dataset and the field prediction described in the following sections fig 8 shows the spatial distributions of correct prediction underestimation and overestimation cases by the s3 model each dot under the subplots represents a testing well location for a particular year in general model predictions match the label references for most wells however since the mass recovery data extracted from the p2r model tends to decrease over time and the model predicts future well performance the s3 model tends to underestimate for later years these results suggest that the deep learning model could be further improved by including more representative spatiotemporal samples into the training dataset 4 2 well performance ranking prediction the predicted well performance ranking map covering the entire field is obtained using the well trained model based on the input dataset requirements of our model the entire field is sliced into 10x10x13 image sets within the 200 west area each image set is assigned a performance ranking for the next 5 years predicted by the mc3d cnn model as a potential well location with a given plume concentration image at any time step hydrostratigraphic unit and hydraulic conductivity fig 9 presents the resulting performance ranking prediction which can be used to assist in future well planning the centroid plume concentration of each grid in fig 9 was clustered according to its performance ranking the results are shown in fig 10 using a violin plot which is a hybrid of a boxplot and kernel density plot that can visualize the distribution of a numeric variable in different groups it is not surprising that the low ranking grids have much lower concentration compared to the medium and high ranking grids the concentration distributions of the medium and high classes are similar it is interesting to see that many grids with high concentration were ranked as medium while many other grids with lower concentration were ranked as high this highlights the value of using image based classification instead of point measurement for decision making 5 conclusion and discussion we propose a dl framework that can predict the future performance of extraction wells by mining the hidden relationship between historical p t records and contaminant plume distribution and aquifer hydrogeological properties inspired by the success of dl applications in computer image recognition applications we formulated the well performance prediction as a classification problem similar to image recognition the resulting dl model can identify key patterns of subsurface properties that control well extraction by learning from pre labeled historical records and paired subsurface property images the trained dl model can capture such key patterns around new wells and classify them as high medium and low performance ranking locations the advantage of this dl method compared to analytical well models is that it can look deep into the heterogeneous nature of aquifer conditions although rigorous physical constraints were not explicitly imposed in the dl framework they were implicitly included by selecting the key physical factors as the training image for model inputs the deep learning framework is also adaptive to integrate new data once they become available to retrain and update the deep learning model with improved performance compared to numerical f t models this approach is much more portable and makes full use of historical p t records and thus is suitable for data driven decision making and adaptive site management asm to reduce remediation time and cost as discussed in section 5 1 the future development of this method is also discussed in section 5 1 and the limitations are discussed in section 5 2 5 1 application scenario of the well performance ranking tool the data driven and portable features of the dl approach made it a useful tool for asm here we refer to asm as a systematic and iterative management strategy that routinely re evaluates and prioritizes site remedial actions and characterization activities to expedite the remediation of large and or complex sites demirkanli and freedman 2021 prediction of extraction well performance at specific locations is critical for asm for evaluating and revising p t well network design and operation setting reasonable remedy targets and estimating remedy costs although this method is data driven it doesn t incur additional costs for collecting new data because the well mass recovery records are often routinely recorded during the p t operation subject to the regulatory requirement the dl model can also be easily re trained with better accuracy for continuous planning whenever new data are available during the routine evaluation of remediation progress the updated well performance ranking map can assist in planning new well locations rebalancing the pumping rates for existing wells or even turning off some low performance ranking wells to better use their treating volume for high performance wells another application scenario for this performance prediction model is to integrate it with optimization workflows for p t well network design there is a long history of developing and applying integrated simulation based optimization approach for p t system design khan et al 2004 maskey et al 2002 mayer et al 2002 mckinney and lin 1996 wagner and gorelick 1987 zheng and wang 2002 in a typical simulation based optimization application optimization search algorithms e g differential evolution bayer 2010 generic evolution park 2016 particle swarm mategaonkar and eldho 2014 firefly kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015 and others are used to drive a groundwater simulator iteratively to check whether the environmental and or hydraulic constraints were met with certain p t configuration parameters e g new well location pumping rates and pumping duration and then adjust these configuration parameters accordingly the computational cost of the optimization problem grows exponentially with the number of parameters and makes formal optimization nearly impossible for complex waste sites with a large number of wells the data driven md3d cnn model is much more portable comparing to expensive numerical f t models and it is also more adaptive to integrate new data once they become available these make it ideal as a filtering tool to reduce the number of candidate well locations for the optimization search algorithms so that limited computational resources can be concentrated on more promising well installation plans the performance prediction model can also be integrated into groundwater simulators e g the hanford site s p2r model and provide direct on the fly optimization in such cases the model can be used as a wrapper of the groundwater simulator that pauses the simulator periodically and then rebalances the extraction rates among wells based on their performance ranking to achieve better mass recovery 5 2 limitations and future development we demonstrated this performance prediction model using the model simulated ccl4 of a real complex remediation project located on the hanford site the model simulation results provided a known answer so that accuracy and mismatch of the dl models could be precisely measured and traced although the scope of this study is limited to developing and demonstrating the new method one question to answer is how to apply this method in field as there are no known subsurface images such as the exact plume distribution provided by the calibrated p2r model our next step will address this question with the following three approaches geostatistical simulation and ensemble prediction due to the limited sampling and monitoring data in any real remediation site it is clearly impossible to have exact plume distribution for the performance prediction model as model input however a remediation project always has some type of estimation of the plume distribution which is essential for decision making such a plume distribution estimation can be used as a training image for the performance ranking tool an even better method would be to train multiple dl models using the geostatistical realization of the plume distribution murray and bott 2008 to augment the training pool to correct model bias the site uncertainty can be reduced by combining all the dl model results to provide a more representative or accurate ensemble prediction incorporating multiple data inputs although the demonstration case only used three key aquifer properties as inputs the mc3d cnn architecture is flexible and can be readily extended to include other variables one important potential training image dataset is geophysical investigations which can provide high spatial temporal resolution snapshots of subsurface measurements training the dl model with the aid of numerical model results in sites with very limited subsurface measurement numerical simulation results can be added as a supplementary dataset for model training this study provides a dl framework to make better use of p t records for future remediation design p t remedy monitoring and operational data along with site investigation information applied to data informed approaches such as the one tested in this study can create opportunities to improve our understanding of contaminant transport provide flexible tools for site management
