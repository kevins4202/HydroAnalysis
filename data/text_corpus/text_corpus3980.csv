19900,as the wastewater sector moves towards achieving net zero greenhouse gas ghg emissions quantifying and understanding fugitive emissions from various sewage treatment steps is crucial for developing effective ghg abatement strategies methane ch4 emissions from a sludge drying pan sdp were measured at a wastewater treatment plant in australia for more than a year using a micrometeorological technique paired with open path lasers the emission rate was tightly associated with sludge additions climatology and operational processes the mean emission rate during the 90 weeks after initial sludge addition was 2 3 0 8 g m 2 d 1 with cumulative emissions of approximately 32 t of ch4 a dynamic temporal pattern of emissions was observed highlighting the importance of continuous or near continuous measurements for quantifying sdp emissions a methane correction factor mcf expressed as a fraction of the measured chemical oxygen demand of the sludge was determined to be 0 17 after 63 weeks the median operational cycle duration at the facility this is broadly consistent with albeit slightly less than the ipcc default value of 0 2 for shallow anaerobic lagoons these emission measurements will support wastewater utilities that employ open air sludge drying processes to develop effective ghg abatement strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

wastewater treatment facilities are a significant source of greenhouse gas ghg emissions to the atmosphere including methane ch4 from the anaerobic treatment of organics and nitrous oxide n2o from the biological removal of nitrogen n through nitrification and denitrification processes czepiel et al 1993 ipcc 2006 global population rise has increased the need for wastewater treatment without

increased by 49 from 1990 to 2020 with most of the increase attributed to developing countries especially in south and east asia 58 vs 65 and smaller increases from european countries 4 vs 3 there is growing interest in reducing ghg emissions from water treatment plants worldwide and the magnitude of ghg emissions is becoming an important factor in assessing the performance of water treatment

significant ghg source in wastewater treatment plants wwtps daelman et al 2012 during sludge drying ch4 is produced as the sludge entering the drying pan still has considerable residual ch4 potential daelman et al 2012 in one particular case it was estimated based on a mass balance analysis that an sdp receiving anaerobically digested sludge accounted for 25 65 of the overall ghg emissions from a wwtp pan et al 2016 however direct measurement of emissions from sdps are rarely reported because of the challenges associated with full scale monitoring such as the long operation cycles up to several years significant spatial variation and occupational hazards to access the sdps in the absence of direct monitoring wastewater facilities are estimating ch4 emissions using the default ipcc emission factor in this approach emissions are related to the input and output levels of the chemical oxygen demand or biological oxygen demand in the sludge however there is limited evidence validating the application of this emission factor to this particular process czepiel et al 1993 moore et al 2023 there is thus a need for direct measurements at sdps to validate and refine the emission factor the direct measurement of emissions from large open sources like sdps is challenging tremblay et al 2005 in many jurisdictions the flux chamber technique is the measurement standard however chamber measurements are problematic chambers modify the environmental conditions inside the chamber which can potentially alter the ambient emission rate further the small size of the chamber means the measurement may be unrepresentative of the source as a whole necessitating a substantial measurement survey for large sources delre et al 2017 world wide efforts are underway to implement measurement methodologies that are more accurate cheaper and logistically simpler to use such as plant scale tracer methods delre et al 2017 yoshida et al 2014 yver kwok et al 2015 one alternative is inverse dispersion modelling idm a micrometeorological technique where emission rates are calculated from gas concentration measured in the air downwind of the source the idm technique measures emissions over a much larger area than chambers it does not alter the source environment it has modest measurement requirements and is well suited for long term measurements idm has been widely used to quantify emission sources such as gas wells riddick et al 2019 tailings ponds you et al 2021 biogas plants groth et al 2015 and cattle feedlots bai et al 2015 among other applications in this study we employ the idm technique to quantify ch4 emissions from an sdp at a large wastewater treatment plant in australia by monitoring ch4 emissions from an sdp near continuously over an operation cycle

sdps including the contribution from each operational stage 3 develop a simple mathematical model to estimate ch4 emissions from sdps and identify key parameters influencing the emissions and 4 identify mitigation opportunities results and discussion long term ch4 emission rates the sdp measurements give a near continuous sequence of emission rates each a 15 min average with 6 775 measurements over a period of 613 days average weekly emission rates are calculated from this data sequence week 1 follows the initial placement of sludge in the sdp on 12 13 march 2021 and measurements began on week 3 24 march 2021 the weekly ch4 emission rates are shown in fig 1 a and the weekly precipitation and air temperature are shown in fig 1b emissions were relatively low during the period of initial sludge feeds weeks 1 to 27 during this initial period there was a short term pattern where emissions rose and then fell after each fresh sludge addition after week 27 early september there was a steep increase in emissions that led to a peak emission rate observed in week 33 this coincided with increasing air temperatures an increasing pace of sludge additions and the accumulation of sludge in the pan after the emission peak week 33 the emissions decreased over time by week 41 december 2021 the emissions had dropped by approximately 62 from the peak the decrease corresponded to an interval with no sludge additions which likely due to the reduced availability of organic carbon in the sludge only 36 mm of rain fell from weeks 36 to 51 fig 1b therefore rainfall events are unlikely to be a key factor contributing to reduced emissions we note that a tractor turning sludge event on week 41 coincided with a short term 30 increase in the emissions over the subsequent two weeks emissions plateaued at a low level after week 55 there was a slight increase in emissions when sludge turning was resumed on week 82 with emissions rising from an average of 0 2 to 0 9 g m 2 d 1 we use a generalized additive model gam with a normal error distribution to propagate the uncertainty of daily gas emissions over the measurement period bai et al 2020 wood 2006 over the 90 weeks the cumulative ch4 emissions from the sdp was calculated to be 32 5 1 07 t s e fig 2 giving rise to a mean daily ch4 emission rate of 2 3 0 08 g m 2 d 1 the dynamic emission pattern highlights the importance of continuous or near continuous measurements in order to accurately quantify ch4 emissions this capability is an important advantage of micrometeorological measurement

stockpiled the codout measured at week 90 95th percentile pan cycle duration was 472 t using the cod measurements and the cumulative ch4 emissions over 63 weeks median operational cycle duration the mcf for this sdp was calculated to be 0 17 table 1 over 90 weeks 95th percentile operational cycle duration of all drying pans the mcf dropped to 0 12 table 1 these values were slightly below the ipcc default value of 0 2 for a shallow anaerobic lagoon defined as 2 m in depth but well within the expected range of 0 0 3 given by the ipcc the mcf measured at the median cycle duration time was very close to the ipcc default value giving confidence in the current reporting methodology given sludge loading variability seasonal factors and variations in duration drying cycle from the pans overall cod balance the cod mass balance analysis fig 3 a shows that after 90 weeks 9 of the feed cod was removed via the supernatant decanted 22 ended up in the dried sludge while the rest 69 was emitted the emitted cod can be 1 converted to co2 via aerobic and anoxic reactions or 2 converted to ch4 and co2 via anaerobic transformations the anaerobic processes consumed 8 of the total cod fed to the pan estimated from the measured total ch4 emissions based on the cod mass balance the remaining emitted cod 61 of cod fed to the pan should be attributed to aerobic and anoxic reactions e g with oxygen nitrite nitrate sulfate as the electron acceptors enabled by the surface transfer of oxygen from the atmosphere the observed mcf was higher at 90 weeks than it was at 63 weeks this indicates that as the cod in the sludge reduced over time a decreasing proportion of this reduction was from anaerobic methanogenic processes this is likely driven by the relatively fixed rate of oxygen transferring into the sludge bed and the reducing rate of cod reduction over time as the substrate is consumed modelling based analysis and implications for mitigation strategies in order to understand the impact of the various operating parameters on the measured emissions and to determine the key parameters that can be used to estimate sdp emissions in the future two model approaches were examined the first being a first order kinetic model relating emissions to volatile solids destruction and the second being a sediment model relating mcf to operating conditions dynamic emissions fitted by a first order

of the feed vs k is the hydrolysis rate coefficient d 1 the hydrolysis rate coefficient k was estimated to be 0 013 d 1 by minimizing the modelled and measured ch4 emissions the modelled cumulative ch4 emissions show an excellent fit with the measured data r2 97 figs 3b c the congruency indicates that the first order kinetic model is adequate to describe the temporal variations of ch4 emissions from sdps and that the rate of ch4 emissions can be largely explained by the cod loading and timing given the model fit holds over an extended duration of varying weather conditions seasonal conditions such as rainfall and air temperature were not major causes of emission variation dependence of mcf values on sdp operational conditions the mcf value for this study was estimated to be 0 17 at the median drying cycle time for the open air drying pans table 1 this value is comparable to albeit slightly lower than the value of 0 2 recommended by ipcc 2006 to further evaluate how varying sdp operating conditions e g surface organic loading and temperature influence ch4 emissions represented by mcf values a one dimensional sediment model was established details of the model are presented in supplementary materials briefly it was found that mcf values are positively related to surface organic loadings and temperatures fig s4 at a typical temperature of 20 c the mcf increases from 0 02 to 0 6 with the surface organic loading being elevated from 50 to 300 g cod m 2 the typical operational range of sdps tchobanoglus et al 2003 the surface organic loading of this study is 70 g cod m 2 locating it at the low end of the operational range which is mainly responsible for the relatively low mcf observed it is to be noted that the modelling results can be considered indicatively only as the sediment model is largely simplified due to the lack of process data such as temporal and spatial profiles of n compounds and oxygen the sediment model has not been validated with an independent data set because of the lack of full scale sdp monitoring data although further validation of the model is needed the model provides a simple and useful tool to estimate the ch4 emissions from sdps operated under different temperature and surface loading conditions a future study could be used to expand the simplified model to a more comprehensive one when relevant data are available significance of this study with the rising awareness of ghg emissions from wwtps ghg monitoring and quantification has been widely performed in full scale plants daelman et al 2012 gruber et al 2021 kosonen et al 2016 however most studies focused on n2o and ch4 emissions from aeration tanks using online hoods to capture the emitted gases duan et al 2020 however the gas hood method is not applicable to sdp systems which are expected to have large spatial and temporal variability majumder et al 2014 pan et al 2016 this study to the best of our knowledge is the first full scale ghg monitoring campaign for an sdp lasting for the entire operational cycle the monitoring results indeed show significant temporal variations of ch4 emission fig 1 which further highlights the importance of conducing long term continuous monitoring for quantifying ghg emissions from sdps this study demonstrates that the reported values for open air sdps calculated using ipcc guidelines are consistent with actual measured emissions and confirms that open air sdps are a significant source of ghg emissions at the wwtp facility studied here melbourne water open air sdps and biosolids stockpiles are estimated to contribute approximately 50 of the total reportable fugitive ghg emissions from the facility responsible for 154 000 t of co2 equivalent co2 e against a total reported scope 1 emissions of 290 000 t co2 e in 2021 22 https www melbournewater com au water data and education environmental issues our path net zero accessed on 15 february 2021 in china it was also reported that emission from sludge treatment and disposal accounted for over 60 of total emissions zhao et al 2021 this enables wastewater facilities to make informed decisions regarding interventions to avoid these emissions which may include i enhancing the drying process to promote aerobic conditions and faster drying and ii consideration of low emission thermal treatment and carbonization technologies the results of this study provide critical information for wastewater treatment plant owners and operators that open air sdps are a significant source of ghg emissions as a result alternative sludge drying technologies need to be considered as the industry works to achieve net zero in addition to being a large source of ghg emissions open air sdps can also be a significant source of odour present land and groundwater contamination risks have a large footprint and exhibit poor performance during wet weather conclusions methane emission from a sludge drying pan was monitored for 90 weeks covering an entire drying cycle using an idm technique coupled with open path ch4 laser meausrements a dynamic emission pattern was observed which increased over a sequence of sludge additions followed by a rapid decrease as sludge additions stopped the effect of sludge turning events leading to short term increased emissions was also observed the dynamic pattern highlights the importance of high frequency measurements to accurately characterize the emissions a ch4 correction factor i e the proportion of the organic carbon lost during the drying process that was converted to ch4 as measured on the basis of cod was determined to be 0 17 at 63 weeks the median operational cycle duration this is slightly below but broadly consistent with the default value of 0 2 proposed by the ipcc for shallow anerobic wastewater lagoons modelling based analysis suggests the relatively low mcf is mainly attributed to the low surface organic loadings 70 g cod m 2 and the low ambient temperature yearly average of 18 c materials and methods experimental site the experimental site was located at melbourne water s eastern treatment plant which is a sewage treatment plant 1 100 ha in size 31 km southeast of melbourne victoria australia incoming domestic and industrial wastewater is treated via conventional primary and secondary treatment from which sludge is thickened and pumped to mesophilic anaerobic digesters digested sludge is pumped into sludge drying pans sdp s and dried stabilized to produce biosolids fig s1 the treatment of sludge in the sdp includes a decanting phase and evaporation phase the median treatment period is 400 days 57 weeks depending on the weather for a typical pan the filling and decanting cycle during the decanting phase repeats 5 6 times once the pan has been filled to the target solids loading 400 t ha 1 the pan is left to stand while the supernatant is decanted for about 180 days the standing period ends when the solids are apparent through the supernatant liquid and clear supernatant can no longer be extracted the pan outlets are then closed and the sludge is left to dry until the material can be transformed to windrows turning period 220 days windrows are turned regularly until the sludge is harvested and stockpiled onsite there are a total of 106 ha of open air sludge drying pans located at the treatment plant and a further 11 identical drying pans 27 5 ha are located at the eastern treatment plant s southern drying pan area sdp 49 located at the southwest corner of this area was chosen for emission measurements this choice facilitated emission measurements during west and southwest winds when no other sdps were upwind of sdp 49 the idm measurement technique requires isolation from interfering gas plumes the sdp 49 is 100 240 m in size and when full the sludge is approximately 1 m deep the pan base is made of hardened cement treated crushed concrete and laid out in a north south direction the terrain surrounding the experimental site is flat and covered with short grass the average minimum maximum air temperature was 10 2 19 8 c with annual precipitation of 705 mm the prevailing winds was sw and ne for winter and summer time respectively bom 2022 a widely spaced row of small trees was located 70 m west of the pan there were no other significant ch4 sources west of the experimental pan i e within 500 m these characteristics mean that the site is aerodynamically simple and well suited to micrometeorological emission measurements the first sludge feed was added to sdp 49 on 12 and 13 march 2021 here time is denoted as weeks since this initial sludge feed the first two sludge fill event emissions 12 13 march 2021 were missed because the instrument was not ready emission measurements began on week 3 on 24 march 2021 and concluded on week 90 on 27 november 2022 following the first sludge feed more sludge materials were added several times between may and november 2021 sludge interim samples across the entire sdp 49 were taken in may and december 2022 and analyzed at a nata accredited laboratory to determine the carbon oxygen demand value cod total solids and volatile solids fractions these measurements were used to conduct a mass balance across the process and calculate a site specific mcf factor for sdp 49 the cod and other characteristics of the added sludge are shown in table

ch4 emissions show an excellent fit with the measured data r2 97 figs 3b c the congruency indicates that the first order kinetic model is adequate to describe the temporal variations of ch4 emissions from sdps and that the rate of ch4 emissions can be largely explained by the cod loading and timing given the model fit holds over an extended duration of varying weather conditions seasonal conditions such as rainfall and air temperature were not major causes of emission variation dependence of mcf values on sdp operational conditions the mcf value for this study was estimated to be 0 17 at the median drying cycle time for the open air drying pans table 1 this value is comparable to albeit slightly lower than the value of 0 2 recommended by ipcc 2006 to further evaluate how varying sdp operating conditions e g surface organic loading and temperature influence ch4 emissions represented by mcf values a one dimensional sediment model was established details of the model are presented in supplementary materials briefly it was found that mcf values are positively related to surface organic loadings and temperatures fig s4 at a typical temperature of 20 c the mcf increases from 0 02 to 0 6 with the surface organic loading being elevated from 50 to 300 g cod m 2 the typical operational range of sdps tchobanoglus et al 2003 the surface organic loading of this study is 70 g cod m 2 locating it at the low end of the operational range which is mainly responsible for the relatively low mcf observed it is to be noted that the modelling results can be considered indicatively only as the sediment model is largely simplified due to the lack of process data such as temporal and spatial profiles of n compounds and oxygen the sediment model has not been validated with an independent data set because of the lack of full scale sdp monitoring data although further validation of the model is needed the model provides a simple and useful tool to estimate the ch4 emissions from sdps operated under different temperature and surface loading conditions a future study could be used to expand the simplified model to a more comprehensive one when relevant data are available significance of this study with the rising awareness of ghg emissions from wwtps ghg monitoring and quantification has been widely performed in full scale plants daelman et al 2012 gruber et al 2021 kosonen et al 2016 however most studies focused on n2o and ch4 emissions from aeration tanks using online hoods to capture the emitted gases duan et al 2020 however the gas hood method is not applicable to sdp systems which are expected to have large spatial and temporal variability majumder et al 2014 pan et al 2016 this study to the best of our knowledge is the first full scale ghg monitoring campaign for an sdp lasting for the entire operational cycle the monitoring results indeed show significant temporal variations of ch4 emission fig 1 which further highlights the importance of conducing long term continuous monitoring for quantifying ghg emissions from sdps this study demonstrates that the reported values for open air sdps calculated using ipcc guidelines are consistent with actual measured emissions and confirms that open air sdps are a significant source of ghg emissions at the wwtp facility studied here melbourne water open air sdps and biosolids stockpiles are estimated to contribute approximately 50 of the total reportable fugitive ghg emissions from the facility responsible for 154 000 t of co2 equivalent co2 e against a total reported scope 1 emissions of 290 000 t co2 e in 2021 22 https www melbournewater com au water data and education environmental issues our path net zero accessed on 15 february 2021 in china it was also reported that emission from sludge treatment and disposal accounted for over 60 of total emissions zhao et al 2021 this enables wastewater facilities to make informed decisions regarding interventions to avoid these emissions which may include i enhancing the drying process to promote aerobic conditions and faster drying and ii consideration of low emission thermal treatment and carbonization technologies the results of this study provide critical information for wastewater treatment plant owners and operators that open air sdps are a significant source of ghg emissions as a result alternative sludge drying technologies need to be considered as the industry works to achieve net zero in addition to being a large source of ghg emissions open air sdps can also be a significant source of odour present land and groundwater contamination risks have a large footprint and exhibit poor performance during wet weather conclusions methane emission from a sludge drying pan was monitored for 90 weeks covering an entire drying cycle using an idm technique coupled with open path ch4 laser meausrements a dynamic emission pattern was observed which increased over a sequence of sludge additions followed by a rapid decrease as sludge additions stopped the effect of sludge turning events leading to short term increased emissions was also observed the dynamic pattern highlights the importance of high frequency measurements to accurately characterize the emissions a ch4 correction factor i e the proportion of the organic carbon lost during the drying process that was converted to ch4 as measured on the basis of cod was determined to be 0 17 at 63 weeks the median operational cycle duration this is slightly below but broadly consistent with the default value of 0 2 proposed by the ipcc for shallow anerobic wastewater lagoons modelling based analysis suggests the relatively low mcf is mainly attributed to the low surface organic loadings 70 g cod m 2 and the low ambient temperature yearly average of 18 c materials and methods experimental site the experimental site was located at melbourne water s eastern treatment plant which is a sewage treatment plant 1 100 ha in size 31 km southeast of melbourne victoria australia incoming domestic and industrial wastewater is treated via conventional primary and secondary treatment from which sludge is thickened and pumped to mesophilic anaerobic digesters digested sludge is pumped into sludge drying pans sdp s and dried stabilized to produce biosolids fig s1 the treatment of sludge in the sdp includes a decanting phase and evaporation phase the median treatment period is 400 days 57 weeks depending on the weather for a typical pan the filling and decanting cycle during the decanting phase repeats 5 6 times once the pan has been filled to the target solids loading 400 t ha 1 the pan is left to stand while the supernatant is decanted for about 180 days the standing period ends when the solids are apparent through the supernatant liquid and clear supernatant can no longer be extracted the pan outlets are then closed and the sludge is left to dry until the material can be transformed to windrows turning period 220 days windrows are turned regularly until the sludge is harvested and stockpiled onsite there are a total of 106 ha of open air sludge drying pans located at the treatment plant and a further 11

19901,this paper reports conclusions from a recent study completed for the water research foundation and the state of california to offer guidance on uv chlorine advanced oxidation for potable water reuse the fundamentals of uv chlorine advanced oxidation are discussed and lessons learned from some of the early adopters of this technology are presented important highlights include the significant impact of ammonia and chloramines on uv chlorine treatment challenges associated with predicting uv chlorine performance due to complex photochemistry and an ongoing need to monitor potential byproducts and transformation products when employing any form of advanced oxidation for potable reuse graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv chlorine aop reuse ammonia chloramines data availability no data was used for the research described in the article introduction the ultraviolet uv chlorine cl advanced oxidation process aop can be cost effective for potable water reuse treatment and is growing in popularity particularly following reverse osmosis ro as part of the so called full advanced treatment fat train of the active design and under construction potable reuse uv aop projects in the united states recently reported 76 were pursuing uv chlorine versus uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 festger et al 2021 while uv chlorine has many similarities to uv h2o2 treatment there are important differences the municipal water industry is familiar with uv h2o2 treatment due to several decades of experience but uv chlorine is new and there is a need to disseminate the recent lessons learned as well as to highlight current information gaps to allow the process to be improved the authors recently completed a study funded by the water research foundation and the state of california on uv chlorine aop in potable reuse a guidance manual to assessment and implementation wrf 2022 this mini review summarizes some of the key conclusions from this study it is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of uv based aop so the focus is on specific technical details that differentiate uv chlorine from other aops for additional general information the reader is directed to the original full report wrf 2022 or to advanced oxidation processes for water treatment fundamentals and applications stefan 2018 important fundamentals of uv chlorine photochemistry several important fundamental principles of uv chlorine photochemistry are highlighted in this section as reminders to help in understanding subsequent concepts presented in this review uv based aops work by adding an oxidant chlorine or h2o2 that absorbs uv photons and decays to form a reactive product that can destroy contaminants in the case of h2o2 decomposition the main useful product is the hydroxyl radical oh chlorine photolysis also produces oh but it also produces several reactive chlorine species rcs including cl and clo the efficiency by which uv photolysis forms these useful products depends on how well each oxidant absorbs uv photons and in turn the efficiency by which the resulting photolysis produces the oh and the rcs i e the quantum yield fig 1 illustrates that when using low pressure lp uv lamps that emit primarily at 254 nm both hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite ocl absorb photons about three times more efficiently than h2o2 on a per mole basis medium pressure mp lamps emit photons not only near 254 nm but also in the 290 350 nm range which are absorbed by hocl and ocl but not effectively by h2o2 when one mole of h2o2 absorbs one mole of photons at 254 nm it produces 1 11 mol of oh radicals i e the quantum yield is 1 11 goldstein et al 2007 the quantum yield of oh formation from chlorine photolysis is less certain reportedly ranging between 0 46 1 4 when hocl undergoes photolysis stefan 2018 chuang et al 2017 bulman et al 2019 and from 0 12 to 0 61 when ocl is photolyzed stefan 2018 furthermore the quantum yield of production of rcs via chlorine photolysis at 254 nm is uncertain with stefan et al 2018 and chuang et al 2017 reporting a quantum yield of cl formation from ocl and hocl in the order of 0 3 0 6 at 254 nm the quantum yields associated with mp uv i e with wavelengths other than 254 nm are also unreported these uncertainties suggest that models to predict the amount of oh and rcs available to treat the water under different uv chlorine treatment conditions may be inaccurate this is a current weakness of uv chlorine treatment design performance must be predicted largely on empirical and uncertain evidence more research in this area is needed an additional factor that governs both uv chlorine and uv h2o2 performance is the scavenging of the radicals and reactive species by the chlorine and h2o2 themselves oh reacts at least 4 5 times more quickly with ocl than with hocl buxton and subhani 1972 anastasio and matthew 2006 which is a contributing factor that may lead uv chlorine to be more effective at ph values below the pka of chlorine about 7 5 at 25 c where hocl predominates this has helped uv chlorine to become an attractive option for water reuse treatment that employs reverse osmosis ro ro permeate typically has a ph of 5 6 due to anti fouling acid injection and may make uv chlorine more cost effective relative to uv h2o2 ongoing research is also demonstrating that rcs species may be more effective at higher ph potentially widening the ph envelope of uv chlorine relative to uv h2o2 depending on the susceptibility of a specific contaminant to rcs reaction guo et al 2017 2022 uv chlorine may also be more efficient at higher ph if using mp uv lamps ocl is a very effective absorber of photons emitted at the higher wavelengths by mp lamps fig 1 and in particular the photolysis of ocl leads to not only oh but also to rcs zhou et al 2019 there is little reported about the performance of mp lamps at higher ph to treat contaminants particularly those susceptible to rcs reaction research needs at present uv chlorine treatment design is largely empirical many of the details of chlorine photochemistry remain unknown more data must be developed to allow accurate treatment models to be advanced such models could then be used to optimize process design ammonia chloramines nitrate and nitrite the degree of nitrification denitrification that precedes ro and advanced oxidation can be erratic unless the plant is well designed and operated for this purpose as a result the concentrations of ammonia nitrate and nitrite arriving at the ro can be widely variable and ro is an incomplete barrier against these species furthermore chloramines are often applied as an antifoulant for the ro as such there can be a mixture of all these compounds in the ro permeate the implications are discussed in the following text and in fig 2 which shows model simulations of the reactions of a fictive scenario whereby free chlorine is applied in a ro permeate containing nh3 and or nh2cl 180 s upstream of the uv reactor wrf 2022 ammonia if ammonia concentrations are high e g 1 to 2 mg n l uv chlorine treatment may be cost prohibitive due to the free chlorine demand of the ammonia lower ammonia concentrations may be acceptable but they will still exert a chlorine demand the reaction between ammonia and free chlorine is essentially instantaneous at neutral and higher ph but at ph 5 5 the reaction may take tens of seconds to complete fig 2 therefore one must account for the chlorine demand exerted by the ammonia as the water travels from the chlorine injection point to both the location of the chlorine analyzer and the entry to the uv reactor in order to accurately establish the desired free chlorine concentration entering the reactor chloramines just like ammonia chloramines exert a free chlorine demand that is not instantaneous in particular monochloramine reacts with free chlorine over several minutes at ph 5 5 to form dichloramine thus the concentration of monochloramine decreases and the concentration of dichloramine increases fig 2 this has three important implications 1 it is another complication in measuring the amount of free chlorine entering the uv reactor the free chlorine measurements must account for the travel time from the chlorine injection site to both the chlorine analyzer and the uv reactor otherwise the measured chlorine will not correspond to what is actually entering the reactor 2 monochloramine is a very strong oh scavenger k 1 0 109 m 1s 1 while dichloramine is weaker k 0 62 109 m 1s 1 anastasio and matthew 2006 the contribution of both species must be considered in terms of the overall oh scavenging in the water in the reactor but if the travel time between free chlorine addition and the reactor increases the chloramine speciation becomes arguably more favorable as monochloramine is converted to dichloramine an example of a fictive ro permeate containing a mixture of chloramines nitrate and nitrite is shown in table 1 demonstrating that the chloramines are contributing about 30 to the overall oh scavenging uv chlorine performance will therefore be strongly influenced by the amount of chloramines and the ratio of mono versus dichloramine 3 monochloramine has a molar absorption coefficient of about twice that of dichloramine at 254 nm wrf 2022 this is shown in fig 3 for a fictive ro permeate illustrating that monochloramine may be the dominant uv absorber preventing more efficient chlorine photolysis to drive the treatment process this suggests that as with point 2 allowing more time for free chlorine to convert monochloramines to dichloramine prior to the water entering the uv reactor is beneficial however more reaction time also allows more free chlorine to be consumed which is detrimental to treatment performance at present there are no readily available models that a designer can use to easily simulate and determine the optimum reaction time between the point of chlorine injection and the uv reactor for different combinations of free chlorine dose and ammonia chloramine concentration nitrite while nitrite is unlikely to exist in a uv chlorine system since it is quickly oxidized by free chlorine to nitrate it can be a problem for uv h2o2 systems nitrite is an extremely strong oh scavenger table 1 as it is a very strong radical scavenger it has a strong impact on system sizing nitrite removal prior to uv h2o2 treatment is essential there is also evidence that for very high uvt water e g 98 cm 1 consistent with ro permeate there is potential for nitrite formation inside the uv reactor from nitrate and chloramines especially for mp systems but also from lp systems stefan 2021 research needs the mathematical models used here to illustrate the influence of chloramines on uv chlorine performance were developed from experiments conducted at much longer reaction times e g tens of minutes than is relevant for uv chlorine where the kinetics over seconds to several minutes is critical there is a need to validate or recalibrate these models under short reaction times and other conditions e g ph temperature relevant to water reuse so that the impact of ammonia and chloramines on uv chlorine treatment can be accurately predicted and mitigated regulatory issues and design goals treatment processes must be designed to meet clear treatment goals if a uv aop is to treat water containing a specific contaminant such as a groundwater polluted with trichloroethylene tce the goal is comparatively straightforward the aop system can be designed based on the known or tested reactivity of that contaminant with uv and the reactive species being produced and then eventual performance can be confirmed by measuring the concentration of that contaminant in the treated water for water reuse the situation is far more complex the uv aop is to serve as a barrier against potential contaminants that may be in the water possibly with irregular frequency there is therefore complexity in establishing the initial treatment level and then also in how to monitor ongoing treatment performance once the system is installed there is no consensus on treatment goals for uv aop systems in water reuse in california uv aop for indirect potable reuse treatment following ro is required to achieve 6 log virus inactivation and 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane as a surrogate for organic microcontaminant removal if ndma is present a uv dose capable of reducing it to below the 10 ng l notification level may be a secondary treatment target as jurisdictions continue to develop and promulgate regulations other indicator compounds may be suggested the selection of treatment goals should be carefully considered because there may be unintended consequences on the resulting preference for uv chlorine treatment versus uv h2o2 or other methods and in turn on actual protection against the spectrum of pathogens and chemical contaminants for example if the treatment goal for chemical destruction were to be set at 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane reduction then both uv chlorine and uv h2o2 systems could be designed to achieve that goal while 1 4 dioxane is susceptible to destruction by oh k 2 8 109 m 1s 1 patton et al 2017 it is relatively inert to rcs chuang et al 2017 if uv chlorine and uv h2o2 were both designed to achieve the same level of oh production to achieve the same level of 1 4 dioxane destruction the rcs that are also being formed by the uv chlorine system would be reacting with and destroying some contaminants that may be in the water and which are reactive with rcs thus in reality the uv chlorine system would provide a broader treatment barrier than uv h2o2 despite both achieving equal regulatory credit based on 1 4 dioxane destruction if uv h2o2 were installed instead of uv chlorine based on cost and due only to their similar ability to destroy 1 4 dioxane the added benefit of the role of rcs would be overlooked uv chlorineuv chlorineresearch needs very few jurisdictions have established treatment requirements for potable water reuse the lack of clear treatment goals makes it difficult to design uv chlorine systems or any treatment system such goals need to be developed and they should avoid unintended bias against forms of treatment that may be at present poorly understood but which could ultimately prove to be advantageous e g the role of rcs wavelengths other than 254 nm etc disinfection credit a benefit of uv aop treatment for water reuse is the combination of chemical destruction and disinfection from uv there is no industry consensus about the degree to which a uv aop reactor for water reuse treatment might be required to provide disinfection but in california there is a proposal to use uv aop to gain a 6 log inactivation credit for giardia cryptosporidium and viruses waterboards 2021 demonstrating 6 log inactivation of an organism in a uv reactor through reactor validation testing is at the boundary of what is possible given the need to spike a challenge organism at a concentration high enough to measure a million fold reduction an alternative method to solve this problem is the combined variable approach for uv reactor validation wright et al 2020 here one or ideally more challenge organisms are used to benchmark uv reactor disinfection performance and certain operating conditions required to achieve 6 log inactivation of target pathogens are extrapolated there is some debate among experts about the conditions under which such extrapolation should be allowed but at present it is arguably the best method available to demonstrate 6 log inactivation of target organisms given the practical challenges in doing so directly another consideration for disinfection using uv aop is the action of the oxidant itself h2o2 is a relatively weak disinfectant on its own e g labatiuk et al 1993 and is generally not recognized as a viable primary disinfectant but chlorine has well established ct inactivation kinetics for predicting its contribution to disinfection at present there has been no known discussion among regulators about allowing the oxidant to be given regulatory disinfection credit it is also unclear whether the radicals and reactive species would contribute to disinfection with some studies suggesting that their concentration would be too low to contribute meaningfully mamane et al 2007 rattanakul and oguma 2017 even if their contribution were significant there would need to be a method to monitor radical reactive species concentrations in real time to allow disinfection credit to be obtained which is not possible at present research needs methods to validate and monitor uv aop reactor performance for disinfection and the role of the oxidant in disinfection need to be considered treatment performance monitoring a treatment goal for water reuse might be defined based on the theoretical destruction of a contaminant s e g 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane 6 log virus but in practice the actual destruction would not be routinely tracked since the contaminants may not be present or the analysis would be too challenging instead treatment performance is tracked using some combination of uv and oxidant dose monitoring coupled with data such as flow rate and uv transmittance uvt there are generally three approaches that can be used to monitor performance 1 control by minimum electrical energy dose eed eed kwh volume measures the power used by the uv lamps normalized to flow rate the required eed is based on performance testing at different flow uvt oxidant dose lamp power combinations that are used to define the operating window this approach assumes some minimum allowable chlorine concentration and uvt and perhaps an allowable ph range as such unless these parameters are all at their limits the system is always overdosing to some extent this is the simplest and most conservative approach 2 control by minimum dose the uv system s programmable logic controller plc calculates the required uv dose applied to the water as a function of uv lamp power flow rate and uvt using an algorithm validated via field testing similar to the eed approach it uses a fixed minimum oxidant dose and potentially limits to other parameters such as ph 3 control by calculated log reduction this is the most complex algorithm but theoretically achieves the most efficient treatment performance the plc calculations account for uv lamp power flow rate uvt oxidant concentration and potentially other water quality parameters to output the predicted log reduction of the target contaminant for those instantaneous conditions using an algorithm validated via field testing like the previous two methods as of the time of this article there is one site in california with an operating permit that uses this approach as the control method increases in complexity so does the required validation testing i e number of test conditions to verify its ability to maintain required treatment from the discussion above it s evident that a uv chlorine system must use multiple sensors to ensure sufficient treatment some important considerations are the following uvt uvt can be monitored prior to the chlorine addition point or at the entry to the uv reactor chlorine has a strong absorbance at 254 nm and at other wavelengths relevant if a mp lamp is used fig 1 so if uvt is monitored only prior to chlorine addition the plc must estimate the change in uvt due to the chlorine addition it is important to recognize that if ammonia chloramines are present in the water the uvt may change considerably as they react with chlorine in the travel time between the sampling line and the uvt monitor making the uvt reading an inaccurate estimate of what is entering the uv reactor as such travel times to the uvt monitor should either be kept very short or similar to the travel time between the sampling point and the uv reactor inlet uvt can also be monitored at the reactor exit since some uv dose algorithms can use both influent effluent values for calculation some ro permeate may have uvt values greater than 97 cm 1 requiring special uvt monitors with longer path lengths e g 2 5 cm to achieve accuracy it is not uncommon for algorithms not to take credit for uvt values above 98 due to the uncertainty in the measurement in the very high uvt range free chlorine the issues associated with measuring free chlorine when ammonia and chloramines are present have already been discussed in short care must be taken to provide a conservative estimate of free chlorine concentration entering the uv reactor as there are ongoing reactions occurring between the species as the water is travelling to both the monitor and the reactor from the sampling point as with uvt monitoring travel times to the chlorine analyzer should either be kept very short or similar to the travel time between the sampling point and the uv reactor inlet it should be repeated however that this complication only exists if ammonia chloramines are present in the ro permeate otherwise free chlorine application and monitoring is greatly simplified research needs practical experience with monitoring uv chlorine processes is limited as more systems are brought online stakeholders should disseminate the lessons learned there is limited information about real world uv chlorine installations in peer reviewed literature or trade journals o m costs uv chlorine system costing is very reactor location and configuration specific wrf 2022 reported an example comparison of estimated annual operations and maintenance costs in california for uv chlorine relative to uv h2o2 treatment of potable reuse water following ro when treating to achieve 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane destruction and 1 2 log ndma reduction fig 4 it predicts that energy costs are lower for uv chlorine than uv h2o2 but that oxidant costs for treatment are slightly higher the major difference in the costs shown in fig 4 is for quenching residual h2o2 it is assumed that such quenching is achieved by application of chlorine if there is no need to quench residual h2o2 the cost of uv h2o2 will drop significantly making the two options more comparable wrf 2022 reported that in general low pressure high output uv systems will have a higher purchase price than mp due to the greater number of lamps and ballasts required but that annual o m costs for mp systems may be in the order of 50 higher this is based on very limited data the relative cost of lp vs mp is also likely to be a function of treatment targets if ndma photolysis is required mp is more inefficient than lp because the photons emitted by mp at wavelengths greater than 254 nm are poorly absorbed by ndma however they may be efficiently absorbed by chlorine to drive chemical destruction as such mp might be more cost competitive if treatment requires only chemical oxidation and not ndma destruction more research is needed to test this theory source water quality considerations the municipal water that supplies potable reuse projects can vary widely over time depending on weather events season and sources of contribution to the collection system much of this variability may be reduced through the upstream treatment train but nonetheless careful consideration should be given to properly characterizing the range of water quality to be treated by the uv chlorine system ammonia and chloramines are particularly important to characterize if they are present in the ro permeate for reasons already explained the range of expected uvt is critical aop performance is heavily influenced by the oh and rcs scavenging capacity in the water in ro permeate the contribution of such scavenging by effluent organic matter efom is likely to be small compared to the scavenging due to the chlorine and chloramines whose concentrations can be measured or accurately predicted at the design stage as such the degree of oh scavenging in the water can be accurately predicted and its impact on treatment performance determined in contrast the scavenging of rcs by these compounds is largely unknown making overall uv chlorine treatment models uncertain research needs the role of rcs for treatment performance and their scavenging by constituents in the water is very poorly understood until more is learned it will be difficult to quantify the added benefit of these potentially useful species when designing uv chlorine treatment beyond demonstrating log removal of the target compound typically 1 4 dioxane byproducts and toxicity there is concern that the relatively high chlorine concentrations needed for uv chlorine treatment e g 2 5 mg l coupled with photolysis and the generation of rcs might lead to the formation of toxic byproducts partially mitigating this fear is that the chlorine reaction time available to form byproducts is small this is because chlorine is typically added immediately upstream of the uv reactor and a well designed reactor may lead to the almost complete destruction of the chlorine within tens of seconds nevertheless thisan area of current research there are only a

19901,this paper reports conclusions from a recent study completed for the water research foundation and the state of california to offer guidance on uv chlorine advanced oxidation for potable water reuse the fundamentals of uv chlorine advanced oxidation are discussed and lessons learned from some of the early adopters of this technology are presented important highlights include the significant impact of ammonia and chloramines on uv chlorine treatment challenges associated with predicting uv chlorine performance due to complex photochemistry and an ongoing need to monitor potential byproducts and transformation products when employing any form of advanced oxidation for potable reuse graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv chlorine aop reuse ammonia chloramines data availability no data was used for the research described in the article introduction the ultraviolet uv chlorine cl advanced oxidation process aop can be cost effective for potable water reuse treatment and is growing in popularity particularly following reverse osmosis ro as part of the so called full advanced treatment fat train of the active design and under construction potable reuse uv aop projects in the united states recently reported 76 were pursuing uv chlorine versus uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 festger et al 2021 while uv chlorine has many similarities to uv h2o2 treatment there are important differences the municipal water industry is familiar with uv h2o2 treatment due to several decades of experience but uv chlorine is new and there is a need to disseminate the recent lessons learned as well as to highlight current information gaps to allow the process to be improved the authors recently completed a study funded by the water research foundation and the state of california on uv chlorine aop in potable reuse a guidance manual to assessment and implementation wrf 2022 this mini review summarizes some of the key conclusions from this study it is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of uv based aop so the focus is on specific technical details that differentiate uv chlorine from other aops for additional general information the reader is directed to the original full report wrf 2022 or to advanced oxidation processes for water treatment fundamentals and applications stefan 2018 important fundamentals of uv chlorine photochemistry several important fundamental principles of uv chlorine photochemistry are highlighted in this section as reminders to help in understanding subsequent concepts presented in this review uv based aops work by adding an oxidant chlorine or h2o2 that absorbs uv photons and decays to form a reactive product that can destroy contaminants in the case of h2o2 decomposition the main useful product is the hydroxyl radical oh chlorine photolysis also produces oh but it also produces several reactive chlorine species rcs including cl and clo the efficiency by which uv photolysis forms these useful products depends on how well each oxidant absorbs uv photons and in turn the efficiency by which the resulting photolysis produces the oh and the rcs i e the quantum yield fig 1 illustrates that when using low pressure lp uv lamps that emit primarily at 254 nm both hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite ocl absorb photons about three times more efficiently than h2o2 on a per mole basis medium pressure mp lamps emit photons not only near 254 nm but also in the 290 350 nm range which are absorbed by hocl and ocl but not effectively by h2o2 when one mole of h2o2 absorbs one mole of photons at 254 nm it produces 1 11 mol of oh radicals i e the quantum yield is 1 11 goldstein et al 2007 the quantum yield of oh formation from chlorine photolysis is less certain reportedly ranging between 0 46 1 4 when hocl undergoes photolysis stefan 2018 chuang et al 2017 bulman et al 2019 and from 0 12 to 0 61 when ocl is photolyzed stefan 2018 furthermore the quantum yield of production of rcs via chlorine photolysis at 254 nm is uncertain with stefan et al 2018 and chuang et al 2017 reporting a quantum yield of cl formation from ocl and hocl in the order of 0 3 0 6 at 254 nm the quantum yields associated with mp uv i e with wavelengths other than 254 nm are also unreported these uncertainties suggest that models to predict the amount of oh and rcs available to treat the water under different uv chlorine treatment conditions may be inaccurate this is a current weakness of uv chlorine treatment design performance must be predicted largely on empirical and uncertain evidence more research in this area is needed an additional factor that governs both uv chlorine and uv h2o2 performance is the scavenging of the radicals and reactive species by the chlorine and h2o2 themselves oh reacts at least 4 5 times more quickly with ocl than with hocl buxton and subhani 1972 anastasio and matthew 2006 which is a contributing factor that may lead uv chlorine to be more effective at ph values below the pka of chlorine about 7 5 at 25 c where hocl predominates this has helped uv chlorine to become an attractive option for water reuse treatment that employs reverse osmosis ro ro permeate typically has a ph of 5 6 due to anti fouling acid injection and may make uv chlorine more cost effective relative to uv h2o2 ongoing research is also demonstrating that rcs species may be more effective at higher ph potentially widening the ph envelope of uv chlorine relative to uv h2o2 depending on the susceptibility of a specific contaminant to rcs reaction guo et al 2017 2022 uv chlorine may also be more efficient at higher ph if using mp uv lamps ocl is a very effective absorber of photons emitted at the higher wavelengths by mp lamps fig 1 and in particular the photolysis of ocl leads to not only oh but also to rcs zhou et al 2019 there is little reported about the performance of mp lamps at higher ph to treat contaminants particularly those susceptible to rcs reaction research needs at present uv chlorine treatment design is largely empirical many of the details of chlorine photochemistry remain unknown more data must be developed to allow accurate treatment models to be advanced such models could then be used to optimize process design ammonia chloramines nitrate and nitrite the degree of nitrification denitrification that precedes ro and advanced oxidation can be erratic unless the plant is well designed and operated for this purpose as a result the concentrations of ammonia nitrate and nitrite arriving at the ro can be widely variable and ro is an incomplete barrier against these species furthermore chloramines are often applied as an antifoulant for the ro as such there can be a mixture of all these compounds in the ro permeate the implications are discussed in the following text and in fig 2 which shows model simulations of the reactions of a fictive scenario whereby free chlorine is applied in a ro permeate containing nh3 and or nh2cl 180 s upstream of the uv reactor wrf 2022 ammonia if ammonia concentrations are high e g 1 to 2 mg n l uv chlorine treatment may be cost prohibitive due to the free chlorine demand of the ammonia lower ammonia concentrations may be acceptable but they will still exert a chlorine demand the reaction between ammonia and free chlorine is essentially instantaneous at neutral and higher ph but at ph 5 5 the reaction may take tens of seconds to complete fig 2 therefore one must account for the chlorine demand exerted by the ammonia as the water travels from the chlorine injection point to both the location of the chlorine analyzer and the entry to the uv reactor in order to accurately establish the desired free chlorine concentration entering the reactor chloramines just like ammonia chloramines exert a free chlorine demand that is not instantaneous in particular monochloramine reacts with free chlorine over several minutes at ph 5 5 to form dichloramine thus the concentration of monochloramine decreases and the concentration of dichloramine increases fig 2 this has three important implications 1 it is another complication in measuring the amount of free chlorine entering the uv reactor the free chlorine measurements must account for the travel time from the chlorine injection site to both the chlorine analyzer and the uv reactor otherwise the measured chlorine will not correspond to what is actually entering the reactor 2 monochloramine is a very strong oh scavenger k 1 0 109 m 1s 1 while dichloramine is weaker k 0 62 109 m 1s 1 anastasio and matthew 2006 the contribution of both species must be considered in terms of the overall oh scavenging in the water in the reactor but if the travel time between free chlorine addition and the reactor increases the chloramine speciation becomes arguably more favorable as monochloramine is converted to dichloramine an example of a fictive ro permeate containing a mixture of chloramines nitrate and nitrite is shown in table 1 demonstrating that the chloramines are contributing about 30 to the overall oh scavenging uv chlorine performance will therefore be strongly influenced by the amount of chloramines and the ratio of mono versus dichloramine 3 monochloramine has a molar absorption coefficient of about twice that of dichloramine at 254 nm wrf 2022 this is shown in fig 3 for a fictive ro permeate illustrating that monochloramine may be the dominant uv absorber preventing more efficient chlorine photolysis to drive the treatment process this suggests that as with point 2 allowing more time for free chlorine to convert monochloramines to dichloramine prior to the water entering the uv reactor is beneficial however more reaction time also allows more free chlorine to be consumed which is detrimental to treatment performance at present there are no readily available models that a designer can use to easily simulate and determine the optimum reaction time between the point of chlorine injection and the uv reactor for different combinations of free chlorine dose and ammonia chloramine concentration nitrite while nitrite is unlikely to exist in a uv chlorine system since it is quickly oxidized by free chlorine to nitrate it can be a problem for uv h2o2 systems nitrite is an extremely strong oh scavenger table 1 as it is a very strong radical scavenger it has a strong impact on system sizing nitrite removal prior to uv h2o2 treatment is essential there is also evidence that for very high uvt water e g 98 cm 1 consistent with ro permeate there is potential for nitrite formation inside the uv reactor from nitrate and chloramines especially for mp systems but also from lp systems stefan 2021 research needs the mathematical models used here to illustrate the influence of chloramines on uv chlorine performance were developed from experiments conducted at much longer reaction times e g tens of minutes than is relevant for uv chlorine where the kinetics over seconds to several minutes is critical there is a need to validate or recalibrate these models under short reaction times and other conditions e g ph temperature relevant to water reuse so that the impact of ammonia and chloramines on uv chlorine treatment can be accurately predicted and mitigated regulatory issues and design goals treatment processes must be designed to meet clear treatment goals if a uv aop is to treat water containing a specific contaminant such as a groundwater polluted with trichloroethylene tce the goal is comparatively straightforward the aop system can be designed based on the known or tested reactivity of that contaminant with uv and the reactive species being produced and then eventual performance can be confirmed by measuring the concentration of that contaminant in the treated water for water reuse the situation is far more complex the uv aop is to serve as a barrier against potential contaminants that may be in the water possibly with irregular frequency there is therefore complexity in establishing the initial treatment level and then also in how to monitor ongoing treatment performance once the system is installed there is no consensus on treatment goals for uv aop systems in water reuse in california uv aop for indirect potable reuse treatment following ro is required to achieve 6 log virus inactivation and 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane as a surrogate for organic microcontaminant removal if ndma is present a uv dose capable of reducing it to below the 10 ng l notification level may be a secondary treatment target as jurisdictions continue to develop and promulgate regulations other indicator compounds may be suggested the selection of treatment goals should be carefully considered because there may be unintended consequences on the resulting preference for uv chlorine treatment versus uv h2o2 or other methods and in turn on actual protection against the spectrum of pathogens and chemical contaminants for example if the treatment goal for chemical destruction were to be set at 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane reduction then both uv chlorine and uv h2o2 systems could be designed to achieve that goal while 1 4 dioxane is susceptible to destruction by oh k 2 8 109 m 1s 1 patton et al 2017 it is relatively inert to rcs chuang et al 2017 if uv chlorine and uv h2o2 were both designed to achieve the same level of oh production to achieve the same level of 1 4 dioxane destruction the rcs that are also being formed by the uv chlorine system would be reacting with and destroying some contaminants that may be in the water and which are reactive with rcs thus in reality the uv chlorine system would provide a broader treatment barrier than uv h2o2 despite both achieving equal regulatory credit based on 1 4 dioxane destruction if uv h2o2 were installed instead of uv chlorine based on cost and due only to their similar ability to destroy 1 4 dioxane the added benefit of the role of rcs would be overlooked uv chlorineuv chlorineresearch needs very few jurisdictions have established treatment requirements for potable water reuse the lack of clear treatment goals makes it difficult to design uv chlorine systems or any treatment system such goals need to be developed and they should avoid unintended bias against forms of treatment that may be at present poorly understood but which could ultimately prove to be advantageous e g the role of rcs wavelengths other than 254 nm etc disinfection credit a benefit of uv aop treatment for water reuse is the combination of chemical destruction and disinfection from uv there is no industry consensus about the degree to which a uv aop reactor for water reuse treatment might be required to provide disinfection but in california there is a proposal to use uv aop to gain a 6 log inactivation credit for giardia cryptosporidium and viruses waterboards 2021 demonstrating 6 log inactivation of an organism in a uv reactor through reactor validation testing is at the boundary of what is possible given the need to spike a challenge organism at a concentration high enough to measure a million fold reduction an alternative method to solve this problem is the combined variable approach for uv reactor validation wright et al 2020 here one or ideally more challenge organisms are used to benchmark uv reactor disinfection performance and certain operating conditions required to achieve 6 log inactivation of target pathogens are extrapolated there is some debate among experts about the conditions under which such extrapolation should be allowed but at present it is arguably the best method available to demonstrate 6 log inactivation of target organisms given the practical challenges in doing so directly another consideration for disinfection using uv aop is the action of the oxidant itself h2o2 is a relatively weak disinfectant on its own e g labatiuk et al 1993 and is generally not recognized as a viable primary disinfectant but chlorine has well established ct inactivation kinetics for predicting its contribution to disinfection at present there has been no known discussion among regulators about allowing the oxidant to be given regulatory disinfection credit it is also unclear whether the radicals and reactive species would contribute to disinfection with some studies suggesting that their concentration would be too low to contribute meaningfully mamane et al 2007 rattanakul and oguma 2017 even if their contribution were significant there would need to be a method to monitor radical reactive species concentrations in real time to allow disinfection credit to be obtained which is not possible at present research needs methods to validate and monitor uv aop reactor performance for disinfection and the role of the oxidant in disinfection need to be considered treatment performance monitoring a treatment goal for water reuse might be defined based on the theoretical destruction of a contaminant s e g 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane 6 log virus but in practice the actual destruction would not be routinely tracked since the contaminants may not be present or the analysis would be too challenging instead treatment performance is tracked using some combination of uv and oxidant dose monitoring coupled with data such as flow rate and uv transmittance uvt there are generally three approaches that can be used to monitor performance 1 control by minimum electrical energy dose eed eed kwh volume measures the power used by the uv lamps normalized to flow rate the required eed is based on performance testing at different flow uvt oxidant dose lamp power combinations that are used to define the operating window this approach assumes some minimum allowable chlorine concentration and uvt and perhaps an allowable ph range as such unless these parameters are all at their limits the system is always overdosing to some extent this is the simplest and most conservative approach 2 control by minimum dose the uv system s programmable logic controller plc calculates the required uv dose applied to the water as a function of uv lamp power flow rate and uvt using an algorithm validated via field testing similar to the eed approach it uses a fixed minimum oxidant dose and potentially limits to other parameters such as ph 3 control by calculated log reduction this is the most complex algorithm but theoretically achieves the most efficient treatment performance the plc calculations account for uv lamp power flow rate uvt oxidant concentration and potentially other water quality parameters to output the predicted log reduction of the target contaminant for those instantaneous conditions using an algorithm validated via field testing like the previous two methods as of the time of this article there is one site in california with an operating permit that uses this approach as the control method increases in complexity so does the required validation testing i e number of test conditions to verify its ability to maintain required treatment from the discussion above it s evident that a uv chlorine system must use multiple sensors to ensure sufficient treatment some important considerations are the following uvt uvt can be monitored prior to the chlorine addition point or at the entry to the uv reactor chlorine has a strong absorbance at 254 nm and at other wavelengths relevant if a mp lamp is used fig 1 so if uvt is monitored only prior to chlorine addition the plc must estimate the change in uvt due to the chlorine addition it is important to recognize that if ammonia chloramines are present in the water the uvt may change considerably as they react with chlorine in the travel time between the sampling line and the uvt monitor making the uvt reading an inaccurate estimate of what is entering the uv reactor as such travel times to the uvt monitor should either be kept very short or similar to the travel time between the sampling point and the uv reactor inlet uvt can also be monitored at the reactor exit since some uv dose algorithms can use both influent effluent values for calculation some ro permeate may have uvt values greater than 97 cm 1 requiring special uvt monitors with longer path lengths e g 2 5 cm to achieve accuracy it is not uncommon for algorithms not to take credit for uvt values above 98 due to the uncertainty in the measurement in the very high uvt range free chlorine the issues associated with measuring free chlorine when ammonia and chloramines are present have already been discussed in short care must be taken to provide a conservative estimate of free chlorine concentration entering the uv reactor as there are ongoing reactions occurring between the species as the water is travelling to both the monitor and the reactor from the sampling point as with uvt monitoring travel times to the chlorine analyzer should either be kept very short or similar to the travel time between the sampling point and the uv reactor inlet it should be repeated however that this complication only exists if ammonia chloramines are present in the ro permeate otherwise free chlorine application and monitoring is greatly simplified research needs practical experience with monitoring uv chlorine processes is limited as more systems are brought online stakeholders should disseminate the lessons learned there is limited information about real world uv chlorine installations in peer reviewed literature or trade journals o m costs uv chlorine system costing is very reactor location and configuration specific wrf 2022 reported an example comparison of estimated annual operations and maintenance costs in california for uv chlorine relative to uv h2o2 treatment of potable reuse water following ro when treating to achieve 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane destruction and 1 2 log ndma reduction fig 4 it predicts that energy costs are lower for uv chlorine than uv h2o2 but that oxidant costs for treatment are slightly higher the major difference in the costs shown in fig 4 is for quenching residual h2o2 it is assumed that such quenching is achieved by application of chlorine if there is no need to quench residual h2o2 the cost of uv h2o2 will drop significantly making the two options more comparable wrf 2022 reported that in general low pressure high output uv systems will have a higher purchase price than mp due to the greater number of lamps and ballasts required but that annual o m costs for mp systems may be in the order of 50 higher this is based on very limited data the relative cost of lp vs mp is also likely to be a function of treatment targets if ndma photolysis is required mp is more inefficient than lp because the photons emitted by mp at wavelengths greater than 254 nm are poorly absorbed by ndma however they may be efficiently absorbed by chlorine to drive chemical destruction as such mp might be more cost competitive if treatment requires only chemical oxidation and not ndma destruction more research is needed to test this theory source water quality considerations the municipal water that supplies potable reuse projects can vary widely over time depending on weather events season and sources of contribution to the collection system much of this variability may be reduced through the upstream treatment train but nonetheless careful consideration should be given to properly characterizing the range of water quality to be treated by the uv chlorine system ammonia and chloramines are particularly important to characterize if they are present in the ro permeate for reasons already explained the range of expected uvt is critical aop performance is heavily influenced by the oh and rcs scavenging capacity in the water in ro permeate the contribution of such scavenging by effluent organic matter efom is likely to be small compared to the scavenging due to the chlorine and chloramines whose concentrations can be measured or accurately predicted at the design stage as such the degree of oh scavenging in the water can be accurately predicted and its impact on treatment performance determined in contrast the scavenging of rcs by these compounds is largely unknown making overall uv chlorine treatment models uncertain research needs the role of rcs for treatment performance and their scavenging by constituents in the water is very poorly understood until more is learned it will be difficult to quantify the added benefit of these potentially useful species when designing uv chlorine treatment beyond demonstrating log removal of the target compound typically 1 4 dioxane byproducts and toxicity there is concern that the relatively high chlorine concentrations needed for uv chlorine treatment e g 2 5 mg l coupled with photolysis and the generation of rcs might lead to the formation of toxic byproducts partially mitigating this fear is that the chlorine reaction time available to form byproducts is small this is because chlorine is typically added immediately upstream of the uv reactor and a well designed reactor may lead to the almost complete destruction of the chlorine within tens of seconds nevertheless thisan area of current research there are only a few reported studies of the formation of conventional drinking water disinfection byproducts dbps from uv chlorine wang et al 2015 2019 and evaluated conventional dbp formation in bench pilot and full

19902,this study removes two technical constraints for transitioning full scale activated sludge infrastructure to continuous flow aerobic granular sludge ags facilities the first of these is the loss of treatment capacity as a result of the rapid washout of flocculent sludge inventory and in turn the potential loss of nitrification during initial ags reactor startup the second is the physical selector design which currently is limited to either the complex sequencing batch reactor selection or sidestream hydrocyclones briefly real wastewater data collected from this study suggested that by increasing the surface overflow rate sor of an upflow clarifier to 10 m h 1 the clarifier can be taken advantage of as a physical selector to separate flocculant sludge from ags redirecting the physical selector underflow and overflow sludge to the feast and famine zones of a treatment train respectively can create a biological selection that not only promotes ags formation but also safeguards the effluent quality throughout the ags reactor startup period this study provides a novel concept for economically implementing continuous flow ags within existing full scale continuous flow treatment trains graphical abstract image graphical abstract a schematic and b photographic illustration of a smart strategy of physical and biological selection integration for the startup of a pilot scale continuous flow aerobic granular sludge reactor without treatment interruption keywords continuous flow aerobic granulation selector srt feast famine sor 1 introduction nearly all full scale aerobic granular sludge ags cultivation has been achieved through the application of sequencing batch selectors to wash out slow settling bioflocs as a means to drive fast settling ags formation kent et al 2018 unless fully seeded with ags sequencing batch reactors sbrs or continuous flow reactors are expected to suffer poor treatment performance during startup as a result of substantial sludge washout in the course of flocculent sludge transformation into an ags morphology sun et al 2019 in full scale applications wastewater resource recovery facilities wrrfs cannot withstand such a treatment capacity interruption even if it is temporary and have to comply with discharge permit limits all the time although this problem can be mitigated by initially inoculating reactors with ags it is almost impossible to find adequate local supplies of seed ags given the current state of the technology adding to this startup difficulty the challenge to provide an external settling velocity selection that can promote swift aerobic granulation in full scale continuous systems by specifically targeting the separation of large and dense ags particles is another technical barrier hydrocyclones have been employed to provide such a selection pressure however their relatively low hydraulic capacity e g 120 3360 m3 d 1 limits their application in large systems to sidestream return activated sludge ras where only a small portion e g 5 7 of the ras flow can be processed for physical selection avila et al 2021 partin 2019 regmi et al 2022 this low strength selection pressure plus the high suspended solids content in ras e g 5000 mg l 1 compromised the physical selection efficiency of hydrocyclones for ags ford et al 2016 as a result a prolonged startup phase perhaps as long as a year was required to observe significant sludge settleability improvements in full scale continuous flow reactors in which ags formation is still a challenge ford et al 2016 kent et al 2018 roche et al 2022 welling et al 2015 wett et al 2015 for this reason an alternative strategy should be developed to provide sufficient selection strength to promote successful continuous flow ags formation while maintaining the startup treatment performance required for large full scale applications this study aimed to address these two technical challenges in one design illustrated in fig 1 it is our hypothesis that clarifiers or other clarifier like structures might be used to provide the physical selection on sludge settling velocity needed by increasing the surface overflow rate sor to 10 m h 1 a 10 m h 1 selective settling velocity has been proven to be a physical selection strong enough to drive continuous flow aerobic granulation when a sequencing batch selector was used sun et al 2021 2019 in addition to this physical selection our previous studies also concluded that having a feast to famine duration ratio 0 30 is conductive to sludge settleability improvement even when physical selection strength was not strong enough an et al 2021b hence it is also our hypothesis that the feast famine conditions investigated in our previous studies can be taken advantage of to provide biological selection internal to the bioreactors by redirecting the underflow and overflow of the physical velocity selector to the feast and famine zones of the treatment train respectively although the roles of feast famine conditions and the settling velocity selection have been reported in previous studies kent et al 2018 a smart strategy of physical and biological selection integration into one continuous flow system fed with real wastewater for achieving both ags formation and effluent quality safeguarding during reactor startup has not been developed before this study is aimed to provide such a novel approach to enable full scale applications of continuous flow ags technology with reasonable infrastructure modifications 2 results 2 1 upflow selection the effectiveness of a continuous upflow selector in separating bioparticles based on their physical settleability was investigated in this study the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss distribution along the height of the upflow selector is shown in fig 2 a b c and d which was used as an indicator of its particle separation performance and monitored over 197 days of the pfr operation as can be seen from fig 2a on the 25th day after the startup there was only a slight mlss difference e g 300 mg l 1 between the underflow and overflow indicating poor separation efficiency probably due to the lack of sludge densification or granulation to drive aerobic granulation solids retention time srt was gradually reduced from 10 days to 5 days within the next two months according to fig 2e it is noteworthy that other than the minor loss of solids in the final clarifier effluent biofloc wasting through srt control is the only outlet for bioflocs to be removed from the pfr system fig 1 as a consequence both mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss concentrations in the pfr gradually decreased in fig 2f corresponding to the srt decrease in fig 2e this srt reduction led to gradual improvement of the mlss distribution along the height of the upflow selector as shown in fig 2b to c as flocculent sludge was preferentially wasted from the system the accidental sludge loss events on days 36 and 85 shown in fig 2f were due to tubing leakage which was quickly fixed on the same day by day 107 after startup the difference in mlss between the underflow and overflow increased to 2923 mg l 1 with only 1080 mg l 1 mlss remaining in the overflow and 4003 mg l 1 mlss partitioned into the underflow fig 2c this clear mlss gradient in the upflow selector remained throughout the rest of the experiment fig 2d demonstrating that excellent separation efficiency was achieved in the continuous upflow selector as the sludge settleability steadily improved over the course of the experiment fig 1 as would be expected with separation efficiency improvement the ratio between biomass partitioned into the upflow selector underflow and overflow gradually increased from an undesirable value of 0 3 to an acceptable value of 1 2 over the rest of the experiment fig 2g it was apparent that a large portion of the sludge biomass gradually transformed into larger and denser bioparticles that were continuously retained and returned to the feast zone fig 1a in order to confirm this observation particle size distributions of the sludge in the overflow and underflow of the upflow selector were compared on day 197 in fig 3 a as can be seen the particle size distribution in the underflow showed two peaks with almost equal height i e a peak around 250 µm representing more dispersed bioflocs and another peak around 1000 µm representing compact ags in contrast the particle size distribution in the overflow only showed one peak around 250 µm indicating only bioflocs were in the overflow these particle size distributions were confirmed by photomicrographs of sludge morphologies sampled from the upflow selector overflow and underflow as shown in fig 3e and f large and dense ags were co mingled with bioflocs in the underflow while only bioflocs were present in the overflow one can conclude that a 10 m h 1 sor provided sufficient physical velocity selection to separate ags from bioflocs this good separation efficiency provides a prerequisite for dense ags and light bioflocs to be further subjected to internal biological selection by returning them to the feast and famine zones of the bioreactor respectively fig 1 on days 183 and 197 the carbonaceous specific oxygen uptake rates sourcod and nitrogenous sourn of the sludges were measured in the upflow selector by sampling along the height of the column as shown in fig 4 the column inflow i e upflow selection starts at an entry point 50 cm below the overflow surface all samples collected above this point had significantly greater sourcod than those collected below it p 0 05 indicating that the majority of bioflocs that were washed out with overflow were enriched with heterotrophic bacteria fig 4a conversely sludge samples collected below this entry point were the denser more compact ags demonstrating significantly greater sourn than those collected above it p 0 05 indicating the heavier bioparticles retained in the underflow were enriched with nitrifying bacteria fig 4b since srt was controlled by wasting the flocculent sludge in the upflow selector overflow fig 1a the flocculent sludge srt is expected to have a shorter srt than that of the bulk mixed liquor sludge and significantly shorter than that of the granular sludge which was retained almost indefinitely this is one explanation for why the fast growing heterotrophic microbes dominated the overflow biomass while the slow growing nitrifying bacteria partitioned to the underflow fig 4 2 2 feast famine selection the in situ oxygen uptake rate our and soluble cod scod profiles measured in all chambers of the pfr are shown in fig 5 a as can be seen ours in the first two chambers were substantially greater than those in the rest chambers fig 5a indicating the first two chambers were in the feast zone while the rest of the reactor chambers were more or less in famine condition this observation is supported by the scod profile in fig 5a which shows the majority of the readily biodegradable scod was removed in the first two chambers leaving mostly refractory scod in downstream chambers the scod removal efficiency profiles in fig 5b measured throughout the 197 days of experiment further confirm that the great majority of the scod was removed in the first two chambers these profiles evidenced a clear segregation between feast and famine zones throughout the period of reactor operation as a matter of fact a feast to famine duration ratio of 0 25 as estimated from fig 5a of this test was confirmed to be an optimum feast to famine ratio for boosting aerobic granulation in both sbrs and pfrs an et al 2021b this disparate substrate availability and microbial activity distribution between the feast and famine zones created a selective condition to favor biological selection toward ags growth while suppressing the growth of dispersed bioflocs particularly under the designed sludge return configuration shown in fig 1 in the field of aerobic granulation research it is well known that bioflocs are very competitive in utilizing readily biodegradable substrates for their looser structure and higher specific surface area tay et al 2002 hence such a selective condition is required for aerobic granule sludge formation kent et al 2018 i e returning final clarifier overflow biomass together with underflow biomass into the same feast zone would have eliminated such a selective condition and failed aerobic granulation unless a rapid washout of bioflocs is practiced which unfortunately led to the loss of treatment capacity during startup sun et al 2019 one can see from fig 2g that by segregating upflow selector return sludge to the feast zone and the final clarifier return sludge to the famine zone the ratio of biomass particitioned into the underflow over overflow quickly increased over time more of the sludge inventory became heavier and was retained in the upflow selector underflow as it was returned to the feast zone where it benefited from a competitive substrate advantage while dispersed flocculent sludge was outselected through starvation and sludge wasting fig 1 2 3 the evolution of sludge settleability fig 5c shows that the zone settling velocity vzs of seed sludge was only 2 m h 1 unlike the radical vzs improvement achieved in a previous study without bioflocs return sun et al 2019 the srt control practiced in this study showed a slower improvement in sludge settleability after 162 days of sludge acclimation to the experimental conditions vzs gradually increased to 10 m h 1 which is the designed sor of the upflow selector fig 5c the sludge volume index namely svi30 and svi5 svi30 have been collectively used to evaluate the extent of granular sludge formation kent et al 2018 pronk et al 2015 technically granular sludge should possess svi30 60 ml g 1 and a svi5 svi30 ratio approaching 1 0 respectively fig 5d shows that svi30 was stabilized around 60 65 ml g 1 after 120 days which was half the svi30 value of the initial seed sludge the svi5 svi30 ratio also decreased from 2 0 to 1 2 after 197 days fig 5e evidencing good progression of successful continuous flow ags 2 4 effluent quality in upper occoquan service authority uosa a high lime process is used to flocculate phosphorus in tertiary treatment and nitrate needs to be discharged to the downstream occoquan reservoir to maintain an oxidized environment in the bottom waters for eutrophication prevention for this reason only scod and ammonia removal are targeted in the secondary treatment process investigated in this study fig 5f and g show that both scod and ammonia removal efficiencies were maintained at acceptable levels e g 75 and 100 throughout 197 days of the ags pfr startup period there were two exceptions resulting from unintended sludge inventory losses on two individual days because the tubing leakage fig 2f similarly the final clarifier effluent total suspended solids concentration tss was also controlled in an acceptable range throughout the 197 day test duration and stabilized around 30 mg l 1 fig 5h the wall effect in the small clarifier used in the study fig 1 might have aggravated the effluent tss and can be avoided in full scale clarifiers moreover the tertiary lime flocculation and clarifiers in full scale application will also further strengthen the tss removal one remarkable observation was that a five day bulk srt would normally be considered too short to sustain reliable nitrification in a bioreactor liu and wang 2014 poduska and andrews 1975 yet 100 nitrification efficiency was achieved throughout the experiment fig 5g it can be inferred that a majority of the nitrifying bacteria were immobilized in the ags returned from the upflow selector underflow resulting in a much longer srt for the denser sludge retained in the system observations from fig 4b are in line with this inference 2 5 continuous upflow selector versus sequencing batch selector sequencing batch selector operation has been commonly used to provide the physical selection needed to drive ags formation kent et al 2018 in a previous study a sequencing batch selector was used in concert with continuous flow feast famine selection to achieve successful continuous flow ags formation an et al 2021a the sequencing batch selector was made of a column similar to the one used as a upflow selector in this study fig 1 but it was operated in a sequencing batch mode with a cycle of one minute of feeding four minutes of settling one minute of overflow discharge followed by another minute of underflow discharge the volume exchange ratio of the sequencing batch selector was set at 50 with a discharging height of 65 cm to provide a selective settling velocity of about 10 m h 1 which is same as the sor of the upflow selector used in this study in an attempt to compare the effectiveness of the two types of physical selectors in separating desired bioparticles under the same selective settling velocity the particle size distributions for the two selector inflows overflows and underflows were plotted in fig 3a and b in order to make a fair comparison results based on a similar inflow particle size distribution were selected and presented technically the selector separation efficiency should be inversely related to the overlapping area between the overflow and underflow i e the same size particles ending up in both overflow and underflow indicates poor separation efficiencies conversely a 100 separation efficiency between bioflocs and ags would leave zero overlapping area in particle size distribution between the two streams fig 3a and b because the inflow entry point was located at 30 cm above the bottom of the continuous selector used in this study a portion of bioflocs may escape upflow selection through gravity settling into this 30 cm stagnant bottom space as illustrated in fig 3c likewise it is known that an sbr with a 50 volume exchange should have at least 50 bioflocs unselected due to gravity settling within the space below the effluent port as illustrated in fig 3d as a result those bioflocs escaping the selector overflow contributed to the overlapping area in fig 3a and b because a continuous upflow selector can be designed with an inflow entry point closer to the bottom its particle separation should be more complete with less bioflocs escaping the selection this assumption is supported by the results in fig 3a and b i e the bioflocs escaping the physical selectors made up 39 and 59 of the total bioflocs that should have been washed out with the overflow from the continuous upflow selector and sequencing batch selector respectively these results indicate a much better separation efficiency in the former than latter theoretically this separation efficiency in a continuous upflow selector could be improved by moving the inflow entry point further down to the column bottom in full scale design fig 3c 3 discussion 3 1 the synergy between physical and biological selection there is a consensus that ags formation is driven by selection pressure that selectively reduces the persistence of bioflocs in a bioreactor kent et al 2018 since srt control is the only managed sludge outlet in the reactor shown in fig 1 and the flocculent sludge was the only type of sludge wasted the successful continuous ags demonstrated in fig 2 through 5 was driven by the srt controlled wasting that imposed outselection pressure only on the flocculent sludge portion of the biomass inventory this can be seen from the srt dependent key metrics for ags such as svi30 svi5 svi30 vzs and selector underflow overflow biomass ratios in fig 6 it appears that only when the bulk srt was less than 5 5 days could ags formation be achieved for example only after the reactor srt was controlled below 5 5 days the svi30 and svi5 svi30 started to drop to 60 ml g 1 and 1 1 respectively which are typically considered as the characteristics of ags figs 2e 5d e and 6a one should be aware that the actual srt of the flocculent sludge portion of the biomass should be much shorter than 5 5 days while that of the ags portion retained in the system should be longer both of which were factored in the overall bulk srt calculated for the reactor biomass inventory this conclusion is supported by the distinctive distribution of heterotrophic and nitrifying microorganisms in the overflow and underflow in fig 4 the dominance of nitrifying bacteria in the underflow of hydrocyclone system by selectively overflow sludge wasting for srt control has also been observed in one recent study regmi et al 2022 the enrichment of nitrifying population in the granules through srt control 5 5 days could also explain the seattleability improvement in terms of svi30 svi5 svi30 and vzs in fig 6 the slow growing microorganisms were reported to facilitate the formation of granules liu et al 2004 xia et al 2007 since the srts of dense granules and bioflocs were not able to be differentially controlled in previous granulation studies in sbrs especially during the reactor startup the srt was usually not considered as a decisive factor for aerobic granulation li et al 2008 however the novel arrangement in the fig 1 setup offered the possibility for srt deviation of ags and flocculant sludge the short srt of flocculent sludge realized significant outselection of this type of biomass while the retention and recirculation of ags resulted in their persistence and dominance in the sludge bed fig 2g therefore the srt control provided sufficient selection pressure resulting in the continuous flow ags formation by selectively retaining the slow growing bioparticles for granule settleability improvement in contrast to the physical selection provided by the upflow selector external to the bioreactors biological selection internal to the reactor imposed by separately returning heavier ags and lighter bioflocs to the feast and famine zones respectively further boosted biofloc outselection by subjecting bioflocs to low substrate availability fig 5a and b this is a novel application of internal selection pressure has not been widely accepted in full scale applications to our knowledge existing hydrocyclone installed treatment trains return a mixture of dense sludge hydrocyclone underflow and lighter bioflocs final clarifier sludge return to feast zones without attempting to differentiate their substrate availability avila et al 2021 partin 2019 regmi et al 2022 according to fig 4a the physical upflow selector overflow was mainly comprised of fast growing heterotrophic bacteria theoretically it would be more difficult and take much longer time to outselect these bioflocs if they were provided a competitive growth advantage by exposing them to the same high substrate availability as that of the ags which grow and develop at a much lower rate due to mass diffusion limitation if this more conventionally applied bioflocs to ags transition setup were applied the external physical selector would be the only driving force to transform flocculent sludge to ags and thus a much more radical biofloc washout type of short srt would have to be employed sun et al 2019 even with the sidestream hydrocyclone installation only 5 7 of the ras can be subjective to physical selection avila et al 2021 partin 2019 regmi et al 2022 leaving majority of the bioflocs and ags unseparated in the ras returned to the feast zone where bioflocs gain more growth advantage over ags which explains the slow startup period e g one year needed to observe sludge settleability improvement ford et al 2016 kent et al 2018 roche et al 2022 welling et al 2015 wett et al 2015 one may propagate the approach to only return hydrocyclone underflow to the feast zone deferring the rest ras to the famine zone given the minor sludge inventory that can be produced from the hydrocyclone underflow the viability of this approach to establish a feast zone solely for ags s advantage is questionable in contrast the setup with continuous upflow selector used in this study through the increase of clarifier sor is capable of providing holistically physical selection on all existing sludge inventory which explains the prompt startup of the continuous granulation system fig 5c d and e it is well known that bioflocs are very competitive in utilizing readily available substrates for a number of reasons they can outcompete ags because of their looser structure and higher specific surface area that promotes fast substrate diffusion and utilization tay et al 2002 therefore returning both sludges to the same feast zone as conventionally practiced to date is counterproductive to the progression and stabilization of continuous flow ags systems for this reason extremely short srts e g 0 3 0 4 days had to be employed with such a conventional approach to rid the biomass inventory of bioflocs in a radical way cofré et al 2018 sun et al 2019 as an undesirable consequence the mlvss in a bioreactor subjected to such a radically short srt will also have a dramatic reduction in performance resulting in poor effluent quality cofré et al 2018 sun et al 2019 for example an srt as short as 0 3 days had to be imposed to drive continuous flow ags formation in one of our previous studies resulting in an initial mlvss as low as 300 mg l 1 and poor effluent quality associated with only 31 cod and 6 ammonia removal sun et al 2019 this performance loss resulting from the drastic outselection pressure necessary for ags formation can be resolved by incorporating a strategy that manages to separate the srts of flocculent sludge and ags while incorporating reactor internal biological selection through controlling f m regimes for the distinctly different sludge forms i e selective ags and biofloc returns to feast and famine zones respectively this strategy is shown schematically in fig 1 superimposing this second selection pressure to a bioreactor allowed aerobic granulation to be achieved at a relatively higher srt and mlvss levels to safeguard the effluent quality throughout the reactor startup phase without treatment interruption fig 5f g and h the concept of leveraging such feast famine conditions should be of interest to designers considering a transition from conventional activated sludge processes to continuous flow ags systems in particular by examining if existing bioreactors can accommodate the methods developed herein and described in a previous study an et al 2021b 3 2 implication on full scale physical selector design at present the most popular continuous flow physical selector employed in wrrfs is hydrocyclones which are currently limited to sidestream wasting applications due to technology sizing limitations and associated costs partin 2019 wett et al 2015 uosa in the u s has also employed hydrocyclones to successfully enhance its full scale activated sludge settleability as designed only 5 of the ras was processed through the hydrocyclones with such a weak selection only moderate sludge settleability improvements were observed over 23 months of operation however a true shift to a purely continuous flow ags system has not been observed in contrast it only took 197 days to achieve true measures of a continuous flow ags formation with the same primary effluent pe in this pilot study the key difference can be attributed to subjecting 100 of the mainstream mixed liquor flow to the selection pressure of the continuous upflow selector shown in fig 1 the continuous upflow selector tested in this study demonstrated that a mainstream physical selector can be developed for full scale continuous ags applications particularly for green field sites upflow selectors are more suitable and practical than the sequencing batch selectors tested in a prior study sun et al 2019 especially for high flow rate continuous flow wastewater treatment systems kent et al 2018 the concept of continuous upflow selector is not new as it has been used in full scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors for decades frankin 2001 however it was for the first time fully explored in this study to apply it for strategic biofloc outselection using a managed srt control approach to drive continuous flow ags formation without performance loss during the startup phase figs 1 and 2 this study has helped the field understand that an external continuous upflow selector provides excellent solid separation efficiency and may be a good choice for full scale applications where stronger selection pressure is needed for faster transitions from conventional activated sludge to ags fig 5c to e the upflow selector incorporated into the fig 1 design mimics a conventional clarifier with a very high sor so there may in some cases be the flexibility to rearrange and repurpose existing clarifier structures within wrrfs to act as external physical selectors subject to available water head following the same concept lamella plate settlers may also be considered for high flow continuous flow settling velocity selection in the mainstream application faraji et al 2013 li et al 2014 results from this study suggest that a high capacity physical external upflow selector should be explored for full scale applications to be used in concert with biological feast famine selection internal to the bioreactors this may provide the added selection pressure that designers are looking for to expedite the transition from conventional activated sludge to continuous flow ags in full scale wastewater treatment trains 4 conclusions the following concluding remarks can be drawn from this study 1 an external continuous upflow selector that incorporates managed srt control coupled with internal feast famine bioreactor selection proved effectiveness in promoting continuous flow ags formation in real domestic wastewater without treatment interruption during ags reactor startup 2 srt control through managed wasting of the flocculent sludge in the overflow from a upflow selector was successfully used as a selection pressure to drive continuous flow ags without compromising system performance or final clarifier effluent quality 3 heterotrophic and nitrifying microorganisms dominated the upflow selector overflow and underflow biomass respectively this was explained by the actual srt difference between the wasted flocculent sludge portion of the biomass and the ags portion of biomass retained in the system 4 intelligently routing the sludge returns of ags to feast zones and flocculent sludge to famine zones resulted in biological selection internal to the bioreactor this biological selection was applied to boost the physical selection pressure obtained with the upflow selector which also safeguarded the effluent quality throughout the reactor startup period without treatment performance degradation or interruption 5 in existing wrrfs considering ags application secondary clarifiers hold the potential to be reconfigured to provide external physical settling velocity selection by manipulating sors 5 materials and methods 5 1 reactor design and operation a pfr with the design and setup illustrated in fig 1 was operated onsite in uosa a wrrf located in centreville va usa the pe from the primary clarifiers of uosa was fed to the pfr through gravity flow without any pretreatment the pfr with a 140 l total working volume was made of 10 completely mixed chambers connected in series to create feast famine conditions along the gravity flow direction fig 1 the hydraulic retention time of the pfr was controlled at 6 5 h similar to that of the full scale secondary process at uosa all chambers were aerated with dissolved oxygen do 2 mg l 1 at a flow rate of 3 l min 1 in each chamber meanwhile aeration also provided homogenous mixing in each chamber as shown in fig 1 a continuous upflow column with an internal diameter of 8 cm and a total working height of 80 cm was installed at the end of the pfr to mimic a high rate clarifier the column inflow i e the mixed liquor from the pfr effluent continuously entered at a height of 30 cm from the column bottom and then flowed up for 50 cm before overflowing from the top of the upflow column fig 1a the sor of this column was set at 10 m h 1 to separate the sludge particles based on their settling velocity theoretically only those particles with a settling velocity greater than 10 m h 1 can be retained within the underflow of the upflow selector and returned to the first feast zone chamber of the pfr fig 1a the unsettled bioflocs in the overflow were sent to another clarifier designed with a more typical sor of 1 m h 1 a portion of bioflocs settled under this low sor was wasted on a daily basis for srt control fig 1a the remainder of the flocculent sludge was returned to the first famine zone of the pfr as shown in fig 1a the flow rate ratio of selector overflow to underflow was set at about 1 6 an airlifting method was used to return sludges by blowing the settled sludge through tubings into either the feast or famine zones according to the flow design in fig 1 sun et al 2019 5 2 analytical methods do was measured using an hq40d meter hach loveland co usa the

financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
19902,this study removes two technical constraints for transitioning full scale activated sludge infrastructure to continuous flow aerobic granular sludge ags facilities the first of these is the loss of treatment capacity as a result of the rapid washout of flocculent sludge inventory and in turn the potential loss of nitrification during initial ags reactor startup the second is the physical selector design which currently is limited to either the complex sequencing batch reactor selection or sidestream hydrocyclones briefly real wastewater data collected from this study suggested that by increasing the surface overflow rate sor of an upflow clarifier to 10 m h 1 the clarifier can be taken advantage of as a physical selector to separate flocculant sludge from ags redirecting the physical selector underflow and overflow sludge to the feast and famine zones of a treatment train respectively can create a biological selection that not only promotes ags formation but also safeguards the effluent quality throughout the ags reactor startup period this study provides a novel concept for economically implementing continuous flow ags within existing full scale continuous flow treatment trains graphical abstract image graphical abstract a schematic and b photographic illustration of a smart strategy of physical and biological selection integration for the startup of a pilot scale continuous flow aerobic granular sludge reactor without treatment interruption keywords continuous flow aerobic granulation selector srt feast famine sor 1 introduction nearly all full scale aerobic granular sludge ags cultivation has been achieved through the application of sequencing batch selectors to wash out slow settling bioflocs as a means to drive fast settling ags formation kent et al 2018 unless fully seeded with ags sequencing batch reactors sbrs or continuous flow reactors are expected to suffer poor treatment performance during startup as a result of substantial sludge washout in the course of flocculent sludge transformation into an ags morphology sun et al 2019 in full scale applications wastewater resource recovery facilities wrrfs cannot withstand such a treatment capacity interruption even if it is temporary and have to comply with discharge permit limits all the time although this problem can be mitigated by initially inoculating reactors with ags it is almost impossible to find adequate local supplies of seed ags given the current state of the technology adding to this startup difficulty the challenge to provide an external settling velocity selection that can promote swift aerobic granulation in full scale continuous systems by specifically targeting the separation of large and dense ags particles is another technical barrier hydrocyclones have been employed to provide such a selection pressure however their relatively low hydraulic capacity e g 120 3360 m3 d 1 limits their application in large systems to sidestream return activated sludge ras where only a small portion e g 5 7 of the ras flow can be processed for physical selection avila et al 2021 partin 2019 regmi et al 2022 this low strength selection pressure plus the high suspended solids content in ras e g 5000 mg l 1 compromised the physical selection efficiency of hydrocyclones for ags ford et al 2016 as a result a prolonged startup phase perhaps as long as a year was required to observe significant sludge settleability improvements in full scale continuous flow reactors in which ags formation is still a challenge ford et al 2016 kent et al 2018 roche et al 2022 welling et al 2015 wett et al 2015 for this reason an alternative strategy should be developed to provide sufficient selection strength to promote successful continuous flow ags formation while maintaining the startup treatment performance required for large full scale applications this study aimed to address these two technical challenges in one design illustrated in fig 1 it is our hypothesis that clarifiers or other clarifier like structures might be used to provide the physical selection on sludge settling velocity needed by increasing the surface overflow rate sor to 10 m h 1 a 10 m h 1 selective settling velocity has been proven to be a physical selection strong enough to drive continuous flow aerobic granulation when a sequencing batch selector was used sun et al 2021 2019 in addition to this physical selection our previous studies also concluded that having a feast to famine duration ratio 0 30 is conductive to sludge settleability improvement even when physical selection strength was not strong enough an et al 2021b hence it is also our hypothesis that the feast famine conditions investigated in our previous studies can be taken advantage of to provide biological selection internal to the bioreactors by redirecting the underflow and overflow of the physical velocity selector to the feast and famine zones of the treatment train respectively although the roles of feast famine conditions and the settling velocity selection have been reported in previous studies kent et al 2018 a smart strategy of physical and biological selection integration into one continuous flow system fed with real wastewater for achieving both ags formation and effluent quality safeguarding during reactor startup has not been developed before this study is aimed to provide such a novel approach to enable full scale applications of continuous flow ags technology with reasonable infrastructure modifications 2 results 2 1 upflow selection the effectiveness of a continuous upflow selector in separating bioparticles based on their physical settleability was investigated in this study the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss distribution along the height of the upflow selector is shown in fig 2 a b c and d which was used as an indicator of its particle separation performance and monitored over 197 days of the pfr operation as can be seen from fig 2a on the 25th day after the startup there was only a slight mlss difference e g 300 mg l 1 between the underflow and overflow indicating poor separation efficiency probably due to the lack of sludge densification or granulation to drive aerobic granulation solids retention time srt was gradually reduced from 10 days to 5 days within the next two months according to fig 2e it is noteworthy that other than the minor loss of solids in the final clarifier effluent biofloc wasting through srt control is the only outlet for bioflocs to be removed from the pfr system fig 1 as a consequence both mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss concentrations in the pfr gradually decreased in fig 2f corresponding to the srt decrease in fig 2e this srt reduction led to gradual improvement of the mlss distribution along the height of the upflow selector as shown in fig 2b to c as flocculent sludge was preferentially wasted from the system the accidental sludge loss events on days 36 and 85 shown in fig 2f were due to tubing leakage which was quickly fixed on the same day by day 107 after startup the difference in mlss between the underflow and overflow increased to 2923 mg l 1 with only 1080 mg l 1 mlss remaining in the overflow and 4003 mg l 1 mlss partitioned into the underflow fig 2c this clear mlss gradient in the upflow selector remained throughout the rest of the experiment fig 2d demonstrating that excellent separation efficiency was achieved in the continuous upflow selector as the sludge settleability steadily improved over the course of the experiment fig 1 as would be expected with separation efficiency improvement the ratio between biomass partitioned into the upflow selector underflow and overflow gradually increased from an undesirable value of 0 3 to an acceptable value of 1 2 over the rest of the experiment fig 2g it was apparent that a large portion of the sludge biomass gradually transformed into larger and denser bioparticles that were continuously retained and returned to the feast zone fig 1a in order to confirm this observation particle size distributions of the sludge in the overflow and underflow of the upflow selector were compared on day 197 in fig 3 a as can be seen the particle size distribution in the underflow showed two peaks with almost equal height i e a peak around 250 µm representing more dispersed bioflocs and another peak around 1000 µm representing compact ags in contrast the particle size distribution in the overflow only showed one peak around 250 µm indicating only bioflocs were in the overflow these particle size distributions were confirmed by photomicrographs of sludge morphologies sampled from the upflow selector overflow and underflow as shown in fig 3e and f large and dense ags were co mingled with bioflocs in the underflow while only bioflocs were present in the overflow one can conclude that a 10 m h 1 sor provided sufficient physical velocity selection to separate ags from bioflocs this good separation efficiency provides a prerequisite for dense ags and light bioflocs to be further subjected to internal biological selection by returning them to the feast and famine zones of the bioreactor respectively fig 1 on days 183 and 197 the carbonaceous specific oxygen uptake rates sourcod and nitrogenous sourn of the sludges were measured in the upflow selector by sampling along the height of the column as shown in fig 4 the column inflow i e upflow selection starts at an entry point 50 cm below the overflow surface all samples collected above this point had significantly greater sourcod than those collected below it p 0 05 indicating that the majority of bioflocs that were washed out with overflow were enriched with heterotrophic bacteria fig 4a conversely sludge samples collected below this entry point were the denser more compact ags demonstrating significantly greater sourn than those collected above it p 0 05 indicating the heavier bioparticles retained in the underflow were enriched with nitrifying bacteria fig 4b since srt was controlled by wasting the flocculent sludge in the upflow selector overflow fig 1a the flocculent sludge srt is expected to have a shorter srt than that of the bulk mixed liquor sludge and significantly shorter than that of the granular sludge which was retained almost indefinitely this is one explanation for why the fast growing heterotrophic microbes dominated the overflow biomass while the slow growing nitrifying bacteria partitioned to the underflow fig 4 2 2 feast famine selection the in situ oxygen uptake rate our and soluble cod scod profiles measured in all chambers of the pfr are shown in fig 5 a as can be seen ours in the first two chambers were substantially greater than those in the rest chambers fig 5a indicating the first two chambers were in the feast zone while the rest of the reactor chambers were more or less in famine condition this observation is supported by the scod profile in fig 5a which shows the majority of the readily biodegradable scod was removed in the first two chambers leaving mostly refractory scod in downstream chambers the scod removal efficiency profiles in fig 5b measured throughout the 197 days of experiment further confirm that the great majority of the scod was removed in the first two chambers these profiles evidenced a clear segregation between feast and famine zones throughout the period of reactor operation as a matter of fact a feast to famine duration ratio of 0 25 as estimated from fig 5a of this test was confirmed to be an optimum feast to famine ratio for boosting aerobic granulation in both sbrs and pfrs an et al 2021b this disparate substrate availability and microbial activity distribution between the feast and famine zones created a selective condition to favor biological selection toward ags growth while suppressing the growth of dispersed bioflocs particularly under the designed sludge return configuration shown in fig 1 in the field of aerobic granulation research it is well known that bioflocs are very competitive in utilizing readily biodegradable substrates for their looser structure and higher specific surface area tay et al 2002 hence such a selective condition is required for aerobic granule sludge formation kent et al 2018 i e returning final clarifier overflow biomass together with underflow biomass into the same feast zone would have eliminated such a selective condition and failed aerobic granulation unless a rapid washout of bioflocs is practiced which unfortunately led to the loss of treatment capacity during startup sun et al 2019 one can see from fig 2g that by segregating upflow selector return sludge to the feast zone and the final clarifier return sludge to the famine zone the ratio of biomass particitioned into the underflow over overflow quickly increased over time more of the sludge inventory became heavier and was retained in the upflow selector underflow as it was returned to the feast zone where it benefited from a competitive substrate advantage while dispersed flocculent sludge was outselected through starvation and sludge wasting fig 1 2 3 the evolution of sludge settleability fig 5c shows that the zone settling velocity vzs of seed sludge was only 2 m h 1 unlike the radical vzs improvement achieved in a previous study without bioflocs return sun et al 2019 the srt control practiced in this study showed a slower improvement in sludge settleability after 162 days of sludge acclimation to the experimental conditions vzs gradually increased to 10 m h 1 which is the designed sor of the upflow selector fig 5c the sludge volume index namely svi30 and svi5 svi30 have been collectively used to evaluate the extent of granular sludge formation kent et al 2018 pronk et al 2015 technically granular sludge should possess svi30 60 ml g 1 and a svi5 svi30 ratio approaching 1 0 respectively fig 5d shows that svi30 was stabilized around 60 65 ml g 1 after 120 days which was half the svi30 value of the initial seed sludge the svi5 svi30 ratio also decreased from 2 0 to 1 2 after 197 days fig 5e evidencing good progression of successful continuous flow ags 2 4 effluent quality in upper occoquan service authority uosa a high lime process is used to flocculate phosphorus in tertiary treatment and nitrate needs to be discharged to the downstream occoquan reservoir to maintain an oxidized environment in the bottom waters for eutrophication prevention for this reason only scod and ammonia removal are targeted in the secondary treatment process investigated in this study fig 5f and g show that both scod and ammonia removal efficiencies were maintained at acceptable levels e g 75 and 100 throughout 197 days of the ags pfr startup period there were two exceptions resulting from unintended sludge inventory losses on two individual days because the tubing leakage fig 2f similarly the final clarifier effluent total suspended solids concentration tss was also controlled in an acceptable range throughout the 197 day test duration and stabilized around 30 mg l 1 fig 5h the wall effect in the small clarifier used in the study fig 1 might have aggravated the effluent tss and can be avoided in full scale clarifiers moreover the tertiary lime flocculation and clarifiers in full scale application will also further strengthen the tss removal one remarkable observation was that a five day bulk srt would normally be considered too short to sustain reliable nitrification in a bioreactor liu and wang 2014 poduska and andrews 1975 yet 100 nitrification efficiency was achieved throughout the experiment fig 5g it can be inferred that a majority of the nitrifying bacteria were immobilized in the ags returned from the upflow selector underflow resulting in a much longer srt for the denser sludge retained in the system observations from fig 4b are in line with this inference 2 5 continuous upflow selector versus sequencing batch selector sequencing batch selector operation has been commonly used to provide the physical selection needed to drive ags formation kent et al 2018 in a previous study a sequencing batch selector was used in concert with continuous flow feast famine selection to achieve successful continuous flow ags formation an et al 2021a the sequencing batch selector was made of a column similar to the one used as a upflow selector in this study fig 1 but it was operated in a sequencing batch mode with a cycle of one minute of feeding four minutes of settling one minute of overflow discharge followed by another minute of underflow discharge the volume exchange ratio of the sequencing batch selector was set at 50 with a discharging height of 65 cm to provide a selective settling velocity of about 10 m h 1 which is same as the sor of the upflow selector used in this study in an attempt to compare the effectiveness of the two types of physical selectors in separating desired bioparticles under the same selective settling velocity the particle size distributions for the two selector inflows overflows and underflows were plotted in fig 3a and b in order to make a fair comparison results based on a similar inflow particle size distribution were selected and presented technically the selector separation efficiency should be inversely related to the overlapping area between the overflow and underflow i e the same size particles ending up in both overflow and underflow indicates poor separation efficiencies conversely a 100 separation efficiency between bioflocs and ags would leave zero overlapping area in particle size distribution between the two streams fig 3a and b because the inflow entry point was located at 30 cm above the bottom of the continuous selector used in this study a portion of bioflocs may escape upflow selection through gravity settling into this 30 cm stagnant bottom space as illustrated in fig 3c likewise it is known that an sbr with a 50 volume exchange should have at least 50 bioflocs unselected due to gravity settling within the space below the effluent port as illustrated in fig 3d as a result those bioflocs escaping the selector overflow contributed to the overlapping area in fig 3a and b because a continuous upflow selector can be designed with an inflow entry point closer to the bottom its particle separation should be more complete with less bioflocs escaping the selection this assumption is supported by the results in fig 3a and b i e the bioflocs escaping the physical selectors made up 39 and 59 of the total bioflocs that should have been washed out with the overflow from the continuous upflow selector and sequencing batch selector respectively these results indicate a much better separation efficiency in the former than latter theoretically this separation efficiency in a continuous upflow selector could be improved by moving the inflow entry point further down to the column bottom in full scale design fig 3c 3 discussion 3 1 the synergy between physical and biological selection there is a consensus that ags formation is driven by selection pressure that selectively reduces the persistence of bioflocs in a bioreactor kent et al 2018 since srt control is the only managed sludge outlet in the reactor shown in fig 1 and the flocculent sludge was the only type of sludge wasted the successful continuous ags demonstrated in fig 2 through 5 was driven by the srt controlled wasting that imposed outselection pressure only on the flocculent sludge portion of the biomass inventory this can be seen from the srt dependent key metrics for ags such as svi30 svi5 svi30 vzs and selector underflow overflow biomass ratios in fig 6 it appears that only when the bulk srt was less than 5 5 days could ags formation be achieved for example only after the reactor srt was controlled below 5 5 days the svi30 and svi5 svi30 started to drop to 60 ml g 1 and 1 1 respectively which are typically considered as the characteristics of ags figs 2e 5d e and 6a one should be aware that the actual srt of the flocculent sludge portion of the biomass should be much shorter than 5 5 days while that of the ags portion retained in the system should be longer both of which were factored in the overall bulk srt calculated for the reactor biomass inventory this conclusion is supported by the distinctive distribution of heterotrophic and nitrifying microorganisms in the overflow and underflow in fig 4 the dominance of nitrifying bacteria in the underflow of hydrocyclone system by selectively overflow sludge wasting for srt control has also been observed in one recent study regmi et al 2022 the enrichment of nitrifying population in the granules through srt control 5 5 days could also explain the seattleability improvement in terms of svi30 svi5 svi30 and vzs in fig 6 the slow growing microorganisms were reported to facilitate the formation of granules liu et al 2004 xia et al 2007 since the srts of dense granules and bioflocs were not able to be differentially controlled in previous granulation studies in sbrs especially during the reactor startup the srt was usually not considered as a decisive factor for aerobic granulation li et al 2008 however the novel arrangement in the fig 1 setup offered the possibility for srt deviation of ags and flocculant sludge the short srt of flocculent sludge realized significant outselection of this type of biomass while the retention and recirculation of ags resulted in their persistence and dominance in the sludge bed fig 2g therefore the srt control provided sufficient selection pressure resulting in the continuous flow ags formation by selectively retaining the slow growing bioparticles for granule settleability improvement in contrast to the physical selection provided by the upflow selector external to the bioreactors biological selection internal to the reactor imposed by separately returning heavier ags and lighter bioflocs to the feast and famine zones respectively further boosted biofloc outselection by subjecting bioflocs to low substrate availability fig 5a and b this is a novel application of internal selection pressure has not been widely accepted in full scale applications to our knowledge existing hydrocyclone installed treatment trains return a mixture of dense sludge hydrocyclone underflow and lighter bioflocs final clarifier sludge return to feast zones without attempting to differentiate their substrate availability avila et al 2021 partin 2019 regmi et al 2022 according to fig 4a the physical upflow selector overflow was mainly comprised of fast growing heterotrophic bacteria theoretically it would be more difficult and take much longer time to outselect these bioflocs if they were provided a competitive growth advantage by exposing them to the same high substrate availability as that of the ags which grow and develop at a much lower rate due to mass diffusion limitation if this more conventionally applied bioflocs to ags transition setup were applied the external physical selector would be the only driving force to transform flocculent sludge to ags and thus a much more radical biofloc washout type of short srt would have to be employed sun et al 2019 even with the sidestream hydrocyclone installation only 5 7 of the ras can be subjective to physical selection avila et al 2021 partin 2019 regmi et al 2022 leaving majority of the bioflocs and ags unseparated in the ras returned to the feast zone where bioflocs gain more growth advantage over ags which explains the slow startup period e g one year needed to observe sludge settleability improvement ford et al 2016 kent et al 2018 roche et al 2022 welling et al 2015 wett et al 2015 one may propagate the approach to only return hydrocyclone underflow to the feast zone deferring the rest ras to the famine zone given the minor sludge inventory that can be produced from the hydrocyclone underflow the viability of this approach to establish a feast zone solely for ags s advantage is questionable in contrast the setup with continuous upflow selector used in this study through the increase of clarifier sor is capable of providing holistically physical selection on all existing sludge inventory which explains the prompt startup of the continuous granulation system fig 5c d and e it is well known that bioflocs are very competitive in utilizing readily available substrates for a number of reasons they can outcompete ags because of their looser structure and higher specific surface area that promotes fast substrate diffusion and utilization tay et al 2002 therefore returning both sludges to the same feast zone as conventionally practiced to date is counterproductive to the progression and stabilization of continuous flow ags systems for this reason extremely short srts e g 0 3 0 4 days had to be employed with such a conventional approach to rid the biomass inventory of bioflocs in a radical way cofré et al 2018 sun et al 2019 as an undesirable consequence the mlvss in a bioreactor subjected to such a radically short srt will also have a dramatic reduction in performance resulting in poor effluent quality cofré et al 2018 sun et al 2019 for example an srt as short as 0 3 days had to be imposed to drive continuous flow ags formation in one of our previous studies resulting in an initial mlvss as low as 300 mg l 1 and poor effluent quality associated with only 31 cod and 6 ammonia removal sun et al 2019 this performance loss resulting from the drastic outselection pressure necessary for ags formation can be resolved by incorporating a strategy that manages to separate the srts of flocculent sludge and ags while incorporating reactor internal biological selection through controlling f m regimes for the distinctly different sludge forms i e selective ags and biofloc returns to feast and famine zones respectively this strategy is shown schematically in fig 1 superimposing this second selection pressure to a bioreactor allowed aerobic granulation to be achieved at a relatively higher srt and mlvss levels to safeguard the effluent quality throughout the reactor startup phase without treatment interruption fig 5f g and h the concept of leveraging such feast famine conditions should be of interest to designers considering a transition from conventional activated sludge processes to continuous flow ags systems in particular by examining if existing bioreactors can accommodate the methods developed herein and described in a previous study an et al 2021b 3 2 implication on full scale physical selector design at present the most popular continuous flow physical selector employed in wrrfs is hydrocyclones which are currently limited to sidestream wasting applications due to technology sizing limitations and associated costs partin 2019 wett et al 2015 uosa in the u s has also employed hydrocyclones to successfully enhance its full scale activated sludge settleability as designed only 5 of the ras was processed through the hydrocyclones with such a weak selection only moderate sludge settleability improvements were observed over 23 months of operation however a true shift to a purely continuous flow ags system has not been observed in contrast it only took 197 days to achieve true measures of a continuous flow ags formation with the same primary effluent pe in this pilot study the key difference can be attributed to subjecting 100 of the mainstream mixed liquor flow to the selection pressure of the continuous upflow selector shown in fig 1 the continuous upflow selector tested in this study demonstrated that a mainstream physical selector can be developed for full scale continuous ags applications particularly for green field sites upflow selectors are more suitable and practical than the sequencing batch selectors tested in a prior study sun et al 2019 especially for high flow rate continuous flow wastewater treatment systems kent et al 2018 the concept of continuous upflow selector is not new as it has been used in full scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors for decades frankin 2001 however it was for the first time fully explored in this study to apply it for strategic biofloc outselection using a managed srt control approach to drive continuous flow ags formation without performance loss during the startup phase figs 1 and 2 this study has helped the field understand that an external continuous upflow selector provides excellent solid separation efficiency and may be a good choice for full scale applications where stronger selection pressure is needed for faster transitions from conventional activated sludge to ags fig 5c to e the upflow selector incorporated into the fig 1 design mimics a conventional clarifier with a very high sor so there may in some cases be the flexibility to rearrange and repurpose existing clarifier structures within wrrfs to act as external physical selectors subject to available water head following the same concept lamella plate settlers may also be considered for high flow continuous flow settling velocity selection in the mainstream application faraji et al 2013 li et al 2014 results from this study suggest that a high capacity physical external upflow selector should be explored for full scale applications to be used in concert with biological feast famine selection internal to the bioreactors this may provide the added selection pressure that designers are looking for to expedite the transition from conventional activated sludge to continuous flow ags in full scale wastewater treatment trains 4 conclusions the following concluding remarks can be drawn from this study 1 an external continuous upflow selector that incorporates managed srt control coupled with internal feast famine bioreactor selection proved effectiveness in promoting continuous flow ags formation in real domestic wastewater without treatment interruption during ags reactor startup 2 srt control through managed wasting of the flocculent sludge in the overflow from a upflow selector was successfully used as a selection pressure to drive continuous flow ags without compromising system performance or final clarifier effluent quality 3 heterotrophic and nitrifying microorganisms dominated the upflow selector overflow and underflow biomass respectively this was explained by the actual srt difference between the wasted flocculent sludge portion of the biomass and the ags portion of biomass retained in the system 4 intelligently routing the sludge returns of ags to feast zones and flocculent sludge to famine zones resulted in biological selection internal to the bioreactor this biological selection was applied to boost the physical selection pressure obtained with the upflow selector which also safeguarded the effluent quality throughout the reactor startup period without treatment performance degradation or interruption 5 in existing wrrfs considering ags application secondary clarifiers hold the potential to be reconfigured to provide external physical settling velocity selection by manipulating sors 5 materials and methods 5 1 reactor design and operation a pfr with the design and setup illustrated in fig 1 was operated onsite in uosa a wrrf located in centreville va usa the pe from the primary clarifiers of uosa was fed to the pfr through gravity flow without any pretreatment the pfr with a 140 l total working volume was made of 10 completely mixed chambers connected in series to create feast famine conditions along the gravity flow direction fig 1 the hydraulic retention time of the pfr was controlled at 6 5 h similar to that of the full scale secondary process at uosa all chambers were aerated with dissolved oxygen do 2 mg l 1 at a flow rate of 3 l min 1 in each chamber meanwhile aeration also provided homogenous mixing in each chamber as shown in fig 1 a continuous upflow column with an internal diameter of 8 cm and a total working height of 80 cm was installed at the end of the pfr to mimic a high rate clarifier the column inflow i e the mixed liquor from the pfr effluent continuously entered at a height of 30 cm from the column bottom and then flowed up for 50 cm before overflowing from the top of the upflow column fig 1a the sor of this column was set at 10 m h 1 to separate the sludge particles based on their settling velocity theoretically only those particles with a settling velocity greater than 10 m h 1 can be retained within the underflow of the upflow selector and returned to the first feast zone chamber of the pfr fig 1a the unsettled bioflocs in the overflow were sent to another clarifier designed with a more typical sor of 1 m h 1 a portion of bioflocs settled under this low sor was wasted on a daily basis for srt control fig 1a the remainder of the flocculent sludge was returned to the first famine zone of the pfr as shown in fig 1a the flow rate ratio of selector overflow to underflow was set at about 1 6 an airlifting method was used to return sludges by blowing the settled sludge through tubings into either the feast or famine zones according to the flow design in fig 1 sun et al 2019 5 2 analytical methods do was measured using an hq40d meter hach loveland co usa the

19903,capacitive deionization cdi is a promising technique for brackish water desalination however its salt electrosorption capacity is insufficient for practical application yet and little information is available on hardness ion mg2 ca2 removal in cdi herein hierarchical porous carbon hpc was prepared from low cost and renewable microalgae via a simple one pot approach and both mno2 hpc and polyaniline hpc pani hpc composites were then synthesized using a facile one step hydrothermal method compared with the mno2 electrode the mno2 hpc electrode presented an improved hydrophilicity higher specific capacitance and lower electrode resistance the electrodes exhibited pseudocapacitive behaviors and the maximum salt electrosorption capacities of mno2 hpc pani hpc cdi cell was up to 0 65 mmol g 1 nacl 0 71 mmol g 1 mgcl2 and 0 76 mmol g 1 cacl2 respectively which were comparable and even higher than those of the previously reported cdi cells additionally the mno2 hpc electrode presented a selectivity order of ca2 mg2 na and the divalent cation selectivity was found to be attributed to their stronger binding strength in the cavity of mno2 multiscale simulations further reveal that the mno2 hpc electrodes with the unique luminal configuration of mno2 and hpc as supportive framework could offer a great intercalation selectivity of the divalent cations and exhibit a great promise in hardness ion removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hierarchical porous carbon manganese dioxides brackish water desalination divalent cation selectivity multiscale simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction desalination has been widely applied to tackle the escalating freshwater scarcity currently there are two main types of water desalination technologies reverse osmosis and thermal distillation caldera and breyer 2023 however the energy consumption of reverse osmosis is high and membrane fouling at high pressure is another problem that needs to be resolved thermal distillation consumes even more thermal and electric energy to vapor water which makes it very expensive and results in a large emission of greenhouse gasses srimuk et al 2020 in addition water hardness is a problem broadly existing in tap river and ground water this is mainly owning to the presence of calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 ions which can induce scaling problems in heat exchangers pipelines of boilers and electrical appliances he et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 several approaches including ion exchange chemical precipitation nanofiltration reverse osmosis and electrodialysis have been applied for water softening zhang et al 2020 however these processes either consume a large amount of energy or require an excessive use of chemicals thus the development of an environmentally friendly and low energy consuming technology is highly desirable for brackish water desalination and water softening capacitive deionization cdi is an electrochemically controlled method based on electrosorption of ions through the formation of an electric double layer edl on the surface of two porous carbon electrodes bhat et al 2019 due to its environmentally friendly low cost and high energy efficiency features cdi has emerged as a promising desalination technology for brackish water treatment oyarzun et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 nevertheless the undesirable expulsion of the co ions in the carbon electrode will lead to a lower salt electrosorption capacity and higher energy consumption gamaethiralalage et al 2021 tan et al 2020 in order to improve the salt electrosorption capacity redox active and pseudocapacitive materials such as na3v2 po4 3 cuhcf and mno2 have been employed as cdi electrodes srimuk et al 2020 however these materials always suffer from poor conductivity and or volume expansion contraction in the ion intercalation deintercalation process which can result in poor cycling stability chen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 thus designing composite materials composed of carbon material with pseudocapacitive material i e mno2 could be an efficient way to enhance electrical conductivity while mitigating the volume expansion contraction thereby enhancing desalination performance jia et al 2018 hierarchical porous carbon hpc has a high surface area with a multimodal pore size distribution and can serve as a conductive network and buffer the volume expansion of the active material in battery and supercapacitor applications sevilla et al 2017 wang et al 2017 in particular renewable biomass such as microalgae can be utilized to synthesize hpc through a simple and sustainable one pot approach sevilla et al 2017 compared to traditional materials biomass derived materials have demonstrated lower production costs and reduced energy consumption in certain applications hussain et al 2021 oliveira et al 2021 furthermore studies have shown that biomass production can be scaled up using established methods and technologies making it a viable option for large scale applications oliveira et al 2021 in addition microalgae have extraordinary biomass productivity and a fast growth rate and can even be easily cultivated in nutrient rich wastewaters the unit co2 fixation capacity of microalgae is nearly 50 times higher than terrestrial plants zhou et al 2017 production of hpc from microalgae could further accelerate co2 mitigation more importantly the uniform micron sized cell bodies in microalgae can result in the production of carbon materials with large surface areas and controllable multimodal porosity rizwan et al 2018 thus hpc derived from microalgae could be a great candidate as a supportive backbone in electrode materials for improving cdi performance various mno2 polymorphs α β and δ have been used as electrode materials in cdi just for nacl removal owing to their environmentally friendly low cost and high theoretical specific capacitance features leong and yang 2019 srimuk et al 2020 among them α mno2 with a large tunnel structure 4 6 4 6 å has been applied in multivalent ion batteries including mg ca and al as well juran et al 2018 the square 2 2 loose tunnels are suitable for the insertion extraction of ions with a large hydrated radius suggesting that α mno2 can be an efficient pseudocapacitive electrode in cdi for water softening therefore integrating α mno2 into the hpc surface will counteract their drawbacks and derive a synergistically improved hybrid electrode for cdi applications in addition although some carbon or battery electrodes have been used for divalent ions removal cerón et al 2020 chen et al 2022 singh et al 2020 shocron et al 2022 uwayid et al 2022 zhao et al 2012 information regarding the use of hybrid electrodes for water softening and divalent cation selectivity in cdi systems remains limited therefore in this work microalgae were used to prepare hpc first then the α mno2 nanorods were uniformly dispersed on the hpc surface and pani was grafted on hpc via a facile one step hydrothermal procedure later the brackish water desalination and water softening performance of the prepared mno2 hpc pani hpc cdi cell was evaluated in addition the mno2 hpc electrode was used to evaluate the competitive intercalation between na mg2 and ca2 in the binary salt solutions furthermore the underlying mechanisms for cation selectivity were elucidated using molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory dft calculations 2 results and discussion 2 1 preparation and characterizations of the electrodes the facile preparation procedure of the mno2 hpc and pani hpc is illustrated in fig 1 a the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of mno2 confirms the formation of α mno2 jcpds no 44 0141 fig 1b leong and yang 2019 similarly three peaks centered at 37 1 41 8 and 66 3 were clearly observed which could be attributed to the 211 301 and 002 planes of α mno2 in contrast both hpc and pani hpc showed an amorphous structure as two broad peaks at 24 0 and 43 8 were observed fig 1b raman spectra of the hpc and mno2 hpc show g and d bands at 1595 and 1333 cm 1 respectively indicating ordered graphene and disordered amorphous carbon structures fig s1 evans et al 2019 in addition multiple features in the fingerprint region 1556 1469 1295 1230 and 1103 cm 1 were observed in the fourier transform infrared ftir pattern of the pani hpc which resulted from the different aromatic modes in the pani polymer fig 1c more importantly the feature at 1103 cm 1 demonstrates the presence of the conducting form of pani on the surface of hpc and the feature at approximately 511 cm 1 proves the existence of mn o on the mno2 hpc composite surface evans et al 2019 tan et al 2021 the transmission electron microscopy tem images of the mno2 hpc and pani hpc clearly show that both mno2 and pani were formed on the hpc surface respectively fig 1d and fig s2 specifically the α mno2 samples show typical nanowire bundles fig 1e the elemental mapping of the mno2 hpc indicates the presence of mn and o elements fig 1f exhibiting the uniform distribution of mn and o in the mno2 hpc the d spacing is approximately 0 346 nm which corresponds to the 220 crystal plane of the α mno2 structure fig 1g in addition scanning electron microscopy sem images further demonstrate that the mno2 nanorods were uniformly formed on the hpc surface fig s3 a new peak of mn 2p was observed in the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectrum of the mno2 hpc and two new peaks of n 1 s and cl 2p were observed in the pani hpc fig s4 the high resolution xps spectra of the mno2 hpc in the mn 2p region presented two peaks at 653 7 ev mn 2p1 2 and 642 0 ev mn 2p3 2 indicating that the oxidation state of mn was 4 fig s5 chong et al 2018 the high resolution xps spectra of the pani hpc in the n 1 s region 400 ev confirm the presence of n nh and n from pani fig s6 evans et al 2019 in addition the pani hpc had a positive zeta potential of 15 7 mv indicating that it could selectively absorb negative ions like cl fig s7 conversely both mno2 20 7 mv and mno2 hpc 23 9 mv exhibited negative zeta potentials implying that they could selectively absorb positive ions such as na mg2 and ca2 via electrostatic force the hydrophilicity of the electrodes was evaluated by static water contact angles fig s8 compared to the hpc and mno2 electrodes both mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes exhibited smaller water contact angles suggesting that they were readily wetted and accessed by the salty solution tan et al 2021 2 2 electrochemical performance of the electrodes similar to the hpc electrode the mno2 mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes depicted rectangular shaped voltammograms fig 2a and fig s9 these cyclic voltammetry cv curves were consistent with the previous reports on mno2 carbon and pani carbon composite electrodes indicating their pseudocapacitive behaviors evans et al 2019 both mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes exhibited larger responsive currents suggesting their higher specific capacitances their charge discharge profiles in 1 m nacl solution further confirm their pseudocapacitive behaviors with symmetric and linear curves fig 2 b and fig s10 in line with the cv results the pani hpc electrode possessed the largest specific capacitance of 197 1 f g 1 followed by the mno2 hpc 175 2 f g 1 hpc 153 9 f g 1 and mno2 102 4 f g 1 electrodes at 0 3 a g 1 fig s11 the higher specific capacitances in the mno2 hpc electrode was attributed to the synergistic effects between the hpc and mno2 because the porous hpc serves as a supportive backbone in the mno2 hpc composite which could prevent the particle aggregation and reduce the volume expansion contraction of mno2 chen et al 2013 jia et al 2018 besides the faradaic pseudocapacitance from the mno2 can further improve the specific capacitance of mno2 hpc since the conductive pani layer on the surface of hpc could facilitate easy and fast ion transportation the pani hpc electrode had the smallest rct 0 23 ω and σ 12 36 ω s0 5 values table s1 fig 2c and fig s12 in comparison with the poor conductivity in the mno2 electrode rct 2 76 ω σ 44 88 ω s0 5 the mno2 hpc also had much lower rct 0 23 ω and σ 12 36 ω s0 5 values the well dispersed mno2 nanorods connected with the conductive matrix of hpc could substantially facilitate the ion and electron transportation fig s3 chen et al 2013 sevilla et al 2017 similarly the quasi rectangular shape in the cv curves was also observed for the mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes in 1 m mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes with a slightly higher current response compared to that of 1 m nacl fig 2d and 2e consistent with the cv results the galvanostatic charge discharge curves of the mno2 hpc electrode in 1 m mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes also showed linear and symmetric curves but had relatively higher specific capacitances of 177 3 f g 1 mgcl2 and 179 6 f g 1 cacl2 respectively fig s13 similarly the mno2 carbon electrode was reported to have a similar specific capacitance in equimolar concentrations of nacl and mgcl2 electrolytes xu et al 2021 the relatively higher specific capacitances of the mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes in divalent electrolytes i e mgcl2 and cacl2 also indicate their excellent water softening capacity then dunn s method fig s14 tan et al 2021 was used to calculate the contributions of edl capacitance and pseudocapacitance for the mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes respectively as shown in fig 2f the approximately 87 capacitance of the mno2 hpc electrode resulted from pseudocapacitance and the capacitance was approximately 82 for the pani hpc electrode in 1 m nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes these results further demonstrate that the pseudocapacitive intercalation process was the main charge storage mechanism in the electrochemical reaction for both mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes in nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes more importantly the pseudocapacitive contributed capacities in the hardness ion electrolytes mgcl2 and cacl2 were relatively higher than those in the nacl electrolyte 2 3 water desalination and water softening performance the representative current density and nacl concentration profiles of the hpchpc mno2 pani hpc and mno2 hpc pani hpc cells are depicted in fig s15 at each applied cell voltage the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell always possessed the highest salt electrosorption capacity followed by the mno2 pani hpc and hpchpc cells fig 3 a 3c fig s16 shows the corresponding average salt electrosorption rates charge efficiencies and energy consumptions obviously the best desalination performance was observed for the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell the energy consumption for the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell in 5 mm nacl solution was only 0 64 wh g 1 which was considerably lower than previously reported conventional cdis as well as mno2 based hybrid cdis hand and cusick 2017 he et al 2021 xu et al 2021 notably only 0 17 wh l 1 of energy was required to desalinate the feed solution to drinking water 20 mg l 1 nacl making it quite low compared to ro processes 0 5 2 5 wh l 1 for brackish water with salinity 10 g l 1 tan et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 the highest electrosorption capacities for the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell was up to 0 65 mmol g 1 nacl 0 71 mmol g 1 mgcl2 and 0 76 mmol g 1 cacl2 fig 3d its maximum nacl electrosorption capacity was comparable and even higher than the values reported in the previous studies table s2 in which similar mno2 or mno2 pani carbon composite electrodes were applied jin et al 2020 nie et al 2020 in addition the maximum mgcl2 and cacl2 electrosorption capacities were also higher than those in the previous reports table s3 s4 liu et al 2020 uwayid et al 2022 its excellent brackish water desalination and water softening performance could mainly be ascribed to the pseudocapacitive behaviors of the pani hpc and mno2 hpc electrodes which can selectively intercalate negative ions cl and positive ions na mg2 and ca2 evans et al 2019 tan et al 2020 wang et al 2019 in addition the synergistic effects between the high porosity of the hpc and mno2 pani could generate higher specific capacitances better hydrophilicity and reduce charge transfer and ionic diffusion resistances thereby guaranteeing excellent desalination performance fig 2 and fig s8 then the cycling performance of the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell was examined the nacl electrosorption capacity remained at approximately ca 0 35 mmol g 1 the mgcl2 electrosorption capacity remained at ca 0 39 mmol g 1 while the cacl2 electrosorption capacity was stable at ca 0 42 mmol g 1 fig 3e in addition the desorption efficiency remained approximately 96 suggesting that the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell exhibited exceptional regeneration capabilities fig s17 the porous hpc served as a supportive backbone in the mno2 hpc composite which could prevent particle aggregation reduce the volume expansion contraction of mno2 enhance the structural integrity and perform long term cycling chen et al 2013 in order to further illustrate the stability the mno2 hpc powder was scratched off from the carbon cloth for raman xrd sem and tem characterizations the intensity ratio of d band to g band i d i g increased from 0 99 to 1 02 after 30 cycles indicating slight oxidation of the mno2 hpc electrode fig s18 however the xrd characterizations indicate that the crystal structure of the mno2 hpc electrode had no obvious change in comparison with the original one after 30 cycles in 10 mm nacl fig s19 there was also no significant change in the morphology of the mno2 hpc electrode fig s20 and fig s21 in addition the uniform coating of the pani on the hpc surface could reduce the kinetics of parasitic reactions of carbon materials fig s3 additionally the shallow traps for the pani molecules in the pores of hpc can protect it from degradation evans et al 2019 gao et al 2022 as a result the pani hpc composite electrode could also retain a large cycling capacity evans et al 2019 the galvanostatic charge discharge tests also demonstrated the high stability of the mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes fig s22 additionally the effluent ph in 10 mm nacl in all 30 cycles slightly decreased and stabilized at approximately 6 5 7 0 fig s23 these results further demonstrate that the facile designed mno2 hpc could be applied as an efficient electrode material for improved brackish water desalination and hardness ion removal 2 4 cation selectivity of the α mno2 hpc electrode the cation selectivity of the mno2 hpc electrode in binary salt solutions was subsequently investigated fig 4 the difference in cation electrosorption capacity between na and mg2 cations gradually increased when the applied voltage was increased from 0 8 v to 1 4 v fig 4a similar results were observed in the binary nacl cacl2 solution fig 4b indicating that the mno2 hpc possessed divalent selectivity over monovalent cations since the mno2 hpc surface was negatively charged fig s7 there was a strong electrostatic force between divalent cations and the mno2 hpc surface leong and yang 2020 leong et al 2021 in addition the active sites occupied by na could be gradually replaced by divalent cations mg2 or ca2 because of the stronger interaction between the divalent ions and the negatively charged electrode surface which results from the ion swapping effect srimuk et al 2020 xu et al 2021 more importantly the divalent cation selectivity could still be maintained when the concentration of na was twice that of ca2 fig s24 suggesting that the mno2 hpc electrode had a great potential in water softening in addition the mno2 hpc electrode showed a relatively higher affinity for ca2 than mg2 fig 4c one reason could be the slower kinetics of mg2 intercalation deintercalation into the tunnel structure of α mno2 than that of ca2 as the hydrated ionic radius of mg2 0 43 nm is larger than that of ca2 0 41 nm singh et al 2021 shocron et al 2022 the relatively higher hydration energy of mg2 1830 kj mol 1 compared to that of ca2 1505 kj mol 1 could also limit mg2 intercalation deintercalation fig 4d and e other studies also showed that ca2 could be more strongly attracted to the negatively charged electrode because of its smaller hydrated radius compared to that of mg2 singh et al 2021 to further evaluate the selective capacity of mg2 and ca2 over na in the mno2 hpc electrode the intercalation mechanisms were elucidated using molecular dynamics simulations and dft calculations the intercalation capacities of cations in the mno2 hpc were evaluated by monte carlo simulations the results indicate that the amount of mg2 and ca2 was obviously greater than that of na fig 5 a and b this might be attributed to the relatively higher binding energy between divalent cations and the electrode than that of na fig 5c duchanois et al 2022 the cation selectivity of the mno2 hpc was largely dependent on the special configuration of α mno2 in addition the interaction energies e inter of cations and α mno2 were precisely examined by dft calculations through the unit cell model of α mno2 for the limited lumen size only one water molecule can be encapsulated in the cavity with the cation after equilibrium fig s25 and fig 5d f the location site of the cations is offset from the center of the cavity of α mno2 table s5 from the e inter of the cations in α mno2 fig 5g it is obvious that the binding strength of mg2 and ca2 to the lumen side is much higher than that of na this proves that the intercalation selectivity of divalent cations in the electrode can be contributed by the stronger binding strength of mg2 and ca2 in the cavity of α mno2 singh et al 2021 moreover the charge distributions of the cation intercalation systems from mulliken charge analysis indicate that only 0 44 e electrons are transferred from α mno2 and h2o to na table s6 while 0 76 e and 0 82 e are transferred from that to mg2 and ca2 respectively the electron density difference also confirms the direction and degree of electron transfer in the encapsulation of cations to α mno2 fig 5d f and fig s26 su et al 2018 thus the mno2 hpc electrodes with a reasonable combination and configuration offer better intercalation selectivity of mg2 and ca2 overall the mno2 hpc electrode exhibited a selectivity order of ca2 mg2 na due to the differences in valence hydrated radius and binding strength in the cavity of mno2 3 conclusions the well dispersed mno2 nanorods connected with hpc were prepared using a facile one step hydrothermal approach the prepared mno2 hpc electrode had a considerable specific capacitance of 175 2 f g 1 low charge transfer and ion diffusion resistance and superior stability in comparison with the hpchpc and mno2 pani hpc cells the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell exhibited the highest nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 electrosorption capacity fastest salt electrosorption rate highest charge efficiency and lowest energy consumption the mno2 hpc electrode delivered selective intercalation to the hardness ions mg2 and ca2 in the binary salt solutions both ion valence and radius could affect their competitive intercalation into the mno2 hpc electrode furthermore molecular dynamics simulations and dft calculations indicate that the preference of mno2 hpc toward divalent ions was mainly due to their stronger binding strength in the cavity of mno2 our results clearly demonstrate that cdi with the facile designed mno2 hpc composite electrode can offer a great promise in brackish water desalination and water softening 4 material and methods 4 1 preparation of mno2 hpc and polyaniline hpc the chemicals used in this work are described in the supporting information the hpc was produced from microalgae spirulina platensis biomass sevilla et al 2017 first the microalgae samples were thoroughly mixed with caco3 and k2c2o4 at a weight ratio of 1 0 5 0 5 in an agatha mortar pyrolyzed in a tube furnace in a n2 environment and held at 800 c for 2 h the obtained hpc powders were soaked and washed with 0 1 m hcl several times to remove inorganic impurities and then thoroughly washed with deionized water then both mno2 hpc and pani hpc were prepared via a facile one step hydrothermal procedure fig 1a evans et al 2019 for the mno2 hpc 0 35 g mnso4 1 g k2s2o8 and 0 35 g hpc powder were mixed in 56 ml deionized water di under stirring for 20 min at room temperature then 4 ml koh 1 m was wisely dropped into the solution with magnetic stirring for an additional 30 min the obtained mixture was transferred into a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave which was heated for 12 h at 110 c in an electric oven later the produced precipitates were washed with di water several times and collected by vacuum filtration mno2 was produced with the same procedure without the addition of hpc for the pani hpc 0 35 g hpc powder 0 35 g aniline and 3 ml hcl 37 were added into 55 ml di water with magnetic stirring for 6 h at 4 c then 2 g ammonium persulfate was added to the solution with magnetic stirring for an additional 2 h at 4 c similarly the obtained mixture was transferred into a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated for 6 h at 120 c the formed pani hpc was then washed with di water and ethanol several times and collected by vacuum filtration finally the mno2 mno2 hpc and pani hpc samples were dried in vacuum at 50 c for 24 h details about the preparation and characterizations of the hpc mno2 mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes are given in the supporting information 4 2 capacitive deionization tests the desalination of brackish water 2 5 10 mm nacl and softening of water 2 5 10 mm mgcl2 and cacl2 were performed in a homemade cdi cell fig s27 the cell consisted of a cathode hpc or pani hpc and an anode hpc mno2 or mno2 hpc the water channel was formed by a 0 5 mm thick silicon gasket between the anode and cathode and a filament fabric served as the spacer titanium foils were used as current leads in the brackish water desalination and water softening processes 70 ml of feed solution was circulated through the cdi cell at a flow rate of 35 ml min 1 a constant voltage i e 0 8 1 0 1 2 v or 1 4 v was applied to the cell by a potentiostat parstat mc princeton applied research inc usa for the single salt solution the concentration variation of ions was calculated according to the linear relationship between the concentration and conductivity which was monitored by a conductivity meter

scientific inc usa the ph variation of the effluent solution was monitored by a ph meter s210 mettler toledo co switzerland details on the calculations of salt electrosorption capacity salt electrosorption rate charge efficiency and energy consumption are provided in the supporting information 4 3 theoretical calculations the intercalation behaviors of na mg2 and ca2 in mno2 hpc were determined according to the metropolis monte carlo method metropolis et al 1953 the α mno2 hpc supercell consists of two graphene sheets with a mno2 layer with a size of 29 82 å 29 52 å 16 20 å showing mn c bonds between the graphene layer and α mno2 the molecular dynamics simulations were implemented to predict the intercalation amounts of ions in the mno2 hpc supercell using universal force fields the ewald summation was used to evaluate the electrostatic interactions with an accuracy of 1 10 4 kcal mol the atom based summation was applied to assess the van der waals interactions by using cubic spline truncation of a 15 5 å cutoff distance and a 1 0 å spline width the location and the amounts of the ion species could be reflected in the simulations to further investigate the

19903,capacitive deionization cdi is a promising technique for brackish water desalination however its salt electrosorption capacity is insufficient for practical application yet and little information is available on hardness ion mg2 ca2 removal in cdi herein hierarchical porous carbon hpc was prepared from low cost and renewable microalgae via a simple one pot approach and both mno2 hpc and polyaniline hpc pani hpc composites were then synthesized using a facile one step hydrothermal method compared with the mno2 electrode the mno2 hpc electrode presented an improved hydrophilicity higher specific capacitance and lower electrode resistance the electrodes exhibited pseudocapacitive behaviors and the maximum salt electrosorption capacities of mno2 hpc pani hpc cdi cell was up to 0 65 mmol g 1 nacl 0 71 mmol g 1 mgcl2 and 0 76 mmol g 1 cacl2 respectively which were comparable and even higher than those of the previously reported cdi cells additionally the mno2 hpc electrode presented a selectivity order of ca2 mg2 na and the divalent cation selectivity was found to be attributed to their stronger binding strength in the cavity of mno2 multiscale simulations further reveal that the mno2 hpc electrodes with the unique luminal configuration of mno2 and hpc as supportive framework could offer a great intercalation selectivity of the divalent cations and exhibit a great promise in hardness ion removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hierarchical porous carbon manganese dioxides brackish water desalination divalent cation selectivity multiscale simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction desalination has been widely applied to tackle the escalating freshwater scarcity currently there are two main types of water desalination technologies reverse osmosis and thermal distillation caldera and breyer 2023 however the energy consumption of reverse osmosis is high and membrane fouling at high pressure is another problem that needs to be resolved thermal distillation consumes even more thermal and electric energy to vapor water which makes it very expensive and results in a large emission of greenhouse gasses srimuk et al 2020 in addition water hardness is a problem broadly existing in tap river and ground water this is mainly owning to the presence of calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 ions which can induce scaling problems in heat exchangers pipelines of boilers and electrical appliances he et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 several approaches including ion exchange chemical precipitation nanofiltration reverse osmosis and electrodialysis have been applied for water softening zhang et al 2020 however these processes either consume a large amount of energy or require an excessive use of chemicals thus the development of an environmentally friendly and low energy consuming technology is highly desirable for brackish water desalination and water softening capacitive deionization cdi is an electrochemically controlled method based on electrosorption of ions through the formation of an electric double layer edl on the surface of two porous carbon electrodes bhat et al 2019 due to its environmentally friendly low cost and high energy efficiency features cdi has emerged as a promising desalination technology for brackish water treatment oyarzun et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 nevertheless the undesirable expulsion of the co ions in the carbon electrode will lead to a lower salt electrosorption capacity and higher energy consumption gamaethiralalage et al 2021 tan et al 2020 in order to improve the salt electrosorption capacity redox active and pseudocapacitive materials such as na3v2 po4 3 cuhcf and mno2 have been employed as cdi electrodes srimuk et al 2020 however these materials always suffer from poor conductivity and or volume expansion contraction in the ion intercalation deintercalation process which can result in poor cycling stability chen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 thus designing composite materials composed of carbon material with pseudocapacitive material i e mno2 could be an efficient way to enhance electrical conductivity while mitigating the volume expansion contraction thereby enhancing desalination performance jia et al 2018 hierarchical porous carbon hpc has a high surface area with a multimodal pore size distribution and can serve as a conductive network and buffer the volume expansion of the active material in battery and supercapacitor applications sevilla et al 2017 wang et al 2017 in particular renewable biomass such as microalgae can be utilized to synthesize hpc through a simple and sustainable one pot approach sevilla et al 2017 compared to traditional materials biomass derived materials have demonstrated lower production costs and reduced energy consumption in certain applications hussain et al 2021 oliveira et al 2021 furthermore studies have shown that biomass production can be scaled up using established methods and technologies making it a viable option for large scale applications oliveira et al 2021 in addition microalgae have extraordinary biomass productivity and a fast growth rate and can even be easily cultivated in nutrient rich wastewaters the unit co2 fixation capacity of microalgae is nearly 50 times higher than terrestrial plants zhou et al 2017 production of hpc from microalgae could further accelerate co2 mitigation more importantly the uniform micron sized cell bodies in microalgae can result in the production of carbon materials with large surface areas and controllable multimodal porosity rizwan et al 2018 thus hpc derived from microalgae could be a great candidate as a supportive backbone in electrode materials for improving cdi performance various mno2 polymorphs α β and δ have been used as electrode materials in cdi just for nacl removal owing to their environmentally friendly low cost and high theoretical specific capacitance features leong and yang 2019 srimuk et al 2020 among them α mno2 with a large tunnel structure 4 6 4 6 å has been applied in multivalent ion batteries including mg ca and al as well juran et al 2018 the square 2 2 loose tunnels are suitable for the insertion extraction of ions with a large hydrated radius suggesting that α mno2 can be an efficient pseudocapacitive electrode in cdi for water softening therefore integrating α mno2 into the hpc surface will counteract their drawbacks and derive a synergistically improved hybrid electrode for cdi applications in addition although some carbon or battery electrodes have been used for divalent ions removal cerón et al 2020 chen et al 2022 singh et al 2020 shocron et al 2022 uwayid et al 2022 zhao et al 2012 information regarding the use of hybrid electrodes for water softening and divalent cation selectivity in cdi systems remains limited therefore in this work microalgae were used to prepare hpc first then the α mno2 nanorods were uniformly dispersed on the hpc surface and pani was grafted on hpc via a facile one step hydrothermal procedure later the brackish water desalination and water softening performance of the prepared mno2 hpc pani hpc cdi cell was evaluated in addition the mno2 hpc electrode was used to evaluate the competitive intercalation between na mg2 and ca2 in the binary salt solutions furthermore the underlying mechanisms for cation selectivity were elucidated using molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory dft calculations 2 results and discussion 2 1 preparation and characterizations of the electrodes the facile preparation procedure of the mno2 hpc and pani hpc is illustrated in fig 1 a the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of mno2 confirms the formation of α mno2 jcpds no 44 0141 fig 1b leong and yang 2019 similarly three peaks centered at 37 1 41 8 and 66 3 were clearly observed which could be attributed to the 211 301 and 002 planes of α mno2 in contrast both hpc and pani hpc showed an amorphous structure as two broad peaks at 24 0 and 43 8 were observed fig 1b raman spectra of the hpc and mno2 hpc show g and d bands at 1595 and 1333 cm 1 respectively indicating ordered graphene and disordered amorphous carbon structures fig s1 evans et al 2019 in addition multiple features in the fingerprint region 1556 1469 1295 1230 and 1103 cm 1 were observed in the fourier transform infrared ftir pattern of the pani hpc which resulted from the different aromatic modes in the pani polymer fig 1c more importantly the feature at 1103 cm 1 demonstrates the presence of the conducting form of pani on the surface of hpc and the feature at approximately 511 cm 1 proves the existence of mn o on the mno2 hpc composite surface evans et al 2019 tan et al 2021 the transmission electron microscopy tem images of the mno2 hpc and pani hpc clearly show that both mno2 and pani were formed on the hpc surface respectively fig 1d and fig s2 specifically the α mno2 samples show typical nanowire bundles fig 1e the elemental mapping of the mno2 hpc indicates the presence of mn and o elements fig 1f exhibiting the uniform distribution of mn and o in the mno2 hpc the d spacing is approximately 0 346 nm which corresponds to the 220 crystal plane of the α mno2 structure fig 1g in addition scanning electron microscopy sem images further demonstrate that the mno2 nanorods were uniformly formed on the hpc surface fig s3 a new peak of mn 2p was observed in the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectrum of the mno2 hpc and two new peaks of n 1 s and cl 2p were observed in the pani hpc fig s4 the high resolution xps spectra of the mno2 hpc in the mn 2p region presented two peaks at 653 7 ev mn 2p1 2 and 642 0 ev mn 2p3 2 indicating that the oxidation state of mn was 4 fig s5 chong et al 2018 the high resolution xps spectra of the pani hpc in the n 1 s region 400 ev confirm the presence of n nh and n from pani fig s6 evans et al 2019 in addition the pani hpc had a positive zeta potential of 15 7 mv indicating that it could selectively absorb negative ions like cl fig s7 conversely both mno2 20 7 mv and mno2 hpc 23 9 mv exhibited negative zeta potentials implying that they could selectively absorb positive ions such as na mg2 and ca2 via electrostatic force the hydrophilicity of the electrodes was evaluated by static water contact angles fig s8 compared to the hpc and mno2 electrodes both mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes exhibited smaller water contact angles suggesting that they were readily wetted and accessed by the salty solution tan et al 2021 2 2 electrochemical performance of the electrodes similar to the hpc electrode the mno2 mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes depicted rectangular shaped voltammograms fig 2a and fig s9 these cyclic voltammetry cv curves were consistent with the previous reports on mno2 carbon and pani carbon composite electrodes indicating their pseudocapacitive behaviors evans et al 2019 both mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes exhibited larger responsive currents suggesting their higher specific capacitances their charge discharge profiles in 1 m nacl solution further confirm their pseudocapacitive behaviors with symmetric and linear curves fig 2 b and fig s10 in line with the cv results the pani hpc electrode possessed the largest specific capacitance of 197 1 f g 1 followed by the mno2 hpc 175 2 f g 1 hpc 153 9 f g 1 and mno2 102 4 f g 1 electrodes at 0 3 a g 1 fig s11 the higher specific capacitances in the mno2 hpc electrode was attributed to the synergistic effects between the hpc and mno2 because the porous hpc serves as a supportive backbone in the mno2 hpc composite which could prevent the particle aggregation and reduce the volume expansion contraction of mno2 chen et al 2013 jia et al 2018 besides the faradaic pseudocapacitance from the mno2 can further improve the specific capacitance of mno2 hpc since the conductive pani layer on the surface of hpc could facilitate easy and fast ion transportation the pani hpc electrode had the smallest rct 0 23 ω and σ 12 36 ω s0 5 values table s1 fig 2c and fig s12 in comparison with the poor conductivity in the mno2 electrode rct 2 76 ω σ 44 88 ω s0 5 the mno2 hpc also had much lower rct 0 23 ω and σ 12 36 ω s0 5 values the well dispersed mno2 nanorods connected with the conductive matrix of hpc could substantially facilitate the ion and electron transportation fig s3 chen et al 2013 sevilla et al 2017 similarly the quasi rectangular shape in the cv curves was also observed for the mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes in 1 m mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes with a slightly higher current response compared to that of 1 m nacl fig 2d and 2e consistent with the cv results the galvanostatic charge discharge curves of the mno2 hpc electrode in 1 m mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes also showed linear and symmetric curves but had relatively higher specific capacitances of 177 3 f g 1 mgcl2 and 179 6 f g 1 cacl2 respectively fig s13 similarly the mno2 carbon electrode was reported to have a similar specific capacitance in equimolar concentrations of nacl and mgcl2 electrolytes xu et al 2021 the relatively higher specific capacitances of the mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes in divalent electrolytes i e mgcl2 and cacl2 also indicate their excellent water softening capacity then dunn s method fig s14 tan et al 2021 was used to calculate the contributions of edl capacitance and pseudocapacitance for the mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes respectively as shown in fig 2f the approximately 87 capacitance of the mno2 hpc electrode resulted from pseudocapacitance and the capacitance was approximately 82 for the pani hpc electrode in 1 m nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes these results further demonstrate that the pseudocapacitive intercalation process was the main charge storage mechanism in the electrochemical reaction for both mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes in nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes more importantly the pseudocapacitive contributed capacities in the hardness ion electrolytes mgcl2 and cacl2 were relatively higher than those in the nacl electrolyte 2 3 water desalination and water softening performance the representative current density and nacl concentration profiles of the hpchpc mno2 pani hpc and mno2 hpc pani hpc cells are depicted in fig s15 at each applied cell voltage the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell always possessed the highest salt electrosorption capacity followed by the mno2 pani hpc and hpchpc cells fig 3 a 3c fig s16 shows the corresponding average salt electrosorption rates charge efficiencies and energy consumptions obviously the best desalination performance was observed for the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell the energy consumption for the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell in 5 mm nacl solution was only 0 64 wh g 1 which was considerably lower than previously reported conventional cdis as well as mno2 based hybrid cdis hand and cusick 2017 he et al 2021 xu et al 2021 notably only 0 17 wh l 1 of energy was required to desalinate the feed solution to drinking water 20 mg l 1 nacl making it quite low compared to ro processes 0 5 2 5 wh l 1 for brackish water with salinity 10 g l 1 tan et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 the highest electrosorption capacities for the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell was up to 0 65 mmol g 1 nacl 0 71 mmol g 1 mgcl2 and 0 76 mmol g 1 cacl2 fig 3d its maximum nacl electrosorption capacity was comparable and even higher than the values reported in the previous studies table s2 in which similar mno2 or mno2 pani carbon composite electrodes were applied jin et al 2020 nie et al 2020 in addition the maximum mgcl2 and cacl2 electrosorption capacities were also higher than those in the previous reports table s3 s4 liu et al 2020 uwayid et al 2022 its excellent brackish water desalination and water softening performance could mainly be ascribed to the pseudocapacitive behaviors of the pani hpc and mno2 hpc electrodes which can selectively intercalate negative ions cl and positive ions na mg2 and ca2 evans et al 2019 tan et al 2020 wang et al 2019 in addition the synergistic effects between the high porosity of the hpc and mno2 pani could generate higher specific capacitances better hydrophilicity and reduce charge transfer and ionic diffusion resistances thereby guaranteeing excellent desalination performance fig 2 and fig s8 then the cycling performance of the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell was examined the nacl electrosorption capacity remained at approximately ca 0 35 mmol g 1 the mgcl2 electrosorption capacity remained at ca 0 39 mmol g 1 while the cacl2 electrosorption capacity was stable at ca 0 42 mmol g 1 fig 3e in addition the desorption efficiency remained approximately 96 suggesting that the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell exhibited exceptional regeneration capabilities fig s17 the porous hpc served as a supportive backbone in the mno2 hpc composite which could prevent particle aggregation reduce the volume expansion contraction of mno2 enhance the structural integrity and perform long term cycling chen et al 2013 in order to further illustrate the stability the mno2 hpc powder was scratched off from the carbon cloth for raman xrd sem and tem characterizations the intensity ratio of d band to g band i d i g increased from 0 99 to 1 02 after 30 cycles indicating slight oxidation of the mno2 hpc electrode fig s18 however the xrd characterizations indicate that the crystal structure of the mno2 hpc electrode had no obvious change in comparison with the original one after 30 cycles in 10 mm nacl fig s19 there was also no significant change in the morphology of the mno2 hpc electrode fig s20 and fig s21 in addition the uniform coating of the pani on the hpc surface could reduce the kinetics of parasitic reactions of carbon materials fig s3 additionally the shallow traps for the pani molecules in the pores of hpc can protect it from degradation evans et al 2019 gao et al 2022 as a result the pani hpc composite electrode could also retain a large cycling capacity evans et al 2019 the galvanostatic charge discharge tests also demonstrated the high stability of the mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes fig s22 additionally the effluent ph in 10 mm nacl in all 30 cycles slightly decreased and stabilized at approximately 6 5 7 0 fig s23 these results further demonstrate that the facile designed mno2 hpc could be applied as an efficient electrode material for improved brackish water desalination and hardness ion removal 2 4 cation selectivity of the α mno2 hpc electrode the cation selectivity of the mno2 hpc electrode in binary salt solutions was subsequently investigated fig 4 the difference in cation electrosorption capacity between na and mg2 cations gradually increased when the applied voltage was increased from 0 8 v to 1 4 v fig 4a similar results were observed in the binary nacl cacl2 solution fig 4b indicating that the mno2 hpc possessed divalent selectivity over monovalent cations since the mno2 hpc surface was negatively charged fig s7 there was a strong electrostatic force between divalent cations and the mno2 hpc surface leong and yang 2020 leong et al 2021 in addition the active sites occupied by na could be gradually replaced by divalent cations mg2 or ca2 because of the stronger interaction between the divalent ions and the negatively charged electrode surface which results from the ion swapping effect srimuk et al 2020 xu et al 2021 more importantly the divalent cation selectivity could still be maintained when the concentration of na was twice that of ca2 fig s24 suggesting that the mno2 hpc electrode had a great potential in water softening in addition the mno2 hpc electrode showed a relatively higher affinity for ca2 than mg2 fig 4c one reason could be the slower kinetics of mg2 intercalation deintercalation into the tunnel structure of α mno2 than that of ca2 as the hydrated ionic radius of mg2 0 43 nm is larger than that of ca2 0 41 nm singh et al 2021 shocron et al 2022 the relatively higher hydration energy of mg2 1830 kj mol 1 compared to that of ca2 1505 kj mol 1 could also limit mg2 intercalation deintercalation fig 4d and e other studies also showed that ca2 could be more strongly attracted to the negatively charged electrode because of its smaller hydrated radius compared to that of mg2 singh et al 2021 to further evaluate the selective capacity of mg2 and ca2 over na in the mno2 hpc electrode the intercalation mechanisms were elucidated using molecular dynamics simulations and dft calculations the intercalation capacities of cations in the mno2 hpc were evaluated by monte carlo simulations the results indicate that the amount of mg2 and ca2 was obviously greater than that of na fig 5 a and b this might be attributed to the relatively higher binding energy between divalent cations and the electrode than that of na fig 5c duchanois et al 2022 the cation selectivity of the mno2 hpc was largely dependent on the special configuration of α mno2 in addition the interaction energies e inter of cations and α mno2 were precisely examined by dft calculations through the unit cell model of α mno2 for the limited lumen size only one water molecule can be encapsulated in the cavity with the cation after equilibrium fig s25 and fig 5d f the location site of the cations is offset from the center of the cavity of α mno2 table s5 from the e inter of the cations in α mno2 fig 5g it is obvious that the binding strength of mg2 and ca2 to the lumen side is much higher than that of na this proves that the intercalation selectivity of divalent cations in the electrode can be contributed by the stronger binding strength of mg2 and ca2 in the cavity of α mno2 singh et al 2021 moreover the charge distributions of the cation intercalation systems from mulliken charge analysis indicate that only 0 44 e electrons are transferred from α mno2 and h2o to na table s6 while 0 76 e and 0 82 e are transferred from that to mg2 and ca2 respectively the electron density difference also confirms the direction and degree of electron transfer in the encapsulation of cations to α mno2 fig 5d f and fig s26 su et al 2018 thus the mno2 hpc electrodes with a reasonable combination and configuration offer better intercalation selectivity of mg2 and ca2 overall the mno2 hpc electrode exhibited a selectivity order of ca2 mg2 na due to the differences in valence hydrated radius and binding strength in the cavity of mno2 3 conclusions the well dispersed mno2 nanorods connected with hpc were prepared using a facile one step hydrothermal approach the prepared mno2 hpc electrode had a considerable specific capacitance of 175 2 f g 1 low charge transfer and ion diffusion resistance and superior stability in comparison with the hpchpc and mno2 pani hpc cells the mno2 hpc pani hpc cell exhibited the highest nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 electrosorption capacity fastest salt electrosorption rate highest charge efficiency and lowest energy consumption the mno2 hpc electrode delivered selective intercalation to the hardness ions mg2 and ca2 in the binary salt solutions both ion valence and radius could affect their competitive intercalation into the mno2 hpc electrode furthermore molecular dynamics simulations and dft calculations indicate that the preference of mno2 hpc toward divalent ions was mainly due to their stronger binding strength in the cavity of mno2 our results clearly demonstrate that cdi with the facile designed mno2 hpc composite electrode can offer a great promise in brackish water desalination and water softening 4 material and methods 4 1 preparation of mno2 hpc and polyaniline hpc the chemicals used in this work are described in the supporting information the hpc was produced from microalgae spirulina platensis biomass sevilla et al 2017 first the microalgae samples were thoroughly mixed with caco3 and k2c2o4 at a weight ratio of

impurities and then thoroughly washed with deionized water then both mno2 hpc and pani hpc were prepared via a facile one step hydrothermal procedure fig 1a evans et al 2019 for the mno2 hpc 0 35 g mnso4 1 g k2s2o8 and 0 35 g hpc powder were mixed in 56 ml deionized water di under stirring for 20 min at room temperature then 4 ml koh 1 m was wisely dropped into the solution with magnetic

precipitates were washed with di water several times and collected by vacuum filtration mno2 was produced with the same procedure without the addition of hpc for the pani hpc 0 35 g hpc powder 0 35 g

similarly the obtained mixture was transferred into a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated for 6 h at 120 c the formed pani hpc was then washed with di water and ethanol several times and collected by vacuum filtration finally the mno2 mno2 hpc and pani hpc samples were dried in vacuum at 50 c for 24 h details about the preparation and characterizations of the hpc mno2 mno2 hpc and pani hpc electrodes are given in the supporting information 4 2 capacitive deionization tests the desalination of brackish water 2 5 10 mm nacl and softening of water 2 5 10 mm mgcl2 and cacl2 were performed in a homemade cdi cell fig s27 the cell consisted of a cathode hpc or pani hpc and an anode hpc mno2 or mno2 hpc the water channel was formed by a 0 5 mm thick silicon gasket between the anode and cathode and a filament fabric served as the spacer titanium foils were used as current leads in the brackish water desalination and water softening processes 70 ml of feed solution was circulated through the cdi cell at a flow rate of 35 ml min 1 a constant voltage i e 0 8 1 0 1 2 v or 1 4 v was applied to the cell by a potentiostat parstat mc princeton applied research inc usa for

scientific inc usa the ph variation of the effluent solution was monitored by a ph meter s210 mettler toledo co switzerland details on the calculations of salt electrosorption capacity salt electrosorption rate charge efficiency and energy consumption are provided in the supporting information 4 3 theoretical calculations the intercalation behaviors of na mg2 and ca2 in mno2 hpc were determined according to the metropolis monte carlo method metropolis et al 1953 the α mno2 hpc supercell consists of two graphene sheets with a mno2 layer with a size of 29 82 å 29 52 å 16 20 å showing mn c bonds between the graphene layer and α mno2 the molecular dynamics simulations were implemented to predict the intercalation amounts of ions in the mno2 hpc supercell using universal force fields the ewald summation was used to evaluate the electrostatic interactions with an accuracy of 1 10 4 kcal mol the atom based summation was applied to assess the van der waals interactions by using cubic spline truncation of a 15 5 å cutoff distance and a 1 0 å spline width the location and the amounts of the ion species could be reflected in the simulations to further investigate the

19904,motivated by the need for enhancing sorbent affinity for per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas we demonstrate the possibility of rationally designing clay based material fluoroclay with a pre selected intercalant and predicting sorbent performance using all atom molecular dynamics simulation coupled with density functional theory based computation perfluorohexyldodecane quaternary ammonium f6h12a as the selected intercalant revealed significant enhancement in adsorption affinity for hard to remove compounds including perfluorobutane sulfonate pfbs and polyfluoroalkylethers genx and adona the adsorption is thermodynamically entropy driven and dominated by the hydrophobic effect the incorporation of fluorine atoms into clay intercalants gave rise to a hydrophobic and fluorophilic cavity structure for targeted pfas the self assembly of intercalant pfas under the negative electric field of clay sheets created a unique configuration that significantly enlarged the contact surface area between pfas and f6h12a and was quantitatively driven by their intermolecular interactions e g cf chain ch chain cf chain cf chain and charge ch chain interactions collectively our work demonstrated a new approach to select fluorinated functionality for designing a new adsorbent and estimating its performance via molecular simulation it also provided an in depth understanding of the underlying fundamental physics and chemistry in the adsorption of pfas suggesting a new strategy for pfas removal particularly for short chain pfas and new chemical alternatives graphical abstract synopsis md simulation directed rational design of clay based framework was established for efficient removal of pfas particularly short chain pfbs and polyether alternatives genx and adona image graphical abstract keywords density functional theory molecular dynamics per and polyfluoroalkyl substances rational designing self assembly data availability data will be made available on request introduction water contamination by per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas impacts many countries and leads to regulatory actions to reduce human exposure to these toxic chemicals backe et al 2013 houtz et al 2013 moody et al 2003 munoz et al 2018 munoz et al 2023 pfas are used to make water and oil repellent coatings specialty polymers pesticides and aqueous film forming foams afff for controlling class b fires buck et al 2011 kissa 2001 however the strong c f single bond av 485 kj mol and f being a hard atom krafft and riess 2015 that make pfas versatile in applications also lead to persistent pollutants drinking water guidelines as low as 0 004 ng l for perfluorooctane carboxylate pfoa and 0 02 ng l perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos are developed by u s epa 2022 the long chain pfas remain widely detected despite phase out while replacements with short perfluoroalkyl chains e g perfluorobutane sulfonate pfbs or alternative chemistry e g polyfluoroalkylether pose emerging concerns and are highlighted in the newly released pfas strategic roadmap epa s commitments to action 2021 2024 u s epa 2021 stringent guidelines result in costly water treatment processes because existing adsorbents used for removing pfas from water are often not effective the most commonly used activated carbon relies on large specific surface areas among a porous structure and the hydrophobic effect to remove organics of low solubility from water however activated carbon shows limited efficacy for removing short chain pfas n 6 because of the high solubility imparted by charged functional groups e g carboxylate sulfonate alternatively adsorbents that enable ion exchange processes or ionic interactions are utilized to remove anionic pfas such adsorbents are either functionalized with amine groups e g diethylaminoethyl quaternary amine or are inherently aminated e g polyacrylonitrile however the competitive adsorption from co existing organic e g humic and fulvic acids and inorganic e g sulfate chloride anions at concentrations of magnitude higher than pfas can significantly reduce the efficacy of the ion exchange process in removing pfas ateia et al 2019 boyer et al 2021 kumarasamy et al 2020 alternatively xiao et al 2017 and yang et at 2020 crosslinked fluorinated substituents e g decafluorobiphenyl and tris 2 aminoethyl amine with pentafluorobenzaldehyde with structures of β cyclodextrin containing polymers and reported greater affinity for pfoa than activated carbon or non fluorinated du et al 2016 modified montmorillonite with a cationic fluorosurfactant and attributed enhanced adsorption of pfos pfoa to fluorophilic interactions between c f chains of the intercalants and target contaminants these studies have inspired us to explore adding fluorinated substituents into adsorbents and using the c f chain and related molecular interactions for pfas water treatment however no theoretical framework or empirical methods exist for selecting fluorinated functionality for creating new adsorbents for water treatment as laboratory evaluation of adsorbent performance is tedious and costly we chose molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory dft computation to address this challenge all atom molecular dynamics md a simulation method based on classical mechanics of multiparticle systems can provide the ultimate details of particles e g atoms groups and molecules offering a seeing is believing way of studying their physical movements adcock and mccammon 2006 furthermore a detailed and accurate picture of how pfas molecules interact can also be attained by the dft based quantum computations which determine atomic forces and system energy from first principles by approximating the schrödinger equation hermann et al 2017 previously these tools have been complementarily used to support laboratory investigations by elucidating adsorption mechanisms and reaction pathways including for the uptake of pfas by various adsorbents yan et al 2020 yan et al 2021 and defluorination of pfas with hydrated electrons biswas et al 2022 yamijala et al 2020 herein we propose that this powerful coupled simulation tool is also suitable for the rational design of new adsorbents with fluorinated functionalities fluoroclay before material synthesis and laboratory testing are to be conducted in this proof of concept study we choose smectite clay as the substrate for functionalization the layered material has been used to create organic inorganic nanocomposites through intercalating organic species e g neutral molecules organic cations or anions in the exchange sites of interlayer space the presence of clay can improve the mechanical thermal barrier and fire retardancy properties of these organic species ruiz hitzky and van meerbeek 2006 smectite is suitable for water treatment also due to practical reasons e g low cost durability large interlayer space and fouling resistance cadars et al 2012 zeng et al 2003 besides developing the theoretical framework the study reveals in depth molecular mechanisms involving a range of fluorinated structures designing intercalant for pfas through advanced computations the starting point was to compare the relative magnitude of hydrophobic and fluorophilic interactions that major pfas can engage previous experiments demonstrated that the adsorbent capacity increases with increased perfluoroalkyl cf chain length park et al 2020 from this premise dft based computations were carried out to determine the free energy of solvation for anionic pfas in water n octanol and 2 2 2 trifluoroethanol at ph 7 the widely used b3lyp method with the smd model was chosen liu et al 2018 and the dispersion interactions were also included via the d3 version of grimmer s dispersion grimme et al 2010 three most common basis sets e g 6311 gdp 6311 g2d2p and 6311 g3df2p were tested and the values determined at 6311 g3df2p which shows the smallest average bond length differences theory experiment of 398 molecules u s nist 2022 were set as the benchmarking data fig s1 and table s1 s3 hidalgo and mora diez 2016 compared the partitioning coefficients of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfca predicted by dft theory with experimental data determined by jing et al 2009 and found that the general trend could be well reproduced using dft based computation though the logp values for the carboxylates were underestimated with average errors of 2 74 therefore we focused on the trend slope i e increase in log unit per cf2 the 11 representative structures included six perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas e g pfbs pfpes pfhxs pfhps pfos and pfns one carboxylate pfoa one fluorotelomer sulfonate 6 2 ftsa one sulfonamide fhxsa and two polyether carboxylates genx hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid and adona 4 8 dioxa 3h perfluorononanoate the slope of basis set 6311 gdp was determined to be 0 50 which is close to 0 51 of 6311 g3df2p and the residual sum of squares of 6311 gdp was small 0 12 fig s2 thus 6311 gdp was chosen as the basis set for dft based computations in this study the corresponding hydrophobicity and fluorophilicity were predicted by the distribution coefficient logd ow octanol water and logd fw 2 2 2 trifluoroethanol water fig 1 b take pfsas as examples logd ow and log d fw increased with increased cf chain length showing enhanced hydrophobicity and fluorophilicity except for pfns having a slightly lower logd fw than pfos for a specific pfas the logd fw value is 1 6 log units larger than logd ow suggesting that pfas favor fluorous phase domain more than hydrocarbon phase domain encouraged by this calculation we tested a fluorinated analog to a common hydrocarbon quaternary ammonium intercalant c18 h ch2 18n ch3 3 by partially replacing ch segment with cf f6h12a f cf2 6 ch2 12n ch3 3 perfluorohexyldodecane quaternary ammonium was selected as the hypothetical fluorinated intercalant after we evaluated the influence of n 4 n 12 in fnh12a discussed in supporting information fig s3 s12 and table s4 to assess the effect of such a modification we conducted microsecond long fully atomistic md simulations for 12 intercalants and 1 pfas in the interlayer of 6 4 clay supercells immersed in explicit spc e water berendsen et al 1987 the density distributions of the headgroup group i e quaternary ammonium ch chain and cf chain of the intercalants c18 and fnh12a in the direction normal to the clay surface were calculated to establish the interlayer structure in c18 fnh12a clay the initially randomly oriented c18 or f6h12a intercalants spontaneously self assembled into cylinder aggregates or hemimicelles under the negative electric field the smectite layer is naturally negatively charged due to the iso substitution of al by mg the positively charged ammonium groups headed to silicate layers as seen in the two sharp peaks in the density profiles in fig 2 a 2c 2e and 2g while the ch or cf ch chains twisted in the center of interlayer and formed hydrophobic domains revealed by the dramatic drops in water density the root means square deviation rmsd levels of intercalants and pfbs were about 0 35 and 0 1 nm fig s13 indicating the structures were very stable notably all pfas the interlayer structure of pfpes pfhps pfns pfoa 6 2 ftsa fhxsa genx adona were given in fig s14 participated in the aggregate and were wrapped in the cf ch domain of f6h12a fig 2d 2f and 2h which implied strong intermolecular affinity conversely pfbs interacted with the surface of c18 aggregate and was largely in contact with the water phase as illustrated in fig 2b the simulation results demonstrate that the adsorption of pfas in the interlayer of modified smectite clay experienced self assembly of fluorinated intercalant pfas under the negative electric field of clay sheets driving force interaction strength and orbital origin of pfas intercalant self assembly a dft based thermochemistry calculation was performed to investigate the driving force of such a spontaneous self assembly behavior the focus is on the intercalant pfas with c18 pfbs and f6h12apfbs as examples the water cage i e hydration was taken into account phillips 1955 due to the limit of computational resources 24 clay unit cells that strongly interacted with the quaternary ammonium headgroup rather than the hydrophobic domain zeng et al 2003 were not included and the number of 12 f6h12a intercalants was reduced to 3 three configurations of 3c181pfbs fig s15 and 3f6h12a1pfbs fig 2i were obtained from the last 10 ns of the above 1 μs md simulation the rmsd levels of intercalant and pfbs were off to 0 35 and 0 1 nm respectively indicating the structures were very stable fig s13 the thermochemistry analysis was divided into two steps to compare with the reference data of micellization phillips 1955 1st step self assembly of the three intercalants and 2nd step pfbs contacting or entering the self assembly structure the change in gibbs free energy δg1 of step 1 were determined 3c181pfbs 34 41 kcal mol and 3f6h12a1pfbs 54 25 4 60 kcal mol details in table s5 s8 therefore the gibbs free energy gained per c18 f16h12a entering the self assembly structure formed by the intercalants were determined to be 11 47 and 18 08 1 53 kcal mol i e δg1 3 which were highly consistent with the benchmarking values for a c18 13 43 kcal mol and for f6h12a 16 26 17 28 kcal mol predicted by phillips 1955 in the 2nd step the δg2 of 3f6h12a for one pfbs 108 07 7 90 kcal mol was 4 4 times larger than that of 3c18 24 57 kcal mol indicating the structure formed by 3f6h12a was more favorable for adsorbing pfbs than that of 3c18 the δg and δh with hydration in sum were 3c18 1pfbs 58 98 and 22 55 kcal mol and 3f6h12a1pfbs 162 32 and 40 30 kcal mol in contrast without the water cages the corresponding δg values were 15 17 and 37 02 11 98 kcal mol respectively the hydrophobic effect arising from the release of low entropy hydration water into bulk solution during the self assembly of 3f6h12a1pfbs could be further quantified δg 199 34 6 38 kcal mol δh 24 5 14 83 kcal mol and t δs 174 84 8 79 kcal mol the results revealed that the self assembly of intercalant pfas was thermodynamically entropy driven and dominated by the hydrophobic effect in agreement with phillips 1955 and maestre et al 2014 though the self assemblies of c18pfas and f6h12apfas are both spontaneous and governed by hydrophobic effect the distinct aggregate structures of f6h12apfas originated from the enhanced intermolecular interactions between f6h12a and pfas largely intensified such as an effect to probe the interactions we mapped the electrostatic potential onto the electron isodensity surface of c18pfbs f6h12apfbs f6h12apfhxs f6h12apfos extracted from fig 2b 2d 2f and 2g as illustrated in fig 3 a 3b 3c and 3d the orientations of pfbs pfhxs and pfos within the cf ch domain of f6h12a correlate with the alignment between high electron density regions blue area and poor electron density red area this pattern seemed to be particularly crucial in f6h12apfas aggregates where the electron rich region anionic sulfonic group cf chain of pfas and the electron poor region ch chain of 12 f6h12a generated a total permanent dipole across the cf ch domain i e 12f6h12a1pfbs of 2373 d pfbs in 12 f6h12a had a dipole moment of 210 d and its vector was antiparallel to the dipole of the 12f6h12a 2581 d upon the formation of 12f6h12a1pfbs aggregate analogous results could be observed in 12f6h12a1pfhxs and 12f6h12a1pfos table s9 12c18 in the aggregate with pfbs revealed a much larger permanent dipole 4433 d compared to 12f6h12a in aggregate with pfbs and the dipole vector of pfbs in the aggregate 12c18 1pfbs was not particularly aligned with the dipole of 12c18 the dipole reproducibility was confirmed for 12c181pfbs and 12f6h12a1pfbs systems with longer md simulation times e g 2 μs 3 μs and 5 μs table s9 to quantify the association strength between intercalant and pfas we determined the multiple interaction energies δe between the moieties of 12c18 or 12f6h12a with those of pfas pfas cf chain cf chain of intercalant cf chain ch chain and cf chain charge of intercalant ch2 n ch3 3 pfas charge intercalant head group of pfas coo so3 or so2nh charge cf chain of intercalant charge ch chain and lastly charge charge as shown in fig 3e f6h12a had a much larger δe 1 8 times with pfbs than c18 due to the remarkable cavity structure formed by the ch cf domain the trend among the pfas homologue shows that a longer cf chain corresponds to a higher δe because of a larger contacting surface area and more cf2 dipoles namely pfns 48 1 kcal mol demonstrated the strongest interaction with f6h12a followed by pfos 44 3 kcal mol 6 2 ftsa 42 2 kcal mol pfoa 37 9 kcal mol fhxsa 37 1 kcal mol and pfhxs 36 1 kcal mol the trend is consistent with the reported trend of pfas adsorption du et al 2016 yan et al 2020 furthermore f6h12a strongly interacted with genx 38 3 kcal mol and adona 35 7 kcal mol implying its application potential for the emerging pfas interestingly dipole dipole interactions involving cf chain i e cf chain ch chain and cf chain cf chain contributed to a large proportion of the total δe particularly the cf chain ch chain that may be caused by the impact of introduced cf chain on the ch chain of f6h12a krafft and riess 2009 2015 instead the contribution of the positively charged quaternary ammonium group in both c18 and f6h12a was relatively low impressively each interaction term of f6h12a for pfbs was more significant than that of c18 due to the high contact area with the ch cf domain a second order perturbation analysis on the natural population analysis was performed to assess the electron delocalization in the self assembly structure in 12f6h12apfbs the lone pairs of e on the oxygen atoms and antibonding orbitals of s o of pfbs interacted with the antibonding orbitals of c h and c rydberg orbitals in the c h bond of f6h12a respectively which gave rise to the charge ch chain energy of 7 4 kcal mol a strong interaction 17 3 kcal mol was observed between the lone pairs on f atoms in pfbs and the antibonding orbitals of the c h bond in f6h12a this interaction arose from the excess electron density on the fluorine atom that is partially transferred to the neighboring antibonding orbitals mendez arroyo et al 2014 notably in complex 12f6h12a6 2 ftsa the lone pair e of f atom associated with the antibonding orbital of c f bond that generated the fluorophilic interaction cf chain cf chain interaction 12 2 kcal mol stronger and more diverse interactions of f6h12a with pfas compounds resulted in the unique cavity structure and boosted its adsorption performance than the traditional hydrocarbon intercalant c18 performance of fluoroclay for pfas estimated by all atom md simulation finally we sought to estimate the performance of clay modified by f6h12a fluoroclay for pfas to achieve this aim we carried out 1 μs md simulations of clay supercell 20 12 unit cells with pfas in spc e water the ratio of cation exchange capacity to f6h12a was set to 1 1 and 48 pfas were randomly inserted 20 of the intercalant du et al 2016 a pfas molecule was considered to be adsorbed if it is within 3 3 å of the intercalants mountain and lippa 2008 mountain and thirumalai 1998 consistent with reported work du et al 2016 all pfas including pfbs pfos pfoa 6 2 ftsa fhxsa genx and adona assembled with f6h12a in

19904,motivated by the need for enhancing sorbent affinity for per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas we demonstrate the possibility of rationally designing clay based material fluoroclay with a pre selected intercalant and predicting sorbent performance using all atom molecular dynamics simulation coupled with density functional theory based computation perfluorohexyldodecane quaternary ammonium f6h12a as the selected intercalant revealed significant enhancement in adsorption affinity for hard to remove compounds including perfluorobutane sulfonate pfbs and polyfluoroalkylethers genx and adona the adsorption is thermodynamically entropy driven and dominated by the hydrophobic effect the incorporation of fluorine atoms into clay intercalants gave rise to a hydrophobic and fluorophilic cavity structure for targeted pfas the self assembly of intercalant pfas under the negative electric field of clay sheets created a unique configuration that significantly enlarged the contact surface area between pfas and f6h12a and was quantitatively driven by their intermolecular interactions e g cf chain ch chain cf chain cf chain and charge ch chain interactions collectively our work demonstrated a new approach to select fluorinated functionality for designing a new adsorbent and estimating its performance via molecular simulation it also provided an in depth understanding of the underlying fundamental physics and chemistry in the adsorption of pfas suggesting a new strategy for pfas removal particularly for short chain pfas and new chemical alternatives graphical abstract synopsis md simulation directed rational design of clay based framework was established for efficient removal of pfas particularly short chain pfbs and polyether alternatives genx and adona image graphical abstract keywords density functional theory molecular dynamics per and polyfluoroalkyl substances rational designing self assembly data availability data will be made available on request introduction water contamination by per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas impacts many countries and leads to regulatory actions to reduce human exposure to these toxic chemicals backe et al 2013 houtz et al 2013 moody et al 2003 munoz et al 2018 munoz et al 2023 pfas are used to make water and oil repellent coatings specialty polymers pesticides and aqueous film forming foams afff for controlling class b fires buck et al 2011 kissa 2001 however the strong c f single bond av 485 kj mol and f being a hard atom krafft and riess 2015 that make pfas versatile in applications also lead to persistent pollutants drinking water guidelines as low as 0 004 ng l for perfluorooctane carboxylate pfoa and 0 02 ng l perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos are developed by u s epa 2022 the long chain pfas remain widely detected despite phase out while replacements with short perfluoroalkyl chains e g perfluorobutane sulfonate pfbs or alternative chemistry e g polyfluoroalkylether pose emerging concerns and are highlighted in the newly released pfas strategic roadmap epa s commitments to action 2021 2024 u s epa 2021 stringent guidelines result in costly water treatment processes because existing adsorbents used for removing pfas from water are often not effective the most commonly used activated carbon relies on large specific surface areas among a porous structure and the hydrophobic effect to remove organics of low solubility from water however activated carbon shows limited efficacy for removing short chain pfas n 6 because of the high solubility imparted by charged functional groups e g carboxylate sulfonate alternatively adsorbents that enable ion exchange processes or ionic interactions are utilized to remove anionic pfas such adsorbents are either functionalized with amine groups e g diethylaminoethyl quaternary amine or are inherently aminated e g polyacrylonitrile however the competitive adsorption from co existing organic e g humic and fulvic acids and inorganic e g sulfate chloride anions at concentrations of magnitude higher than pfas can significantly reduce the efficacy of the ion exchange process in removing pfas ateia et al 2019 boyer et al 2021 kumarasamy et al 2020 alternatively xiao et al 2017 and yang et at 2020 crosslinked fluorinated substituents e g decafluorobiphenyl and tris 2 aminoethyl amine with pentafluorobenzaldehyde with structures of β cyclodextrin containing polymers and reported greater affinity for pfoa than activated carbon or non fluorinated du et al 2016 modified montmorillonite with a cationic fluorosurfactant and attributed enhanced adsorption of pfos pfoa to fluorophilic interactions between c f chains of the intercalants and target contaminants these studies have inspired us to explore adding fluorinated substituents into adsorbents and using the c f chain and related molecular interactions for pfas water treatment however no theoretical framework or empirical methods exist for selecting fluorinated functionality for creating new adsorbents for water treatment as laboratory evaluation of adsorbent performance is tedious and costly we chose molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory dft computation to address this challenge all atom molecular dynamics md a simulation method based on classical mechanics of multiparticle systems can provide the ultimate details of particles e g atoms groups and molecules offering a seeing is believing way of studying their physical movements adcock and mccammon 2006 furthermore a detailed and accurate picture of how pfas molecules interact can also be attained by the dft based quantum computations which determine atomic forces and system energy from first principles by approximating the schrödinger equation hermann et al 2017 previously these tools have been complementarily used to support laboratory investigations by elucidating adsorption mechanisms and reaction pathways including for the uptake of pfas by various adsorbents yan et al 2020 yan et al 2021 and defluorination of pfas with hydrated electrons biswas et al 2022 yamijala et al 2020 herein we propose that this powerful coupled simulation tool is also suitable for the rational design of new adsorbents with fluorinated functionalities fluoroclay before material synthesis and laboratory testing are to be conducted in this proof of concept study we choose smectite clay as the substrate for functionalization the layered material has been used to create organic inorganic nanocomposites through intercalating organic species e g neutral molecules organic cations or anions in the exchange sites of interlayer space the presence of clay can improve the mechanical thermal barrier and fire retardancy properties of these organic species ruiz hitzky and van meerbeek 2006 smectite is suitable for water treatment also due to practical reasons e g low cost durability large interlayer space and fouling resistance cadars et al 2012 zeng et al 2003 besides developing the theoretical framework the study reveals in depth molecular mechanisms involving a range of fluorinated structures designing intercalant for pfas through advanced computations the starting point was to compare the relative magnitude of hydrophobic and fluorophilic interactions that major pfas can engage previous experiments demonstrated that the adsorbent capacity increases with increased perfluoroalkyl cf chain length park et al 2020 from this premise dft based computations were carried out to determine the free energy of solvation for anionic pfas in water n octanol and 2 2 2 trifluoroethanol at ph 7 the widely used b3lyp method with the smd model was chosen liu et al 2018 and the dispersion interactions were also included via the d3 version of grimmer s dispersion grimme et al 2010 three most common basis sets e g 6311 gdp 6311 g2d2p and 6311 g3df2p were tested and the values determined at 6311 g3df2p which shows the smallest average bond length differences theory experiment of 398 molecules u s nist 2022 were set as the benchmarking data fig s1 and table s1 s3 hidalgo and mora diez 2016 compared the partitioning coefficients of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfca predicted by dft theory with experimental data determined by jing et al 2009 and found that the general trend could be well reproduced using dft based computation though the logp values for the carboxylates were underestimated with average errors of 2 74 therefore we focused on the trend slope i e increase in log unit per cf2 the 11 representative structures included six perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas e g pfbs pfpes pfhxs pfhps pfos and pfns one carboxylate pfoa one fluorotelomer sulfonate 6 2 ftsa one sulfonamide fhxsa and two polyether carboxylates genx hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid and adona 4 8 dioxa 3h perfluorononanoate the slope of basis set 6311 gdp was determined to be 0 50 which is close to 0 51 of 6311 g3df2p and the residual sum of squares of 6311 gdp was small 0 12 fig s2 thus 6311 gdp was chosen as the basis set for dft based computations in this study the corresponding hydrophobicity and fluorophilicity were predicted by the distribution coefficient logd ow octanol water and logd fw 2 2 2 trifluoroethanol water fig 1 b take pfsas as examples logd ow and log d fw increased with increased cf chain length showing enhanced hydrophobicity and fluorophilicity except for pfns having a slightly lower logd fw than pfos for a specific pfas the logd fw value is 1 6 log units larger than logd ow suggesting that pfas favor fluorous phase domain more than hydrocarbon phase domain encouraged by this calculation we tested a fluorinated analog to a common hydrocarbon quaternary ammonium intercalant c18 h ch2 18n ch3 3 by partially replacing ch segment with cf f6h12a f cf2 6 ch2 12n ch3 3 perfluorohexyldodecane quaternary ammonium was selected as the hypothetical fluorinated intercalant after we evaluated the influence of n 4 n 12 in fnh12a discussed in supporting information fig s3 s12 and table s4 to assess the effect of such a modification we conducted microsecond long fully atomistic md simulations for 12 intercalants and 1 pfas in the interlayer of 6 4 clay supercells immersed in explicit spc e water berendsen et al 1987 the density distributions of the headgroup group i e quaternary ammonium ch chain and cf chain of the intercalants c18 and fnh12a in the direction normal to the clay surface were calculated to establish the interlayer structure in c18 fnh12a clay the initially randomly oriented c18 or f6h12a intercalants spontaneously self assembled into cylinder aggregates or hemimicelles under the negative electric field the smectite layer is naturally negatively charged due to the iso substitution of al by mg the positively charged ammonium groups headed to silicate layers as seen in the two sharp peaks in the density profiles in fig 2 a 2c 2e and 2g while the ch or cf ch chains twisted in the center of interlayer and formed hydrophobic domains revealed by the dramatic drops in water density the root means square deviation rmsd levels of intercalants and pfbs were about 0 35 and 0 1 nm fig s13 indicating the structures were very stable notably all pfas the interlayer structure of pfpes pfhps pfns pfoa 6 2 ftsa fhxsa genx adona were given in fig s14 participated in the aggregate and were wrapped in the cf ch domain of f6h12a fig 2d 2f and 2h which implied strong intermolecular affinity conversely pfbs interacted with the surface of c18 aggregate and was largely in contact with the water phase as illustrated in fig 2b the simulation results demonstrate that the adsorption of pfas in the interlayer of modified smectite clay experienced self assembly of fluorinated intercalant pfas under the negative electric field of clay sheets driving force interaction strength and orbital origin of pfas intercalant self assembly a dft based thermochemistry calculation was performed to investigate the driving force of such a spontaneous self assembly behavior the focus is on the intercalant pfas with c18 pfbs and f6h12apfbs as examples the water cage i e hydration was taken into account phillips 1955 due to the limit of computational resources 24 clay unit cells that strongly interacted with the quaternary ammonium headgroup rather than the hydrophobic domain zeng et al 2003 were not included and the number of 12 f6h12a intercalants was reduced to 3 three configurations of 3c181pfbs fig s15 and 3f6h12a1pfbs fig 2i were obtained from the last 10 ns of the above 1 μs md simulation the rmsd levels of intercalant and pfbs were off to 0 35 and 0 1 nm respectively indicating the structures were very stable fig s13 the thermochemistry analysis was divided into two steps to compare with the reference data of micellization phillips 1955 1st step self assembly of the three intercalants and 2nd step pfbs contacting or entering the self assembly structure the change in gibbs free energy δg1 of step 1 were determined 3c181pfbs 34 41 kcal mol and 3f6h12a1pfbs 54 25 4 60 kcal mol details in table s5 s8 therefore the gibbs free energy gained per c18 f16h12a entering the self assembly structure formed by the intercalants were determined to be 11 47 and 18 08 1 53 kcal mol i e δg1 3 which were highly consistent with the benchmarking values for a c18 13 43 kcal mol and for f6h12a 16 26 17 28 kcal mol predicted by phillips 1955 in the 2nd step the δg2 of 3f6h12a for one pfbs 108 07 7 90 kcal mol was 4 4 times larger than that of 3c18 24 57 kcal mol indicating the structure formed by 3f6h12a was more favorable for adsorbing pfbs than that of 3c18 the δg and δh with hydration in sum were 3c18 1pfbs 58 98 and 22 55 kcal mol and 3f6h12a1pfbs 162 32 and 40 30 kcal mol in contrast without the water cages the corresponding δg values were 15 17 and 37 02 11 98 kcal mol respectively the hydrophobic effect arising from the release of low entropy hydration water into bulk solution during the self assembly of 3f6h12a1pfbs could be further quantified δg 199 34 6 38 kcal mol δh 24 5 14 83 kcal mol and t δs 174 84 8 79 kcal mol the results revealed that the self assembly of intercalant pfas was thermodynamically entropy driven and dominated by the hydrophobic effect in agreement with phillips 1955 and maestre et al 2014 though the self assemblies of c18pfas and f6h12apfas are both spontaneous and governed by hydrophobic effect the distinct aggregate structures of f6h12apfas originated from the enhanced intermolecular interactions between f6h12a and pfas largely intensified such as an effect to probe the interactions we mapped the electrostatic potential onto the electron isodensity surface of c18pfbs f6h12apfbs f6h12apfhxs f6h12apfos extracted from fig 2b 2d 2f and 2g as illustrated in fig 3 a 3b 3c and 3d the orientations of pfbs pfhxs and pfos within the cf ch domain of f6h12a correlate with the alignment between high electron density regions blue area and poor electron density red area this pattern seemed to be particularly crucial in f6h12apfas aggregates where the electron rich region anionic sulfonic group cf chain of pfas and the electron poor region ch chain of 12 f6h12a generated a total permanent dipole across the cf ch domain i e 12f6h12a1pfbs of 2373 d pfbs in 12 f6h12a had a dipole moment of 210 d and its vector was antiparallel to the dipole of the 12f6h12a 2581 d upon the formation of 12f6h12a1pfbs aggregate analogous results could be observed in 12f6h12a1pfhxs and 12f6h12a1pfos table s9 12c18 in the aggregate with pfbs revealed a much larger permanent dipole 4433 d compared to 12f6h12a in aggregate with pfbs and the dipole vector of pfbs in the aggregate 12c18 1pfbs was not particularly aligned with the dipole of 12c18 the dipole reproducibility was confirmed for 12c181pfbs and 12f6h12a1pfbs systems with longer md simulation times e g 2 μs 3 μs and 5 μs table s9 to quantify the association strength between intercalant and pfas we determined the multiple interaction energies δe between the moieties of 12c18 or 12f6h12a with those of pfas pfas cf chain cf chain of intercalant cf chain ch chain and cf chain charge of intercalant ch2 n ch3 3 pfas charge intercalant head group of pfas coo so3 or so2nh charge cf chain of intercalant charge ch chain and lastly charge charge as shown in fig 3e f6h12a had a much larger δe 1 8 times with pfbs than c18 due to the remarkable cavity structure formed by the ch cf domain the trend among the pfas homologue shows that a longer cf chain corresponds to a higher δe because of a larger contacting surface area and more cf2 dipoles namely pfns 48 1 kcal mol demonstrated the strongest interaction with f6h12a followed by pfos 44 3 kcal mol 6 2 ftsa 42 2 kcal mol pfoa 37 9 kcal mol fhxsa 37 1 kcal mol and pfhxs 36 1 kcal mol the trend is consistent with the reported trend of pfas adsorption du et al 2016 yan et al 2020 furthermore f6h12a strongly interacted with genx 38 3 kcal mol and adona 35 7 kcal mol implying its application potential for the emerging pfas interestingly dipole dipole interactions involving cf chain i e cf chain ch chain and cf chain cf chain contributed to a large proportion of the total δe particularly the cf chain ch chain that may be caused by the impact of introduced cf chain on the ch chain of f6h12a krafft and riess 2009 2015 instead the contribution of the positively charged quaternary ammonium group in both c18 and f6h12a was relatively low impressively each interaction term of f6h12a for pfbs was more significant than that of c18 due to the high contact area with the ch cf domain a second order perturbation analysis on the natural population analysis was performed to assess the electron delocalization in the self assembly structure in 12f6h12apfbs the lone pairs of e on the oxygen atoms and antibonding orbitals of s o of pfbs interacted with the antibonding orbitals of c h and c rydberg orbitals in the c h bond of f6h12a respectively which gave rise to the charge ch chain energy of 7 4 kcal mol a strong interaction 17 3 kcal mol was observed between the lone pairs on f atoms in pfbs and the antibonding orbitals of the c h bond in f6h12a this interaction arose from the excess electron density on the fluorine atom that is partially transferred to the neighboring antibonding orbitals mendez arroyo et al 2014 notably in complex 12f6h12a6 2 ftsa the lone pair e of f atom associated with the antibonding orbital of c f bond that generated the fluorophilic interaction cf chain cf chain interaction 12 2 kcal mol stronger and more diverse interactions of f6h12a with pfas compounds resulted in the unique cavity structure and boosted its adsorption performance than the traditional hydrocarbon intercalant c18 performance of fluoroclay for pfas estimated by all atom md simulation finally we sought to estimate the performance of clay modified by f6h12a fluoroclay for pfas to achieve this aim we carried out 1 μs md simulations of clay supercell 20 12 unit cells with pfas in spc e water the ratio of cation exchange capacity to f6h12a was set to 1 1 and 48 pfas were randomly inserted 20 of the intercalant du et al 2016 a pfas molecule was considered to be adsorbed if it is within 3 3 å of the intercalants mountain and lippa 2008 mountain and thirumalai 1998 consistent with reported work du et al 2016 all pfas including pfbs pfos pfoa 6 2 ftsa fhxsa genx and adona assembled with f6h12a in the interlayer space and there was no freely non adsorbed pfas fig 4 a and fig s16a s21a fig 4 displays the final configurations of fluoroclay pfas all time series of rmsd difference are only 0 05 0 2
