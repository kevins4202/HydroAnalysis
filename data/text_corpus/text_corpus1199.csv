5995,this study introduces a new macro scale hydrologic processes simulator macro hypros tailored for cold climate regions and depression dominated terrains macro hypros is a grid based hydrologic model of a unique structure to deal with hydrologic complexities in depression dominated cold climate regions the model runs on a daily time step and incorporates a lego fashion horizontal layout to account for sub grid land use heterogeneity on the vertical layout each grid consists of different bands each of which is responsible for simulating specific hydrologic processes macro hypros employs improved methodologies to account for snow accumulation and ablation depressions and frozen ground condition the red river of the north basin rrb was selected to highlight the capabilities of macro hypros in describing the spatiotemporal complexities associated with depression dominated cold climate regions results indicated that the model provided a satisfactory performance having the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of 0 56 and 0 72 in the calibration and validation periods respectively the modeling results accentuated the impacts of frozen ground snowmelt and depressions in the generation of surface runoff over the basin on average the rrb experienced 145 days of frozen or partially frozen ground conditions per year which coincided with early spring rainfall and snowmelt events due to the widespread frozen ground conditions over the basin up to 60 of the generated snowmelt on specific days contributed to surface runoff whereas infiltration had a smaller portion also the results revealed that the depression dominated areas acted as regulators of surface runoff particularly in early springs macro hypros provides spatiotemporal simulations of various hydrologic processes to facilitate a better understanding of macro scale hydrologic trends keywords macro scale hydrologic modeling cold climate regions depression dominated areas 1 introduction the idea of hydrologic modeling at different spatial scales i e micro meso and macro is comparable to using web mapping services in an online map zoomed in views are used to find specific locations and features while zoomed out maps give a holistic view of prominent geographical features of the area similarly micro scale hydrologic models are used to investigate the local hydrologic process such as filling spilling and merging of surface depressions chu et al 2013 on the other hand macro scale hydrologic models are associated with regional and continental hydrologic processes and provide large scale simulations for areas larger than a few thousand square kilometers chu et al 2019 döll et al 2008 macro scale hydrologic modeling is a relatively new field of research which has flourished over the 21st century sood and smakhtin 2015 as one of the initial efforts to substantiate macro scale models eagleson 1986 highlighted the necessity of the knowledge of the hydrologic cycle at a macro scale and portrayed a promising future for macro scale hydrologic models suggesting that the future of hydrology is intertwined with macro scale hydrologic models vörösmarty et al 1989 developed one of the first macro scale hydrologic models in which a water balance model was linked to a water flow model to simulate soil moisture evapotranspiration and surface runoff in south america although before the 21st century the macro scale models were considered as exotic siblings of catchment models döll et al 2008 large scale climate driven changes have led to rapid developments and applications of macro scale hydrologic models throughout the 21st century the emergence of the geographic information system gis along with the increasing availability of satellite images and remote sensing data facilitated pre and post processing of meteorological and hydrological data and applications of macro scale hydrologic models in different study areas the applications of macro scale hydrologic models around the world have indicated that they are useful tools for a variety of subjects such as impacts of climate driven changes on water resources arnell and gosling 2013 flood and drought return period analysis lehner et al 2006 and hydrologic implications of human activities syvitski et al 2005 there are several studies with the primary goal of evaluating different macro scale hydrologic models based on their capabilities features structures and abilities to capture the variations in hydrologic processes gudmundsson et al 2012 kauffeldt et al 2016 sood and smakhtin 2015 for example sood and smakhtin 2015 highlighted the capabilities and limitations of twelve macro scale models and discussed general limitations of macro scale modeling including the uncertainties in hydrologic modeling incorporation of remotely sensed data and scaling issues similarly kauffeldt et al 2016 reviewed 24 macro scale hydrologic models based on their suitability for flood forecasting in europe and provided guidance on model selection based on a set of criteria the selected criteria such as input data requirement flexibility to grid structure flexibility in resolution and possibility of calibration using suitable tools were chosen to accentuate the implementation of hydrologic models on a macro scale kauffeldt et al 2016 it was concluded that although these criteria were subjective to the specific applications of hydrologic models they could serve as an initial step in the model selection for operational flood forecasting schemes kauffeldt et al 2016 macro scale hydrologic models can be classified from different aspects such as their 1 primary objective s 2 integrated processes 3 area of application e g impacts of land use change 4 structure and 5 temporal and spatial resolutions although the majority of the macro scale hydrologic models have been developed with the primary objective of simulating spatial and temporal variations of hydrologic processes some possess more specific features and functions for example the water global analysis and prognosis watergap alcamo et al 2003 takes into account human interventions in forms of water abstractions and dams and the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 considers sub grid heterogeneity through statistical distributions also the model specific objectives directly affect the integrated processes and applications of the models for instance the integration of reservoir management functions in the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 enables its application to a wide range of agricultural water supply and demand problems to simulate hydrologic processes macro scale models generally incorporate two spatial discretization structures 1 grid based and 2 subbasin based each of which has unique advantages and disadvantages chu et al 2019 grid based models such as spatial processes in hydrology sphy terink et al 2015 can easily take advantage of available gridded satellite image products such as leaf area index lai on the other hand subbasin based models such as hydrological predictions for the environment hype lindström et al 2010 can incorporate station based observations e g precipitation and temperature into different subbasins the spatial resolution of different models depends on the availability of input data however there are some model specific recommendations on spatial resolution for example vic simulates land surface processes for grids larger than 1 km while watergap performs its simulations with a spatial resolution of 55 km although macro scale hydrologic models are becoming increasingly popular there are only a few macro scale models for cold climate regions such as ecological model for applied geophysics ecomag motovilov et al 1999 developed for the northern hemisphere climate processes land surface experiment nopex motovilov 2016 used ecomag to simulate snow water equivalent for the macro scale volga basin over a period from 2001 to 2011 results indicated a good agreement between the simulated and observed time series of total snow water equivalent over the basin motovilov 2016 the cold climate regions are characterized by their long and cold winters in which snow covers the land surface for several months leading to a frozen ground condition and consequently spring floods the red river of the north basin rrb is a typical example of the cold climate regions which experiences frequent spring floods as a result of its frozen ground condition early spring snowmelt as well as its unique flat topography lin et al 2015 several studies have suggested that hydrologic models that do not account for cold climate characteristics e g frozen soil and snowmelt are not able to capture the recurring spring floods in the rrb chu et al 2019 tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 in addition to the cold climate condition the filling spilling mechanism of depressions in depression dominated areas dominates the timing and magnitude of generated surface runoff depression dominated areas are typified by numerous surface depressions that collectively alter the macro scale hydrologic processes such depressions act as the gatekeepers controlled by the filling spilling process although some methods and models have been developed to identify and model the dynamics of depressions and their hierarchical relationships e g chu et al 2013 tahmasebi nasab et al 2017b the majority of these models are mainly applied to micro scale simulations tahmasebi nasab et al 2017a to point out the correlation between spatial scales and the delineated characteristics of depressions tahmasebi nasab et al 2017a performed scale analyses of 70 different digital elevation model dem resolutions ranging from 2 m to 105 m for a depression dominated site in the prairie pothole region of north dakota they identified a threshold resolution and showed that hydrologic modeling results were highly influenced by using dem resolutions coarser than the threshold resolution in this study a macro scale hydrologic processes simulator macro hypros is developed with the primary objective of modeling hydrologic processes in depression dominated cold climate regions macro hypros is a grid based hydrologic model that runs on a daily time step and incorporates a novel lego fashion layout to account for sub grid heterogeneity and land use change in addition to the novel horizontal layout the model utilizes widely available meteorological datasets delineated micro topographic features and improved methodologies to account for the influences of surface depressions and cold climate conditions on different hydrologic processes such as snowmelt surface runoff and infiltration macro hypros simulates hydrologic processes in five different bands and uses a simple flow routing procedure to estimate streamflow discharge to deal with the complexities associated with depression dominated cold climate regions macro hypros uses improved methodologies to account for depressions snow accumulation and ablation and frozen conditions the rrb known for its depression dominated topography and cold climate features is selected as a testing example to demonstrate the capabilities of the macro hypros the simulation results are presented in forms of maps and graphs highlighting the unique features of macro hypros and providing guidance for future applications of the model 2 methodology 2 1 model structure in macro hypros a surface is discretized into a user defined number of square grids and simulation is implemented in a grid based fashion fig 1 selecting a proper grid resolution is a function of available input datasets spatial scales and the incorporated methodologies chu et al 2019 oubeidillah et al 2014 however since macro hypros is a macro scale hydrologic model the spatial resolution of larger than 1 km is recommended for simulating different hydrologic processes the resolution greater than 1 km has also been suggested by other macro scale hydrologic models such as vic liang et al 1994 most macro scale hydrologic models neglect the within grid heterogeneity of coarse resolution grids and regard each grid as a homogeneous unit however within grid variations of land use and land cover can alter different hydrologic processes such as surface runoff generation macro hypros incorporates a lego fashion layout for each grid to account for within grid heterogeneity particularly a set of rgb red green and blue building blocks sit on top of a uniform lego plate representing land use variations within a grid fig 1 the red green and blue blocks denote developed vegetated and wetted areas within a plate respectively and can be defined based on the available land use maps in addition to the building blocks different bricks can be placed on top of the rgb blocks to further account for land use details fig 1 for example multiple bricks sitting on top of the green block represent different crops and vegetation types e g cereals or sugar crops macro hypros simulates 14 bricks listed in table 1 out of which eleven are on top of the green block two are on top of the blue block and one is on top of the red block the crop classification presented in table 1 is based on the food and agriculture organization fao indicative crop classification version 1 1 fao statistical development series 15 2017 although the geographic locations and orientations of different brick types are not taken into account the coverage percentage of each brick over a grid can be calculated using the zonal statistics tools in giss different parameters are then assigned to each brick and hydrologic processes are calculated for each brick separately it should be noted that depending on the specific characteristics of a study area the user can modify and change brick parameters for different regions the lego fashion layout allows the model to simulate continuous land use changes at a sub grid scale which can affect different hydrologic processes such as interception or surface runoff generation when hydrologic processes are simulated for all bricks within a grid a weighted average method is used to calculate hydrologic processes for the grid and consider the degrees of importance of bricks as an example fig 2 depicts the land use variations in 2006 and 2007 over a sample grid of 4 4 km2 in the rrb utm coordinates 5 206 174 m 737 859 m based on the cropland data layer cdl database boryan et al 2011 a visual comparison between fig 2a and b indicates that the majority of the grid is covered by oilseed crops in 2006 and cereals in 2007 although this is a subtle change for a 4 4 km2 grid the collective land use changes can impact different hydrologic processes at a macro scale which are simulated in macro hypros through the lego fashion modeling structure in addition to the lego fashion horizontal structure macro hypros accounts for five stratified vertical bands i e atmosphere vegetation snow surface and sub surface bands in the modeling fig 3 presents a simplified flow diagram of macro hypros illustrating its workflow and the order of the bands in the program the model was programmed by using the intel fortran intel 2019 and python 2 7 python 2010 since macro hypros reads inputs and prints outputs in a txt format the arcgis arcpy package environmental systems research institute 2014 was used to facilitate pre and post processing of the gis data specifically processes such as data preparation data analysis conversion and map automation for input and output files are performed using the arcpy package within python 2 7 the primary function of the pre processing programs is to prepare input data in a txt format for macro hypros fig 3 for example a pre processing program calculates the coverage percentage of different bricks on top of each grid by analyzing land use maps using a zonal histogram function the prepared input data are used by the model to simulate different hydrologic processes within three loops including the brick grid and time loops fig 3 the relationships between different bands and descriptions of different hydrologic processes simulated by the model within each band are detailed in section 2 2 eventually flow routing is implemented and a set of post processing programs are used for visualization purposes table a1 lists all variables and parameters used in this paper 2 2 macro hypros bands how are hydrologic processes simulated 2 2 1 atmosphere band three main functions of the atmosphere band in macro hypros are to 1 separate rainfall from snowfall based on the precipitation input 2 modify the average temperature for specific bricks optional and 3 estimate the daily reference evapotranspiration ret for each grid 2 2 1 1 precipitation separation the majority of macro scale hydrologic models use a single threshold temperature to distinguish rainfall from snowfall however some models provide more refinements to the single threshold temperature approach for example users have an option to input rainfall and snowfall time series in hype lindström et al 2010 in addition in hype and hbv96 lindström et al 1997 the single threshold temperature approach is replaced by a temperature interval around the threshold temperature to allow the simultaneous occurrence of rainfall and snowfall i e mixed rainfall and snowfall macro hypros employs a user defined transitional temperature range ttr to determine rainfall snowfall and mixed rainfall and snowfall fig 4 shows a simplified illustration of the separation process 1 rainfall for tave ttmax 2 snowfall for tave ttmin and 3 mixed rainfall and snowfall for ttmin tave ttmax a linear relationship is assumed for the transition of snowfall and rainfall from ttmin to ttmax 2 2 1 2 average temperature adjustment tave in macro hypros represents an average temperature over a grid however the temperature in different bricks can vary from the average grid temperature for example developed areas may create urban heat islands which lead to higher temperatures in towns cities or developed regions oke 1973 in addition to urban heat islands it has been observed that forest canopies play a moderating role in the below canopy temperature by decreasing the daily maximum temperature and increasing the daily minimum temperature von arx et al 2012 to account for the impacts of heat islands in the developed regions and temperature variations under forest canopies macro hypros provides an option to adjust tave for the developed and forest bricks based on two coefficients in the following equation 1 t ave t g k c hi t ave t g c fc t ave t g developed b r i c k forest b r i c k in which tave t g k is the average temperature for time t grid g and brick k and the two coefficients chi and cfc represent the heat island effect and the forest canopy effect respectively when chi and cfc are equal to 1 tave is not changed and when chi and cfc are less more than 1 tave is adjusted 2 2 1 3 reference evapotranspiration ret different macro scale hydrologic models tend to employ 1 the penman monteith method and its variants 2 simple temperature based methods 3 user specified time series or 4 other methods to estimate ret for example evapotranspiration in the vic model liang et al 1994 is estimated by using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 which requires the details on vapor pressure deficient radiation and many other variables another group of models do not limit users to a specific ret relationship and provide multiple options for calculating ret hype lindström et al 2010 can simulate reference evapotranspiration by using different methods with varying levels of complexities 1 modified jensen haise mcguiness oudin et al 2005 2 hargreaves and samani hargreaves and samani 1985 3 priestley and taylor s 1972 and 4 fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 in addition to allowing the users to prepare the ret time series as a model input macro hypros also offers three different ret computation options 1 a simplified form of the standard fao penman monteith method valiantzas 2013 2 a two factor model oudin et al 2005 and 3 hargreaves and samani 1985 equation these options facilitate the selection of a suitable ret scheme based on the study area characteristics and availability of input data different ret computation options have various levels of complexity and input data requirements oudin et al 2005 suggested that the models relying on solar radiation and mean daily temperature are as efficient as more sophisticated and data demanding models and can be used in hydrologic models oudin et al 2005 also suggested a simple two factor ret model which has been incorporated in macro hypros 2 ret t g k r e λ t ave t g k k 2 k 1 i f t ave k 2 0 0 if t ave k 2 0 where λ is the latent heat flux 2 45 mj m 2 day 1 re corresponds to the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 and k1 and k2 respectively are a scaling factor and a temperature threshold ranging from 90 115 and 5 6 2 2 2 vegetation band the vegetation band is responsible for computing the interception losses by plants the macro scale hydrologic models commonly employ a simple bucket approach to simulate interception losses for example sphy terink et al 2015 incorporates a time series of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in a dynamic vegetation module to provide estimates of leaf area index lai and maximum canopy storage eventually the interception is calculated as a function of the stored water on the canopy and the atmospheric evaporation demand terink et al 2015 hbv 96 incorporates a simple storage model only for forested areas lindström et al 1997 1994 in the storage model used in hbv 96 the maximum canopy storage of the forest is assumed to be constant during the year lindström et al 1994 however the majority of hydrologic models account for variable lai during the year e g sphy and vic several studies have suggested that interception losses vary depending on the types of vegetation and precipitation characteristics kozak et al 2007 maidment 1993 therefore macro hypros accounts for rainfall and snowfall interception for 1 short vegetation i e crops and residues and 2 tall vegetation i e forests it should be noted that in each grid all bricks within the green block except for the forest brick are considered as short vegetation bricks table 1 particularly rainfall interception is simulated for both short and tall vegetation bricks however snow interception is estimated only for high vegetation bricks assuming negligible snow interception by short vegetation areas 2 2 2 1 rainfall interception by short vegetation the significance of intercepted water by different crops has been highlighted in numerous studies e g baver 1939 kontorshchikov and eremina 1963 lull 1964 lull 1964 showed that the interception losses accounted for 36 16 and 15 of the total rainfall throughout the growing season for wheat corn and soybean respectively to account for the rainfall interception by short vegetation macro hypros uses a time varying lai based method to compute the rainfall interception losses by crops during the growing season in addition the rainfall interception losses by crop residues can be optionally simulated during the post harvest period the water balance equation for the short vegetation bricks can be expressed as 3 st g sv t g k s t g sv t 1 g k r a i n can t g k i n t c can t g k where stgsv is the short vegetation canopy storage mm intccan is the incremental canopy interception mm and raincan is the incremental rainfall on the canopy mm that is estimated based on the time series of fractional vegetation cover fvc 4 rai n can t g k f v c t g k r a i n t g k where rain is the total incremental rainfall mm and fvc is the ratio of the vertical projection area of vegetation leaves stems and branches on the ground to the total vegetation area and is estimated based on lai using an exponential relationship liang et al 2012 5 f v c t g k 1 e 0 5 l a i t g k in macro hypros the growing season is divided into three periods representing three different plant growth stages fig 5 the lai values obtained from the literature e g mengel et al 2001 sellers et al 1996 represent plants in their fully developed condition i e maximum lai the lai values for the two other stages are approximated based on two linear relationships fig 5 it is assumed that lai increases linearly from the beginning of the growing season until reaching a plateau maximum lai and then decreases linearly to the end of the growing season a simple storage method is used to account for the maximum canopy storage in which the dynamic maximum canopy storage is approximated based on the estimated lai time series von hoyningen huene 1981 6 mxst g can t g k 0 935 0 498 l a i 0 00575 l a i 2 where mxstgcan is the maximum canopy storage mm the amount of water beyond mxstgcan is defined as the excess storage stgex and is expressed as 7 st g ex t g k m a x 0 s t g sv m x s t g can when the excess storage is removed from stgsv intccan mm is then calculated by 8 int c can t g k m i n st g sv a t e d t g k where ated is the atmospheric demand for open water evaporation and ated 1 5ret is suggested allen et al 1998 assuming that intccan is evaporated by the end of each day in addition to the interception by the canopy different studies suggest that the rainfall interception losses by the crop residues are also a significant portion of the total rainfall e g mohamoud and ewing 1990 savabi and stott 1994 as an option a similar approach is used in macro hypros to simulate the interception by crop residues for a user defined period following the crop harvest however the maximum residue storage mxstgres is approximated as a function of the total residue mass kozak et al 2007 savabi and stott 1994 9 mxst g res t g k 346 r m t g k 10 5 r m 2 t g k 370 r m t g k 11 r m 2 t g k 627 r m t g k 37 3 r m 2 t g k if c o r n if s o y b e a n if w h e a t where rm kg ha 1 is the residue mass for corn soybean and wheat similarly a generic empirical equation is employed to estimate mxstgres for other crops kozak et al 2007 2 2 2 2 rainfall and snowfall interception by tall vegetation the modified gash model valente et al 1997 was utilized in macro hypros to estimate rainfall interception and evaporation for the forest canopy and trunks the gash model and its variants are commonly used at a daily time step assuming each day as a separate event miralles et al 2010 in other words the forest canopy is assumed to dry up completely between events carlyle moses and gash 2011 miralles et al 2010 valente et al 1997 the rainfall interception losses from the forest canopy and tree trunks for each time step are estimated based on two critical rainfall values the amount of rainfall to saturate the 1 forest canopy crc and 2 trunks crt valente et al 1997 10 int c frc t g k fvc r a i n t g k rain t g k c r c fvc c r c ρ 1 ε rain t g k c r c rain t g k c r c where intcfrc is the amount of rainfall interception by the forest canopy mm ρ is a ratio of the mean evaporation rate to the mean rainfall rate for the saturated canopy condition and ε is the fraction of trunk evaporation 0 02 miralles et al 2010 valente et al 1997 in addition to the rainfall interception by the forest canopy a similar equation by valente et al 1997 is used to estimate the amount of rainfall interception by tree trunks moreover macro hypros uses a simple bucket approach to estimate snow interception and storage in forest canopies snow interception by tall vegetation is estimated by hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 pomeroy et al 1998 11 int c sno t g k c cu fc s mx s w e f t 1 g k 1 e fvc s n o w t g k fc s mx where intcsno is the amount of snow interception mm snow is the snowfall mm of water equivalent ccu is a canopy unloading coefficient 0 7 swef is the snow storage water equivalent of the forest canopy mm and fcsmx is the maximum forest canopy snow storage mm fcsmx is usually estimated by using lai and snow density pomeroy et al 1998 schmidt and gluns 1991 snowmelt from the forest canopy storage mf is then simulated by using a standard temperature index method liston et al 2006 based on daily average temperature and a constant melting factor 2 2 3 snow band snowmelt is one of the significant elements of the annual streamflow in many cold climate regions around the world in the western united states and canada for example 50 80 of the total streamflow is fed by the snowmelt contributions stewart et al 2004 traditionally the majority of the available hydrologic models take advantage of either 1 energy balance methods ebms or 2 temperature index methods tims leavesley 1989 ebms require a wide variety of either simulated or observed meteorological datasets such as solar radiation temperature and wind speed while tims simulate snowmelt using a single average temperature the simplicity of tims has led to their popularity in macro scale hydrologic models watergap hbv swat and sphy are among macro scale hydrologic models using tims in different forms alcamo et al 2003 arnold et al 1998 bergström 1992 terink et al 2015 the snow band in macro hypros simulates 1 snowpack water equivalent storage 2 snowmelt 3 rain on snow melt and 4 refrozen meltwater the simulated processes in the snow band are summarized here the snow band water balance equation can be expressed as 12 st g sn t g k s t g sn t 1 g k c sn s n o w s t g k m a t g k where stgsn mm is the snowpack water equivalent storage snows is the snowfall mm after interception ma is the actual snowmelt mm and csn is a snowfall correction factor that varies within a range of 0 7 1 6 anderson 2002 and accounts for the losses from sublimation and redistribution anderson 2006 macro hypros incorporates a hybrid tim htim to simulate daily snowmelt and refreezing different studies have indicated that when sub daily temperatures fluctuate above or below the freezing temperature the single temperature tim may fail to provide realistic snowmelt simulations žaknić ćatović et al 2018 therefore a modified macro scale htim is proposed to account for the effect of sub daily temperature fluctuation around the freezing temperature the proposed methodology employs daily maximum and minimum temperatures tmax and tmin and their occurrence timing to complement the original tim which is solely based on tave the daily snowmelt and refreezing can be respectively expressed as 13 m t g k c m t ave t g k δ t t min 0 t max 0 c m t max t g k 2 δ t mlt t min 0 t max 0 14 r t g k c f t ave t g k δ t t min 0 t max 0 c f t min t g k 2 δ t rfr t min 0 t max 0 where m and r are the snowmelt mm and refreezing mm respectively cm and cf are the melting and freezing factors mm c 1 day 1 tave is the daily average temperature c over time step δt day tmax and tmin are the daily maximum and minimum temperatures c and δtmlt and δtfrz are the effective melt and refreezing times and represent the fraction of the day in which the temperature is higher or lower than zero respectively the seasonal variations of cm are also modeled by using a sinusoidal function fontaine et al 2002 neitsch et al 2011 that considers the maximum and minimum melting factors cmx and cmn for different bricks specific values for bricks can be obtained from the existing literature anderson 2006 neitsch et al 2011 the meltwater resulting from a rain on snow event mr mm is calculated only when there is a snowpack on the ground and precipitation is in the form of rainfall or mixed rainfall and snowfall when precipitation occurs in the form of mixed rainfall and snowfall the snowpack is first updated followed by mr calculations assuming that the snowpack surface temperature is 0 c and the rainfall temperature is equal to tave qi et al 2017 mr can be estimated by 15 m r t g k 0 0126 t ave t g k r o s t g k in which ros is the amount of rainfall on snowpack mm the amount of actual snowmelt ma is estimated based on the total available water for melt awm mm and the maximum snowpack water retention storage mxspr mm as follows 16 m a t g k m a x 0 awm t g k m x s p r t g k in which awm is the summation of meltwater from different sources mf mr and m minus the refrozen meltwater r mxspr is a threshold for snowmelt generation the snowpack water retention storage spr retains meltwater until reaching mxspr in other words mxspr is a threshold to delay the generation of snowmelt the water stored in spr can refreeze when the temperature is below 0 c and mxspr is computed as a fraction of snowpack water equivalent storage stgsn mm 17 m x s p r t g k c wr s t g sn where cwr is the coefficient of water retention storage having a suggested value of 0 1 bergström 1992 2 2 4 surface band macro scale hydrologic models use different methodologies with varying levels of complexity to simulate surface runoff and infiltration for example sphy uses a simple saturation excess surface runoff generation method in which surface runoff is a function of the water content and the saturated water content of the first layer of the soil terink et al 2015 the vic model employs the variable infiltration curve vic scheme from the xinanjiang model zhao et al 1980 to simulate the generation of surface runoff although surface runoff is generated from the topmost soil layer in the xinanjiang model the vic model assumes that surface runoff can be generated from the two upper soil layers when the soil storage exceeds the soil storage capacity liang et al 1994 the surface band water balance equation in macro hypros can be expressed as 18 st g dp t g k s t g dp t 1 g k r a i n s t g k m a t g k r u n f t g k i n f l t g k e t g k where stgdp mm is the depression storage rains is the rainfall mm after interception ma is the actual melt mm runf is the generated surface runoff mm infl is the infiltration mm and e is the evaporation mm macro hypros uses the scs cn method usda 1986 to simulate surface runoff and infiltration the simplicity of the cn method makes it popular verma et al 2017 however the original cn method has some limitations for example it is only suitable for event based hydrologic modeling therefore over the course of the last four decades a wide variety of enhancements have been proposed to improve its applicability e g ajmal et al 2015 michel et al 2005 neitsch et al 2011 it has been shown that different factors are responsible for the cn variations among which the antecedent moisture condition amc soil type land use and slope are more pronounced verma et al 2017 the original cn values for each brick are determined based on the soil type and land use fig 6 shows a simplified flow diagram of the surface band s workflow before using the cn method for surface runoff simulation the original cn values for different bricks are modified based on amc slope and frozen ground condition fig 6 macro hypros employs the modification procedure by neitsch et al 2011 to adjust the cn values based on soil water content to account for the grid to grid slope variations macro hypros offers three different cn adjustment options ajmal et al 2016 huang et al 2006 sharpley and williams 1990 listed in table 2 these three different equations provide the option of adjusting cn based on specific topographic features in this study the equation by sharpley and williams 1990 was used to adjust cn values the frozen ground condition is a common phenomenon in cold climate regions which leads to the formation of the relatively impermeable soil surface and affects the generation of surface runoff this condition is associated with the consecutive freezing temperature periods and high antecedent moisture condition chu et al 2019 macro hypros uses the continuous frozen ground index cfgi molnau and bissell 1983 to calculate and locate the frozen ground condition cfgi has a positive value and as it increases the likelihood of the frozen ground increases too cfgi in macro hypros is expressed as 19 c f g i t g k c dc c f g i t 1 g k t ave t g k e 0 4 c sr s n o d t g k where cdc is a daily decay coefficient that controls the degradation of cfgi over time and takes the value of 0 97 molnau and bissell 1983 and csr is a snow reduction coefficient cm 1 to account for the insulation effects of the snowpack cdc and csr are calibrated parameters and their ranges are suggested by molnau and bissell 1983 snod is the depth of snow on the ground cm and is given by 20 s n o d t g k 0 1 s t g sn t g k ρ s in which stgsn mm is the snow water equivalent and ρs g cm 3 is the snow density it is assumed that the impacts of snow compaction and destructive morphinism are negligible and ρs can be calculated solely by a function of average daily temperature anderson 2006 a user defined cfgi transitional range determines the impacts of frozen ground on the generation of surface runoff fig 7 for example molnau and bissell 1983 suggested that the cfgi transitional range varies from 56 to 83 if cfgi is smaller than the lower cfgi threshold cfgilt the ground is not frozen fig 7 and the amount of surface runoff simulated by the modified cn model does not change in contrast if cfgi is greater than the upper cfgi threshold cfgiut the ground is completely frozen fig 7 and it is assumed that infiltration is minimal and cn is set to cnfrozen finally if cfgi is within the transitional range the ground is partially frozen and a linear relationship is established between cfgi and cn in which the cn for cfgiut is 98 when surface runoff is calculated for each brick in a grid an area weighted approach is used to determine the surface runoff over the grid this approach is superior to the traditional composite cn approach for estimating surface runoff mishra and singh 2003 eventually infiltration into the sub surface band is calculated by subtracting the generated surface runoff from the total input water to the surface band i e ground rainfall actual snowmelt 2 2 4 1 blue block depressions and lakes depression dominated areas have a unique undulating topography giving rise to many surface depressions that are periodically ponded and possess various functions such as flood mitigation sediment retention and habitat provision tahmasebi nasab and chu 2018 macro hypros uses the depression dominated delineation d cubed method tahmasebi nasab et al 2017c as a pre processing tool to identify depressions and quantify their impacts the d cubed method provides a variety of features related to surface depressions such as depression storages puddle levels ponding areas and contributing areas these detailed features can potentially alter micro scale hydrologic processes tahmasebi nasab et al 2016 in order to simulate depression influenced hydrologic processes at a macro scale macro hypros incorporates the lumped contributing area to depressions and maximum depression storage for each grid fig 8 depicts a schematic representation of how the d cubed results are incorporated into each grid as the depressions brick as an example fig 8a shows the satellite image of a sample grid of 4 4 km2 within the rrb utm coordinates of the grid center 5 310 355 m 501 855 m in which depressions are mostly concentrated in the southeastern corner of the sample grid fig 8b indicates the spatial distribution of the contributing area to depressions resulted from the d cubed method in other words 100 of the generated surface runoff within the delineated contributing area contributes to the depressions eventually the lumped contributing area of the depressions is incorporated into each grid as the depressions brick fig 8c the depression storage is updated based on the generated surface runoff at every time step the amount of water that spills out of depressions is estimated based on two threshold storages 1 the maximum depression storage mxstgdp and 2 the minimum spill threshold storage mnstgdp 21 s p i l t g k st g dp m x s t g dp c dp s t g dp m n s t g dp 0 st g dp m x s t g dp mnst g dp s t g dp m x s t g dp st g dp m n s t g dp where spil represents the water that spills out of depressions mm and contributes to the generated surface runoff and cdp is a decay factor 0 1 that controls the flow of water out of depressions when they are partially filled it should be noted that mxstgdp values of the grids are obtained from the d cubed surface delineation and mnstgdp values are defined as a fraction of mxstgdp based on the study area the evaporation from the depression storage is estimated based on ret and is expressed as 22 e t g k k w r e t t g k in which kw is the open water evaporation coefficient allen et al 1998 in addition the amount of water that moves from the depression storage to the sub surface band seep mm is estimated according to the fraction full of the depression storage and the fraction empty of the sub surface layer 23 s e e p t g k k s 1 st g dp t g k mxst g dp 1 θ s 1 t 1 g k sa t s 1 where ks1 is the hydraulic conductivity of the sub surface layer 1 mm day θs1 is the soil water content m3 m3 of sub surface layer 1 and sats1 is the soil saturated water content m3 m3 of sub surface layer 1 it should be noted that the current version of macro hypros does not account for lakes and their impacts on hydrologic processes therefore the lake areas within each grid are obtained from different datasets e g national wetlands inventory for the united states lakes and are removed from the grid area 2 2 5 sub surface band macro scale hydrologic models consider one or more layers to simulate different sub surface processes for example the soil profile is represented by only one layer in watergap3 and hbv whereas vic hype and ecomag account for three layers of soil krysanova and hattermann 2017 depending on their physical representation of the soil layers different models require the use of a varying number of soil parameters and characteristics while some models require only a few soil parameters e g five parameters in ecomag others may demand more details e g 19 parameters in vic sub surface processes in macro hypros are simulated in three sub surface layers specifically they schematically embody the sub surface profile in which an upper soil layer s1 is responsible for surface subsurface interactions and crop specifications a lower soil layer s2 represents deep vadose zone and an aquifer layer s3 controls the generated baseflow fig 9 illustrates a simplified workflow representation of the sub surface band its three layers and the simulated processes the water balance for layer s1 can be expressed as 24 st g s 1 t g s t g s 1 t 1 g i n f l t g e t s 1 t g p e r c s 1 t g where stgs1 is the storage of s1 mm ets1 is the evapotranspiration mm from s1 and percs1 is the percolation from s1 to s2 mm in order to compute the percolation from s1 to s2 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity ks1 is adjusted based on the frozen soil condition of a user defined portion of layer s1 frd which represents the topsoil similar to what was described for the determination of the frozen ground in surface band fig 7 a continuous frozen soil index cfsi is used to determine the frozen soil condition particularly two cfsi thresholds regulate the topsoil freezing condition the upper threshold cfsiut beyond which the topsoil is considered to be fully frozen and the lower threshold cfsilt below which the topsoil is in a non frozen condition also the cfsi values between cfsilt and cfsiut are considered to be partially frozen the adjusted ks1 for the frozen soil condition is then estimated by 25 k s 1 t g 0 cfsi c f s i up 10 c i θ fr k s a t 1 t g θ nfr sa t s 1 t g 3 2 b cfs i lt c f s i c f s i up k s 1 cfsi c f s i lt in which k s1 is the adjusted

content θfr and θnfr are the soil frozen and non frozen water contents ci is an empirical factor that accounts for the impedance of ice shoop and bigl 1997 and b is the clapp hornberger constant jame and norum 1980 the frozen water content for partially frozen soils i e θfr is estimated by using a linear relationship that uses cfsilt and cfsiut to determine the frozen fraction the evapotranspiration is calculated based on the specific crop coefficients kc for different plants during their growth stages allen et al 1998 26 e t s 1 t g k k c t g k r e t t g k where ets1 is the evapotranspiration mm ets1 is first removed from a user defined effective evapotranspiration depth etd defined as a fraction of the upper soil layer s thickness if ets1 is greater than the available water in etd ets1 is then removed from the rest of layer s1 the potential amount of percolation from s1 to s2 is estimated by using a function of the soil hydraulic conductivity the fraction full of layer s1 and fraction empty of layer s2 bennett 1998 27 mxper c s 1 t g k s 1 θ s 1 t g sa t s 1 1 θ s 2 t 1 g sa t s 2 where mxpercs1 is the potential percolation mm from s1 to s2 ks1 is the hydraulic conductivity mm day of s1 θs1 and θs2 are water contents of s1 and s2 and sats1 and sats2 are the saturated water contents of s1 and s2 the actual percolation from s1 to s2 is then estimated based on the amount of available water for percolation and mxpercs1 28 per c s 1 t g m i n mxper c s 1 t g a w p s 1 t g where awps1 is the available water for percolation mm which is calculated by the field capacity of s1 fcs1 29 aw p s 1 t g θ s 1 t g f c s 1 t g θ s 1 f c s 1 0 θ s 1 f c s 1 the water balance equation used for layer s2 is similar to the one for layer s1 however evapotranspiration from layer s2 is assumed negligible in addition the percolation from s2 to s3 is estimated by using a similar set of equations used for determining the percolation from s1 to s2 eqs 27 29 when the percolation from s2 to s3 i e percs2 is computed the groundwater recharge is estimated by using an exponential relationship developed by venetis 1969 this simple relationship has also been successfully used in different models such as swat and sphy 30 gw r s 3 t g 1 e 1 c gw p e r c s 2 t g e 1 c gw g w r s 3 t 1 g where gwrs3 is the groundwater recharge mm and cgw is the delay

1 e c rc st g s 3 b f th 2 2 6 flow routing flow routing involves simulating water movement through the entire drainage network to the outlet of a watershed the st venant equations offer a theoretical basis for flow routing however they require a variety of input data that are not usually available especially for macro scale modeling therefore macro scale hydrologic models typically employ simple routing methods that only account for flood wave delay and attenuation paiva et al 2011 similar to other macro scale hydrologic models e g vic macro hypros performs a streamflow routing procedure after hydrologic processes are simulated for the entire simulation period in other words streamflow routing is performed separately from the simulation of hydrologic processes when different processes are simulated the contributing components to streamflow i e surface runoff and baseflow are summed up for each time step this step generates a time series of matrices that account for the total contributing water from each grid 33 q c t g 0 001 r u n f t g b f s 3 t g a where qc is the grid specific contributing flow m3 and a is the grid area after removing the lakes macro hypros uses a simple routing method to route the grid specific contributing flow to a user defined outlet the user defined outlet is employed to determine the boundaries of the basin based on the input dem specifically a flow direction matrix of the study area is first computed to determine the direction of flow in a given grid then the flow accumulation matrix of the study area is calculated which is a cumulative count of the number of grids draining into the downstream grid the drainage network and the basin boundaries are eventually determined by employing the computed flow direction and flow accumulation matrices in macro hypros a set of post processing programs and the arcpy package are used to route qc employing flow direction and flow accumulation matrixes of the surface eventually a linear reservoir routing method is used to account for the delay of flow from different grids to the outlet this method has been incorporated and tested in sphy and is expressed as terink et al 2015 34 q t 1 c fr q t c fr q t 1 where q is the discharge m3 s at the outlet and cfr is a flow recession coefficient 0 1 it has been suggested that smaller cfr values correspond to the faster basin response whereas larger values represent the slower basin response terink et al 2015 2 3 testing of macro hypros in the rrb the red river of the north drains parts of minnesota and dakotas in the united states and flows into lake winnipeg in canada the rrb covers an area of 116 500 km2 out of which 103 600 km2 is within the united states fig 10 a red river basin board 2000 the annual average precipitation and temperature of the rrb are 500 mm and 4 3 c respectively jin et al 2008 and the basin slope varies from 0 04 to 0 25 m km the majority of the rrb is within the prairie pothole region that is featured with many depression dominated areas and flat topography the basin s topography can be divided into three elevation classes 1 low 2 moderate and 3 high fig 10b where the low elevation class 1 corresponds to the red river valley a prolific agricultural region in the northern united states the agricultural areas dominate the rrb specifically nearly 60 of the basin is covered by cultivated croplands whereas only 4 5 of the basin is covered by developed areas fig 10c tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 the rrb possesses unique hydro topographical features which make it prone to the occurrence of frequent spring floods in addition to its flat topography in the red river valley rrb is categorized as a cold climate region having lingering cold winters a combination of freezing temperatures and thick snowpack give rise to the frozen ground condition that lasts up to the spring when snow begins to melt the concurring snowmelt and early spring rainfalls lead to frequent floods in the rrb fig 10d highlights some of the record breaking floods in the rrb at the united states geological survey usgs grand forks station station id 05082500 including the recent 2019 flood the high snowfall during the winter of 1996 97 96 in of snow were recorded in grand forks as well as the occurrence of a blizzard on april 5 6 1997 led to the worst flooding in the rrb in more than 100 years usgs 2019a this trend has been repeating for many years in which the months of march and april play a significant role in the spring flooding condition fig 10d the reoccurrence of the spring floods pinpoints the significance of the cold climate processes in the basin therefore the rrb was selected for this study to highlight the capabilities of macro hypros for depression dominated cold climate regions 2 4 model setup and input data the rrb the u s portion as shown in fig 10a was discretized into 6351 grids of 4 4 km2 and different hydrologic processes were simulated for each grid table 3 lists the major input data obtained from different sources a 30 m digital elevation model dem was obtained from the national elevation dataset usgs 2019b and was used for the d cubed surface delineation tahmasebi nasab et al 2017c the daily streamflow dataset at the grand forks station was also obtained from the usgs 2019c for a selected 5 year period the cropland data layer cdl database boryan et al 2011 30 m resolution was used for the land use distribution and brick specification within each grid different meteorological data such as daily precipitation and daily temperature were obtained from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 and the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr fuka et al 2012 the soil type data were extracted from the united states department of agriculture statsgo2 database nrcs 2018 using soil data viewer 6 2 natural resources conservation service 2015 which is a gis extension to extract sub surface information from statsgo2 database also different soil hydraulic parameters were obtained from the existing literature particularly chu et al 2019 compiled different soil parameters for use in a hydrologic model from different sources e g carsel et al 1998 maidment 1993 rawls et al 1982 rawls and brakensiek 1983 other input data such as lai and crop specific information were also obtained from the existing literature as shown in table 3 a 5 year simulation period from 2003 to 2007 1826 days was selected out of which 2003 was used as a warm up period 2004 and 2005 were used for model calibration and 2006 and 2007 were utilized for model validation since the main objective of this study is to present the structure methodology and development of macro hypros the model parameters are manually calibrated and automated optimization schemes are not employed the methods for simulating hydrologic processes in each band were meticulously selected to ensure the existence of adequate guidelines for initializing the model parameters in different regions the parameters employed in macro hypros and their acceptable variations were explained in section 2 2 based on the existing literature table 4 lists the macro hypros parameters for different bands including their descriptions spatial scales and the calibration values ranges the project for intercomparison of land surface parameterization schemes pilps suggested that the calibration of macro scale models against observed discharges improved the performance of the models wood et al 1998 hence the macro hypros results were compared against the observed discharges at the grand forks station fig 10a in addition to the graphical comparisons the model performance was evaluated by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and following the recommended criterion for satisfactory performance for daily time steps nse 0 5 moriasi et al 2015 2007 in addition to nse the model performance was evaluated by using the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which has been widely used to evaluate the performance of macro scale hydrologic models e g beck et al 2016 and facilitate the assessment of different components of the performance of hydrologic models such as timing magnitude and variability gupta et al 2009 35 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed values α is a ratio between the standard deviation of the simulated and observed data to measure the relative variability of simulations and β is a ratio between the mean simulated and observed values to represent the bias in simulations gupta et al 2009 kge ranges from to 1 in which kge 1 0 represents the perfect match following rogelis et al 2016 the model performance can be classified into poor kge 0 intermediate 0 5 kge 0 75 and good kge 0 75 3 results and discussion fig 11 depicts the daily monthly and yearly graphical comparisons between the simulated and observed discharges m3 s at the grand forks gauging station a visual assessment for the daily discharges fig 11a indicates that macro hypros provided a comparable estimation of the streamflow variations in both cold and warm months the nse coefficients for the calibration and validation periods were 0 56 and 0 72 respectively indicating satisfactory model performance moriasi et al 2007 2015 in addition to nse kge values for the calibration and validation periods were 0 59 and 0 57 respectively falling into the intermediate model performance group further statistical analysis of the entire simulation period indicated that the model was able to estimate 65 of the variability of streamflow discharge α as well as a linear correlation coefficient r of 0 75 suggesting a positive strong linear relationship between the simulated and observed discharge values although the model was able to successfully simulate the variations in the discharge patterns during low and high flow periods it underestimated the peak discharge values this can be attributed to the hydroclimatic nuances between different years throughout the simulation period and their impacts on the calibration process for example 50 of the average precipitation over the basin in march 2006 occurred in the last five days of march and led to the highest observed peak discharge which was nearly two times higher than the peak discharge values in 2004 and 2005 since the model was calibrated for 2004 and 2005 it might not capture the peak discharge in 2006 in addition to the daily discharge fig 11b illustrates a graphical comparison between the monthly simulated and observed discharges indicating that the model provided satisfactory monthly results r2 0 81 however it slightly underestimated low discharges and overestimated high discharges for the annual average discharges the average error percentage between the observed and simulated values is less than 15 fig 11c 3 1 how does the cold climate condition alter hydrologic processes fig 12 a demonstrates the impacts of frozen ground on the generation of surface runoff in the rrb throughout the simulation period the results from the cfgi method in macro hypros can be used to determine the frozen ground condition i e frozen partially frozen and non frozen and its spatial distribution the results indicated that 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively experienced 65 43 0 and 82 days in which the entire basin s ground 6351 grids was frozen in addition to the 100 frozen ground condition the rrb experienced partially frozen grounds in 105 89 135 and 63 days in 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively the presence of the frozen and partially frozen ground conditions in the basin played a significant role in the early spring surface runoff generation fig 12a indicates that the ending period of the frozen ground condition in each year coincided with the occurrence of a significant amount of surface runoff in the basin further analysis revealed that the period from the end of march to early april was crucial for the frozen ground induced snowmelt runoff in the rrb which also coincided with the early spring rainfalls the red box in fig 12a pinpoints a critical four month period in 2006 i e january to may 2006 in which the frozen ground condition led to the generation of high surface runoff on january 1st 2006 77 1 of the basin was covered by the frozen and partially frozen ground however this number began to decline right after its peak in january indicated by the red box in fig 12a as a consequence of the decline 26 5 and 14 35 of the basin experienced fully and partially frozen ground respectively on march 31st 2006 on the same day the rrb received a significant amount of rainfall fig 12b mostly concentrated on the central and eastern parts of the basin having an average of 15 97 mm the combination of the frozen ground condition and heavy rainfall together with the average snowmelt of 4 51 mm on march 31st 2006 led to the generation of 11 1 mm of surface runoff over the basin fig 12c the aforementioned process for 2006 is a typical example of early springs in the rrb which leads to frequent spring floods with varying levels of severity fig 12a c highlight the capability of macro hypros in simulating the spatially distributed cold climate hydrologic processes that facilitate a better understanding of the basin s dynamics in early springs in addition the spatial distribution of the surface runoff on march 31st 2006 highlights the high amount of surface runoff generated in the red river valley indicated by the dashed red box in fig 12c this pattern is in accordance with the soil type distribution of rrb in which the central region i e red river valley is dominated by finer soil types causing higher surface runoff and lower infiltration chu et al 2019 in addition to early spring rainfall snowmelt played a critical role in the generation of surface runoff in the rrb to highlight the significance of snowmelt fig 13 depicts the simulated frozen ground condition snowmelt surface runoff and infiltration on a sample day i e march 13th 2007 in which the average temperature across the basin was 3 1 c with a standard deviation of 1 5 c although the average basin temperature was above the freezing temperature i e 0 c the results indicated that 98 4 of the basin i e 6248 grids out of 6351 grids experienced either frozen ground or partially frozen ground conditions fig 13a the widespread extent of the frozen ground condition on march 13th 2007 gave rise to susceptible circumstances for the generation of higher surface runoff the frozen ground condition also coincided with an average snowmelt of 6 04 mm over the basin fig 13b leading to higher surface runoff and lower infiltration fig 13c and d it was noticeable that due to the frozen ground condition over the basin more than 60 of the generated snowmelt contributed to surface runoff whereas infiltration had a smaller portion of the generated snowmelt the average surface runoff and infiltration simulated for march 13th 2007 were 3 68 mm and 2 19 mm respectively highlighting the importance of snowmelt in the rrb the pattern of frozen ground induced surface runoff depicted in fig 13 is also typical for the rrb especially on the days when the average temperature is above the freezing temperature but the frozen ground condition persists 3 2 impacts of snow accumulation and ablation processes on red river flow the distribution and magnitude of the snowmelt generated in the rrb have a direct relationship with the available snowpack the snow accumulation process in the rrb generally begins around late november and early december the gradual snow accumulation continues until late march and early april when higher than freezing temperatures initiate the snowmelt process throughout the basin the simulation results showed that the model was able to capture the snow accumulation and ablation processes in different years fig 14 a compares the magnitudes of the simulated snowpack water equivalent hereafter called snowpack and snowmelt in the rrb fig 14a suggests that the peak snowmelt values typically occurred right after the peak snowpack values although different years shared a similar snow accumulation and ablation trend the magnitude of the simulated snowmelt varied from year to year particularly in late march these variations can be attributed to the hydroclimatic variations in different years for example 2006 accounted for the most amount of snowpack throughout the simulation period having a maximum of 41 21 mm on march 6th 2006 when 95 9 of the basin was covered by snow fig 14b highlights the snowpack snowmelt dynamics for a 4 month period in 2006 i e january to may 2006 in which the snowpack decreased with the occurrence of snowmelt events the average temperature in the last five days of march 2006 was 3 c leading to the highest snowmelt peak specifically the average snowmelt across the basin in a 12 day period from 3 25 2006 to 4 5 2006 was 32 26 mm fig 14b the sudden ablation of snowpack and the resulting snowmelt as well as the frozen ground condition at the end of march led to the highest peak discharge 2033 14 m3 s in the red river at the grand forks station on 4 5 2006 moreover the spatially distributed snowpack results confirmed the roles of snow accumulation and ablation processes in the peak discharges in late march and early april fig 15 shows the comparison of the average simulated snowpack and snowmelt in march when the average temperature was 2 86 c 4 27 c 3 55 c and 2 11 c in 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively a visual comparison of the distributions of snowpack in march for different years reveals that the northern parts of the rrb experienced more snow than the southern parts fig 15a d in addition fig 15c clearly shows that 2006 had a higher snowpack in march than other years this is partly attributed to the variations in snowfall in different years for instance 2006 received 7 5 more snowfall than 2007 which resulted in a discrepancy of 2 1 mm between the average simulated snowpack values over the basin in the two years the average snowpack simulated for the rrb in march 2006 was 32 79 mm corresponding to 3 331 mm3 of water which is 2 1 3 5 and 1 9 times greater than those in 2004 2005 and 2007 respectively fig 15a d reasonably higher snowpack in 2006 affected other hydrologic processes such as snowmelt surface runoff and infiltration throughout the simulation period march had the highest snowmelt for all years fig 15e h depict the impacts of snowpack in march on the simulated snowmelt for different years as expected march 2006 experienced more snowmelt than other years high snowmelt values in 2004 2006 and 2007 were most noticeable in the northern and northwestern sides of the basin fig 15e f and h whereas the eastern side of the basin was mainly responsible for the high snowmelt in 2006 the average snowmelt over the basin in march 2006 was 1 3 mm which is 22 94 and 3 17 higher than the snowmelt in march 2004 2005 and 2007 3 3 how do depressions alter hydrologic processes studies have suggested that the abundance of surface depressions in the rrb altered the generation of surface runoff tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 the simulation results from macro hypros highlighted the critical role of depressions as regulators specifically in the early spring period fig 16 a depicts the relationship between the temporal distribution of the depression storage and the generated surface runoff it can be observed that the highest depression storage in different years occurred in late march and early april particularly the amount of depression storage in the basin peaked on march 28th 2004 march 25th 2005 march 31th 2006 and april 1st 2007 when the basin experienced partially frozen ground increased snowmelt and early spring rainfall as shown in fig 12 fig 16a also indicates the connection between depression storage and evaporation from the stored water as expected the highest evaporation usually occurred in the period from june to august the magnitude of the simulated evaporation showed a direct relationship to the depression storage for example since more water was stored in depressions in 2007 the total simulated evaporation from the ponded water in 2007 was 1 7 times higher than that in 2006 fig 16b highlights the variations of depression storage over a 5 month period in 2006 i e march august for the sample grid in the rrb shown in fig 8 as aforementioned the majority of depressions in the sample grid are concentrated in the southeastern corner of the grid fig 8b surface delineation results indicated that the maximum depression storage of the grid was 8 7 mm3 corresponding to 5 4 cm of water over the grid and 24 of the grid area contributed runoff to the depressions since nearly one fourth of the basin contributed to depressions even small rainfall or snowmelt events led to noticeable variations in the depression storage of the grid fig 16b the depression storage had an increasing trend up to the end of march when its peak coincided with the peak runoff on 3 31 2006 afterward the depression storage followed a declining trend with intermittent fluctuations due to small rainfall events and completely dried up on 5 19 2006 from this point forward depressions were only periodically ponded and dried up depending on the rainfall events fig 16b in addition to the temporal distribution of the depression storage in the rrb marco hypros also provided spatial variations of the depression storage fig 17 shows the variations of depression storage in march 2006 and 2007 which had the highest depression storage among other months in these two years fig 17a and b indicate that the basin had higher depression storage values in the eastern and western parts in comparison to the central part this pattern is in accordance with other studies in the rrb for example tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 divided the rrb into 146 subbasins and performed surface delineation to determine the maximum depression storage of the basin it was observed that the central part of the basin generally accounted for lower depression storage and depression storage increased from the central part to the eastern and western sides of the basin tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 fig 17c shows a focused area of the basin that accounted for higher depression storage in both 2006 and 2007 the satellite image presented in fig 17c confirms the abundance of surface depressions over this focused area the average depression storage values in the rrb in march 2006 and 2007 were 0 92 mm and 1 84 mm respectively the higher depression storage in march 2007 can be directly attributed to 4 89 mm more precipitation than that in march 2006 3 4 macro hypros in perspective contributions limitations and potentials hydrologic modeling at macro scale basins around the world is becoming increasingly popular to quantify the critical impacts of climate driven changes on ecological agricultural and human behavioral aspects of water resources byun et al 2019 flexibility to grid structure is one of the important elements of macro scale hydrologic models kauffeldt et al 2016 enabling the models to take advantage of widely available grid based reanalysis and earth observation datasets rodríguez et al 2019 in addition to incorporating a grid based structure macro hypros uses a novel lego fashion horizontal layout to account for sub grid heterogeneity based on the land use and land cover maps the response of macro scale cold climate basins to the projected warming climate trends are poorly known musselman et al 2017 to provide a holistic understanding of cold climate conditions through hydrologic simulations macro hypros incorporates a set of methodologies to simulate frozen ground and snow accumulation and ablation processes moreover it has been shown that the collective effects of surface depressions can manipulate the response of macro scale basins tahmasebi nasab et al 2017b 2018 therefore macro hypros utilizes a topography based approach to account for the influences of surface depressions on macro scale hydrologic processes such as surface runoff the consideration of complexities associated with depression dominated areas and cold climate regions makes the model a proper choice for applications in regions with similar hydro topographical characteristics although the current version of macro hypros presents a novel structure and improved methodologies to simulate hydrologic processes for depression dominated and cold climate regions improvements are foreseen in processes representation and calibration and evaluation processes particularly the current version of macro hypros incorporates a simple leaky bucket approach to simulate sub surface processes the merit of this simple approach is the low input data requirements which makes it suitable for macro scale models however since more spatially distributed datasets are becoming available improvements in the macro hypros sub surface band can enhance its capabilities to simulate sub surface processes since the major objective of this study was to present the theoretical foundation of the macro hypros a mechanistic approach was employed to provide a holistic understanding of the model s structure and methodology however future long term applications of macro hypros will center on calibration and evaluation of the model using not only streamflow discharge but also other hydrologic processes such as snowmelt this multi process calibration evaluation will result in a better indication of the model s behavior within different bands 4 summary and conclusions this study presented the theoretical foundation of the macro scale hydrologic processes simulator with the primary objective of simulating hydrologic processes in cold climate regions and depression dominated terrains macro hypros is a grid based daily hydrologic model that takes advantage of a unique lego fashion horizontal layout to account for the within grid variabilities of land use and land cover each grid in the model is conceptualized as a lego plate on top of which three blocks red green and blue rgb are placed representing the developed vegetated and wetted areas macro hypros incorporates five vertical bands atmosphere vegetation snow surface and sub surface bands each of which simulates different hydrologic processes to accommodate the complexities associated with the depression dominated terrains and cold climate regions the model uses improved methodologies that are developed for macro scale modeling of hydrologic processes eventually a simple routing method is used to compute the outlet discharge the model was applied to the red river of the north basin which is characterized by its cold climate and depression dominated topography for a 4 year period 1461 daily time steps from january 1st 2004 to december 31st 2007 the simulated hydrograph was compared against the observed one and the model performance was evaluated moreover the capabilities of the model in simulating the spatiotemporal variations and trends of different hydrologic processes were showcased in forms of temporally and spatially distributed results the simulated discharges were in good agreement with the observed data having the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 56 and 0 72 for the calibration and validation periods respectively the modeling results indicated that the rrb experienced frozen or partially frozen ground conditions on an average of 145 days per year i e 40 of the year the frozen ground condition often coincided with the early spring rainfall and snowmelt events and altered the magnitude and distribution of the generated surface runoff and infiltration it was demonstrated that the period between late march and early april was a critical one for the frozen ground induced spring floods across the simulation period also the results indicated that the snow accumulation and ablation synchronized with the frozen or partially frozen ground condition produced peak discharge in the red river the snowmelt analysis suggested that up to 60 of the generated snowmelt contributed to surface runoff due to the widespread frozen ground condition macro hypros employed macro scale methodologies to account for the lumped impacts of depressions and their contributing areas within each grid the results revealed that the depression dominated areas within the rrb acted as surface runoff regulators specifically in the periods when a high amount of surface runoff was generated i e late march and early april the modeling results from macro hypros accentuated the significance of considering the unique cold climate processes and the dominated role of surface depressions in hydrologic modeling by using the improved methodologies and a unique lego fashion layout macro hypros provides a better understanding and representation of macro scale hydrologic processes although the current version of macro hypros resulted in satisfactory simulations in the rrb further model applications in other macro scale basins are necessary to test different features of the model also long term model evaluation and sensitivity analysis of the model parameters

5995,this study introduces a new macro scale hydrologic processes simulator macro hypros tailored for cold climate regions and depression dominated terrains macro hypros is a grid based hydrologic model of a unique structure to deal with hydrologic complexities in depression dominated cold climate regions the model runs on a daily time step and incorporates a lego fashion horizontal layout to account for sub grid land use heterogeneity on the vertical layout each grid consists of different bands each of which is responsible for simulating specific hydrologic processes macro hypros employs improved methodologies to account for snow accumulation and ablation depressions and frozen ground condition the red river of the north basin rrb was selected to highlight the capabilities of macro hypros in describing the spatiotemporal complexities associated with depression dominated cold climate regions results indicated that the model provided a satisfactory performance having the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of 0 56 and 0 72 in the calibration and validation periods respectively the modeling results accentuated the impacts of frozen ground snowmelt and depressions in the generation of surface runoff over the basin on average the rrb experienced 145 days of frozen or partially frozen ground conditions per year which coincided with early spring rainfall and snowmelt events due to the widespread frozen ground conditions over the basin up to 60 of the generated snowmelt on specific days contributed to surface runoff whereas infiltration had a smaller portion also the results revealed that the depression dominated areas acted as regulators of surface runoff particularly in early springs macro hypros provides spatiotemporal simulations of various hydrologic processes to facilitate a better understanding of macro scale hydrologic trends keywords macro scale hydrologic modeling cold climate regions depression dominated areas 1 introduction the idea of hydrologic modeling at different spatial scales i e micro meso and macro is comparable to using web mapping services in an online map zoomed in views are used to find specific locations and features while zoomed out maps give a holistic view of prominent geographical features of the area similarly micro scale hydrologic models are used to investigate the local hydrologic process such as filling spilling and merging of surface depressions chu et al 2013 on the other hand macro scale hydrologic models are associated with regional and continental hydrologic processes and provide large scale simulations for areas larger than a few thousand square kilometers chu et al 2019 döll et al 2008 macro scale hydrologic modeling is a relatively new field of research which has flourished over the 21st century sood and smakhtin 2015 as one of the initial efforts to substantiate macro scale models eagleson 1986 highlighted the necessity of the knowledge of the hydrologic cycle at a macro scale and portrayed a promising future for macro scale hydrologic models suggesting that the future of hydrology is intertwined with macro scale hydrologic models vörösmarty et al 1989 developed one of the first macro scale hydrologic models in which a water balance model was linked to a water flow model to simulate soil moisture evapotranspiration and surface runoff in south america although before the 21st century the macro scale models were considered as exotic siblings of catchment models döll et al 2008 large scale climate driven changes have led to rapid developments and applications of macro scale hydrologic models throughout the 21st century the emergence of the geographic information system gis along with the increasing availability of satellite images and remote sensing data facilitated pre and post processing of meteorological and hydrological data and applications of macro scale hydrologic models in different study areas the applications of macro scale hydrologic models around the world have indicated that they are useful tools for a variety of subjects such as impacts of climate driven changes on water resources arnell and gosling 2013 flood and drought return period analysis lehner et al 2006 and hydrologic implications of human activities syvitski et al 2005 there are several studies with the primary goal of evaluating different macro scale hydrologic models based on their capabilities features structures and abilities to capture the variations in hydrologic processes gudmundsson et al 2012 kauffeldt et al 2016 sood and smakhtin 2015 for example sood and smakhtin 2015 highlighted the capabilities and limitations of twelve macro scale models and discussed general limitations of macro scale modeling including the uncertainties in hydrologic modeling incorporation of remotely sensed data and scaling issues similarly kauffeldt et al 2016 reviewed 24 macro scale hydrologic models based on their suitability for flood forecasting in europe and provided guidance on model selection based on a set of criteria the selected criteria such as input data requirement flexibility to grid structure flexibility in resolution and possibility of calibration using suitable tools were chosen to accentuate the implementation of hydrologic models on a macro scale kauffeldt et al 2016 it was concluded that although these criteria were subjective to the specific applications of hydrologic models they could serve as an initial step in the model selection for operational flood forecasting schemes kauffeldt et al 2016 macro scale hydrologic models can be classified from different aspects such as their 1 primary objective s 2 integrated processes 3 area of application e g impacts of land use change 4 structure and 5 temporal and spatial resolutions although the majority of the macro scale hydrologic models have been developed with the primary objective of simulating spatial and temporal variations of hydrologic processes some possess more specific features and functions for example the water global analysis and prognosis watergap alcamo et al 2003 takes into account human interventions in forms of water abstractions and dams and the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 considers sub grid heterogeneity through statistical distributions also the model specific objectives directly affect the integrated processes and applications of the models for instance the integration of reservoir management functions in the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 enables its application to a wide range of agricultural water supply and demand problems to simulate hydrologic processes macro scale models generally incorporate two spatial discretization structures 1 grid based and 2 subbasin based each of which has unique advantages and disadvantages chu et al 2019 grid based models such as spatial processes in hydrology sphy terink et al 2015 can easily take advantage of available gridded satellite image products such as leaf area index lai on the other hand subbasin based models such as hydrological predictions for the environment hype lindström et al 2010 can incorporate station based observations e g precipitation and temperature into different subbasins the spatial resolution of different models depends on the availability of input data however there are some model specific recommendations on spatial resolution for example vic simulates land surface processes for grids larger than 1 km while watergap performs its simulations with a spatial resolution of 55 km although macro scale hydrologic models are becoming increasingly popular there are only a few macro scale models for cold climate regions such as ecological model for applied geophysics ecomag motovilov et al 1999 developed for the northern hemisphere climate processes land surface experiment nopex motovilov 2016 used ecomag to simulate snow water equivalent for the macro scale volga basin over a period from 2001 to 2011 results indicated a good agreement between the simulated and observed time series of total snow water equivalent over the basin motovilov 2016 the cold climate regions are characterized by their long and cold winters in which snow covers the land surface for several months leading to a frozen ground condition and consequently spring floods the red river of the north basin rrb is a typical example of the cold climate regions which experiences frequent spring floods as a result of its frozen ground condition early spring snowmelt as well as its unique flat topography lin et al 2015 several studies have suggested that hydrologic models that do not account for cold climate characteristics e g frozen soil and snowmelt are not able to capture the recurring spring floods in the rrb chu et al 2019 tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 in addition to the cold climate condition the filling spilling mechanism of depressions in depression dominated areas dominates the timing and magnitude of generated surface runoff depression dominated areas are typified by numerous surface depressions that collectively alter the macro scale hydrologic processes such depressions act as the gatekeepers controlled by the filling spilling process although some methods and models have been developed to identify and model the dynamics of depressions and their hierarchical relationships e g chu et al 2013 tahmasebi nasab et al 2017b the majority of these models are mainly applied to micro scale simulations tahmasebi nasab et al 2017a to point out the correlation between spatial scales and the delineated characteristics of depressions tahmasebi nasab et al 2017a performed scale analyses of 70 different digital elevation model dem resolutions ranging from 2 m to 105 m for a depression dominated site in the prairie pothole region of north dakota they identified a threshold resolution and showed that hydrologic modeling results were highly influenced by using dem resolutions coarser than the threshold resolution in this study a macro scale hydrologic processes simulator macro hypros is developed with the primary objective of modeling hydrologic processes in depression dominated cold climate regions macro hypros is a grid based hydrologic model that runs on a daily time step and incorporates a novel lego fashion layout to account for sub grid heterogeneity and land use change in addition to the novel horizontal layout the model utilizes widely available meteorological datasets delineated micro topographic features and improved methodologies to account for the influences of surface depressions and cold climate conditions on different hydrologic processes such as snowmelt surface runoff and infiltration macro hypros simulates hydrologic processes in five different bands and uses a simple flow routing procedure to estimate streamflow discharge to deal with the complexities associated with depression dominated cold climate regions macro hypros uses improved methodologies to account for depressions snow accumulation and ablation and frozen conditions the rrb known for its depression dominated topography and cold climate features is selected as a testing example to demonstrate the capabilities of the macro hypros the simulation results are presented in forms of maps and graphs highlighting the unique features of macro hypros and providing guidance for future applications of the model 2 methodology 2 1 model structure in macro hypros a surface is discretized into a user defined number of square grids and simulation is implemented in a grid based fashion fig 1 selecting a proper grid resolution is a function of available input datasets spatial scales and the incorporated methodologies chu et al 2019 oubeidillah et al 2014 however since macro hypros is a macro scale hydrologic model the spatial resolution of larger than 1 km is recommended for simulating different hydrologic processes the resolution greater than 1 km has also been suggested by other macro scale hydrologic models such as vic liang et al 1994 most macro scale hydrologic models neglect the within grid heterogeneity of coarse resolution grids and regard each grid as a homogeneous unit however within grid variations of land use and land cover can alter different hydrologic processes such as surface runoff generation macro hypros incorporates a lego fashion layout for each grid to account for within grid heterogeneity particularly a set of rgb red green and blue building blocks sit on top of a uniform lego plate representing land use variations within a grid fig 1 the red green and blue blocks denote developed vegetated and wetted areas within a plate respectively and can be defined based on the available land use maps in addition to the building blocks different bricks can be placed on top of the rgb blocks to further account for land use details fig 1 for example multiple bricks sitting on top of the green block represent different crops and vegetation types e g cereals or sugar crops macro hypros simulates 14 bricks listed in table 1 out of which eleven are on top of the green block two are on top of the blue block and one is on top of the red block the crop classification presented in table 1 is based on the food and agriculture organization fao indicative crop classification version 1 1 fao statistical development series 15 2017 although the geographic locations and orientations of different brick types are not taken into account the coverage percentage of each brick over a grid can be calculated using the zonal statistics tools in giss different parameters are then assigned to each brick and hydrologic processes are calculated for each brick separately it should be noted that depending on the specific characteristics of a study area the user can modify and change brick parameters for different regions the lego fashion layout allows the model to simulate continuous land use changes at a sub grid scale which can affect different hydrologic processes such as interception or surface runoff generation when hydrologic processes are simulated for all bricks within a grid a weighted average method is used to calculate hydrologic processes for the grid and consider the degrees of importance of bricks as an example fig 2 depicts the land use variations in 2006 and 2007 over a sample grid of 4 4 km2 in the rrb utm coordinates 5 206 174 m 737 859 m based on the cropland data layer cdl database boryan et al 2011 a visual comparison between fig 2a and b indicates that the majority of the grid is covered by oilseed crops in 2006 and cereals in 2007 although this is a subtle change for a 4 4 km2 grid the collective land use changes can impact different hydrologic processes at a macro scale which are simulated in macro hypros through the lego fashion modeling structure in addition to the lego fashion horizontal structure macro hypros accounts for five stratified vertical bands i e atmosphere vegetation snow surface and sub surface bands in the modeling fig 3 presents a simplified flow diagram of macro hypros illustrating its workflow and the order of the bands in the program the model was programmed by using the intel fortran intel 2019 and python 2 7 python 2010 since macro hypros reads inputs and prints outputs in a txt format the arcgis arcpy package environmental systems research institute 2014 was used to facilitate pre and post processing of the gis data specifically processes such as data preparation data analysis conversion and map automation for input and output files are performed using the arcpy package within python 2 7 the primary function of the pre processing programs is to prepare input data in a txt format for macro hypros fig 3 for example a pre processing program calculates the coverage percentage of different bricks on top of each grid by analyzing land use maps using a zonal histogram function the prepared input data are used by the model to simulate different hydrologic processes within three loops including the brick grid and time loops fig 3 the relationships between different bands and descriptions of different hydrologic processes simulated by the model within each band are detailed in section 2 2 eventually flow routing is implemented and a set of post processing programs are used for visualization purposes table a1 lists all variables and parameters used in this paper 2 2 macro hypros bands how are hydrologic processes simulated 2 2 1 atmosphere band three main functions of the atmosphere band in macro hypros are to 1 separate rainfall from snowfall based on the precipitation input 2 modify the average temperature for specific bricks optional and 3 estimate the daily reference evapotranspiration ret for each grid 2 2 1 1 precipitation separation the majority of macro scale hydrologic models use a single threshold temperature to distinguish rainfall from snowfall however some models provide more refinements to the single threshold temperature approach for example users have an option to input rainfall and snowfall time series in hype lindström et al 2010 in addition in hype and hbv96 lindström et al 1997 the single threshold temperature approach is replaced by a temperature interval around the threshold temperature to allow the simultaneous occurrence of rainfall and snowfall i e mixed rainfall and snowfall macro hypros employs a user defined transitional temperature range ttr to determine rainfall snowfall and mixed rainfall and snowfall fig 4 shows a simplified illustration of the separation process 1 rainfall for tave ttmax 2 snowfall for tave ttmin and 3 mixed rainfall and snowfall for ttmin tave ttmax a linear relationship is assumed for the transition of snowfall and rainfall from ttmin to ttmax 2 2 1 2 average temperature adjustment tave in macro hypros represents an average temperature over a grid however the temperature in different bricks can vary from the average grid temperature for example developed areas may create urban heat islands which lead to higher temperatures in towns cities or developed regions oke 1973 in addition to urban heat islands it has been observed that forest canopies play a moderating role in the below canopy temperature by decreasing the daily maximum temperature and increasing the daily minimum temperature von arx et al 2012 to account for the impacts of heat islands in the developed regions and temperature variations under forest canopies macro hypros provides an option to adjust tave for the developed and forest bricks based on two coefficients in the following equation 1 t ave t g k c hi t ave t g c fc t ave t g developed b r i c k forest b r i c k in which tave t g k is the average temperature for time t grid g and brick k and the two coefficients chi and cfc represent the heat island effect and the forest canopy effect respectively when chi and cfc are equal to 1 tave is not changed and when chi and cfc are less more than 1 tave is adjusted 2 2 1 3 reference evapotranspiration ret different macro scale hydrologic models tend to employ 1 the penman monteith method and its variants 2 simple temperature based methods 3 user specified time series or 4 other methods to estimate ret for example evapotranspiration in the vic model liang et al 1994 is estimated by using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 which requires the details on vapor pressure deficient radiation and many other variables another group of models do not limit users to a specific ret relationship and provide multiple options for calculating ret hype lindström et al 2010 can simulate reference evapotranspiration by using different methods with varying levels of complexities 1 modified jensen haise mcguiness oudin et al 2005 2 hargreaves and samani hargreaves and samani 1985 3 priestley and taylor s 1972 and 4 fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 in addition to allowing the users to prepare the ret time series as a model input macro hypros also offers three different ret computation options 1 a simplified form of the standard fao penman monteith method valiantzas 2013 2 a two factor model oudin et al 2005 and 3 hargreaves and samani 1985 equation these options facilitate the selection of a suitable ret scheme based on the study area characteristics and availability of input data different ret computation options have various levels of complexity and input data requirements oudin et al 2005 suggested that the models relying on solar radiation and mean daily temperature are as efficient as more sophisticated and data demanding models and can be used in hydrologic models oudin et al 2005 also suggested a simple two factor ret model which has been incorporated in macro hypros 2 ret t g k r e λ t ave t g k k 2 k 1 i f t ave k 2 0 0 if t ave k 2 0 where λ is the latent heat flux 2 45 mj m 2 day 1 re corresponds to the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 and k1 and k2 respectively are a scaling factor and a temperature threshold ranging from 90 115 and 5 6 2 2 2 vegetation band the vegetation band is responsible for computing the interception losses by plants the macro scale hydrologic models commonly employ a simple bucket approach to simulate interception losses for example sphy terink et al 2015 incorporates a time series of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in a dynamic vegetation module to provide estimates of leaf area index lai and maximum canopy storage eventually the interception is calculated as a function of the stored water on the canopy and the atmospheric evaporation demand terink et al 2015 hbv 96 incorporates a simple storage model only for forested areas lindström et al 1997 1994 in the storage model used in hbv 96 the maximum canopy storage of the forest is assumed to be constant during the year lindström et al 1994 however the majority of hydrologic models account for variable lai during the year e g sphy and vic several studies have suggested that interception losses vary depending on the types of vegetation and precipitation characteristics kozak et al 2007 maidment 1993 therefore macro hypros accounts for rainfall and snowfall interception for 1 short vegetation i e crops and residues and 2 tall vegetation i e forests it should be noted that in each grid all bricks within the green block except for the forest brick are considered as short vegetation bricks table 1 particularly rainfall interception is simulated for both short and tall vegetation bricks however snow interception is estimated only for high vegetation bricks assuming negligible snow interception by short vegetation areas 2 2 2 1 rainfall interception by short vegetation the significance of intercepted water by different crops has been highlighted in numerous studies e g baver 1939 kontorshchikov and eremina 1963 lull 1964 lull 1964 showed that the interception losses accounted for 36 16 and 15 of the total rainfall throughout the growing season for wheat corn and soybean respectively to account for the rainfall interception by short vegetation macro hypros uses a time varying lai based method to compute the rainfall interception losses by crops during the growing season in addition the rainfall interception losses by crop residues can be optionally simulated during the post harvest period the water balance equation for the short vegetation bricks can be expressed as 3 st g sv t g k s t g sv t 1 g k r a i n can t g k i n t c can t g k where stgsv is the short vegetation canopy storage mm intccan is the incremental canopy interception mm and raincan is the incremental rainfall on the canopy mm that is estimated based on the time series of fractional vegetation cover fvc 4 rai n can t g k f v c t g k r a i n t g k where rain is the total incremental rainfall mm and fvc is the ratio of the vertical projection area of vegetation leaves stems and branches on the ground to the total vegetation area and is estimated based on lai using an exponential relationship liang et al 2012 5 f v c t g k 1 e 0 5 l a i t g k in macro hypros the growing season is divided into three periods representing three different plant growth stages fig 5 the lai values obtained from the literature e g mengel et al 2001 sellers et al 1996 represent plants in their fully developed condition i e maximum lai the lai values for the two other stages are approximated based on two linear relationships fig 5 it is assumed that lai increases linearly from the beginning of the growing season until reaching a plateau maximum lai and then decreases linearly to the end of the growing season a simple storage method is used to account for the maximum canopy storage in which the dynamic maximum canopy storage is approximated based on the estimated lai time series von hoyningen huene 1981 6 mxst g can t g k 0 935 0 498 l a i 0 00575 l a i 2 where mxstgcan is the maximum canopy storage mm the amount of water beyond mxstgcan is defined as the excess storage stgex and is expressed as 7 st g ex t g k m a x 0 s t g sv m x s t g can when the excess storage is removed from stgsv intccan mm is then calculated by 8 int c can t g k m i n st g sv a t e d t g k where ated is the atmospheric demand for open water evaporation and ated 1 5ret is suggested allen et al 1998 assuming that intccan is evaporated by the end of each day in addition to the interception by the canopy different studies suggest that the rainfall interception losses by the crop residues are also a significant portion of the total rainfall e g mohamoud and ewing 1990 savabi and stott 1994 as an option a similar approach is used in macro hypros to simulate the interception by crop residues for a user defined period following the crop harvest however the maximum residue storage mxstgres is approximated as a function of the total residue mass kozak et al 2007 savabi and stott 1994 9 mxst g res t g k 346 r m t g k 10 5 r m 2 t g k 370 r m t g k 11 r m 2 t g k 627 r m t g k 37 3 r m 2 t g k if c o r n if s o y b e a n if w h e a t where rm kg ha 1 is the residue mass for corn soybean and wheat similarly a generic empirical equation is employed to estimate mxstgres for other crops kozak et al 2007 2 2 2 2 rainfall and snowfall interception by tall vegetation the modified gash model valente et al 1997 was utilized in macro hypros to estimate rainfall interception and evaporation for the forest canopy and trunks the gash model and its variants are commonly used at a daily time step assuming each day as a separate event miralles et al 2010 in other words the forest canopy is assumed to dry up completely between events carlyle moses and gash 2011 miralles et al 2010 valente et al 1997 the rainfall interception losses from the forest canopy and tree trunks for each time step are estimated based on two critical rainfall values the amount of rainfall to saturate the 1 forest canopy crc and 2 trunks crt valente et al 1997 10 int c frc t g k fvc r a i n t g k rain t g k c r c fvc c r c ρ 1 ε rain t g k c r c rain t g k c r c where intcfrc is the amount of rainfall interception by the forest canopy mm ρ is a ratio of the mean evaporation rate to the mean rainfall rate for the saturated canopy condition and ε is the fraction of trunk evaporation 0 02 miralles et al 2010 valente et al 1997 in addition to the rainfall interception by the forest canopy a similar equation by valente et al 1997 is used to estimate the amount of rainfall interception by tree trunks moreover macro hypros uses a simple bucket approach to estimate snow interception and storage in forest canopies snow interception by tall vegetation is estimated by hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 pomeroy et al 1998 11 int c sno t g k c cu fc s mx s w e f t 1 g k 1 e fvc s n o w t g k fc s mx where intcsno is the amount of snow interception mm snow is the snowfall mm of water equivalent ccu is a canopy unloading coefficient 0 7 swef is the snow storage water equivalent of the forest canopy mm and fcsmx is the maximum forest canopy snow storage mm fcsmx is usually estimated by using lai and snow density pomeroy et al 1998 schmidt and gluns 1991 snowmelt from the forest canopy storage mf is then simulated by using a standard temperature index method liston et al 2006 based on daily average temperature and a constant melting factor 2 2 3 snow band snowmelt is one of the significant elements of the annual streamflow in many cold climate regions around the world in the western united states and canada for example 50 80 of the total streamflow is fed by the snowmelt contributions stewart et al 2004 traditionally the majority of the available hydrologic models take advantage of either 1 energy balance methods ebms or 2 temperature index methods tims leavesley 1989 ebms require a wide variety of either simulated or observed meteorological datasets such as solar radiation temperature and wind speed while tims simulate snowmelt using a single average temperature the simplicity of tims has led to their popularity in macro scale hydrologic models watergap hbv swat and sphy are among macro scale hydrologic models using tims in different forms alcamo et al 2003 arnold et al 1998 bergström 1992 terink et al 2015 the snow band in macro hypros simulates 1 snowpack water equivalent storage 2 snowmelt 3 rain on snow melt and 4 refrozen meltwater the simulated processes in the snow band are summarized here the snow band water balance equation can be expressed as 12 st g sn t g k s t g sn t 1 g k c sn s n o w s t g k m a t g k where stgsn mm is the snowpack water equivalent storage snows is the snowfall mm after interception ma is the actual snowmelt mm and csn is a snowfall correction factor that varies within a range of 0 7 1 6 anderson 2002 and accounts for the losses from sublimation and redistribution anderson 2006 macro hypros incorporates a hybrid tim htim to simulate daily snowmelt and refreezing different studies have indicated that when sub daily temperatures fluctuate above or below the freezing temperature the single temperature tim may fail to provide realistic snowmelt simulations žaknić ćatović et al 2018 therefore a modified macro scale htim is proposed to account for the effect of sub daily temperature fluctuation around the freezing temperature the proposed methodology employs daily maximum and minimum temperatures tmax and tmin and their occurrence timing to complement the original tim which is solely based on tave the daily snowmelt and refreezing can be respectively expressed as 13 m t g k c m t ave t g k δ t t min 0 t max 0 c m t max t g k 2 δ t mlt t min 0 t max 0 14 r t g k c f t ave t g k δ t t min 0 t max 0 c f t min t g k 2 δ t rfr t min 0 t max 0 where m and r are the snowmelt mm and refreezing mm respectively cm and cf are the melting and freezing factors mm c 1 day 1 tave is the daily average temperature c over time step δt day tmax and tmin are the daily maximum and minimum temperatures c and δtmlt and δtfrz are the effective melt and refreezing times and represent the fraction of the day in which the temperature is higher or lower than zero respectively the seasonal variations of cm are also modeled by using a sinusoidal function fontaine et al 2002 neitsch et al 2011 that considers the maximum and minimum melting factors cmx and cmn for different bricks specific values for bricks can be obtained from the existing literature anderson 2006 neitsch et al 2011 the meltwater resulting from a rain on snow event mr mm is calculated only when there is a snowpack on the ground and precipitation is in the form of rainfall or mixed rainfall and snowfall when precipitation occurs in the form of mixed rainfall and snowfall the snowpack is first updated followed by mr calculations assuming that the snowpack surface temperature is 0 c and the rainfall temperature is equal to tave qi et al 2017 mr can be estimated by 15 m r t g k 0 0126 t ave t g k r o s t g k in which ros is the amount of rainfall on snowpack mm the amount of actual snowmelt ma is estimated based on the total available water for melt awm mm and the maximum snowpack water retention storage mxspr mm as follows 16 m a t g k m a x 0 awm t g k m x s p r t g k in which awm is the summation of meltwater from different sources mf mr and m minus the refrozen meltwater r mxspr is a threshold for snowmelt generation the snowpack water retention storage spr retains meltwater until reaching mxspr in other words mxspr is a threshold to delay the generation of snowmelt the water stored in spr can refreeze when the temperature is below 0 c and mxspr is computed as a fraction of snowpack water equivalent storage stgsn mm 17 m x s p r t g k c wr s t g sn where cwr is the coefficient of water retention storage having a suggested value of 0 1 bergström 1992 2 2 4 surface band macro scale hydrologic models use different methodologies with varying levels of complexity to simulate surface runoff and infiltration for example sphy uses a simple saturation excess surface runoff generation method in which surface runoff is a function of the water content and the saturated water content of the first layer of the soil terink et al 2015 the vic model employs the variable infiltration curve vic scheme from the xinanjiang model zhao et al 1980 to simulate the generation of surface runoff although surface runoff is generated from the topmost soil layer in the xinanjiang model the vic model assumes that surface runoff can be generated from the two upper soil layers when the soil storage exceeds the soil storage capacity liang et al 1994 the surface band water balance equation in macro hypros can be expressed as 18 st g dp t g k s t g dp t 1 g k r a i n s t g k m a t g k r u n f t g k i n f l t g k e t g k where stgdp mm is the depression storage rains is the rainfall mm after interception ma is the actual melt mm runf is the generated surface runoff mm infl is the infiltration mm and e is the evaporation mm macro hypros uses the scs cn method usda 1986 to simulate surface runoff and infiltration the simplicity of the cn method makes it popular verma et al 2017 however the original cn method has some limitations for example it is only suitable for event based hydrologic modeling therefore over the course of the last four decades a wide variety of enhancements have been proposed to improve its applicability e g ajmal et al 2015 michel et al 2005 neitsch et al 2011 it has been shown that different factors are responsible for the cn variations among which the antecedent moisture condition amc soil type land use and slope are more pronounced verma et al 2017 the original cn values for each brick are determined based on the soil type and land use fig 6 shows a simplified flow diagram of the surface band s workflow before using the cn method for surface runoff simulation the original cn values for different bricks are modified based on amc slope and frozen ground condition fig 6 macro hypros employs the modification procedure by neitsch et al 2011 to adjust the cn values based on soil water content to account for the grid to grid slope variations macro hypros offers three different cn adjustment options ajmal et al 2016 huang et al 2006 sharpley and williams 1990 listed in table 2 these three different equations provide the option of adjusting cn based on specific topographic features in this study the equation by sharpley and williams 1990 was used to adjust cn values the frozen ground condition is a common phenomenon in cold climate regions which leads to the formation of the relatively impermeable soil surface and affects the generation of surface runoff this condition is associated with the consecutive freezing temperature periods and high antecedent moisture condition chu et al 2019 macro hypros uses the continuous frozen ground index cfgi molnau and bissell 1983 to calculate and locate the frozen ground condition cfgi has a positive value and as it increases the likelihood of the frozen ground increases too cfgi in macro hypros is expressed as 19 c f g i t g k c dc c f g i t 1 g k t ave t g k e 0 4 c sr s n o d t g k where cdc is a daily decay coefficient that controls the degradation of cfgi over time and takes the value of 0 97 molnau and bissell 1983 and csr is a snow reduction coefficient cm 1 to account for the insulation effects of the snowpack cdc and csr are calibrated parameters and their ranges are suggested by molnau and bissell 1983 snod is the depth of snow on the ground cm and is given by 20 s n o d t g k 0 1 s t g sn t g k ρ s in which stgsn mm is the snow water equivalent and ρs g cm 3 is the snow density it is assumed that the impacts of snow compaction and destructive morphinism are negligible and ρs can be calculated solely by a function of average daily temperature anderson 2006 a user defined cfgi transitional range determines the impacts of frozen ground on the generation of surface runoff fig 7 for example molnau and bissell 1983 suggested that the cfgi transitional range varies from 56 to 83 if cfgi is smaller than the lower cfgi threshold cfgilt the ground is not frozen fig 7 and the amount of surface runoff simulated by the modified cn model does not change in contrast if cfgi is greater than the upper cfgi threshold cfgiut the ground is completely frozen fig 7 and it is assumed that infiltration is minimal and cn is set to cnfrozen finally if cfgi is within the transitional range the ground is partially frozen and a linear relationship is established between cfgi and cn in which the cn for cfgiut is 98 when surface runoff is calculated for each brick in a grid an area weighted approach is used to determine the surface runoff over the grid this approach is superior to the traditional composite cn approach for estimating surface runoff mishra and singh 2003 eventually infiltration into the sub surface band is calculated by subtracting the generated surface runoff from the total input water to the surface band i e ground rainfall actual snowmelt 2 2 4 1 blue block depressions and lakes depression dominated areas have a unique undulating topography giving rise to many surface depressions that are periodically ponded and possess various functions such as flood mitigation sediment retention and habitat provision tahmasebi nasab and chu 2018 macro hypros uses the depression dominated delineation d cubed method tahmasebi nasab et al 2017c as a pre processing tool to identify depressions and quantify their impacts the d cubed method provides a variety of features related to surface depressions such as depression storages puddle levels ponding areas and contributing areas these detailed features can potentially alter micro scale hydrologic processes tahmasebi nasab et al 2016 in order to simulate depression influenced hydrologic processes at a macro scale macro hypros incorporates the lumped contributing area to depressions and maximum depression storage for each grid fig 8 depicts a schematic representation of how the d cubed results are incorporated into each grid as the depressions brick as an example fig 8a shows the satellite image of a sample grid of 4 4 km2 within the rrb utm coordinates of the grid center 5 310 355 m 501 855 m in which depressions are mostly concentrated in the southeastern corner of the sample grid fig 8b indicates the spatial distribution of the contributing area to depressions resulted from the d cubed method in other words 100 of the generated surface runoff within the delineated contributing area contributes to the depressions eventually the lumped contributing area of the depressions is incorporated into each grid as the depressions brick fig 8c the depression storage is updated based on the generated surface runoff at every time step the amount of water that spills out of depressions is estimated based on two threshold storages 1 the maximum depression storage mxstgdp and 2 the minimum spill threshold storage mnstgdp 21 s p i l t g k st g dp m x s t g dp c dp s t g dp m n s t g dp 0 st g dp m x s t g dp mnst g dp s t g dp m x s t g dp st g dp m n s t g dp where spil represents the water that spills out of depressions mm and contributes to the generated surface runoff and cdp is a decay factor 0 1 that controls the flow of water out of depressions when they are partially filled it should be noted that mxstgdp values of the grids are obtained from the d cubed surface delineation and mnstgdp values are defined as a fraction of mxstgdp based on the study area the evaporation from the depression storage is estimated based on ret and is expressed as 22 e t g k k w r e t t g k in which kw is the open water evaporation coefficient allen et al 1998 in addition the amount of water that moves from the depression storage to the sub surface band seep mm is estimated according to the fraction full of the depression storage and the fraction empty of the sub surface layer 23 s e e p t g k k s 1 st g dp t g k mxst g dp 1 θ s 1 t 1 g k sa t s 1 where ks1 is the hydraulic conductivity of the sub surface layer 1 mm day θs1 is the soil water content m3 m3 of sub surface layer 1 and sats1 is the soil saturated water content m3 m3 of sub surface layer 1 it should be noted that the current version of macro hypros does not account for lakes and their impacts on hydrologic processes therefore the lake areas within each grid are obtained from different datasets e g national wetlands inventory for the united states lakes and are removed from the grid area 2 2 5 sub surface band macro scale hydrologic models consider one or more layers to simulate different sub surface processes for example the soil profile is represented by only one layer in watergap3 and hbv whereas vic hype and ecomag account for three layers of soil krysanova and hattermann 2017 depending on their physical representation of the soil layers different models require the use of a varying number of soil parameters and characteristics while some models require only a few soil parameters e g five parameters in ecomag others may demand more details e g 19 parameters in vic sub surface processes in macro hypros are simulated in three sub surface layers specifically they schematically embody the sub surface profile in which an upper soil layer s1 is responsible for surface subsurface interactions and crop specifications a lower soil layer s2 represents deep vadose zone and an aquifer layer s3 controls the generated baseflow fig 9 illustrates a simplified workflow representation of the sub surface band its three layers and the simulated processes the water balance for layer s1 can be expressed as 24 st g s 1 t g s t g s 1 t 1 g i n f l t g e t s 1 t g p e r c s 1 t g where stgs1 is the storage of s1 mm ets1 is the evapotranspiration mm from s1 and percs1 is the percolation from s1 to s2 mm in order to compute the percolation from s1 to s2 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity ks1 is adjusted based on the frozen soil condition of a user defined portion of layer s1 frd which represents the topsoil similar to what was described for the determination of the frozen ground in surface band fig 7 a continuous frozen soil index cfsi is used to determine the frozen soil condition particularly two cfsi thresholds regulate the topsoil freezing condition the upper threshold cfsiut beyond which the topsoil is considered to be fully frozen and the lower threshold cfsilt below which the topsoil is in a non frozen condition also the cfsi values between cfsilt and cfsiut are considered to be partially frozen the adjusted ks1 for the frozen soil condition is then estimated by 25 k s 1 t g 0 cfsi c f s i up 10 c i θ fr k s a t 1 t g θ nfr sa t s 1 t g 3 2 b cfs i lt c f s i c f s i up k s 1 cfsi c f s i lt in which k s1 is the adjusted

content θfr and θnfr are the soil frozen and non frozen water contents ci is an empirical factor that accounts for the impedance of ice shoop and bigl 1997 and b is the clapp hornberger constant jame and norum 1980 the frozen water content for partially frozen soils i e θfr is estimated by using a linear relationship that uses cfsilt and cfsiut to determine the frozen fraction the evapotranspiration is calculated based on the specific crop coefficients kc for different plants during their growth stages allen et al 1998 26 e t s 1 t g k k c t g k r e t t g k where ets1 is the evapotranspiration mm ets1 is first removed from a user defined effective evapotranspiration depth etd defined as a fraction of the upper soil layer s thickness if ets1 is greater than the available water in etd ets1 is then removed from the rest of layer s1 the potential amount of percolation from s1 to s2 is estimated by using a function of the soil hydraulic conductivity the fraction full of layer s1 and fraction empty of layer s2 bennett 1998 27 mxper c s 1 t g k s 1 θ s 1 t g sa t s 1 1 θ s 2 t 1 g sa t s 2 where mxpercs1 is the potential percolation mm from s1 to s2 ks1 is the hydraulic conductivity mm day of s1 θs1 and θs2 are water contents of s1 and s2 and sats1 and sats2 are the saturated water contents of s1 and s2 the actual percolation from s1 to s2 is then estimated based on the amount of available water for percolation and mxpercs1 28 per c s 1 t g m i n mxper c s 1 t g a w p s 1 t g where awps1 is the available water for percolation mm which is calculated by the field capacity of s1 fcs1 29 aw p s 1 t g θ s 1 t g f c s 1 t g θ s 1 f c s 1 0 θ s 1 f c s 1 the water balance equation used for layer s2 is similar to the one for layer s1 however evapotranspiration from layer s2 is assumed negligible in addition the percolation from s2 to s3 is estimated by using a similar set of equations used for determining the percolation from s1 to s2 eqs 27 29 when the percolation from s2 to s3 i e percs2 is computed the groundwater recharge is estimated by using an exponential relationship developed by venetis 1969 this simple relationship has also been successfully used in different models such as swat and sphy 30 gw r s 3 t g 1 e 1 c gw p e r c s 2 t g e 1 c gw g w r s 3 t 1 g where gwrs3 is the groundwater recharge mm and cgw is the delay

1 e c rc st g s 3 b f th 2 2 6 flow routing flow routing involves simulating water movement through the entire drainage network to the outlet of a watershed the st venant equations offer a theoretical basis for flow routing however they require a variety of input data that are not usually available especially for macro scale modeling therefore macro scale hydrologic models typically employ simple routing methods that only account for flood wave delay and attenuation paiva et al 2011 similar to other macro scale hydrologic models e g vic macro hypros performs a streamflow routing procedure after hydrologic processes are simulated for the entire simulation period in other words streamflow routing is performed separately from the simulation of hydrologic processes when different processes are simulated the contributing components to streamflow i e surface runoff and baseflow are summed up for each time step this step generates a time series of matrices that account for the total contributing water from each grid 33 q c t g 0 001 r u n f t g b f s 3 t g a where qc is the grid specific contributing flow m3 and a is the grid area after removing the lakes macro hypros uses a simple routing method to route the grid specific contributing flow to a user defined outlet the user defined outlet is employed to determine the boundaries of the basin based on the input dem specifically a flow direction matrix of the study area is first computed to determine the direction of flow in a given grid then the flow accumulation matrix of the study area is calculated which is a cumulative count of the number of grids draining into the downstream grid the drainage network and the basin boundaries are eventually determined by employing the computed flow direction and flow accumulation matrices in macro hypros a set of post processing programs and the arcpy package are used to route qc employing flow direction and flow accumulation matrixes of the surface eventually a linear reservoir routing method is used to account for the delay of flow from different grids to the outlet this method has been incorporated and tested in sphy and is expressed as terink et al 2015 34 q t 1 c fr q t c fr q t 1 where q is the discharge m3 s at the outlet and cfr is a flow recession coefficient 0 1 it has been suggested that smaller cfr values correspond to the faster basin response whereas larger values represent the slower basin response terink et al 2015 2 3 testing of macro hypros in the rrb the red river of the north drains parts of minnesota and dakotas in the united states and flows into lake winnipeg in canada the rrb covers an area of 116 500 km2 out of which 103 600 km2 is within the united states fig 10 a red river basin board 2000 the annual average precipitation and temperature of the rrb are 500 mm and 4 3 c respectively jin et al 2008 and the basin slope varies from 0 04 to 0 25 m km the majority of the rrb is within the prairie pothole region that is featured with many depression dominated areas and flat topography the basin s topography can be divided into three elevation classes 1 low 2 moderate and 3 high fig 10b where the low elevation class 1 corresponds to the red river valley a prolific agricultural region in the northern united states the agricultural areas dominate the rrb specifically nearly 60 of the basin is covered by cultivated croplands whereas only 4 5 of the basin is covered by developed areas fig 10c tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 the rrb possesses unique hydro topographical features which make it prone to the occurrence of frequent spring floods in addition to its flat topography in the red river valley rrb is categorized as a cold climate region having lingering cold winters a combination of freezing temperatures and thick snowpack give rise to the frozen ground condition that lasts up to the spring when snow begins to melt the concurring snowmelt and early spring rainfalls lead to frequent floods in the rrb fig 10d highlights some of the record breaking floods in the rrb at the united states geological survey usgs grand forks station station id 05082500 including the recent 2019 flood the high snowfall during the winter of 1996 97 96 in of snow were recorded in grand forks as well as the occurrence of a blizzard on april 5 6 1997 led to the worst flooding in the rrb in more than 100 years usgs 2019a this trend has been repeating for many years in which the months of march and april play a significant role in the spring flooding condition fig 10d the reoccurrence of the spring floods pinpoints the significance of the cold climate processes in the basin therefore the rrb was selected for this study to highlight the capabilities of macro hypros for depression dominated cold climate regions 2 4 model setup and input data the rrb the u s portion as shown in fig 10a was discretized into 6351 grids of 4 4 km2 and different hydrologic processes were simulated for each grid table 3 lists the major input data obtained from different sources a 30 m digital elevation model dem was obtained from the national elevation dataset usgs 2019b and was used for the d cubed surface delineation tahmasebi nasab et al 2017c the daily streamflow dataset at the grand forks station was also obtained from the usgs 2019c for a selected 5 year period the cropland data layer cdl database boryan et al 2011 30 m resolution was used for the land use distribution and brick specification within each grid different meteorological data such as daily precipitation and daily temperature were obtained from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 and the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr fuka et al 2012 the soil type data were extracted from the united states department of agriculture statsgo2 database nrcs 2018 using soil data viewer 6 2 natural resources conservation service 2015 which is a gis extension to extract sub surface information from statsgo2 database also different soil hydraulic parameters were obtained from the existing literature particularly chu et al 2019 compiled different soil parameters for use in a hydrologic model from different sources e g carsel et al 1998 maidment 1993 rawls et al 1982 rawls and brakensiek 1983 other input data such as lai and crop specific information were also obtained from the existing literature as shown in table 3 a 5 year simulation period from 2003 to 2007 1826 days was selected out of which 2003 was used as a warm up period 2004 and 2005 were used for model calibration and 2006 and 2007 were utilized for model validation since the main objective of this study is to present the structure methodology and development of macro hypros the model parameters are manually calibrated and automated optimization schemes are not employed the methods for simulating hydrologic processes in each band were meticulously selected to ensure the existence of adequate guidelines for initializing the model parameters in different regions the parameters employed in macro hypros and their acceptable variations were explained in section 2 2 based on the existing literature table 4 lists the macro hypros parameters for different bands including their descriptions spatial scales and the calibration values ranges the project for intercomparison of land surface parameterization schemes pilps suggested that the calibration of macro scale models against observed discharges improved the performance of the models wood et al 1998 hence the macro hypros results were compared against the observed discharges at the grand forks station fig 10a in addition to the graphical comparisons the model performance was evaluated by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and following the recommended criterion for satisfactory performance for daily time steps nse 0 5 moriasi et al 2015 2007 in addition to nse the model performance was evaluated by using the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which has been widely used to evaluate the performance of macro scale hydrologic models e g beck et al 2016 and facilitate the assessment of different components of the performance of hydrologic models such as timing magnitude and variability gupta et al 2009 35 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed values α is a ratio between the standard deviation of the simulated and observed data to measure the relative variability of simulations and β is a ratio between the mean simulated and observed values to represent the bias in simulations gupta et al 2009 kge ranges from to 1 in which kge 1 0 represents the perfect match following rogelis et al 2016 the model performance can be classified into poor kge 0 intermediate 0 5 kge 0 75 and good kge 0 75 3 results and discussion fig 11 depicts the daily monthly and yearly graphical comparisons between the simulated and observed discharges m3 s at the grand forks gauging station a visual assessment for the daily discharges fig 11a indicates that macro hypros provided a comparable estimation of the streamflow variations in both cold and warm months the nse coefficients for the calibration and validation periods were 0 56 and 0 72 respectively indicating satisfactory model performance moriasi et al 2007 2015 in addition to nse kge values for the calibration and validation periods were 0 59 and 0 57 respectively falling into the intermediate model performance group further statistical analysis of the entire simulation period indicated that the model was able to estimate 65 of the variability of streamflow discharge α as well as a linear correlation coefficient r of 0 75 suggesting a positive strong linear relationship between the simulated and observed discharge values although the model was able to successfully simulate the variations in the discharge patterns during low and high flow periods it underestimated the peak discharge values this can be attributed to the hydroclimatic nuances between different years throughout the simulation period and their impacts on the calibration process for example 50 of the average precipitation over the basin in march 2006 occurred in the last five days of march and led to the highest observed peak discharge which was nearly two times higher than the peak discharge values in 2004 and 2005 since the model was calibrated for 2004 and 2005 it might not capture the peak discharge in 2006 in addition to the daily discharge fig 11b illustrates a graphical comparison between the monthly simulated and observed discharges indicating that the model provided satisfactory monthly results r2 0 81 however it slightly underestimated low discharges and overestimated high discharges for the annual average discharges the average error percentage between the observed and simulated values is less than 15 fig 11c 3 1 how does the cold climate condition alter hydrologic processes fig 12 a demonstrates the impacts of frozen ground on the generation of surface runoff in the rrb throughout the simulation period the results from the cfgi method in macro hypros can be used to determine the frozen ground condition i e frozen partially frozen and non frozen and its spatial distribution the results indicated that 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively experienced 65 43 0 and 82 days in which the entire basin s ground 6351 grids was frozen in addition to the 100 frozen ground condition the rrb experienced partially frozen grounds in 105 89 135 and 63 days in 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively the presence of the frozen and partially frozen ground conditions in the basin played a significant role in the early spring surface runoff generation fig 12a indicates that the ending period of the frozen ground condition in each year coincided with the occurrence of a significant amount of surface runoff in the basin further analysis revealed that the period from the end of march to early april was crucial for the frozen ground induced snowmelt runoff in the rrb which also coincided with the early spring rainfalls the red box in fig 12a pinpoints a critical four month period in 2006 i e january to may 2006 in which the frozen ground condition led to the generation of high surface runoff on january 1st 2006 77 1 of the basin was covered by the frozen and partially frozen ground however this number began to decline right after its peak in january indicated by the red box in fig 12a as a consequence of the decline 26 5 and 14 35 of the basin experienced fully and partially frozen ground respectively on march 31st 2006 on the same day the rrb received a significant amount of rainfall fig 12b mostly concentrated on the central and eastern parts of the basin having an average of 15 97 mm the combination of the frozen ground condition and heavy rainfall together with the average snowmelt of 4 51 mm on march 31st 2006 led to the generation of 11 1 mm of surface runoff over the basin fig 12c the aforementioned process for 2006 is a typical example of early springs in the rrb which leads to frequent spring floods with varying levels of severity fig 12a c highlight the capability of macro hypros in simulating the spatially distributed cold climate hydrologic processes that facilitate a better understanding of the basin s dynamics in early springs in addition the spatial distribution of the surface runoff on march 31st 2006 highlights the high amount of surface runoff generated in the red river valley indicated by the dashed red box in fig 12c this pattern is in accordance with the soil type distribution of rrb in which the central region i e red river valley is dominated by finer soil types causing higher surface runoff and lower infiltration chu et al 2019 in addition to early spring rainfall snowmelt played a critical role in the generation of surface runoff in the rrb to highlight the significance of snowmelt fig 13 depicts the simulated frozen ground condition snowmelt surface runoff and infiltration on a sample day i e march 13th 2007 in which the average temperature across the basin was 3 1 c with a standard deviation of 1 5 c although the average basin temperature was above the freezing temperature i e 0 c the results indicated that 98 4 of the basin i e 6248 grids out of 6351 grids experienced either frozen ground or partially frozen ground conditions fig 13a the widespread extent of the frozen ground condition on march 13th 2007 gave rise to susceptible circumstances for the generation of higher surface runoff the frozen ground condition also coincided with an average snowmelt of 6 04 mm over the basin fig 13b leading to higher surface runoff and lower infiltration fig 13c and d it was noticeable that due to the frozen ground condition over the basin more than 60 of the generated snowmelt contributed to surface runoff whereas infiltration had a smaller portion of the generated snowmelt the average surface runoff and infiltration simulated for march 13th 2007 were 3 68 mm and 2 19 mm respectively highlighting the importance of snowmelt in the rrb the pattern of frozen ground induced surface runoff depicted in fig 13 is also typical for the rrb especially on the days when the average temperature is above the freezing temperature but the frozen ground condition persists 3 2 impacts of snow accumulation and ablation processes on red river flow the distribution and magnitude of the snowmelt generated in the rrb have a direct relationship with the available snowpack the snow accumulation process in the rrb generally begins around late november and early december the gradual snow accumulation continues until late march and early april when higher than freezing temperatures initiate the snowmelt process throughout the basin the simulation results showed that the model was able to capture the snow accumulation and ablation processes in different years fig 14 a compares the magnitudes of the simulated snowpack water equivalent hereafter called snowpack and snowmelt in the rrb fig 14a suggests that the peak snowmelt values typically occurred right after the peak snowpack values although different years shared a similar snow accumulation and ablation trend the magnitude of the simulated snowmelt varied from year to year particularly in late march these variations can be attributed to the hydroclimatic variations in different years for example 2006 accounted for the most amount of snowpack throughout the simulation period having a maximum of 41 21 mm on march 6th 2006 when 95 9 of the basin was covered by snow fig 14b highlights the snowpack snowmelt dynamics for a 4 month period in 2006 i e january to may 2006 in which the snowpack decreased with the occurrence of snowmelt events the average temperature in the last five days of march 2006 was 3 c leading to the highest snowmelt peak specifically the average snowmelt across the basin in a 12 day period from 3 25 2006 to 4 5 2006 was 32 26 mm fig 14b the sudden ablation of snowpack and the resulting snowmelt as well as the frozen ground condition at the end of march led to the highest peak discharge 2033 14 m3 s in the red river at the grand forks station on 4 5 2006 moreover the spatially distributed snowpack results confirmed the roles of snow accumulation and ablation processes in the peak discharges in late march and early april fig 15 shows the comparison of the average simulated snowpack and snowmelt in march when the average temperature was 2 86 c 4 27 c 3 55 c and 2 11 c in 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively a visual comparison of the distributions of snowpack in march for different years reveals that the northern parts of the rrb experienced more snow than the southern parts fig 15a d in addition fig 15c clearly shows that 2006 had a higher snowpack in march than other years this is partly attributed to the variations in snowfall in different years for instance 2006 received 7 5 more snowfall than 2007 which resulted in a discrepancy of 2 1 mm between the average simulated snowpack values over the basin in the two years the average snowpack simulated for the rrb in march 2006 was 32 79 mm corresponding to 3 331 mm3 of water which is 2 1 3 5 and 1 9 times greater than those in 2004 2005 and 2007 respectively fig 15a d reasonably higher snowpack in 2006 affected other hydrologic processes such as snowmelt surface runoff and infiltration throughout the simulation period march had the highest snowmelt for all years fig 15e h depict the impacts of snowpack in march on the simulated snowmelt for different years as expected march 2006 experienced more snowmelt than other years high snowmelt values in 2004 2006 and 2007 were most noticeable in the northern and northwestern sides of the basin fig 15e f and h whereas the eastern side of the basin was mainly responsible for the high snowmelt in 2006 the average snowmelt over the basin in march 2006 was 1 3 mm which is 22 94 and 3 17 higher than the snowmelt in march 2004 2005 and 2007 3 3 how do depressions alter hydrologic processes studies have suggested that the abundance of surface depressions in the rrb altered the generation of surface runoff tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 the simulation results from macro hypros highlighted the critical role of depressions as regulators specifically in the early spring period fig 16 a depicts the relationship between the temporal distribution of the depression storage and the generated surface runoff it can be observed that the highest depression storage in different years occurred in late march and early april particularly the amount of depression storage in the basin peaked on march 28th 2004 march 25th 2005 march 31th 2006 and april 1st 2007 when the basin experienced partially frozen ground increased snowmelt and early spring rainfall as shown in fig 12 fig 16a also indicates the connection between depression storage and evaporation from the stored water as expected the highest evaporation usually occurred in the period from june to august the magnitude of the simulated evaporation showed a direct relationship to the depression storage for example since more water was stored in depressions in 2007 the total simulated evaporation from the ponded water in 2007 was 1 7 times higher than that in 2006 fig 16b highlights the variations of depression storage over a 5 month period in 2006 i e march august for the sample grid in the rrb shown in fig 8 as aforementioned the majority of depressions in the sample grid are concentrated in the southeastern corner of the grid fig 8b surface delineation results indicated that the maximum depression storage of the grid was 8 7 mm3 corresponding to 5 4 cm of water over the grid and 24 of the grid area contributed runoff to the depressions since nearly one fourth of the basin contributed to depressions even small rainfall or snowmelt events led to noticeable variations in the depression storage of the grid fig 16b the depression storage had an increasing trend up to the end of march when its peak coincided with the peak runoff on 3 31 2006 afterward the depression storage followed a declining trend with intermittent fluctuations due to small rainfall events and completely dried up on 5 19 2006 from this point forward depressions were only periodically ponded and dried up depending on the rainfall events fig 16b in addition to the temporal distribution of the depression storage in the rrb marco hypros also provided spatial variations of the depression storage fig 17 shows the variations of depression storage in march 2006 and 2007 which had the highest depression storage among other months in these two years fig 17a and b indicate that the basin had higher depression storage values in the eastern and western parts in comparison to the central part this pattern is in accordance with other studies in the rrb for example tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 divided the rrb into 146 subbasins and performed surface delineation to determine the maximum depression storage of the basin it was observed that the central part of the basin generally accounted for lower depression storage and depression storage increased from the central part to the eastern and western sides of the basin tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 fig 17c shows a focused area of the basin that accounted for higher depression storage in both 2006 and 2007 the satellite image presented in fig 17c confirms the abundance of surface depressions over this focused area the average depression storage values in the rrb in march 2006 and 2007 were 0 92 mm and 1 84 mm respectively the higher depression storage in march 2007 can be directly attributed to 4 89 mm more precipitation than that in march 2006 3 4 macro hypros in perspective contributions limitations and potentials hydrologic modeling at macro scale basins around the world is becoming increasingly popular to quantify the critical impacts of climate driven changes on ecological agricultural and human behavioral aspects of water resources byun et al 2019 flexibility to grid structure is one of the important elements of macro scale hydrologic models kauffeldt et al 2016 enabling the models to take advantage of widely available grid based reanalysis and earth observation datasets rodríguez et al 2019 in addition to incorporating a grid based structure macro hypros uses a novel lego fashion horizontal layout to account for sub grid heterogeneity based on the land use and land cover maps the response of macro scale cold climate basins to the projected warming climate trends are poorly known musselman et al 2017 to provide a holistic understanding of cold climate conditions through hydrologic simulations macro hypros incorporates a set of methodologies to simulate frozen ground and snow accumulation and ablation processes moreover it has been shown that the collective effects of surface depressions can manipulate the response of macro scale basins tahmasebi nasab et al 2017b 2018 therefore macro hypros utilizes a topography based approach to account for the influences of surface depressions on macro scale hydrologic processes such as surface runoff the consideration of complexities associated with depression dominated areas and cold climate regions makes the model a proper choice for applications in regions with similar hydro topographical characteristics although the current version of macro hypros presents a novel structure and improved methodologies to simulate hydrologic processes for depression dominated and cold climate regions improvements are foreseen in processes representation and calibration and evaluation processes particularly the current version of macro hypros incorporates a simple leaky bucket approach to simulate sub surface processes the merit of this simple approach is the low input data requirements which makes it suitable for macro scale models however since more spatially distributed datasets are becoming available improvements in the macro hypros sub surface band can enhance its capabilities to simulate sub surface processes since the major objective of this study was to present the theoretical foundation of the macro hypros a mechanistic approach was employed to provide a holistic understanding of the model s structure and methodology however future long term applications of macro hypros will center on calibration and evaluation of the model using not only streamflow discharge but also other hydrologic processes such as snowmelt this multi process calibration evaluation will result in a better indication of the model s behavior within different bands 4 summary and conclusions this study presented the theoretical foundation of the macro scale hydrologic processes simulator with the primary objective of simulating hydrologic processes in cold climate regions and depression dominated terrains macro hypros is a grid based daily hydrologic model that takes advantage of a unique lego fashion horizontal layout to account for the within grid variabilities of land use and land cover each grid in the model is conceptualized as a lego plate on top of which three blocks red green and blue rgb are placed representing the developed vegetated and wetted areas macro hypros incorporates five vertical bands atmosphere vegetation snow surface and sub surface bands each of which simulates different hydrologic processes to accommodate the complexities associated with the depression dominated terrains and cold climate regions the model uses improved methodologies that are developed for macro scale modeling of hydrologic processes eventually a simple routing method is used to compute the outlet discharge the model was applied to the red river of the north basin which is characterized by its cold climate and depression dominated topography for a 4 year period 1461 daily time steps from january 1st 2004 to december 31st 2007 the simulated hydrograph was compared against the observed one and the model performance was evaluated moreover the capabilities of the model in simulating the spatiotemporal variations and trends of different hydrologic processes were showcased in forms of temporally and spatially distributed results the simulated discharges were in good agreement with the observed data having the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 56 and 0 72 for the calibration and validation periods respectively the modeling results indicated that the rrb experienced frozen or partially frozen ground conditions on an average of 145 days per year i e 40 of the year the frozen ground condition often coincided with the early spring rainfall and snowmelt events and altered the magnitude and distribution of the generated surface runoff and infiltration it was demonstrated that the period between late march and early april was a critical one for the frozen ground induced spring floods across the simulation period also the results indicated that the snow accumulation and ablation synchronized with the frozen or partially frozen ground condition produced peak discharge in the red river the snowmelt analysis suggested that up to 60 of the generated snowmelt contributed to surface runoff due to the widespread frozen ground condition macro hypros employed macro scale methodologies to account for the lumped impacts of depressions and their contributing areas within each grid the results revealed that the depression dominated areas within the rrb acted as surface runoff regulators specifically in the periods when a high amount of surface runoff was generated i e late march and early april the modeling results from macro hypros accentuated the significance of considering the unique cold climate processes and the dominated role of surface depressions in hydrologic modeling by using the improved methodologies and a unique lego fashion layout macro hypros provides a better understanding and representation of macro scale hydrologic processes although the current version of macro hypros resulted in satisfactory simulations in the rrb further model applications in other macro scale basins are necessary to test different features of the model also long term model evaluation and sensitivity analysis of the model parameters

5996,through a comprehensive paleoflood hydrological investigation we document natural evidence for at least 27 high magnitude paleofloods at six sites on the lower green river utah hydraulic analysis using the sedimentation and river hydraulic 2d model srh 2d shows that the responsible peak paleoflood discharges ranged between 500 and 7500 m3 s at least 14 of these paleoflood discharge peaks exceed a level twice that of the maximum systematic record of gauged flows 1929 m3 s geochronological analyses employing optically stimulated luminescence osl and radiocarbon dating techniques demonstrate that these 14 largest paleoflood peaks occurred during the past 700 years integration of the paleoflood data into flood frequency analyses ffa reveals considerably higher values for the upper tails of the flood distribution than does a ffa based solely on the systematic gauged record indicating that extreme floods are larger and more frequent than implied by the relatively short gauged record through examination of three approaches to extreme flood estimation conventional ffa probable maximum flood estimation pmf and paleoflood hydrology pfh we show the significance of the natural evidence for advancing scientific understanding of extreme floods that naturally occur in the colorado river system we argue that this kind of scientific understanding is absolutely essential for achieving a credible evaluation of extreme flood risk in a watershed of immense importance to economic prosperity of the southwestern u s keywords paleoflood hydrology flood risk analysis naturalist approach green river upper colorado river basin 1 introduction 1 1 background problem floods result in many of the most frequent and costly water related natural disasters worldwide their global impacts include losses of life and billions of dollars in financial damages over the past century national stream gauging networks were established in many countries to provide systematic and quantitative data on streamflow including flooding to make effective use of the resulting accumulation of hydrological and meteorological observations two primary methodologies were developed mainly in the engineering community flood frequency analysis ffa and probable maximum flood pmf estimation national environment research council 1999 sl44 2006 2006 conventional ffa combines systematical records with statistical mathematical theories to provide actionable information for flood risk assessment this is conducted by fitting functions to peak annual discharges obtained from gauged records for a drainage basin extrapolations are made from what is usually a very short instrumental flood record of relatively small flood peaks in order to estimate flood extremes that may have very long return periods in other words extreme flood estimates are based on the statistical properties of the relatively frequent small scale flooding that is most commonly represented in gauge records it therefore is a matter of assumption that this record can be reliably extrapolated upscale to predict the magnitudes of unknown rare extremes a key ffa assumption is that the flood peaks are independently identically distributed iid because this iid criterion is a necessity for achieving valid statistical inferences kiseiel 1969 however in areas of high flood variability such as the southwestern u s peak flood series are commonly mixed distributions such that the most extreme flood peaks are generated by very different meteorological phenomena than are the less extreme peaks hirschboeck 1988 though these and other shortcomings have been obvious for decades klemeš 1987 conventional ffa continues to be utilized as a matter of standard practice often in ignorance that opportunities may be available to overcome shortcomings in regard to making credible extrapolations to flood extremes pmf procedures like ffa can be lacking in credibility these procedures employ hydrological models that may embody highly problematic presumptions particularly in regard to conditions representing the most extreme flood generating parameters by definition pmf modeling predicts the most extreme flood peak that could conceivably occur at a particular location i e a prediction of something at the absolute limit of what theoretically is supposed to occur were an exceedance of such flooding actually to occur of course the model would thereby be falsified by an act of nature as a matter of logical inference pmf procedures are largely deductive they can indeed yield true conclusions but only if the assumptions made are indeed true to reality in contrast ffa procedures are largely an inductive in that various statistical methods are employed to generalize from data and address associated uncertainties while these approaches have long applied engineering traditions in both empirical and theoretical hydrology they also have limitations in regard to hydrology viewed as a complete scientific discipline baker 2017 this paper employs a third mode of reasoning abduction which works in concert with both deduction and induction to generate enhanced understanding of the nature of extreme floods baker 1996 1998 1 2 paleoflood hydrology paleoflood hydrology pfh relies on the identification of physical evidence of past flood phenomena including flood slackwater deposits

2006 merz et al 2014 toonen et al 2017 2020 wilhelm et al 2019 pfh was embraced for both scientific and engineering applications worldwide after early programs of paleoflood investigation were initiated in central texas during the 1970s baker 1975 patton and baker 1977 and subsequent paleoflood studies were accomplished in the broader southwestern u s patton and dibble 1982 kochel et al 1982 ely and baker 1985 webb et al 1988 jarrett 1990 o connor et al 1994 ostenaa et al 1996 and then in other parts of the north america knox 1985 1993 2000 springer and kite 1997 brown et al 2000

japan jones et al 2001 india kale et al 1997 thailand kidson et al 2005 and israel wohl et al 1994 greenbaum et al 2000 2006 the colorado river is the most important river in the southwestern u s providing water for municipal drinking water agriculture irrigation systems and hydropower needs for more than 35 million people in seven states extreme flooding along this river would also cause massive disasters along floodplains and bring about severe damage to infrastructure and high economic costs including the potential loss of major dams that are critical to the economy of the entire region a large number of paleoflood investigations have been conducted in the lower colorado river and its tributaries e g ely and baker 1985 partridge and baker 1987 fuller 1987 enzel et al 1994 webb et al 1988 o connor et al 1994 these studies and subsequent syntheses enzel et al 1993 harden et al 2010 provide for robust knowledge of real world floods that have actually occurred over the last several thousand years in contrast there have been relatively few paleoflood studies conducted in the upper colorado river basin where more than 95 of the colorado river s discharge originates blinn and poff 2005 an important exception is the study by greenbaum et al 2014 which found natural evidence for 44 extreme floods occurring during the last 2000 years on the upper colorado river near moab utah two of these paleofloods exceeded the pmf of 8500 m3 s and the whole assemblage of largest paleoflood peaks was found to be more frequent than could be estimated on the basis of the systematic gauge data alone given this example of combining long term paleoflood records with high spatial temporal resolution systematic observations and their linkages to climate change we hope further to advance understanding extreme flood generation mechanism and improve upon estimates for the occurrences and magnitudes of future extreme flooding in the upper colorado river basin in this study we present the results of investigations along the stillwater canyon section of the lower green river we document the paleoflood events of the last 700 years using swd psis and 2d hydraulic modeling to estimate the associated peak discharges we then apply these new paleoflood data in ffa using different methodologies the results are then discussed in terms of their great potential for gaining understanding of nature of extreme flood events and their linkages with climatic changes in the upper colorado river basin 2 study area the green river is a chief tributary of the upper colorado river it is 1170 km long and has a drainage area of 124 600 km2 that includes parts of wyoming utah and colorado fig 1 it contributes nearly half of the total annual flow to the colorado river at the confluence heading in the wind river range of wyoming the green river receives tributary flows from western colorado then flows south through the uinta mountains and the uinta basin of utah finally traversing a long series of canyons before joining the main stem of the colorado river in south central utah in its lower reaches from the town of green river ut to the junction with the colorado river the green river meanders through steep stable sandstone bedrock canyons cashion 1967 labyrinth and stillwater where gradients approach 0 1 m km the green river joins the colorado river roughly 63 km downstream of moab ut precipitation in the upper green river basin can exceed 1000 mm water equivalent per year with most of this generally occurring in the form of winter snow in contrast the lower green river basin has a semiarid climate characterized by cold winters and hot dry summers noaa coop station no 421163 in canyonlands national park 1965 2018 western regional climate center 2013 records the in situ climate variables the records indicate annual mean temperature is 5 78 c with the maximum monthly mean temperature in july varying between 18 8 and 32 6 c and the minimum monthly mean temperature in january varying between 6 3 and 2 7 c annual mean precipitation is 229 mm ranging between 117 and 338 mm this precipitation is attributed to 1 summer and fall convective storms coming from the gulf of mexico or the gulf of california 2 large scale cyclonic storms resulting from pacific air masses in summer and fall and 3 north pacific frontal storms in winter blinn and poff 2005 the usgs gauging station on the green river at green river utah no 09315000 is situated ca 200 km upstream from the confluence of the green and colorado rivers fig 1 the drainage area of the green river at this location is 116 160 km2 accounting for 93 of the basin the gauge has recorded the daily discharge rate since 1894 and is continuous except for the period 1900 1904 at this station the average annual discharge is 170 0 m3 s with a maximum of 347 8 m3 s and minimum of 51 1 m3 s the annual maximum gauged flood peaks range from a low of 183 m3 s in 1934 to a high of 1929 m3 s in 1917 with an average of 790 m3 s fig 2 besides the gauged record there is no humanly recorded historical flood record that we could find for the green river this study involves six paleoflood study sites along stillwater canyon of the lower green river as the name suggests this is a canyon that is free of rapids swift turbulent flow where the river loops in sinuous curves bedrock meanders the study sites are distributed unevenly along a 35 km long reach from the mouth of dead horse canyon to the confluence with the colorado river fig 3 the river channel averages about 250 350 m in width and flows within a 120 m deep canyon with near vertical fully bedrock walls 3 methodologies 3 1 paleoflood record analysis there are many techniques available for making inferences concerning the hydrological parameters for past flood events employing principles of geomorphology and related aspects of quaternary stratigraphy and sedimentology baker 2008 england et al 2010 the most accurate method involves slackwater deposits and paleostage indicators swd psi in stable boundary fluvial reaches baker 1987 slackwater deposits are fine grained sediments mainly sand conveyed in suspension during highly energetic flood flows and deposited in areas of flow separation that result in long term preservation after the flood recession baker 2008 during our detailed field paleo hydrological investigations layered sequences of slackwater deposits were found at the six study sites along stillwater canyon of the lower green river fig 3 the paleoflood swds include between 7 and 11 flood deposits at most of the sections with one section containing only two swds while another contained 30 swds fig 4 sites are located up to 13 5 m above water level a w l we exposed stratigraphic sections at each site made detailed descriptions of the flood swds and sampled for osl and radiocarbon dating the sedimentary units associated with paleoflood events were identified using the well established sedimentological criteria baker 1987 kochel and baker 1988 house 2002 benito and o connor 2013 3 2 paleoflood age determination we employed two geochronology techniques to develop a robust paleoflood chronology accelerator mass spectrometry ams radiocarbon 14c dating of charcoal and plant material and optically stimulated luminescence osl dating of quartz sand radiocarbon dating is the most widely used geochronology method in fluvial studies and the analytical techniques have been highly refined over the past several decades three 14c samples were collected at two of six sites to estimate ages of the swds the samples were prepared and analyzed at the arizona ams lab at the university of arizona with calibration to calendar years oxcal 4 3 using the intcal13 calibration curve reimer et al 2013 and reported as two sigma calibrated age ranges table 2 because of insufficient amounts of the organic matter most of this study employed osl dating twelve osl samples were submitted to the dating laboratory of the israel geological survey in jerusalem and three were analyzed at the luminescence lab at the utah state university we employed the latest single aliquot regenerative dose sar procedures for osl dating of quartz sand murray and wintle 2000 2003 wintle and murray 2006 dose rate calculations were determined by chemical analysis of the u th k and rb content using icp ms and icp aes techniques and conversion factors from guérin et al 2011 the contribution of cosmic radiation to the dose rate was calculated using sample depth elevation and latitude longitude following prescott and hutton 1994 dose rates are calculated based on water content sediment chemistry and cosmic contribution aitken and xie 1990 aitken 1998 3 3 paleoflood hydraulic analysis paleoflood discharge estimation can be accomplished by methods ranging from simple hydraulic formulae applied at a single cross section to a variety of one two or even three dimensional hydraulic modeling codes applied to high resolution channel geometry data for this study we used the two dimensional hydraulic model shr 2d sedimentation and river hydraulics 2d lai 2010 to estimate peak discharges for the paleofloods roughness values were identified and delineated within zones for the modeled study reach the manning s n values chosen for the hydraulic model are 0 028 for the channel and 0 045 for the banks based on observations made in the field and comparison to values previously published for a similar reach of the upper colorado river greenbaum et al 2014 a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine changes in hydraulic calculations response to the uncertainty of roughness coefficient mesh cells chosen for the model in the river channel had an approximate size of 2 6 m but where the canyon walls were more widely spaced we increased the dimensions to between 6 and 8 m for areas of interest especially those near the swd sites we employed finer mesh cells to provide more detail the 2d model results also displayed the water depth and velocity distribution in the study reach information of importance to understanding the depositional environment of swds the downstream boundary condition set in the model for each flow estimate was normal depth the location of the downstream boundary was established far enough downstream so that any uncertainty in this value would not affect model results in areas of interest the model run was initiated from a dry condition and continued with a two second time step the simulation time for each modeled flow varied from 10 to 16 h in which time the incoming and outgoing flows and water surface elevation at monitoring points stabilized lidar data were used to develop the geometry of the channel for the hydraulic model and this provided a high resolution digital elevation model dem with a 0 5 meter grid spacing and 19 6 cm vertical accuracy the lidar scanning happened during the low water season with discharges ranging 26 50 m3 s depth recording sonar was used at multiple sections confirming that water depths were generally less than a meter or so during the low water season we input successive discharges for the upstream boundary and obtained discharge stage q s relationships for each site the paleoflood discharges were acquired from the resulting rating curves which were fitted based on the relevant q s relationships because the elevation of a swd is somewhat lower than the actual water surface during the flooding the reconstructed discharge is treated as the minimum value with an underestimation of 10 20 kochel et al 1982 baker 1987 enzel et al 1993 the two main assumptions for discharge calculation are 1 that significant aggradation and or degradation of the channel has not occurred during the time span of the flooding represented by the swds and 2 that significant scour and or fill in the river channel has not occurred during large flood events baker et al 1983a b for the study reach both assumptions are acceptable because the river loops in sinuous curves of sandstone bedrock over a stable rock bed which indicates very little bed change during the late holocene i e last three millennia 3 4 flood frequency analysis ffa the annual maximum flood series and a partial duration flood series pds were extracted from usgs gauge 09 315 000 on the green river at green river utah there are 117 annual peak flows 1895 1899 1905 2016 fig 2 however only the unregulated annual maximum series 1895 1899 1905 1961 is used which closely represents the natural flow on the green river these 62 peaks were adjusted to the drainage area at the study site using the method of cudworth 1989 it is assumed that the ratio of the peak discharges at the two locations is equal to the square root of their respective drainage areas therefore the peak flows at the study sites are larger than the usgs gauge values by 4 9 the largest seven paleoflood peak flows were incorporated into the ffa by considering their extreme magnitudes and avoiding double registration of the flood records the largest paleoflood events 7500 m3 s takes the first place in ffa and assigned the oldest age 1330 water year in this particular case the largest flood in the last 680 years is 7500 m3 s the second largest event takes the second place with the second oldest age and so on the ffa was conducted using hec ssp hydrologic engineering center s statistical software package v2 2 under the newly updated guidelines for determining flood flow frequency bulletin 17c england et al 2018 which continues to fit the log pearson type iii lp iii distribution using the expected moments algorithm ema cohn et al 1997 2001 england et al 2003 2018 with the multiple grubbs beck test mgbt cohn et al 2013 lamontagne et al 2013 2016 ema provides a direct fit of the lp iii distribution utilizing multiple types of at site flood information including the systematic record historical floods as well as paleofloods while adjusting for any potentially influential low floods pilf missing values due to an incomplete record or zero flood years we also employed the bulletin 17b method iacwd 1982 the log normal distribution chow et al 1988 the regional regression equation kenney et al 2008 and the self similar model kidson et al 2005 malamud and turcotte 2006 with the systematic gauged peaks and the paleoflood data 4 results 4 1 paleoflood slackwater deposits and chronology of the paleoflood events nine stratigraphic sequences of fine grained flood deposits were found at the six study sites located along a 35 km long reach of stillwater canyon of the lower green river fig 3 different slackwater depositional areas occurred in low velocity flow environments during flooding accumulating on stable rock platforms and alluvial terraces during flood recession suspended flood sediments were deposited and eventually experienced long term preservation in these regions characteristics of the slackwater depositional environments of the lower green river paleoflood swds are summarized in table 1 the 2d hydraulic model generated the paleoflood flow and velocity distributions in two dimensions indicating the slackwater depositional zones fig 5 the swds at the dead horse canyon site dhc 1 and 2 are located in a low velocity backwater area at the tributary mouth while swds at the high driftwood hd site is located on a high velocity site at a 90 curve where the sediments are probably super elevated the entire paleoflood record for the six sites consists of 68 paleoflood swd layers and two driftwood lines at the hd site these two driftwood lines are located 5 m and 12 m a w l they are composed of coarse driftwood and logs since this is a multi site record it may well be that floods are presented at more than one site the results of the ams and osl dating at the various sections indicate that all 70 units at six sites are deposited and preserved in 680 140 a or 940 110 a bracketing the error which can be represented by the rf 1 and dhc 1 sections fig 2 the osl ages 550 190 a of 26 swd layers at the rf 1 site cover all age ranges at the other five sites except for the dhc 1 the oldest unit at the dhc 1 section is 680 250 a at least 27 paleoflood events are therefore considered to have occurred in the past 680 years tables 2 and 3 4 2 paleoflood hydrodynamics the 2d hydraulic model was run for approximately 12 different discharge levels at each swd site these levels ranged upward from 50 m3 s which is a flow just large enough to begin submerging the lowest swds at the six sites rating curves were then fitted based on the stimulated discharge stage q s points following the equation q c h e β where q is the stimulated flow discharge for a certain height of the water surface m3 s h is the height of the water surface m e is the height of the lowest point of a cross section m h e is head or water depth m c and β are calibration coefficients c indicates flow discharge when water depth h e is equal to 1 and β is the slope of the rating curve water dynamic conditions are represented in the model output by particle tracings and water depth near each swd site on the study reach fig 5 the paleoflood peak discharges were estimated using the rating curve equations combined with the relevant water stages fig 6 and table 4 all the paleoflood peaks ranged between 20 4 and 7 2 when the manning s n value was adjusted by 25 fig 6 and table 4 the largest magnitude of paleoflood was about 7500 m3 s 9 2 to 3 0 with a water stage of 13 50 m above the river water level there are at least 14 paleofloods with magnitudes larger than twice the maximum systematic gauged record of 1929 m3 s 4 3 flood frequency analysis ffa the results of ffa based on various methods and flood series are shown in figs 7 9 and tables 5 7 for the bulletin 17c method the annual peak flows including the systematic record and paleofloods are all described by flow interval qy lower qy upper and perception thresholds ty lower ty upper in fig 7 and tables 5 and 6 the perception thresholds ty lower ty upper are used describe the sample properties in ema they describe the range of measurable potential discharges and are independent of the actual peak discharges that have occurred the lower perception threshold ty lower represents the smallest peak that have happened in this study ty lower for each event is the minimum estimated discharge for that event ty upper is assumed to be infinite as bigger floods that might exceed known highwater marks and other physical evidence of the flood the station skew was used in this study expected quantiles for the interval floods are shown with 95 confidence limit in fig 7a and b combining both the paleoflood data and systematic peaks the ffa shows the largest paleoflood 7500 m3 s has an aep annual exceedance probability of 0 057 or a return period of 1750 years while the aep and return period for the largest gauged flood 2023 m3 s are 3 770 and 26 5 years fig 8a in contrast the ffa using only the systematic peaks shows that the return period for the largest paleoflood is longer than 1 000 000 years for the largest gauged flood 68 5 years fig 8b the ratio of 95 confidence interval to the expected quantile ci eq is used to illustrate the effects of change with the integration of paleoflood data fig 8c paleofloods increased both the expected quantiles and confidence intervals of the 25 year flood and the longer recurrence interval floods to various extents while the ci eq was reduced by 20 for 25 year flood 27 for 50 year flood 24 for 100 year flood and 17 for 200 year flood other flood probability models also showed a good fit with most data points fig 9 curves 1 3 5 7 were calculated using the bulletin 17c bulletin 17b methods a log normal distribution and the self similar model combining paleoflood data with the systematic annual maximum flood series except that the partial duration flood series was used for the self similar model curves 2 4 6 8 were calculated using the same approaches but with only the systematic peaks curve 9 employed the regional regression equation relatively good agreement is observed among the different ffa techniques for recurrence intervals of less than ten years two clusters appeared with increasing recurrence intervals curves 1 3 5 7 and 8 occupied the first cluster showing high upper tails the low values were estimated by curves 2 4 6 and 9 which are limited to analysis of only the systematic peaks clearly the paleoflood data swing up the upper tails for the log p iii and lognormal distributions fig 8a b and c however curves 7 and 8 demonstrated that the expected quantiles correspond very closely with a power law distribution for recurrence interval larger than 25 years they both were in good agreement with paleoflood involved bulletin 17c results curve 1 5 discussion and conclusions the protection against extreme floods for large high hazard water related projects and engineered systems including high level dams and nuclear power plants is a long standing hydrological issue hydrologists developed two primary procedures for flood protection decision making 1 ffa based on the statistical analysis of peak flood distributions and 2 probable maximum flood pmf calculations despite inherent difficulties and controversies involving both methods emerging since the 1960s e g yevjevich 1968 or earlier both procedures have nevertheless been applied extensively and established either as engineering standards or official guidance in the united states and many other countries hydrology committee 1977 national environment research council 1999 sl44 2006 it has now been more than a century since 1914 when the concept of a return period of a flood event of a given magnitude or average recurrence interval was proposed by fuller 1914 and statistical techniques were introduced for the hydrological analysis of flood extremes early on this procedure was known to require a sufficiently large number of flood events for statistical validity such that the parameters met the requirement of being independent identically distributed random variables kisiel 1969 these requirements reflect fundamental assumptions necessary for ffa that a specific magnitude of flood corresponds to a specific probability or return period the objective of ffa is to find this relationship especially to predict the upper tails for the relevant distributions klemeš 2000 however it is almost always not possible to collect statistically large enough samples to validly estimate the greatest extremes even in the u s where the hydrological gauging network has been established since late 19th century national research council 1988 the gauged data are always restricted to samples overwhelming dominated by small and common floods whereas data on extremely large rare floods are not captured in the instrumental data making this assumption inadequate for making valid statistical inferences this circumstance inevitably leads to extrapolation from the existing gauged data the incorporation of paleoflood data into ffa started in the late 1970s costa 1978a b baker et al 1979 in a seminal study stedinger and cohn 1986 examined three methods for utilizing paleoflood information in flood frequency analysis see also stedinger and baker 1987 stedinger and griffis 2008 cohn et al 1997 developed a method of expected moments algorithm ema for utilizing paleoflood information in ffa and this procedure has become the basis for the newly published bulletin 17c england et al 2018 francés 2001 showed how to include paleoflood data in ffa using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method lam et al 2017 integrated paleoflood data into ffa using bayesian inference methods thereby showing a significant reduction in uncertainty for 100 yr flood estimation in subtropical australia multiple studies have focused on assessing the contribution of pfh to ffa improvement by promoting the incorporation of paleoflood data in these many studies the utilization of paleoflood information for ffa simply enriches the flood samples for the statistical manipulation as klemeš 1987 1994 strongly asserted much of ffa is just a part of small sample theory in disguise the term flood being used merely as a name for numbers employed pmf estimation employs both meteorological and hydrological approaches to calculate the theoretically maximum flood for a basin of interest wmo 2009 the pmf for a given basin is derived from the probable maximum precipitation pmp which is defined by american meteorological society as the theoretically greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration that is physically possible over a particular drainage at a certain time of the year this means the pmf method must assume that there is a natural upper limit to precipitation for a given duration and area based on this assumption the pmf can then be estimated to an upper limit of flood magnitude by hydrological modeling that incorporates the most extreme combination of hydrological conditions however it is difficult if not impossible for the reality of a changing world to establish the validity of any assumed upper limit to either precipitation or flooding the established methods for pmp pmf estimation are necessarily based on known limited observations and the current state of knowledge specific to the circumstances of time and place however in the real world both data and the intelligence with which to understand things i e science are increasing jakob et al 2009 song et al 2015 pmp pmf estimates are consequently observed to increase as more sophisticated meteorological phenomena observed and recognized kunkel et al 2013 moreover the magnitude of pmp pmf can also vary widely by using different methods douglas and barros 2003 jakob et al 2009 rouhani and leconte 2016 the hydrological model transforming the pmp into pmf uses a science as knowledge approach of which it underpins valid reasoning about what can be said to the world the extreme floods generated by a hydrological model are therefore considered as what we human created rather than what really happened in nature the most controversial observation is that pmp pmf values have been exceeded by actual extreme events a relevant example is the recent discovery of two naturally evidenced extreme floods i e paleofloods occurring in the last 2000 years and found to be larger than the pmf for the upper colorado river greenbaum et al 2014 this review of problems and criticisms of both the ffa and pmf methodologies raises even more fundamental concerns about the epistemological underpinnings in regard to the scientific understanding of the nature of extreme floods while these are not usually issues considered in the practical expediency necessary to achieve engineering solutions they do emerge when phenomena are at the limits of scientific understanding extreme flooding lies at those limits both the ffa and pmf methods employ theory directed science as knowledge approaches which hold the world to be a system that permits the application of deductive logic through mathematics to provide the certainty associated with that kind of reasoning baker 2017 but that certainty only applies if the assumptions made are absolutely true in this study state of the art paleoflood hydrology pfh was applied to provide information on extreme floods not captured in the short instrumental record pfh derives from a science as seeking point of view and employs a world directed investigative approach baker 2017 to discover the extreme floods that have actually happened over a geological span of time commonly limited to the holocene epoch a period about the last 11 700 years characterized by earth s non glacial climate regimes pfh thereby provides reliable fundamental knowledge concerning extreme flood behavior in nature it thus makes previously unknown extreme floods known to appropriately experienced investigators thereby revealing what would otherwise be hidden within hydrological assumptions by directly compiling evidence from the world in a sense listening to the nature what nature presents to us and thinking based on realities pfh investigators study the clues signals and signs of the most extreme floods found in nature in following these signs an explanatory working hypothesis emerges as to what is actually possible and every inference to what is probable must also infer what is possible this is abductive inference baker 2017 and the associated natural historical approach yields real world discoveries about extreme floods which form the basis for advancing scientific understanding about such flooding by employing paleoflood hydrological investigation this study identified at least 27 real extreme floods that occurred on the lower green river during the last 700 years combining the water stages inferred by the tops of paleoflood swd layers the 2d hydraulic modeling retrodicted the minimum peak paleo discharges at six study reaches among them at least 14 paleofloods were larger than twice of the maximum systematic gauged record of 1929 m3 s the largest paleoflood has a minimum peak discharge of 7500 m3 s these numbers more accurately reflect the actual history of extreme floods on the green river rather than either 1 the extrapolated ones from small scale flood samples or 2 the derived outputs from a hydrological watershed model this is unlike both conventional ffa or the hydrological rainfall runoff models used for pmf estimation which respectively involve either generating probabilistically extrapolated upper tails or the deterministically deduce limiting upper values via models and assumptions providing the established practical tools for predicting extreme floods in flood mitigation projects or design flood estimations u s army corps of engineers 1991 u s bureau of reclamation 2003 however these practical tools can only be claimed to be science based if their predictions are compared to the information nature provides to us about extreme flood events i e there is agreement with empirical evidence not just empirical evidence that is convenient in the artificial repositories of our existing data sets but all possible empirical evidence which includes that being held by nature itself in its natural repositories to ignore realities is to be unscientific pfh continues the exploratory imperative of what is most essential in a doing science of extreme flooding by making discoveries of viable and efficient data sources from real world evidence which can act as a spotlight for improving both ffa schendel and thongwichian 2017 lam et al 2017 and hydrological modeling england et al 2014 of extreme floods finally it can be observed that the clustering of paleoflood patterns offers an opportunity to explore complex spatially highly interrelated flood climate links in a global perspective baker 1987 2008 ely et al 1993 hirschboeck 1988 knox 2000 macklin et al 2006 merz et al 2014 benito et al 2015 toonen et al 2017 which combined with other information on paleoclimates can provide valuable insights into understanding the nature of extreme floods merz et al 2014 ely et al 1993 1997 displays the clustered extreme paleofloods in the last 4000 years in the southwestern u s and identified the hydroclimatic effect on the increased flood frequency harden et al 2010 also suggests that hydroclimatic dynamics strongly affected the episodes of major flood events during the holocene based on a broader paleoflood dataset for the southwestern u s the results of this study agree with previous research ely et al 1993 harden et al 2010 greenbaum et al 2014 that frequent large floods happened during periods of cool and dry climate knox 1993 2000 highlighted that significant changes in magnitudes and frequencies of extreme paleofloods are regional hydrological responses to global climatic change huang et al 2007 2010 and liu et al 2014 inferred that major holocene flood episodes are associated with transitional periods of climatic change forced by monsoonal shifts in northern and central china benito et al 2015 examined the relationship between holocene flood patterns and short term climatic variability in europe and north africa suggesting the importance of paleoflood information for understanding future spatial temporal changes of flood frequency toonen et al 2017 implied that individual flood events and multiyear episodes generally fall within extended flood rich phases controlled by climate demonstrating the value of paleoflood datasets as useful multiscale hydromorphic signals of climate change recent studies munoz and dee 2017 munoz et al 2018 suggest that el niño increase the risk of mississippi flooding and conventional flood prediction techniques based engineering control measures might actually be making floods worse much remains for research in the future but the only resource and basis we can rely on is to find out what s naturally true of extreme floods is the history of past manifestations it cannot be overemphasized that a truly scientific understanding of extreme floods can only emerge from our exploration in nature of flood signs in all their temporal contexts paleo historical and systematically gauged to be followed by the explanation of the discovered not presumed phenomena through a

5996,through a comprehensive paleoflood hydrological investigation we document natural evidence for at least 27 high magnitude paleofloods at six sites on the lower green river utah hydraulic analysis using the sedimentation and river hydraulic 2d model srh 2d shows that the responsible peak paleoflood discharges ranged between 500 and 7500 m3 s at least 14 of these paleoflood discharge peaks exceed a level twice that of the maximum systematic record of gauged flows 1929 m3 s geochronological analyses employing optically stimulated luminescence osl and radiocarbon dating techniques demonstrate that these 14 largest paleoflood peaks occurred during the past 700 years integration of the paleoflood data into flood frequency analyses ffa reveals considerably higher values for the upper tails of the flood distribution than does a ffa based solely on the systematic gauged record indicating that extreme floods are larger and more frequent than implied by the relatively short gauged record through examination of three approaches to extreme flood estimation conventional ffa probable maximum flood estimation pmf and paleoflood hydrology pfh we show the significance of the natural evidence for advancing scientific understanding of extreme floods that naturally occur in the colorado river system we argue that this kind of scientific understanding is absolutely essential for achieving a credible evaluation of extreme flood risk in a watershed of immense importance to economic prosperity of the southwestern u s keywords paleoflood hydrology flood risk analysis naturalist approach green river upper colorado river basin 1 introduction 1 1 background problem floods result in many of the most frequent and costly water related natural disasters worldwide their global impacts include losses of life and billions of dollars in financial damages over the past century national stream gauging networks were established in many countries to provide systematic and quantitative data on streamflow including flooding to make effective use of the resulting accumulation of hydrological and meteorological observations two primary methodologies were developed mainly in the engineering community flood frequency analysis ffa and probable maximum flood pmf estimation national environment research council 1999 sl44 2006 2006 conventional ffa combines systematical records with statistical mathematical theories to provide actionable information for flood risk assessment this is conducted by fitting functions to peak annual discharges obtained from gauged records for a drainage basin extrapolations are made from what is usually a very short instrumental flood record of relatively small flood peaks in order to estimate flood extremes that may have very long return periods in other words extreme flood estimates are based on the statistical properties of the relatively frequent small scale flooding that is most commonly represented in gauge records it therefore is a matter of assumption that this record can be reliably extrapolated upscale to predict the magnitudes of unknown rare extremes a key ffa assumption is that the flood peaks are independently identically distributed iid because this iid criterion is a necessity for achieving valid statistical inferences kiseiel 1969 however in areas of high flood variability such as the southwestern u s peak flood series are commonly mixed distributions such that the most extreme flood peaks are generated by very different meteorological phenomena than are the less extreme peaks hirschboeck 1988 though these and other shortcomings have been obvious for decades klemeš 1987 conventional ffa continues to be utilized as a matter of standard practice often in ignorance that opportunities may be available to overcome shortcomings in regard to making credible extrapolations to flood extremes pmf procedures like ffa can be lacking in credibility these procedures employ hydrological models that may embody highly problematic presumptions particularly in regard to conditions representing the most extreme flood generating parameters by definition pmf modeling predicts the most extreme flood peak that could conceivably occur at a particular location i e a prediction of something at the absolute limit of what theoretically is supposed to occur were an exceedance of such flooding actually to occur of course the model would thereby be falsified by an act of nature as a matter of logical inference pmf procedures are largely deductive they can indeed yield true conclusions but only if the assumptions made are indeed true to reality in contrast ffa procedures are largely an inductive in that various statistical methods are employed to generalize from data and address associated uncertainties while these approaches have long applied engineering traditions in both empirical and theoretical hydrology they also have limitations in regard to hydrology viewed as a complete scientific discipline baker 2017 this paper employs a third mode of reasoning abduction which works in concert with both deduction and induction to generate enhanced understanding of the nature of extreme floods baker 1996 1998 1 2 paleoflood hydrology paleoflood hydrology pfh relies on the identification of physical evidence of past flood phenomena including flood slackwater deposits

baker 2008 benito and o connor 2013 pfh results can provide both 1 a sound foundation for flood frequency analysis costa 1978a b baker et al 1979 2002 stedinger and baker 1987 and 2 hydrological model improvements england et al 2014 pfh also provides real world flood data with which to inform the search for flood climate linkages in a broad context as global and regional atmospheric circulation patterns and processes drive changing flood generating meteorological elements over long time scales benito et al 2003 2015 ely et al 1993 harden et al 2010 huang et al 2007 knox 2000 macklin et al 2006 merz et al 2014 toonen et al 2017 2020 wilhelm et al 2019 pfh was embraced for both scientific and engineering applications worldwide after early programs of paleoflood investigation were initiated in central texas during the 1970s baker 1975 patton and baker 1977 and subsequent paleoflood studies were accomplished in the broader southwestern u s patton and dibble 1982 kochel et al 1982 ely and baker 1985 webb et al 1988 jarrett 1990 o connor et al 1994 ostenaa et al 1996 and then in other parts of the north america knox 1985 1993 2000 springer and kite 1997 brown et al 2000

japan jones et al 2001 india kale et al 1997 thailand kidson et al 2005 and israel wohl et al 1994 greenbaum et al 2000 2006 the colorado river is the most important river in the southwestern u s providing water for municipal drinking water agriculture irrigation systems and hydropower needs for more than 35 million people in seven states extreme flooding along this river would also cause massive disasters along floodplains and bring about severe damage to infrastructure and high economic costs including the potential loss of major dams that are critical to the economy of the entire region a large number of paleoflood investigations have been conducted in the lower colorado river and its tributaries e g ely and baker 1985 partridge and baker 1987 fuller 1987 enzel et al 1994 webb et al 1988 o connor et al 1994 these studies and subsequent syntheses enzel et al 1993 harden et al 2010 provide for robust knowledge of real world floods that have actually occurred over the last several thousand years in contrast there have been relatively few paleoflood studies conducted in the upper colorado river basin where more than 95 of the colorado river s discharge originates blinn and poff 2005 an important exception is the study by greenbaum et al 2014 which found natural evidence for 44 extreme floods occurring during the last 2000 years on the upper colorado river near moab utah two of these paleofloods exceeded the pmf of 8500 m3 s and the whole assemblage of largest paleoflood peaks was found to be more frequent than could be estimated on the basis of the systematic gauge data alone given this example of combining long term paleoflood records with high spatial temporal resolution systematic observations and their linkages to climate change we hope further to advance understanding extreme flood generation mechanism and improve upon estimates for the occurrences and magnitudes of future extreme flooding in the upper colorado river basin in this study we present the results of investigations along the stillwater canyon section of the lower green river we document the paleoflood events of the last 700 years using swd psis and 2d hydraulic modeling to estimate the associated peak discharges we then apply these new paleoflood data in ffa using different methodologies the results are then discussed in terms of their great potential for gaining understanding of nature of extreme flood events and their linkages with climatic changes in the upper colorado river basin 2 study area the green river is a chief tributary of the upper colorado river it is 1170 km long and has a drainage area of 124 600 km2 that includes parts of wyoming utah and colorado fig 1 it contributes nearly half of the total annual flow to the colorado river at the confluence heading in the wind river range of wyoming the green river receives tributary flows from western colorado then flows south through the uinta mountains and the uinta basin of utah finally traversing a long series of canyons before joining the main stem of the colorado river in south central utah in its lower reaches from the town of green river ut to the junction with the colorado river the green river meanders through steep stable sandstone bedrock canyons cashion 1967 labyrinth and stillwater where gradients approach 0 1 m km the green river joins the colorado river roughly 63 km downstream of moab ut precipitation in the upper green river basin can exceed 1000 mm water equivalent per year with most of this generally occurring in the form of winter snow in contrast the lower green river basin has a semiarid climate characterized by cold winters and hot dry summers noaa coop station no 421163 in canyonlands national park 1965 2018 western regional climate center 2013 records the in situ climate variables the records indicate annual mean temperature is 5 78 c with the maximum monthly mean temperature in july varying between 18 8 and 32 6 c and the minimum monthly mean temperature in january varying between 6 3 and 2 7 c annual mean precipitation is 229 mm ranging between 117 and 338 mm this precipitation is attributed to 1 summer and fall convective storms coming from the gulf of mexico or the gulf of california 2 large scale cyclonic storms resulting from pacific air masses in summer and fall and 3 north pacific frontal storms in winter blinn and poff 2005 the usgs gauging station on the green river at green river utah no 09315000 is situated ca 200 km upstream from the confluence of the green and colorado rivers fig 1 the drainage area of the green river at this location is 116 160 km2 accounting for 93 of the basin the gauge has recorded the daily discharge rate since 1894 and is continuous except for the period 1900 1904 at this station the average annual discharge is 170 0 m3 s with a maximum of 347 8 m3 s and minimum of 51 1 m3 s the annual maximum gauged flood peaks range from a low of 183 m3 s in 1934 to a high of 1929 m3 s in 1917 with an average of 790 m3 s fig 2 besides the gauged record there is no humanly recorded historical flood record that we could find for the green river this study involves six paleoflood study sites along stillwater canyon of the lower green river as the name suggests this is a canyon that is free of rapids swift turbulent flow where the river loops in sinuous curves bedrock meanders the study sites are distributed unevenly along a 35 km long reach from the mouth of dead horse canyon to the confluence with the colorado river fig 3 the river channel averages about 250 350 m in width and flows within a 120 m deep canyon with near vertical fully bedrock walls 3 methodologies 3 1 paleoflood record analysis there are many techniques available for making inferences concerning the hydrological parameters for past flood events employing principles of geomorphology and related aspects of quaternary stratigraphy and sedimentology baker 2008 england et al 2010 the most accurate method involves slackwater deposits and paleostage indicators swd psi in stable boundary fluvial reaches baker 1987 slackwater deposits are fine grained sediments mainly sand conveyed in suspension during highly energetic flood flows and deposited in areas of flow separation that result in long term preservation after the flood recession baker 2008 during our detailed field paleo hydrological investigations layered sequences of slackwater deposits were found at the six study sites along stillwater canyon of the lower green river fig 3 the paleoflood swds include between 7 and 11 flood deposits at most of the sections with one section containing only two swds while another contained 30 swds fig 4 sites are located up to 13 5 m above water level a w l we exposed stratigraphic sections at each site made detailed descriptions of the flood swds and sampled for osl and radiocarbon dating the sedimentary units associated with paleoflood events were identified using the well established sedimentological criteria baker 1987 kochel and baker 1988 house 2002 benito and o connor 2013 3 2 paleoflood age determination we employed two geochronology techniques to develop a robust paleoflood chronology accelerator mass spectrometry ams radiocarbon 14c dating of charcoal and plant material and optically stimulated luminescence osl dating of quartz sand radiocarbon dating is the most widely used geochronology method in fluvial studies and the analytical techniques have been highly refined over the past several decades three 14c samples were collected at two of six sites to estimate ages of the swds the samples were prepared and analyzed at the arizona ams lab at the university of arizona with calibration to calendar years oxcal 4 3 using the intcal13 calibration curve reimer et al 2013 and reported as two sigma calibrated age ranges table 2 because of insufficient amounts of the organic matter most of this study employed osl dating twelve osl samples were submitted to the dating laboratory of the israel geological survey in jerusalem and three were analyzed at the luminescence lab at the utah state university we employed the latest single aliquot regenerative dose sar procedures for osl dating of quartz sand murray and wintle 2000 2003 wintle and murray 2006 dose rate calculations were determined by chemical analysis of the u th k and rb content using icp ms and icp aes techniques and conversion factors from guérin et al 2011 the contribution of cosmic radiation to the dose rate was calculated using sample depth elevation and latitude longitude following prescott and hutton 1994 dose rates are calculated based on water content sediment chemistry and cosmic contribution aitken and xie 1990 aitken 1998 3 3 paleoflood hydraulic analysis paleoflood discharge estimation can be accomplished by methods ranging from simple hydraulic formulae applied at a single cross section to a variety of one two or even three dimensional hydraulic modeling codes applied to high resolution channel geometry data for this study we used the two dimensional hydraulic model shr 2d sedimentation and river hydraulics 2d lai 2010 to estimate peak discharges for the paleofloods roughness values were identified and delineated within zones for the modeled study reach the manning s n values chosen for the hydraulic model are 0 028 for the channel and 0 045 for the banks based on observations made in the field and comparison to values previously published for a similar reach of the upper colorado river greenbaum et al 2014 a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine changes in hydraulic calculations response to the uncertainty of roughness coefficient mesh cells chosen for the model in the river channel had an approximate size of 2 6 m but where the canyon walls were more widely spaced we increased the dimensions to between 6 and 8 m for areas of interest especially those near the swd sites we employed finer mesh cells to provide more detail the 2d model results also displayed the water depth and velocity distribution in the study reach information of importance to understanding the depositional environment of swds the downstream boundary condition set in the model for each flow estimate was normal depth the location of the downstream boundary was established far enough downstream so that any uncertainty in this value would not affect model results in areas of interest the model run was initiated from a dry condition and continued with a two second time step the simulation time for each modeled flow varied from 10 to 16 h in which time the incoming and outgoing flows and water surface elevation at monitoring points stabilized lidar data were used to develop the geometry of the channel for the hydraulic model and this provided a high resolution digital elevation model dem with a 0 5 meter grid spacing and 19 6 cm vertical accuracy the lidar scanning happened during the low water season with discharges ranging 26 50 m3 s depth recording sonar was used at multiple sections confirming that water depths were generally less than a meter or so during the low water season we input successive discharges for the upstream boundary and obtained discharge stage q s relationships for each site the paleoflood discharges were acquired from the resulting rating curves which were fitted based on the relevant q s relationships because the elevation of a swd is somewhat lower than the actual water surface during the flooding the reconstructed discharge is treated as the minimum value with an underestimation of 10 20 kochel et al 1982 baker 1987 enzel et al 1993 the two main assumptions for discharge calculation are 1 that significant aggradation and or degradation of the channel has not occurred during the time span of the flooding represented by the swds and 2 that significant scour and or fill in the river channel has not occurred during large flood events baker et al 1983a b for the study reach both assumptions are acceptable because the river loops in sinuous curves of sandstone bedrock over a stable rock bed which indicates very little bed change during the late holocene i e last three millennia 3 4 flood frequency analysis ffa the annual maximum flood series and a partial duration flood series pds were extracted from usgs gauge 09 315 000 on the green river at green river utah there are 117 annual peak flows 1895 1899 1905 2016 fig 2 however only the unregulated annual maximum series 1895 1899 1905 1961 is used which closely represents the natural flow on the green river these 62 peaks were adjusted to the drainage area at the study site using the method of cudworth 1989 it is assumed that the ratio of the peak discharges at the two locations is equal to the square root of their respective drainage areas therefore the peak flows at the study sites are larger than the usgs gauge values by 4 9 the largest seven paleoflood peak flows were incorporated into the ffa by considering their extreme magnitudes and avoiding double registration of the flood records the largest paleoflood events 7500 m3 s takes the first place in ffa and assigned the oldest age 1330 water year in this particular case the largest flood in the last 680 years is 7500 m3 s the second largest event takes the second place with the second oldest age and so on the ffa was conducted using hec ssp hydrologic engineering center s statistical software package v2 2 under the newly updated guidelines for determining flood flow frequency bulletin 17c england et al 2018 which continues to fit the log pearson type iii lp iii distribution using the expected moments algorithm ema cohn et al 1997 2001 england et al 2003 2018 with the multiple grubbs beck test mgbt cohn et al

paleofloods while adjusting for any potentially influential low floods pilf missing values due to an incomplete record or zero flood years we also employed the bulletin 17b method iacwd 1982 the log normal distribution chow et al 1988 the regional regression equation kenney et al 2008 and the self similar model kidson et al 2005 malamud and turcotte 2006 with the systematic gauged peaks and the paleoflood data 4 results 4 1 paleoflood slackwater deposits and chronology of the paleoflood events nine stratigraphic sequences of fine grained flood deposits were found at the six study sites located along a 35 km long reach of stillwater canyon of the lower green river fig 3 different slackwater depositional areas occurred in low velocity flow environments during flooding accumulating on stable rock platforms and alluvial terraces during flood recession suspended flood sediments were deposited and eventually experienced long term preservation in these regions characteristics of the slackwater depositional environments of the lower green river paleoflood swds are summarized in table 1 the 2d hydraulic model generated the paleoflood flow and velocity distributions in two dimensions indicating the slackwater depositional zones fig 5 the swds at the dead horse canyon site dhc 1 and 2 are located in a low velocity backwater area at the tributary mouth while swds at the high driftwood hd site is located on a high velocity site at a 90 curve where the sediments are probably super elevated the entire paleoflood record for the six sites consists of 68 paleoflood swd layers and two driftwood lines at the hd site these two driftwood lines are located 5 m and 12 m a w l they are composed of coarse driftwood and logs since this is a multi site record it may well be that floods are presented at more than one site the results of the ams and osl dating at the various sections indicate that all 70 units at six sites are deposited and preserved in 680 140 a or 940 110 a bracketing the error which can be represented by the rf 1 and dhc 1 sections fig 2 the osl ages 550 190 a of 26 swd layers at the rf 1 site cover all age ranges at the other five sites except for the dhc 1 the oldest unit at the dhc 1 section is 680 250 a at least 27 paleoflood events are therefore considered to have occurred in the past 680 years tables 2 and 3 4 2 paleoflood hydrodynamics the 2d hydraulic model was run for approximately 12 different discharge levels at each swd site these levels ranged upward from 50 m3 s which is a flow just large enough to begin submerging the lowest swds at the six sites rating curves were then fitted based on the stimulated discharge stage q s points following the equation q c h e β where q is the stimulated flow discharge for a certain height of the water surface m3 s h is the height of the water surface m e is the height of the lowest point of a cross section m h e is head or water depth m c and β are calibration coefficients c indicates flow discharge when water depth h e is equal to 1 and β is the slope of the rating curve water dynamic conditions are represented in the model output by particle tracings and water depth near each swd site on the study reach fig 5 the paleoflood peak discharges were estimated using the rating curve equations combined with the relevant water stages fig 6 and table 4 all the paleoflood peaks ranged between 20 4 and 7 2 when the manning s n value was adjusted by 25 fig 6 and table 4 the largest magnitude of paleoflood was about 7500 m3 s 9 2 to 3 0 with a water stage of 13 50 m above the river water level there are at least 14 paleofloods with magnitudes larger than twice the maximum systematic gauged record of 1929 m3 s 4 3 flood frequency analysis ffa the results of ffa based on various methods and flood series are shown in figs 7 9 and tables 5 7 for the bulletin 17c method the annual peak flows including the systematic record and paleofloods are all described by flow interval qy lower qy upper and perception thresholds ty lower ty upper in fig 7 and tables 5 and 6 the perception thresholds ty lower ty upper are used describe the sample properties in ema they describe the range of measurable potential discharges and are independent of the actual peak discharges that have occurred the lower perception threshold ty lower represents the smallest peak that have happened in this study ty lower for each event is the minimum estimated discharge for that event ty upper is assumed to be infinite as bigger floods that might exceed known highwater marks and other physical evidence of the flood the station skew was used in this study expected quantiles for the interval floods are shown with 95 confidence limit in fig 7a and b combining both the paleoflood data and systematic peaks the ffa shows the largest paleoflood 7500 m3 s has an aep annual exceedance probability of 0 057 or a return period of 1750 years while the aep and return period for the largest gauged flood 2023 m3 s are 3 770 and 26 5 years fig 8a in contrast the ffa using only the systematic peaks shows that the return period for the largest paleoflood is longer than 1 000 000 years for the largest gauged flood 68 5 years fig 8b the ratio of 95 confidence interval to the expected quantile ci eq is used to illustrate the effects of change with the integration of paleoflood data fig 8c paleofloods increased both the expected quantiles and confidence intervals of the 25 year flood and the longer recurrence interval floods to various extents while the ci eq was reduced by 20 for 25 year flood 27 for 50 year flood 24 for 100 year flood and 17 for 200 year flood other flood probability models also showed a good fit with most data points fig 9 curves 1 3 5 7 were calculated using the bulletin 17c bulletin 17b methods a log normal distribution and the self similar model combining paleoflood data with the systematic annual maximum flood series except that the partial duration flood series was used for the self similar model curves 2 4 6 8 were calculated using the same approaches but with only the systematic peaks curve 9 employed the regional regression equation relatively good agreement is observed among the different ffa techniques for recurrence intervals of less than ten years two clusters appeared with increasing recurrence intervals curves 1 3 5 7 and 8 occupied the first cluster showing high upper tails the low values were estimated by curves 2 4 6 and 9 which are limited to analysis of only the systematic peaks clearly the paleoflood data swing up the upper tails for the log p iii and lognormal distributions fig 8a b and c however curves 7 and 8 demonstrated that the expected quantiles correspond very closely with a power law distribution for recurrence interval larger than 25 years they both were in good agreement with paleoflood involved bulletin 17c results curve 1 5 discussion and conclusions the protection against extreme floods for large high hazard water related projects and engineered systems including high level dams and nuclear power plants is a long standing hydrological issue hydrologists developed two primary procedures for flood protection decision making 1 ffa based on the statistical analysis of peak flood distributions and 2 probable maximum flood pmf calculations despite inherent difficulties and controversies involving both methods emerging since the 1960s e g yevjevich 1968 or earlier both procedures have nevertheless been applied extensively and established either as engineering standards or official guidance in the united states and many other countries hydrology committee 1977 national environment research council 1999 sl44 2006 it has now been more than a century since 1914 when the concept of a return period of a flood event of a given magnitude or average recurrence interval was proposed by fuller 1914 and statistical techniques were introduced for the hydrological analysis of flood extremes early on this procedure was known to require a sufficiently large number of flood events for statistical validity such that the parameters met the requirement of being independent identically distributed random variables kisiel 1969 these requirements reflect fundamental assumptions necessary for ffa that a specific magnitude of flood corresponds to a specific probability or return period the objective of ffa is to find this relationship especially to predict the upper tails for the relevant distributions klemeš 2000 however it is almost always not possible to collect statistically large enough samples to validly estimate the greatest extremes even in the u s where the hydrological gauging network has been established since late 19th century national research council 1988 the gauged data are always restricted to samples overwhelming dominated by small and common floods whereas data on extremely large rare floods are not captured in the instrumental data making this assumption inadequate for making valid statistical inferences this circumstance inevitably leads to extrapolation from the existing gauged data the incorporation of paleoflood data into ffa started in the late 1970s costa 1978a b baker et al 1979 in a seminal study stedinger and cohn 1986 examined three methods for utilizing paleoflood information in flood frequency analysis see also stedinger and baker 1987 stedinger and griffis 2008 cohn et al 1997 developed a method of expected moments algorithm ema for utilizing paleoflood information in ffa and this procedure has become the basis for the newly published bulletin 17c england et al 2018 francés 2001 showed how to include paleoflood data in ffa using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method lam et al 2017 integrated paleoflood data into ffa using bayesian inference methods thereby showing a significant reduction in uncertainty for 100 yr flood estimation in subtropical australia multiple studies have focused on assessing the contribution of pfh to ffa improvement by promoting the incorporation of paleoflood data in these many studies the utilization of paleoflood information for ffa simply enriches the flood samples for the statistical manipulation as klemeš 1987 1994 strongly asserted much of ffa is just a part of small sample theory in disguise the term flood being used merely as a name for numbers employed pmf estimation employs both meteorological and hydrological approaches to calculate the theoretically maximum flood for a basin of interest wmo 2009 the pmf for a given basin is derived from the probable maximum precipitation pmp which is defined by american meteorological society as the theoretically greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration that is physically possible over a particular drainage at a certain time of the year this means the pmf method must assume that there is a natural upper limit to precipitation for a given duration and area based on this assumption the pmf can then be estimated to an upper limit of flood magnitude by hydrological modeling that incorporates the most extreme combination of hydrological conditions however it is difficult if not impossible for the reality of a changing world to establish the validity of any assumed upper limit to either precipitation or flooding the established methods for pmp pmf estimation are necessarily based on known limited observations and the current state of knowledge specific to the circumstances of time and place however in the real world both data and the intelligence with which to understand things i e science are increasing jakob et al 2009 song et al 2015 pmp pmf estimates are consequently observed to increase as more sophisticated meteorological phenomena observed and recognized kunkel et al 2013 moreover the magnitude of pmp pmf can also vary widely by using different methods douglas and barros 2003 jakob et al 2009 rouhani and leconte 2016 the hydrological model transforming the pmp into pmf uses a science as knowledge approach of which it underpins valid reasoning about what can be said to the world the extreme floods generated by a hydrological model are therefore considered as what we human created rather than what really happened in nature the most controversial observation is that pmp pmf values have been exceeded by actual extreme events a relevant example is the recent discovery of two naturally evidenced extreme floods i e paleofloods occurring in the last 2000 years and found to be larger than the pmf for the upper colorado river greenbaum et al 2014 this review of problems and criticisms of both the ffa and pmf methodologies raises even more fundamental concerns about the epistemological underpinnings in regard to the scientific understanding of the nature of extreme floods while these are not usually issues considered in the practical expediency necessary to achieve engineering solutions they do emerge when phenomena are at the limits of scientific understanding extreme flooding lies at those limits both the ffa and pmf methods employ theory directed science as knowledge approaches which hold the world to be a system that permits the application of deductive logic through mathematics to provide the certainty associated with that kind of reasoning baker 2017 but that certainty only applies if the assumptions made are absolutely true in this study state of the art paleoflood hydrology pfh was applied to provide information on extreme floods not captured in the short instrumental record pfh derives from a science as seeking point of view and employs a world directed investigative approach baker 2017 to discover the extreme floods that have actually happened over a geological span of time commonly limited to the holocene epoch a period about the last 11 700 years characterized by earth s non glacial climate regimes pfh thereby provides reliable fundamental knowledge concerning extreme flood behavior in nature it thus makes previously unknown extreme floods known to appropriately experienced investigators thereby revealing what would otherwise be hidden within hydrological assumptions by directly compiling evidence from the world in a sense listening to the nature what nature presents to us and thinking based on realities pfh investigators study the clues signals and signs of the most extreme floods found in nature in following these signs an explanatory working hypothesis emerges as to what is actually possible and every inference to what is probable must also infer what is possible this is abductive inference baker 2017 and the associated natural historical approach yields real world discoveries about extreme floods which form the basis for advancing scientific understanding about such flooding by employing paleoflood hydrological investigation this study identified at least 27 real extreme floods that occurred on the lower green river during the last 700 years combining the water stages inferred by the tops of paleoflood swd layers the 2d hydraulic modeling retrodicted the minimum peak paleo discharges at six study reaches among them at least 14 paleofloods were larger than twice of the maximum systematic gauged record of 1929 m3 s the largest paleoflood has a minimum peak discharge of 7500 m3 s these numbers more accurately reflect the actual history of extreme floods on the green river rather than either 1 the extrapolated ones from small scale flood samples or 2 the derived outputs from a hydrological watershed model this is unlike both conventional ffa or the hydrological rainfall runoff models used for pmf estimation which respectively involve either generating probabilistically extrapolated upper tails or the deterministically deduce limiting upper values via models and assumptions providing the established practical tools for predicting extreme floods in flood mitigation projects or design flood estimations u s army corps of engineers 1991 u s bureau of reclamation 2003 however these practical tools can only be claimed to be science based if their predictions are compared to the information nature provides to us about extreme flood events i e there is agreement with empirical evidence not just empirical evidence that is convenient in the artificial repositories of our existing data sets but all possible empirical evidence which includes that being held by nature itself in its natural repositories to ignore realities is to be unscientific pfh continues the exploratory imperative of what is most essential in a doing science of extreme flooding by making discoveries of viable and efficient data sources from real world evidence which can act as a spotlight for improving both ffa schendel and thongwichian 2017 lam et al 2017 and hydrological modeling england et al 2014 of extreme floods finally it can be observed that the clustering of paleoflood patterns offers an opportunity to explore complex spatially highly interrelated flood climate links in a global perspective baker 1987 2008 ely et al 1993 hirschboeck 1988 knox 2000 macklin et al 2006 merz et al 2014 benito et al 2015 toonen et al 2017 which combined with other information on paleoclimates can provide valuable insights into understanding the nature of extreme floods merz et al 2014 ely et al 1993 1997 displays the clustered extreme paleofloods in the last 4000 years in the southwestern u s and identified the hydroclimatic effect on the increased flood frequency harden et al 2010 also suggests that hydroclimatic dynamics strongly affected the episodes of major flood events during the holocene based on a broader paleoflood dataset for the southwestern u s the results of this study agree with previous research ely et al 1993 harden et al 2010 greenbaum et al 2014 that frequent large floods happened during periods of cool and dry climate knox 1993 2000 highlighted that significant changes in magnitudes and frequencies of extreme paleofloods are regional hydrological responses to global climatic change huang et al 2007 2010 and liu et al 2014 inferred that major holocene flood episodes are associated with transitional periods of climatic change forced by monsoonal shifts in northern and central china benito et al 2015 examined the relationship between holocene flood patterns and short term climatic variability in europe and north africa suggesting the importance of paleoflood information for understanding future spatial temporal changes of flood frequency toonen et al 2017 implied that individual flood events and multiyear episodes generally fall within extended flood rich phases controlled by climate demonstrating the value of paleoflood datasets as useful multiscale hydromorphic signals of climate change recent studies munoz and dee 2017 munoz et al 2018 suggest that el niño increase the risk of mississippi flooding and conventional flood prediction techniques based engineering control measures might actually be making floods worse much remains for research in the future but the only resource and basis we can rely on is to find out what s naturally true of extreme floods is the history of past manifestations it cannot be overemphasized that a truly scientific understanding of extreme floods can only emerge from our exploration in nature of flood signs in all their temporal contexts paleo historical and systematically gauged to be followed by the explanation of the discovered not presumed phenomena through a

5997,the migration of volatile organic compounds vocs from groundwater is an environmental concern because of the risk of vapor intrusion in coastal aquifers or areas under the influence of systematic pumping groundwater table fluctuations may be significant which may affect voc flux this study developed a one dimensional numerical model to simulate voc mass transfer from groundwater to the vadose zone to the atmosphere which was validated with data gained from a previously performed soil tank experiment the numerical model revealed that groundwater table fluctuations in a simulated sandy aquifer cause voc flux levels to increase by more than one order of magnitude furthermore groundwater table fluctuations of larger amplitude are associated with larger voc flux levels contaminants associated with larger henry s law constants and smaller water solid distribution coefficients are influenced to a greater extent by groundwater table fluctuations in a coarse sand aquifer the non equilibrium model demonstrated that the voc flux level is lower 18 than that calculated if equilibrium is assumed showing the equilibrium assumption to be somewhat conservative groundwater table fluctuations induce significant increases in voc flux from soils of coarse or medium sand while flux levels are not significantly affected in silt or clay soils rainfall only has a temporal effect on voc flux during groundwater table fluctuations the numerical model in this paper could help improve estimates of human health risk by vi in areas with groundwater table fluctuation further non equilibrium studies are needed to estimate mass transfer coefficients among the three phases for different contaminants under different conditions keywords groundwater table fluctuation volatile organic compound released flux non equilibrium model 1 introduction volatile organic compounds voc in groundwater systems are a great environmental concern with a growing imperative to deal with the hazard of widespread voc plumes caused by anthropogenic pollution hou and li 2017 for instance groundwater contamination involving the highly toxic voc carbon tetrachloride ccl4 recknagel 1967 is a particular concern in china due to its wide use by industry the volatilization of vocs from groundwater to the vadose zone represents an important migration pathway that threatens the health of humans in buildings located above garg et al 2017 rivett et al 2011 yao et al 2018 therefore there is an essential need to formulate vapor intrusion models that can accurately predict voc transport so that health risks can be adequately managed many models have already been developed for this purpose most of which conceptualize transport in the vadose zone by diffusion advection and biodegradation assuming a static groundwater table and equilibrium partitioning in vapor liquid and solid phases devaull 2007 verginelli and baciocchi 2011 a retardation factor rt is typically defined to integrate the mass distribution between gas phase and liquid phase and between liquid phase and solid phase under equilibrium conditions costanza robinson et al 2013 kim et al 2005 shen et al 2014 shen and suuberg 2016 however some scenarios may influence voc transport that are not adequately addressed by these models cho et al 1993 for example time varying groundwater systems involving different mechanisms such as pressure variations rainfall events and groundwater table fluctuations shen et al 2012a shen et al 2013c coastal aquifers around the world are subject to groundwater table fluctuations induced by oceanic oscillations shoushtari et al 2016 although the fluctuation amplitude would damp out with the distance from the shoreline raubenheimer et al 1999 singaraja et al 2018 observed that the amplitude can be as much as 0 05 0 10 m within a distance of 700 m from the shoreline in addition marechal et al 2002 reported that groundwater tables may fluctuate with an amplitude of 0 03 0 10 m owing to tidal effects in some inland areas such fluctuation especially the drainage process facilitates the release of contaminants from groundwater to the vadose zone guo 2015 werner and hohener 2002 this factor could have profound implications for the world s population living in close vicinity to voc groundwater plumes in coastal areas for instance in the san francisco bay area of california usa there are 8000 contaminated sites within 5 km of the bay shoreline alone http geotracker waterboards ca gov although not all of these sites will involve voc groundwater plumes many of them will therefore the influence of such scenarios in vapor intrusion models and the validity of local equilibrium assumptions needs to be further examined with models considering non equilibrium mass transfer possibly being a more realistic way to describe the transport some previous studies have considered the transport of vocs from groundwater to the atmosphere under the condition of groundwater table fluctuations however they performed experiments with one or two cycles of groundwater table fluctuation guo 2015 werner and hohener 2002 also some studies only considered the block effect of capillary fringe on the transport of vocs from saturated zone to the unsaturated zone while they did not specifically study the effect of groundwater table fluctuation shen et al 2013a furthermore most transport models assume equilibrium among different phases picone et al 2012 while other models ignore the sorption of contaminants to the soil surface thomson et al 1997 if steady state without groundwater table fluctuation is assumed voc transfer between gas and liquid phases and between liquid and solid phases will be in equilibrium and non equilibrium vapor intrusion models with kinetic mass transfer would be simplified to equilibrium vapor intrusion models as mentioned by chen et al 2016 mass transfer limitation could significantly change the distribution of gaseous concentration and liquid concentration during the process of vapor intrusion however there is a research gap regarding mass transfer limitation during groundwater table fluctuation therefore the development of a comprehensive numerical model that considers non equilibrium mass transfer during groundwater table fluctuations is needed until now a number of models have been introduced to consider the non equilibrium mass transfer process among three phases in soil remediation processes such as soil vapor extraction armstrong et al 1994 hoeg et al 2004 and air sparging rahbeh and mohtar 2007 vanantwerp et al 2008 however in vapor intrusion models it is assumed that equilibrium exists among three phases one recent study considered rate limited mass transfer between gas and liquid phases for modeling vapor intrusion under the condition of aerobic biodegradation chen et al 2016 in addition very few physical experiments have been carried out to observe the non equilibrium phenomena in the column study or the field work because the precise sampling of contaminants in three phases remains problematic cho et al 1993 this study aimed to formulate a one dimensional non equilibrium numerical model with groundwater table fluctuations the concentrations of voc contaminants before and after fluctuation commenced were calculated and compared to show the influence of groundwater table fluctuations on the release of voc contaminants from groundwater to the atmosphere the difference between the equilibrium and non equilibrium models was also calculated and compared for different soil characteristics finally the effects of groundwater table fluctuation amplitude voc type soil type and rainfall events on the release of contaminants from groundwater to the vadose zone and finally to the crawl space of a building were taken into consideration 2 the transport model 2 1 the conceptual model in the process of the groundwater table fluctuations the vertical movement of pore gas and water is dominant therefore a one dimensional vertical direction was considered suitable for describing the physical phenomenon such model was validated by a soil column experiment discussed in section 4 the schematic diagram of the numerical model is shown in fig 1 the position of z 0 was the top of the saturated zone while z l was the ground level a ventilation opening of 1 m was located above ground to simulate the crawl space above the contaminated groundwater assuming continuous contaminant ventilation of the opening the atmospheric pressure fluctuation in the crawl space was ignored in this paper the thickness of the unsaturated zone including the capillary fringe was 5 m and the contaminant concentration at the lower boundary was deemed constant to represent the dnapl contaminated site with semi infinite groundwater contamination source in the simulation process the ventilation opening above the soil surface was simplified as a well mixed container and the non equilibrium mass transfer of contaminants only occurred in the capillary fringe and vadose zone most vapor intrusion models consider that contaminants in the gaseous phase liquid phase and solid phase reach equilibrium in the subsurface environment costanza robinson et al 2013 devaull 2007 luo et al 2015 shen et al 2012b however we hypothesize that the mass transfer process may not reach equilibrium among these three phases and the interfacial mass transfer was considered in this paper the system was assumed isothermal and heat transfer was not considered while certain organic contaminants will biodegrade naturally under aerobic conditions in the vadose zone davis et al 2009 chlorinated vocs typically do not kurt and spain 2013 usepa 2012 and therefore biodegradation was not considered in this study 2 2 governing water and gas movement equations when the groundwater table fluctuates water would move in the pore space which could be described by the richards equation richards 1931 1 c w h s sw θ w ϕ h w t z ρ w g k s k rw μ w h w z 1 0 where cw h soil water capacity function m 1 ssw water specific storativity m 1 θw volumetric soil moisture

viscosity kg m s when the groundwater table dropped the bottom of the unsaturated zone would transfer to the saturated zone after imbibition therefore eq 1 included the water storativity term which ensured that the richards equation remained valid in the saturated zone where cw h was zero binning 1994 the soil moisture content θw and soil water capacity cw h were both determined by soil

simulated in the process of groundwater table fluctuations and the flux of water advection could be calculated by the following equation 6 q w k h h w z 1 ρ w g k s k rw μ w h w z 1 where k h was the hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated or saturated zones m s since the soil had relatively high permeability the variation of gaseous pressure in the unsaturated zone could be neglected during the fluctuations of groundwater table guo and jiao 2008 therefore the pore gas was assumed incompressible and the continuity equation could be drawn to simulate the gas flow 7 q w z q g z 0 where qg w was the gas water advection flux m s 2 3 governing contaminant transport equations in a porous medium for the vadose zone and capillary fringe the mass balance equations for the transport of contaminants

where dg0 w0 the molecular diffusion coefficient of the contaminant in the gas water phase m2 s ξ the longitudinal dispersivity or simply dispersivity m our model considered mechanical dispersion because groundwater table fluctuations would induce advective flow for both water and vapors it should be noted that previous vapor intrusion models at steady state only considered diffusion 3 numerical solution 3 1 model boundary conditions 3 1 1 the boundary conditions for water and gas movement for the water movement model when rainfall events were not considered the top boundary condition could be simplified as a no flux boundary therefore the following equation could be achieved 13 q w z l t ρ w g k s k rw μ w h w z 1 0 h w z x l t 1 0 since the groundwater table would fluctuate at a certain frequency the bottom boundary could be simplified as the given head boundary which could be expressed as follows 14 h w z 0 t h 0 where h0 was the given hydraulic head which was also the height of the groundwater table m when rainfall at the soil surface was simulated the following boundary condition could be drawn to consider the effect of rainfall 15 q w z l t q rain where qrain was the rainfall intensity m s the rainfall event would also cause the groundwater table to rise but this would be counteracted by the flow of groundwater therefore this effect was not considered in the model to compare the contaminant distribution with and without groundwater table fluctuations the groundwater table was kept stable until the distribution of contaminant concentration in three phases reached stability after that it started to fluctuate for 5000 h in order to prevent gas moving across the lower boundary the lower boundary was set at the lowest position during groundwater table fluctuations therefore the height of the groundwater table h0 could be described by the following equation 16 h 0 a t 0 h a a sin 2 π t t 0 h t 5000 h where a the amplitude of groundwater table fluctuation m t the period of groundwater table fluctuation h t time h for the gas flow in the soil since the saturated zone was located below the lower boundary during the process of groundwater table fluctuations there was no gas flow through the lower boundary as described by eq 17 17 q g z 0 t 0 3 1 2 the boundary condition for the contaminant transport model boundary condition of constant concentration was applied for the lower boundary of the liquid phase as described by eq 18 18 c w z 0 t c w 0 where cw0 is the constant concentration in the lower boundary of the model this lower boundary condition could represent some contaminated sites with dnapl which would continue to release contaminants and keep the concentration of groundwater relatively stable since there was no gas at the lower boundary of the model there was no need to define the lower boundary for the contaminant concentration in the gas phase for the top boundary condition of the contaminant transport model the gas volume above the soil surface in the crawl space of a building must be considered we assumed that the contaminant in the gas phase was well mixed in the crawl space and ventilation was simulated as an airflow blowing in without contaminants therefore the following equation could be drawn to calculate the variation of contaminant concentration in the crawl space 19 j top a area q wind c gout v top d c gout dt where jtop the flux of contaminant through the soil surface to the crawl space mg m2 s aarea the cross sectional area of the research field m2 qwind the wind

advection which could be expressed by the following equation 20 j top d gtop c g z z l q gtop c gtop where dgtop the gas dispersion coefficient at the soil surface m2 s qgtop the gas flux from the unsaturated zone to the crawl space m s based on eq 10 the adsorbed concentration at the soil surface was totally determined by the aqueous concentration therefore there was no need to give the boundary conditions for the concentration of the contaminant in the solid phase 3 2 model initial conditions the initial conditions for the simulation had two parts the water distribution profiles and the contaminant distribution profiles at the start of simulation t 0 h the condition for soil water was assumed to be hydrostatic shen et al 2012b assuming no gas and liquid flow occurred before groundwater table fluctuation on the other hand the concentration distribution of contaminant in three phases reached stable at the start of simulation and the released flux from unsaturated zone to the crawl space was constant 3 3 model discretization in this study the finite difference method was applied to solve these equations in the model the total length of the unsaturated zone was 5 m which was discretized into 500 grids with the grid length of 1 cm the lengths of crawl space above soil surface was 1 m fig 1 the time step was 1 h during groundwater table fluctuations in order to catch its movement with the fluctuation period of 12 h when solving eqs 8 and 9 one difficult problem was to discretize the advection term and how to choose the concentration in the upstream and downstream sides properly many mathematical methods have been developed to solve this problem such as the upwind scheme leap frog scheme and lax friedrichs scheme morton and roe 2001 roe 1989 in this paper the upwind scheme was applied to determine the concentration of the contaminant in the advection term as shown in eqs 21 and 22 21 c g w i 1 2 t 1 c g w i t 1 q g w i 1 2 t 1 0 c g w i 1 t 1 q g w i 1 2 t 1 0 22 c g w i 1 2 t 1 c g w i 1 t 1 q g w i 1 2 t 1 0 c g w i t 1 q g w i 1 2 t 1 0 where i was the index number for the grid and i 1 2 and i 1 2 meant the position of the grid surface eqs 21 and 22 illustrates that the concentration at the grid surface was totally determined by the concentration at the upstream grid 3 4 mass transfer coefficients among three phases in the contaminant transport model considering non equilibrium mass transfer the gas water and water solid mass transfer coefficients were two key parameters that determined the equilibrium state among these three phases therefore it was necessary to determine these two parameters based on previous studies when calculating the gas water mass transfer coefficient γgw γgw kgwagw the interfacial sorption coefficient kgw and the gas water interfacial area agw were two key parameters that needed to be determined previous studies found that the superficial velocity had significant influence on the interfacial sorption coefficient kgw and many empirical equations had been developed based on experimental results cho et al 1993 gidda et al 2011 however in the natural environment gas and water phases may or may not be static which was not considered in most equations roberts et al 1985 shulman et al 1955 therefore the following equation was chosen to calculate kgw because it considered both static and non static conditions szatkowski et al 1995 23 sh a 0 023sc a 0 5 0 849re a 0 861 sc a 0 5 where sha liquid side sherwood number dimensionless sca liquid side schmidt number dimensionless rea liquid side reynolds number dimensionless eq 23 ignored the gas side mass transfer resistance because the gas diffusion coefficient was about four orders of magnitude greater than the liquid diffusion coefficient inducing a much higher mass transfer coefficient in the gas side sherwood and holloway 1940 szatkowski et al 1995 therefore the calculated liquid side gas water sorption coefficient by eq 23 was used as the total gas water sorption coefficient kgw the gas water interfacial area was another parameter that controlled γgw peng and brusseau 2005 used gas phase tracer tests to measure the gas water interfacial area and eqs 24 26 were drawn to calculate the gas water interfacial area which were applied in this study 24 a gw 6 1 ϕ d 50 1 β θ w θ m ϕ 1 2 m m 25 β 14 3

where koc the organic carbon normalized partition coefficient m3 kg foc the organic carbon content of soil dimensionless henry s law controls the distribution of contaminants between gas and water phases which is mainly determined by temperature in this paper the temperature was assumed isothermal at 20 c therefore henry s law constant h was 0 972 for ccl4 according to chen et al 2012 it should be regarded that higher temperatures would lead to a higher henry s law constant which would lead to a larger released flux from groundwater to the vadose zone to the crawl space of a building 3 6 input parameter values 3 6 1 general simulations the general base case scenario input parameter values used are displayed in table 1 the parameters α m n for the van genuchten equation indicated that the soil was mainly formed by medium sand leij et al 1997 the default fluctuation amplitude of groundwater table was 0 05 m which could happen in coast aquifers and some inland area by tidal effect marechal et al 2002 singaraja et al 2018 many parameters in the model are sensitive to temperature especially the henry s law constant chen et al 2012 the parameters in table 1 were used in all simulations unless stated otherwise 3 6 2 voc type four common voc contaminants of concern including ccl4 pce tce and benzene which were selected as target contaminants the basic parameters of these contaminants are listed in table a1 when comparing the different types of voc the organic content of soil foc was all assumed to be 1 the water solid distribution coefficients of different contaminants were calculated by eq 28 and the mass transfer coefficients between liquid and solid were calculated by eq 27 3 6 3 soil types and permeability different types of soil may affect the water distribution in soil which is related to the van genuchten parameters four types of soil were considered which included coarse sand and gravel medium sand silt and clay the representative parameters for these soils were shown in table a2 3 6 4 effects of infiltration when considering infiltration we applied rainfall amounts of 200 mm y and 500 mm y with the rainfall intensity and rainfall times shown in table a3 4 model validation by laboratory experiments in order to check the validity of the model the numerical model was used to interpret the measured released flux from a previous soil column experiment carried out by guo 2015 in that experiment quikrete play sand sieved to 50 mesh size 0 3 mm was placed in a tank with dimensions of 180 cm 60 cm 10 cm the characteristic parameters of the soil the contaminant tce and column are listed in table a4 the flow rate of groundwater was 0 32 l h and the level of groundwater kept increasing until it reached 0 90 m a period of time was delayed before the groundwater table fluctuation after that the groundwater started fluctuation with the help of water level table elevation control during the process of groundwater table fluctuations a 5 l air bag was connected with the contaminant water reservoir to keep the pressure neutral and a relatively constant concentration of dissolved tce in the reservoir was kept during the process of groundwater table fluctuations the tce concentration in the sweep gas was measured and the released flux of tce was calculated during the fluctuations of groundwater table in the numerical model the lower boundary for the liquid contaminant was the constant concentration cw 0 9 mg l and the upper boundary for the gaseous concentration was also the constant concentration cg 0 mg l model validation was carried out with a fluctuation period of about 310 h and a fluctuation amplitude of about 30 cm it could be observed that the simulated flux had similar variation trends with the measured flux fig 2 a the flux increased with the decrease of groundwater table while it decreased with the increase of groundwater table when the groundwater table dropped the top part of the saturated zone would transfer to the capillary fringe and unsaturated zone because this part had a relatively high tce concentration the gaseous concentration of tce in this part would become very high the flux would increase due to gas dispersion during the drainage process however a small delay existed between the measured and simulated flux and the simulated flux would drop more slowly than the measured flux this may be caused by an underestimation of the gaseous dispersion coefficient in the tank experiment the gas and water movement was not ideal one dimensional and there may be gas and water horizontal movement both in the saturated zone and capillary fringe silliman et al 2002 which could lead to a transverse dispersivity to consider the effect of horizontal gas movement the following equation was drawn to modify gas dispersion coefficient 29 d g a d g 0 θ g 10 3 ϕ 2 ξ q g where a was the enhancement factor that represented the effect of horizontal flow on the gas dispersion coefficient in this experiment a was chosen as 2 5 and the model validation result is shown in fig 2b it could be observed that the revised model could better simulate the variation of gaseous flux from the soil to the atmosphere in the real environment the gas dispersion coefficient may also be increased due to the horizontal gas movement which should be taken into consideration in future research 5 results and discussion 5 1 contaminant concentration distribution in the vadose zone before the fluctuation of groundwater table commenced the soil moisture content decreased significantly from the capillary fringe to the top of the unsaturated zone fig 3 b the length of capillary fringe hc could be calculated by the following equation dexter and bird 2001 30 h c 1 α 1 m 1 m according to eq 30 the length of the capillary fringe was calculated to be 0 34 m which was relatively short due to the texture of medium sand on the other hand before the fluctuation of the groundwater table the concentration at the top of the capillary fringe was only 0 65 of the equilibrated gaseous ccl4 concentration at the groundwater table fig 3a the sharp reduction of contaminant concentration through the capillary fringe indicated that the capillary fringe could block the transport of volatile organic contaminants from the groundwater table to the unsaturated zone which was shown by some other studies mccarthy and johnson 1993 shen et al 2013b the blocking effect of the capillary fringe was caused by the variation of moisture content from the capillary fringe to the unsaturated zone fig 3b which resulted in a significant decrease of the total effective diffusion coefficient and correspondingly a high concentration gradient according to the conservation of mass however the blocking effect was less significant in silt or clay because these aquifer materials have a less significant change of moisture content with distance through the capillary fringe shen et al 2013b after the groundwater table started fluctuating the gaseous concentration of ccl4 in the unsaturated zone increased significantly as the blocking effect by the capillary fringe became less significant fig 3a the concentration at the top of capillary fringe 0 34 m above the initial groundwater table increased from 0 029 mg l to 0 29 mg l at 600 h and finally reached 0 59 mg l at 5000 h after fluctuations thus increasing the contaminant concentration in the unsaturated zone the flux increase during groundwater table fluctuations was mainly caused by a relatively significant variation in soil moisture content in the capillary fringe fig 3b which caused an enhanced dispersive flux section 5 2 since the gas water interfacial area agw was strongly correlated with the soil moisture content it could be observed that the gas water mass transfer coefficient γgw decreased from the top to the bottom of the unsaturated zone fig 3c the range of γgw was from 1 8 10 4 s 1 to 2 3 10 3 s 1 which was in the same order of magnitude with the water solid mass transfer coefficient γws 1 3 10 3 s 1 in this study this simulation result indicated that the fluctuations of groundwater table would weaken the blocking effect for the reduction of contaminant concentration from groundwater to the unsaturated zone the released flux of ccl4 from the unsaturated zone to the atmosphere was 5 3 10 9 g m2 s before groundwater table fluctuation however it gradually increased to about 9 3 10 8 g m2 s after fluctuations for 5000 h which is more than one order of magnitude greater fig 4 a the significant increase in flux to the atmosphere indicates that groundwater table fluctuations in sandy soil aquifers would greatly enhance the release of vocs from groundwater to the atmosphere thus greatly enhancing the potential health risk for humans the enhancement of voc emission rate by groundwater table fluctuation was previously observed by guo et al 2019 who performed field experiments and found that the tce emission rate increased from 4 μg m2 d to 8 μg m2 d when the groundwater table fluctuation amplitude increased from 1 5 cm to 10 cm illangasekare et al 2014 also performed soil tank experiments and found that the tce airflow concentration increased in both water drainage and imbibition processes which also indicates the enhancement effect of groundwater table fluctuations on voc flux from groundwater the flux of ccl4 to the atmosphere did not change significantly at the start of groundwater table fluctuations it increased gradually at 500 h after fluctuations started fig 4a because the higher concentration caused by groundwater table fluctuations needed time to transport from the bottom of the unsaturated zone to the top as shown in fig 3a the gaseous concentrations had increased significantly at the bottom of the unsaturated zone at 600 h while it had not change significantly at the top of the unsaturated zone the gaseous concentration at the top of unsaturated zone gradually increased when the fluctuations kept for 2400 h which shows that much time is needed to increase the gaseous concentration at the top of the unsaturated zone as well as the released flux on the other hand the fluctuation amplitude of released flux increased with the continuous fluctuations after groundwater table fluctuations for 5000 h the amplitude of released flux was 8 4 10 9 g m2 s which was 9 1 of the average flux fig 4b a phase difference of π 6 could be observed between the variation of released flux and the variation of groundwater table the phase difference indicates that the peak of contaminant concentration in the soil and the released flux to the atmosphere happens when the groundwater table was approaching the highest position it also indicates that the variation of released vocs to the atmosphere is both determined by the groundwater table position and its variation rate however some experimental results have indicated that the released flux out from the unsaturated zone increases dramatically when the groundwater table suddenly dropped guo 2015 illangasekare et al 2014 mccarthy and johnson 1993 werner and hohener 2002 this was mainly caused by the decreased water content in the capillary fringe and top of saturated zone which increased the exposure of gas phase with water phase with high contaminant concentration the contaminant in gas and water phases quickly reached equilibrium resulting in elevated soil gas concentration some enclosed contaminant in air bubbles released to the atmosphere during the drainage process may also increase the released flux 5 2 the variation of gaseous concentration caused by different mechanisms the variation of gaseous concentration caused by different mechanisms at 2 5 m below the soil surface were calculated and compared to determine the main factors that affect voc flux during groundwater table fluctuations fig 5 this depth was selected because it was in the middle of unsaturated zone which is representative for the variation of contaminant concentration at different depths it could be observed that the variation of gaseous concentration caused by dispersion gradually increased from 3 2 10 9 mg l s to 5 4 10 9 mg l s when time increased from 250 h to 300 h which was the main mechanism for the increase of contaminant concentration from groundwater to the atmosphere the increase of gaseous concentration by dispersion was mainly caused by two factors 1 the fluctuations of groundwater table increased the flowing flux of gas and water in the unsaturated zone which would significantly increase the mechanical dispersion of contaminant in both gas and water 2 when groundwater table dropped gas entered the position which was originally water and the mass transfer from water to gas created a large gaseous concentration in this position the large contaminant concentration in the bottom of unsaturated zone caused a larger concentration gradient which finally caused an enhanced dispersive flux because the unsaturated zone above the capillary fringe had a larger effective dispersion coefficient compared with the capillary fringe a larger gaseous concentration in the unsaturated zone would facilitate dispersion due to fick s law this mechanism is revealed by fig a1 which shows that the ccl4 flux to the soil surface would also increase significantly after groundwater table fluctuations without considering mechanical dispersion the mechanical dispersion of contaminant was strongly correlated with the longitudinal dispersivity ξ sensitivity analysis of the longitudinal dispersivity showed that larger ξ would create higher vocs flux to the atmosphere while ignoring the mechanical dispersion would underestimate the vocs flux released from the groundwater fig a1 on the other hand the comparison of the dispersion coefficient caused by diffusion and mechanical dispersion shows that the dispersion in the gas phase was mainly controlled by diffusion fig a1a the dispersion in the liquid phase was controlled by diffusion in most parts of unsaturated zone while near the capillary fringe it was mainly controlled by mechanical dispersion fig a2b this comparison indicates that the mechanical dispersion in the liquid phase near the capillary fringe caused the difference in different dispersivity that was shown in fig a1 the mass transfer of contaminants among the three phases plays a negative role on the increase of contaminant flux to the atmosphere fig 5 which was described as a retardation factor in previous studies brusseau et al 1997 costanza robinson et al 2013 kim et al 2005 on the other hand the advective flux would only cause sinusoidal fluctuations of flux in the soil and above the soil surface though the transient advective flux could be greater than the diffusive flux the net contribution of the advective flux was much smaller than the diffusive flux you and zhan 2013 developed an equilibrium model and found a similar result they also concluded that the advective flux contributed comparably with the diffusive flux only when the gas filled porosity was less than 0 05 5 3 comparison between equilibrium and non equilibrium model the degree of equilibrium between gas and liquid phases dg l was defined by the following equation 31 d g l c w h c g the degree of equilibrium between water and solid phases dl s was defined by the following equation 32 d l s x s k d c w the calculated degree of equilibrium between gas and liquid dg l was very close to 1 at all depths in the unsaturated zone which indicated that the contaminant almost reached equilibrium in most parts of the unsaturated zone fig 6 a among three depths of 0 005 m 2 500 m and 4 875 m dg l varied most significantly at depth of 0 005 m when the groundwater table moved upwards across the center position dg l reached its minimum of 0 995 at depth of 0 005 m indicating that the contaminant was transferring from gas to liquid when the groundwater table moved downwards across the center position dg l reached its maximum of 1 005 which indicated that vocs was transferring from liquid to gas similar with dg l dl s was also very close to 1 at all depth of unsaturated zone which indicated that the contaminant between liquid and solid phases was almost in equilibrium in all parts of the unsaturated zone the maximal variation of dl s happened near the soil surface which was between 0 991 and 1 008 at depth of 0 005 m fig 6b when the groundwater table rose the pore water with high contaminant concentration flowed upwards which caused a higher concentration in the water phase this process would induce the vocs to transfer from liquid to solid therefore dl s decreased with the rise of the groundwater table and vice versa as shown in fig 6b from fig 6a and b it can be concluded that slight non equilibrium mass transfer would occur between gas and water phases and between water and solid phases however this non equilibrium phenomenon mainly occurs at a short distance above the groundwater table as well as the position below the soil surface beyond these regions the contaminant was almost in equilibrium among three phases however in this paper the gas water mass transfer coefficient and water solid mass transfer coefficient were both determined by previous experiments brusseau and rao 1991 peng and brusseau 2005 szatkowski et al 1995 which will vary depending on different contaminants and different soil textures as these two mass transfer coefficients were the key parameters controlling the non equilibrium mass transfer of vocs in the unsaturated zone more research is needed to carefully quantify these two mass transfer coefficients for different contaminants and different soil characteristics for soils composed with medium sand the difference in voc flux between equilibrium and non equilibrium models was relatively small fig a3 for example for fine sand with organic content of 1 the difference of released flux when the fluctuations kept for 5000 h by equilibrium model was about 4 5 lower than that of the non equilibrium model sensitivity analysis of gas water mass transfer coefficient γgw showed that the released flux would not change significantly if γgw decreased to 1 of the original value while the released flux had a decrease of 33 3 when γgw decreased to 0 1 of the original value fig a4 this result shows that the mass transfer process between gas and liquid would not influence the released flux until it was three orders of magnitude lower than the calculated value on the other hand lower water solid mass transfer coefficients γws lead to quicker increases in flux levels during groundwater table fluctuations fig a5 which shows that γws was more sensitive than γgw in a sandy aquifer the comparison of equilibrium and non equilibrium models was also carried out in soils composed with silt and clay for which it was found that equilibrium was also almost fully reached however a non marginal difference between equilibrium and non equilibrium models were discovered in the case of coarse sand results showed that in coarse sand the released flux calculated by a non equilibrium model was lower than that of the equilibrium model fig 7 a at 5000 h the average released flux of ccl4 to the atmosphere calculated by non equilibrium model was 2 7 10 7 g m2 s which was 18 lower than that calculated by the equilibrium model this finding indicates that the traditional equilibrium model might somewhat overestimate the potential human health risk under this condition during 4950 h to 5000 h without rainfall the released flux calculated by equilibrium model could reach 2 8 10 7 g m2 s to 3 5 10 7 g m2 s while the released flux was only 2 1 10 7 g m2 s to 3 3 10 7 g m2 s for the non equilibrium model fig 7b though the average flux of the non equilibrium model was smaller than that calculated by equilibrium model the fluctuation amplitude of the non equilibrium model was larger the discrepancy in coarse sand was mainly caused by a relatively smaller gas water interfacial area for coarse sand which reduces the gas water mass transfer coefficient in the capillary fringe 5 4 the effect of different parameters on the released flux 5 4 1 groundwater table fluctuation amplitude previous studies have shown that groundwater fluctuation amplitudes can be as much as 1 5 10 cm especially in areas near the coast guo et al 2019 marechal et al 2002 singaraja et al 2018 the numerical model showed that the fluctuation amplitude of the groundwater table had strong effect on the released flux of vocs to the atmosphere fig 8 when the fluctuation amplitude was 0 05 m the average released flux increased to 9 28 10 8 g m2 s at 5000 h after fluctuations while it significantly decreased to 5 35 10 8 g m2 s when the fluctuation amplitude decreased to 0 02 m the simulation result indicated that larger fluctuation amplitude would induce larger fluxes though the fluctuation amplitude of flux became larger the average released flux remained relatively close for the groundwater table fluctuation amplitude of 0 05 m and 0 10 m fig 8b because the soil moisture content would not respond to the variation of groundwater table due to a hysteresis effect the released flux to the atmosphere does not always increase with the increase of fluctuation amplitude therefore careful estimation should be made to identify the potential risk for groundwater table fluctuations at different fluctuation amplitudes 5 4 2 different voc contaminants the effects of groundwater fluctuations on the flux of four different voc types was examined using ccl4 pce tce and benzene as target contaminants section 3 6 2 the gas and liquid molecular diffusion coefficients of all four contaminants are similar so their influences were limited however the henry s law constant and the water solid distribution coefficient varied significantly among different contaminants table a1 it was found that the average ccl4 flux as well as its fluctuation amplitude was much larger than that of pce tce and benzene after groundwater table fluctuations commenced fig 9 this was mainly caused by the larger henry s law constant of ccl4 as well as its small sorption capacity on soil although pce has the second largest henry s law constant the water solid distribution coefficient of pce is much larger than the other three contaminants which caused a larger reduced flux by adsorption on soil surface it could be concluded that contaminant with larger henry s law constant and smaller sorption capacity on soil would have greater released flux after groundwater table fluctuations it should be considered that some contaminants may biodegrade whereas other will not however this aspect was not considered in the present study 5 4 3 different soil types and permeability the numerical model showed that groundwater table fluctuations increased the release of ccl4 to the atmosphere most significantly in soils composed with coarse sand and gravel fig 10 a for which the flux increased from 7 08 10 9 g m2 s to 2 70 10 7 g m2 s after fluctuations for 5000 h for medium sand the flux increased from 5 27 10 9 g m2 s to 9 28 10 8 g m2 s after fluctuations for 5000 h it could be deduced that groundwater table fluctuations had higher impact on the increase of released flux for coarse sand and gravel than medium sand however for silt and clay groundwater table fluctuations did not enhance the release of vocs from groundwater to the atmosphere and the released flux of vocs remained nearly constant before and after groundwater table fluctuations fig 10b this phenomenon is related with the distribution of soil moisture content in coarse sand and medium sand the soil moisture content changed significantly in the capillary fringe and the fluctuations of groundwater table would cause a significant variation of soil moisture content at the bottom of unsaturated zone fig 3b the drop of groundwater table would create a zone with high contaminant concentration in the gas phase which would gradually cause a higher gaseous concentration in the unsaturated zone by dispersion and advection as fluctuations proceeded however in silt and clay the variation of soil moisture content during groundwater table fluctuations was insignificant fig a6 5 4 4 effects of infiltration when rainfall events were introduced during the process of groundwater table fluctuations the released flux to the atmosphere significantly decreased fig a7a during the rainfall events the increase of soil moisture content at the top of unsaturated zone blocks the dispersion of contaminants in the gas phase from the unsaturated zone to the atmosphere which causes a sudden drop of released flux shen et al 2012b however after the rainfall ceases the flux quite quickly recovers to the level before rainfall with increased number of rainfall events the flux drop would naturally become more frequent fig a7b the released flux was quite close for rainfall intensity of 200 mm year and 500 mm year after groundwater table fluctuations for 5000 h it can be concluded that the influence of rainfall was quite temporary and could not affect the released flux after the rain stopped for about 100 h 5 4 5 the multiplying number of released flux by the regression model as mentioned in the sections 5 4 1 5 4 3 many parameters affect voc flux during groundwater table fluctuation the key parameters that were determined are the soil permeability i e soil type groundwater table fluctuation amplitude henry s law constant and the organic carbon normalized partition coefficient contaminant characteristics therefore these four parameters were used as known parameters to predict the multiplying number for released flux n after 5000 h of groundwater table fluctuation the following equation was obtained by the multi parameter regression model to predict the multiplying number n 33 n 124 9477 12 0162 lg k s 16 5821 h 50 1644 k oc 231 8718 a the p value of the regression model is 0 0020 0 05 which indicates that it effectively predicts n with small error 6 conclusions and limitations this study developed a numerical model to study the effect of groundwater table fluctuations on the transport of vocs from groundwater to the atmosphere in a sandy aquifer in this numerical model the mass transfer processes between gas and liquid phases and between liquid and solid phases were considered the model was validated by the groundwater table fluctuation experiment by guo 2015 and results showed that the numerical model could simulate the variation trend of released flux during groundwater table fluctuations well however enhanced gas dispersion was found during the experiment which might be caused by the horizontal gas movement in the tank in a sandy aquifer when vocs transported from the contaminated groundwater to the atmosphere without the fluctuation of groundwater table its concentration decreased by more than two order of magnitude from the bottom to the top of the capillary fringe due to the slow diffusion rate in the pore water however groundwater table fluctuations eliminate this blocking effect and greatly enhance voc flux to the atmosphere therefore significantly increasing the potential health risk for human this enhancement of contaminant emission was mainly caused by enhanced dispersion while the mass transfer among three phases would weaken this effect the dispersion in the gas phase was mainly controlled by diffusion while the mechanical dispersion was dominant near the capillary fringe in the liquid phase in the sandy aquifer equilibrium among three phases was almost reached in the unsaturated zone during the groundwater table fluctuations in coarse sand a reduced interfacial area between gas phase and liquid phase leads to a relatively small mass transfer coefficient which causes a non marginal overestimation of the released flux by the equilibrium models further research is needed to carefully determine the mass transfer coefficient among three phases for different contaminants under different conditions e g changes in barometric pressure or the amount of soil organic matter present the released flux increased significantly when the fluctuation amplitude increased from 0 02 m to 0 05 m however a hysteresis effect in soil moisture content limits the increase in voc flux with larger fluctuation amplitudes vocs with higher henry s law constants and lower water solid distribution coefficients will have greater flux levels during groundwater table fluctuations groundwater table fluctuations greatly enhance the released flux of vocs in coarse sand and medium sand however they hardly increase the released flux in silt or clay because the soil moisture content changes little during groundwater table fluctuations rainfall events cause a sudden drop in released flux while its effect is temporal and does not greatly affect the overall increase of released flux during groundwater table fluctuations finally a regression equation was carried out to predict the variation of released flux with groundwater table fluctuation it should be noted that in the present study the soil unsaturated zone was all composed with materials with no soil horizons layers or soil heterogeneity which is unrepresentative of natural soil moreover the adsorption processes solid liquid gas liquid were assumed to be linear and the mixing of salt water and fresh water near the coast the atmospheric pressure fluctuations the preferential flow path the biodegradation effect and some other factors were not considered in this paper these limitation factors could be investigated in further studies based on this model the numerical model presented in this paper is the first step toward improved estimation of vapor intrusion risk

5997,the migration of volatile organic compounds vocs from groundwater is an environmental concern because of the risk of vapor intrusion in coastal aquifers or areas under the influence of systematic pumping groundwater table fluctuations may be significant which may affect voc flux this study developed a one dimensional numerical model to simulate voc mass transfer from groundwater to the vadose zone to the atmosphere which was validated with data gained from a previously performed soil tank experiment the numerical model revealed that groundwater table fluctuations in a simulated sandy aquifer cause voc flux levels to increase by more than one order of magnitude furthermore groundwater table fluctuations of larger amplitude are associated with larger voc flux levels contaminants associated with larger henry s law constants and smaller water solid distribution coefficients are influenced to a greater extent by groundwater table fluctuations in a coarse sand aquifer the non equilibrium model demonstrated that the voc flux level is lower 18 than that calculated if equilibrium is assumed showing the equilibrium assumption to be somewhat conservative groundwater table fluctuations induce significant increases in voc flux from soils of coarse or medium sand while flux levels are not significantly affected in silt or clay soils rainfall only has a temporal effect on voc flux during groundwater table fluctuations the numerical model in this paper could help improve estimates of human health risk by vi in areas with groundwater table fluctuation further non equilibrium studies are needed to estimate mass transfer coefficients among the three phases for different contaminants under different conditions keywords groundwater table fluctuation volatile organic compound released flux non equilibrium model 1 introduction volatile organic compounds voc in groundwater systems are a great environmental concern with a growing imperative to deal with the hazard of widespread voc plumes caused by anthropogenic pollution hou and li 2017 for instance groundwater contamination involving the highly toxic voc carbon tetrachloride ccl4 recknagel 1967 is a particular concern in china due to its wide use by industry the volatilization of vocs from groundwater to the vadose zone represents an important migration pathway that threatens the health of humans in buildings located above garg et al 2017 rivett et al 2011 yao et al 2018 therefore there is an essential need to formulate vapor intrusion models that can accurately predict voc transport so that health risks can be adequately managed many models have already been developed for this purpose most of which conceptualize transport in the vadose zone by diffusion advection and biodegradation assuming a static groundwater table and equilibrium partitioning in vapor liquid and solid phases devaull 2007 verginelli and baciocchi 2011 a retardation factor rt is typically defined to integrate the mass distribution between gas phase and liquid phase and between liquid phase and solid phase under equilibrium conditions costanza robinson et al 2013 kim et al 2005 shen et al 2014 shen and suuberg 2016 however some scenarios may influence voc transport that are not adequately addressed by these models cho et al 1993 for example time varying groundwater systems involving different mechanisms such as pressure variations rainfall events and groundwater table fluctuations shen et al 2012a shen et al 2013c coastal aquifers around the world are subject to groundwater table fluctuations induced by oceanic oscillations shoushtari et al 2016 although the fluctuation amplitude would damp out with the distance from the shoreline raubenheimer et al 1999 singaraja et al 2018 observed that the amplitude can be as much as 0 05 0 10 m within a distance of 700 m from the shoreline in addition marechal et al 2002 reported that groundwater tables may fluctuate with an amplitude of 0 03 0 10 m owing to tidal effects in some inland areas such fluctuation especially the drainage process facilitates the release of contaminants from groundwater to the vadose zone guo 2015 werner and hohener 2002 this factor could have profound implications for the world s population living in close vicinity to voc groundwater plumes in coastal areas for instance in the san francisco bay area of california usa there are 8000 contaminated sites within 5 km of the bay shoreline alone http geotracker waterboards ca gov although not all of these sites will involve voc groundwater plumes many of them will therefore the influence of such scenarios in vapor intrusion models and the validity of local equilibrium assumptions needs to be further examined with models considering non equilibrium mass transfer possibly being a more realistic way to describe the transport some previous studies have considered the transport of vocs from groundwater to the atmosphere under the condition of groundwater table fluctuations however they performed experiments with one or two cycles of groundwater table fluctuation guo 2015 werner and hohener 2002 also some studies only considered the block effect of capillary fringe on the transport of vocs from saturated zone to the unsaturated zone while they did not specifically study the effect of groundwater table fluctuation shen et al 2013a furthermore most transport models assume equilibrium among different phases picone et al 2012 while other models ignore the sorption of contaminants to the soil surface thomson et al 1997 if steady state without groundwater table fluctuation is assumed voc transfer between gas and liquid phases and between liquid and solid phases will be in equilibrium and non equilibrium vapor intrusion models with kinetic mass transfer would be simplified to equilibrium vapor intrusion models as mentioned by chen et al 2016 mass transfer limitation could significantly change the distribution of gaseous concentration and liquid concentration during the process of vapor intrusion however there is a research gap regarding mass transfer limitation during groundwater table fluctuation therefore the development of a comprehensive numerical model that considers non equilibrium mass transfer during groundwater table fluctuations is needed until now a number of models have been introduced to consider the non equilibrium mass transfer process among three phases in soil remediation processes such as soil vapor extraction armstrong et al 1994 hoeg et al 2004 and air sparging rahbeh and mohtar 2007 vanantwerp et al 2008 however in vapor intrusion models it is assumed that equilibrium exists among three phases one recent study considered rate limited mass transfer between gas and liquid phases for modeling vapor intrusion under the condition of aerobic biodegradation chen et al 2016 in addition very few physical experiments have been carried out to observe the non equilibrium phenomena in the column study or the field work because the precise sampling of contaminants in three phases remains problematic cho et al 1993 this study aimed to formulate a one dimensional non equilibrium numerical model with groundwater table fluctuations the concentrations of voc contaminants before and after fluctuation commenced were calculated and compared to show the influence of groundwater table fluctuations on the release of voc contaminants from groundwater to the atmosphere the difference between the equilibrium and non equilibrium models was also calculated and compared for different soil characteristics finally the effects of groundwater table fluctuation amplitude voc type soil type and rainfall events on the release of contaminants from groundwater to the vadose zone and finally to the crawl space of a building were taken into consideration 2 the transport model 2 1 the conceptual model in the process of the groundwater table fluctuations the vertical movement of pore gas and water is dominant therefore a one dimensional vertical direction was considered suitable for describing the physical phenomenon such model was validated by a soil column experiment discussed in section 4 the schematic diagram of the numerical model is shown in fig 1 the position of z 0 was the top of the saturated zone while z l was the ground level a ventilation opening of 1 m was located above ground to simulate the crawl space above the contaminated groundwater assuming continuous contaminant ventilation of the opening the atmospheric pressure fluctuation in the crawl space was ignored in this paper the thickness of the unsaturated zone including the capillary fringe was 5 m and the contaminant concentration at the lower boundary was deemed constant to represent the dnapl contaminated site with semi infinite groundwater contamination source in the simulation process the ventilation opening above the soil surface was simplified as a well mixed container and the non equilibrium mass transfer of contaminants only occurred in the capillary fringe and vadose zone most vapor intrusion models consider that contaminants in the gaseous phase liquid phase and solid phase reach equilibrium in the subsurface environment costanza robinson et al 2013 devaull 2007 luo et al 2015 shen et al 2012b however we hypothesize that the mass transfer process may not reach equilibrium among these three phases and the interfacial mass transfer was considered in this paper the system was assumed isothermal and heat transfer was not considered while certain organic contaminants will biodegrade naturally under aerobic conditions in the vadose zone davis et al 2009 chlorinated vocs typically do not kurt and spain 2013 usepa 2012 and therefore biodegradation was not considered in this study 2 2 governing water and gas movement equations when the groundwater table fluctuates water would move in the pore space which could be described by the

viscosity kg m s when the groundwater table dropped the bottom of the unsaturated zone would transfer to the saturated zone after imbibition therefore eq 1 included the water storativity term which ensured that the richards equation remained valid in the saturated zone where cw h was zero binning 1994 the soil moisture content θw and soil water capacity cw h were both determined by soil

simulated in the process of groundwater table fluctuations and the flux of water advection could be calculated by the following equation 6 q w k h h w z 1 ρ w g k s k rw μ w h w z 1 where k h was the hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated or saturated zones m s since the soil had relatively high permeability the variation of gaseous pressure in the unsaturated zone could be neglected during the fluctuations of groundwater table guo and jiao 2008 therefore the pore gas was assumed incompressible and the continuity equation could be drawn to simulate the gas flow 7 q w z q g z 0 where qg w was the gas water advection flux m s 2 3 governing contaminant transport equations in a porous medium for the vadose zone and capillary fringe the mass balance equations for the transport of contaminants

mass transfer coefficient between the liquid phase and solid phase s 1 kd the water solid distribution coefficient m3 kg ρs the soil particle density kg m3 in eqs 8 and 9 the effective gas and liquid dispersion coefficients should be determined which could be calculated by the following equations bear 1972 millington and quirk 1961 11 d g d g 0 ϕ θ w 10 3 ϕ 2 ξ q g 12 d w d w 0 θ w 10 3 ϕ 2 ξ q w where dg0 w0 the molecular diffusion coefficient of the contaminant in the gas water phase m2 s ξ the longitudinal dispersivity or simply dispersivity m our model considered mechanical dispersion because groundwater table fluctuations would induce advective flow for both water and vapors it should be noted that previous vapor intrusion models at steady state only considered diffusion 3 numerical solution 3 1 model boundary conditions 3 1 1 the boundary conditions for water and gas movement for the water movement model when rainfall events were not considered the top boundary condition could be simplified as a no flux boundary therefore the following equation could be achieved 13 q w z l t ρ w g k s k rw μ w h w z 1 0 h w z x l t 1 0 since the groundwater table would fluctuate at a certain frequency the bottom boundary could be simplified as the given head boundary which could be expressed as follows 14 h w z 0 t h 0 where h0 was the given hydraulic head which was also the height of the groundwater table m when rainfall at the soil surface was simulated the following boundary condition could be drawn to consider the effect of rainfall 15 q w z l t q rain where qrain was the rainfall intensity m s the rainfall event would also cause the groundwater table to rise but this would be counteracted by the flow of groundwater therefore this effect was not considered in the model to compare the contaminant distribution with and without groundwater table fluctuations the groundwater table was kept stable until the distribution of contaminant concentration in three phases reached stability after that it started to fluctuate for 5000 h in order to prevent gas moving across the lower boundary the lower boundary was set at the lowest position during groundwater table fluctuations therefore the height of the groundwater table h0 could be described by the following equation 16 h 0 a t 0 h a a sin 2 π t t 0 h t 5000 h where a the amplitude of groundwater table fluctuation m t the period of groundwater table fluctuation h t time h for the gas flow in the soil since the saturated zone was located below the lower boundary during the process of groundwater table fluctuations there was no gas flow through the lower boundary as described by eq 17 17 q g z 0 t 0 3 1 2 the boundary condition for the contaminant transport model boundary condition of constant concentration was applied for the lower boundary of the liquid phase as described by eq 18 18 c w z 0 t c w 0 where cw0 is the constant concentration in the lower boundary of the model this lower boundary condition could represent some contaminated sites with dnapl which would continue to release contaminants and keep the concentration of groundwater relatively stable since there was no gas at the lower boundary of the model there was no need to define the lower boundary for the contaminant concentration in the gas phase for the top boundary condition of the contaminant transport model the gas volume above the soil surface in the crawl space of a building must be considered we assumed that the contaminant in the gas phase was well mixed in the crawl space and ventilation was simulated as an airflow blowing in without contaminants therefore the following equation could be drawn to calculate the variation of contaminant concentration in the crawl space 19 j top a area q wind c gout v top d c gout dt where jtop the flux of contaminant through the soil surface to the crawl space mg m2 s aarea the cross sectional area of the research field m2 qwind the wind blowing flux across the crawl space m3 s cgout the average contaminant concentration in the crawl space μg l vtop the gas volume of crawl space m3 jtop was mainly caused by the gas diffusion and advection which could be expressed by the following equation 20 j top d gtop c g z z l q gtop c gtop where dgtop the gas dispersion coefficient at the soil surface m2 s qgtop the gas flux from the unsaturated zone to the crawl space m s based on eq 10 the adsorbed concentration at the soil surface was totally determined by the aqueous concentration therefore there was no need to give the boundary conditions for the concentration of the contaminant in the solid phase 3 2 model initial conditions the initial conditions for the simulation had two parts the water distribution profiles and the contaminant distribution profiles at the start of simulation t 0 h the condition for soil water was assumed to be hydrostatic shen et al 2012b assuming no gas and liquid flow occurred before groundwater table fluctuation on the other hand the concentration distribution of contaminant in three phases reached stable at the start of simulation and the released flux from unsaturated zone to the crawl space was constant 3 3 model discretization in this study the finite difference method was applied to solve these equations in the model the total length of the unsaturated zone was 5 m which was discretized into 500 grids with the grid length of 1 cm the lengths of crawl space above soil surface was 1 m fig 1 the time step was 1 h during groundwater table fluctuations in order to catch its movement with the fluctuation period of 12 h when solving eqs 8 and 9 one difficult problem was to discretize the advection term and how to choose the concentration in the upstream and downstream sides properly many mathematical methods have been developed to solve this problem such as the upwind scheme leap frog scheme and lax friedrichs scheme morton and roe 2001 roe 1989 in this paper the upwind scheme was applied to determine the concentration of the contaminant in the advection term as shown in eqs 21 and 22 21 c g w i 1 2 t 1 c g w i t 1 q g w i 1 2 t 1 0 c g w i 1 t 1 q g w i 1 2 t 1 0 22 c g w i 1 2 t 1 c g w i 1 t 1 q g w i 1 2 t 1 0 c g w i t 1 q g w i 1 2 t 1 0 where i was the index number for the grid and i 1 2 and i 1 2 meant the position of the grid surface eqs 21 and 22 illustrates that the concentration at the grid surface was totally determined by the concentration at the upstream grid 3 4 mass transfer coefficients among three phases in the contaminant transport model considering non equilibrium mass transfer the gas water and water solid mass transfer coefficients were two key parameters that determined the equilibrium state among these three phases therefore it was necessary to determine these two parameters based on previous studies when calculating the gas water mass transfer coefficient γgw γgw kgwagw the interfacial sorption coefficient kgw and the gas water interfacial area agw were two key parameters that needed to be determined previous studies found that the superficial velocity had significant influence on the interfacial sorption coefficient kgw and many empirical equations had been developed based on experimental results cho et al 1993 gidda et al 2011 however in the natural environment gas and water phases may or may not be static which was not considered in most equations roberts et al 1985 shulman et al 1955 therefore the following equation was chosen to calculate kgw because it considered both static and non static conditions szatkowski et al 1995 23 sh a 0 023sc a 0 5 0 849re a 0 861 sc a 0 5 where sha liquid side sherwood number dimensionless sca liquid side schmidt number dimensionless rea liquid side reynolds number dimensionless eq 23 ignored the gas side mass transfer resistance because the gas diffusion coefficient was about four orders of magnitude greater than the liquid diffusion coefficient inducing a much higher mass transfer coefficient in the gas side sherwood and holloway 1940 szatkowski et al 1995 therefore the calculated liquid side gas water sorption coefficient by eq 23 was used as the total gas water sorption coefficient kgw the gas water interfacial area was another parameter that controlled γgw peng and brusseau 2005 used gas phase tracer tests to measure the gas water interfacial area and eqs 24 26 were drawn to calculate the gas water interfacial area which were applied in this study 24 a gw 6 1 ϕ d 50 1 β θ w θ m ϕ 1 2 m m 25 β 14 3

brusseau and rao 1991 27 γ ws 3 89 10 5 k d 0 53 1 ϕ ρ s where γws is in the unit of s 1 and kd is in the unit of m3 kg 3 5 the distribution coefficients among the three phases previous research found that the water solid distribution coefficient has a linear relationship with the percentage of soil organic matter kile et al 1995 which could be described by the following equation k d k oc f oc where koc the organic carbon normalized partition coefficient m3 kg foc the organic carbon content of soil dimensionless henry s law controls the distribution of contaminants between gas and water phases which is mainly determined by temperature in this paper the temperature was assumed isothermal at 20 c therefore henry s law constant h was 0 972 for ccl4 according to chen et al 2012 it should be regarded that higher temperatures would lead to a higher henry s law constant which would lead to a larger released flux from groundwater to the vadose zone to the crawl space of a building 3 6 input parameter values 3 6 1 general simulations the general base case scenario input parameter values used are displayed in table 1 the parameters α m n for the van genuchten equation indicated that the soil was mainly formed by medium sand leij et al 1997 the default fluctuation amplitude of groundwater table was 0 05 m which could happen in coast aquifers and some inland area by tidal effect marechal et al 2002 singaraja et al 2018 many parameters in the model are sensitive to temperature especially the henry s law constant chen et al 2012 the parameters in table 1 were used in all simulations unless stated otherwise 3 6 2 voc type four common voc contaminants of concern including ccl4 pce tce and benzene which were selected as target contaminants the basic parameters of these contaminants are listed in table a1 when comparing the different types of voc the organic content of soil foc was all assumed to be 1 the water solid distribution coefficients of different contaminants were calculated by eq 28 and the mass transfer coefficients between liquid and solid were calculated by eq 27 3 6 3 soil types and permeability different types of soil may affect the water distribution in soil which is related to the van genuchten parameters four types of soil were considered which included coarse sand and gravel medium sand silt and clay the representative parameters for these soils were shown in table a2 3 6 4 effects of infiltration when considering infiltration we applied rainfall amounts of 200 mm y and 500 mm y with the rainfall intensity and rainfall times shown in table a3 4 model validation by laboratory experiments in order to check the validity of the model the numerical model was used to interpret the measured released flux from a previous soil column experiment carried out by guo 2015 in that experiment quikrete play sand sieved to 50 mesh size 0 3 mm was placed in a tank with dimensions of 180 cm 60 cm 10 cm the characteristic parameters of the soil the contaminant tce and column are listed in table a4 the flow rate of groundwater was 0 32 l h and the level of groundwater kept increasing until it reached 0 90 m a period of time was delayed before the groundwater table fluctuation after that the groundwater started fluctuation with the help of water level table elevation control during the process of groundwater table fluctuations a 5 l air bag was connected with the contaminant water reservoir to keep the pressure neutral and a relatively constant concentration of dissolved tce in the reservoir was kept during the process of groundwater table fluctuations the tce concentration in the sweep gas was measured and the released flux of tce was calculated during the fluctuations of groundwater table in the numerical model the lower boundary for the liquid contaminant was the constant concentration cw 0 9 mg l and the upper boundary for the gaseous concentration was also the constant concentration cg 0 mg l model validation was carried out with a fluctuation period of about 310 h and a fluctuation amplitude of about 30 cm it could be observed that the simulated flux had similar variation trends with the measured flux fig 2 a the flux increased with the decrease of groundwater table while it decreased with the increase of groundwater table when the groundwater table dropped the top part of the saturated zone would transfer to the capillary fringe and unsaturated zone because this part had a relatively high tce concentration the gaseous concentration of tce in this part would become very high the flux would increase due to gas dispersion during the drainage process however a small delay existed between the measured and simulated flux and the simulated flux would drop more slowly than the measured flux this may be caused by an underestimation of the gaseous dispersion coefficient in the tank experiment the gas and water movement was not ideal one dimensional and there may be gas and water horizontal movement both in the saturated zone and capillary fringe silliman et al 2002 which could lead to a transverse dispersivity to consider the effect of horizontal gas movement the following equation was drawn to modify gas dispersion coefficient 29 d g a d g 0 θ g 10 3 ϕ 2 ξ q g where a was the enhancement factor that represented the effect of horizontal flow on the gas dispersion coefficient in this experiment a was chosen as 2 5 and the model validation result is shown in fig 2b it could be observed that the revised model could better simulate the variation of gaseous flux from the soil to the atmosphere in the real environment the gas dispersion coefficient may also be increased due to the horizontal gas movement which should be taken into consideration in future research 5 results and discussion 5 1 contaminant concentration distribution in the vadose zone before the fluctuation of groundwater table commenced the soil moisture content decreased significantly from the capillary fringe to the top of the unsaturated zone fig 3 b the length of capillary fringe hc could be calculated by the following equation dexter and bird 2001 30 h c 1 α 1 m 1 m according to eq 30 the length of the capillary fringe was calculated to be 0 34 m which was relatively short due to the texture of medium sand on the other hand before the fluctuation of the groundwater table the concentration at the top of the capillary fringe was only 0 65 of the equilibrated gaseous ccl4 concentration at the groundwater table fig 3a the sharp reduction of contaminant concentration through the capillary fringe indicated that the capillary fringe could block the transport of volatile organic contaminants from the groundwater table to the unsaturated zone which was shown by some other studies mccarthy and johnson 1993 shen et al 2013b the blocking effect of the capillary fringe was caused by the variation of moisture content from the capillary fringe to the unsaturated zone fig 3b which resulted in a significant decrease of the total effective diffusion coefficient and correspondingly a high concentration gradient according to the conservation of mass however the blocking effect was less significant in silt or clay because these aquifer materials have a less significant change of moisture content with distance through the capillary fringe shen et al 2013b after the groundwater table started fluctuating the gaseous concentration of ccl4 in the unsaturated zone increased significantly as the blocking effect by the capillary fringe became less significant fig 3a the concentration at the top of capillary fringe 0 34 m above the initial groundwater table increased from 0 029 mg l to 0 29 mg l at 600 h and finally reached 0 59 mg l at 5000 h after fluctuations thus increasing the contaminant concentration in the unsaturated zone the flux increase during groundwater table fluctuations was mainly caused by a relatively significant variation in soil moisture content in the capillary fringe fig 3b which caused an enhanced dispersive flux section 5 2 since the gas water interfacial area agw was strongly correlated with the soil moisture content it could be observed that the gas water mass transfer coefficient γgw decreased from the top to the bottom of the unsaturated zone fig 3c the range of γgw was from 1 8 10 4 s 1 to 2 3 10 3 s 1 which was in the same order of magnitude with the water solid mass transfer coefficient γws 1 3 10 3 s 1 in this study this simulation result indicated that the fluctuations of groundwater table would weaken the blocking effect for the reduction of contaminant concentration from groundwater to the unsaturated zone the released flux of ccl4 from the unsaturated zone to the atmosphere was 5 3 10 9 g m2 s before groundwater table fluctuation however it gradually increased to about 9 3 10 8 g m2 s after fluctuations for 5000 h which is more than one order of magnitude greater fig 4 a the significant increase in flux to the atmosphere indicates that groundwater table fluctuations in sandy soil aquifers would greatly enhance the release of vocs from groundwater to the atmosphere thus greatly enhancing the potential health risk for humans the enhancement of voc emission rate by groundwater table fluctuation was previously observed by guo et al 2019 who performed field experiments and found that the tce emission rate increased from 4 μg m2 d to 8 μg m2 d when the groundwater table fluctuation amplitude increased from 1 5 cm to 10 cm illangasekare et al 2014 also performed soil tank experiments and found that the tce airflow concentration increased in both water drainage and imbibition processes which also indicates the enhancement effect of groundwater table fluctuations on voc flux from groundwater the flux of ccl4 to the atmosphere did not change significantly at the start of groundwater table fluctuations it increased gradually at 500 h after fluctuations started fig 4a because the higher concentration caused by groundwater table fluctuations needed time to transport from the bottom of the unsaturated zone to the top as shown in fig 3a the gaseous concentrations had increased significantly at the bottom of the unsaturated zone at 600 h while it had not change significantly at the top of the unsaturated zone the gaseous concentration at the top of unsaturated zone gradually increased when the fluctuations kept for 2400 h which shows that much time is needed to increase the gaseous concentration at the top of the unsaturated zone as well as the released flux on the other hand the fluctuation amplitude of released flux increased with the continuous fluctuations after groundwater table fluctuations for 5000 h the amplitude of released flux was 8 4 10 9 g m2 s which was 9 1 of the average flux fig 4b a phase difference of π 6 could be observed between the variation of released flux and the variation of groundwater table the phase difference indicates that the peak of contaminant concentration in the soil and the released flux to the atmosphere happens when the groundwater table was approaching the highest position it also indicates that the variation of released vocs to the atmosphere is both determined by the groundwater table position and its variation rate however some experimental results have indicated that the released flux out from the unsaturated zone increases dramatically when the groundwater table suddenly dropped guo 2015 illangasekare et al 2014 mccarthy and johnson 1993 werner and hohener 2002 this was mainly caused by the decreased water content in the capillary fringe and top of saturated zone which increased the exposure of gas phase with water phase with high contaminant concentration the contaminant in gas and water phases quickly reached equilibrium resulting in elevated soil gas concentration some enclosed contaminant in air bubbles released to the atmosphere during the drainage process may also increase the released flux 5 2 the variation of gaseous concentration caused by different mechanisms the variation of gaseous concentration caused by different mechanisms at 2 5 m below the soil surface were calculated and compared to determine the main factors that affect voc flux during groundwater table fluctuations fig 5 this depth was selected because it was in the middle of unsaturated zone which is representative for the variation of contaminant concentration at different depths it could be observed that the variation of gaseous concentration caused by dispersion gradually increased from 3 2 10 9 mg l s to 5 4 10 9 mg l s when time increased from 250 h to 300 h which was the main mechanism for the increase of contaminant concentration from groundwater to the atmosphere the increase of gaseous concentration by dispersion was mainly caused by two factors 1 the fluctuations of groundwater table increased the flowing flux of gas and water in the unsaturated zone which would significantly increase the mechanical dispersion of contaminant in both gas and water 2 when groundwater table dropped gas entered the position which was originally water and the mass transfer from water to gas created a large gaseous concentration in this position the large contaminant concentration in the bottom of unsaturated zone caused a larger concentration gradient which finally caused an enhanced dispersive flux because the unsaturated zone above the capillary fringe had a larger effective dispersion coefficient compared with the capillary fringe a larger gaseous concentration in the unsaturated zone would facilitate dispersion due to fick s law this mechanism is revealed by fig a1 which shows that the ccl4 flux to the soil surface would also increase significantly after groundwater table fluctuations without considering mechanical dispersion the mechanical dispersion of contaminant was strongly correlated with the longitudinal dispersivity ξ sensitivity analysis of the longitudinal dispersivity showed that larger ξ would create higher vocs flux to the atmosphere while ignoring the mechanical dispersion would underestimate the vocs flux released from the groundwater fig a1 on the other hand the comparison of the dispersion coefficient caused by diffusion and mechanical dispersion shows that the dispersion in the gas phase was mainly controlled by diffusion fig a1a the dispersion in the liquid phase was controlled by diffusion in most parts of unsaturated zone while near the capillary fringe it was mainly controlled by mechanical dispersion fig a2b this comparison indicates that the mechanical dispersion in the liquid phase near the capillary fringe caused the difference in different dispersivity that was shown in fig a1 the mass transfer of contaminants among the three phases plays a negative role on the increase of contaminant flux to the atmosphere fig 5 which was described as a retardation factor in previous studies brusseau et al 1997 costanza robinson et al 2013 kim et al 2005 on the other hand the advective flux would only cause sinusoidal fluctuations of flux in the soil and above the soil surface though the transient advective flux could be greater than the diffusive flux the net contribution of the advective flux was much smaller than the diffusive flux you and zhan 2013 developed an equilibrium model and found a similar result they also concluded that the advective flux contributed comparably with the diffusive flux only when the gas filled porosity was less than 0 05 5 3 comparison between equilibrium and non equilibrium model the degree of equilibrium between gas and liquid phases dg l was defined by the following equation 31 d g l c w h c g the degree of equilibrium between water and solid phases dl s was defined by the following equation 32 d l s x s k d c w the calculated degree of equilibrium between gas and liquid dg l was very close to 1 at all depths in the unsaturated zone which indicated that the contaminant almost reached equilibrium in most parts of the unsaturated zone fig 6 a among three depths of 0 005 m 2 500 m and 4 875 m dg l varied most significantly at depth of 0 005 m when the groundwater table moved upwards across the center position dg l reached its minimum of 0 995 at depth of 0 005 m indicating that the contaminant was transferring from gas to liquid when the groundwater table moved downwards across the center position dg l reached its maximum of 1 005 which indicated that vocs was transferring from liquid to gas similar with dg l dl s was also very close to 1 at all depth of unsaturated zone which indicated that the contaminant between liquid and solid phases was almost in equilibrium in all parts of the unsaturated zone the maximal variation of dl s happened near the soil surface which was between 0 991 and 1 008 at depth of 0 005 m fig 6b when the groundwater table rose the pore water with high contaminant concentration flowed upwards which caused a higher concentration in the water phase this process would induce the vocs to transfer from liquid to solid therefore dl s decreased with the rise of the groundwater table and vice versa as shown in fig 6b from fig 6a and b it can be concluded that slight non equilibrium mass transfer would occur between gas and water phases and between water and solid phases however this non equilibrium phenomenon mainly occurs at a short distance above the groundwater table as well as the position below the soil surface beyond these regions the contaminant was almost in equilibrium among three phases however in this paper the gas water mass transfer coefficient and water solid mass transfer coefficient were both determined by previous experiments brusseau and rao 1991 peng and brusseau 2005 szatkowski et al 1995 which will vary depending on different contaminants and different soil textures as these two mass transfer coefficients were the key parameters controlling the non equilibrium mass transfer of vocs in the unsaturated zone more research is needed to carefully quantify these two mass transfer coefficients for different contaminants and different soil characteristics for soils composed with medium sand the difference in voc flux between equilibrium and non equilibrium models was relatively small fig a3 for example for fine sand with organic content of 1 the difference of released flux when the fluctuations kept for 5000 h by equilibrium model was about 4 5 lower than that of the non equilibrium model sensitivity analysis of gas water mass transfer coefficient γgw showed that the released flux would not change significantly if γgw decreased to 1 of the original value while the released flux had a decrease of 33 3 when γgw decreased to 0 1 of the original value fig a4 this result shows that the mass transfer process between gas and liquid would not influence the released flux until it was three orders of magnitude lower than the calculated value on the other hand lower water solid mass transfer coefficients γws lead to quicker increases in flux levels during groundwater table fluctuations fig a5 which shows that γws was more sensitive than γgw in a sandy aquifer the comparison of equilibrium and non equilibrium models was also carried out in soils composed with silt and clay for which it was found that equilibrium was also almost fully reached however a non marginal difference between equilibrium and non equilibrium models were discovered in the case of coarse sand results showed that in coarse sand the released flux calculated by a non equilibrium model was lower than that of the equilibrium model fig 7 a at 5000 h the average released flux of ccl4 to the atmosphere calculated by non equilibrium model was 2 7 10 7 g m2 s which was 18 lower than that calculated by the equilibrium model this finding indicates that the traditional equilibrium model might somewhat overestimate the potential human health risk under this condition during 4950 h to 5000 h without rainfall the released flux calculated by equilibrium model could reach 2 8 10 7 g m2 s to 3 5 10 7 g m2 s while the released flux was only 2 1 10 7 g m2 s to 3 3 10 7 g m2 s for the non equilibrium model fig 7b though the average flux of the non equilibrium model was smaller than that calculated by equilibrium model the fluctuation amplitude of the non equilibrium model was larger the discrepancy in coarse sand was mainly caused by a relatively smaller gas water interfacial area for coarse sand which reduces the gas water mass transfer coefficient in the capillary fringe 5 4 the effect of different parameters on the released flux 5 4 1 groundwater table fluctuation amplitude previous studies have shown that groundwater fluctuation amplitudes can be as much as 1 5 10 cm especially in areas near the coast guo et al 2019 marechal et al 2002 singaraja et al 2018 the numerical model showed that the fluctuation amplitude of the groundwater table had strong effect on the released flux of vocs to the atmosphere fig 8 when the fluctuation amplitude was 0 05 m the average released flux increased to 9 28 10 8 g m2 s at 5000 h after fluctuations while it significantly decreased to 5 35 10 8 g m2 s when the fluctuation amplitude decreased to 0 02 m the simulation result indicated that larger fluctuation amplitude would induce larger fluxes though the fluctuation amplitude of flux became larger the average released flux remained relatively close for the groundwater table fluctuation amplitude of 0 05 m and 0 10 m fig 8b because the soil moisture content would not respond to the variation of groundwater table due to a hysteresis effect the released flux to the atmosphere does not always increase with the increase of fluctuation amplitude therefore careful estimation should be made to identify the potential risk for groundwater table fluctuations at different fluctuation amplitudes 5 4 2 different voc contaminants the effects of groundwater fluctuations on the flux of four different voc types was examined using ccl4 pce tce and benzene as target contaminants section 3 6 2 the gas and liquid molecular diffusion coefficients of all four contaminants are similar so their influences were limited however the henry s law constant and the water solid distribution coefficient varied significantly among different contaminants table a1 it was found that the average ccl4 flux as well as its fluctuation amplitude was much larger than that of pce tce and benzene after groundwater table fluctuations commenced fig 9 this was mainly caused by the larger henry s law constant of ccl4 as well as its small sorption capacity on soil although pce has the second largest henry s law constant the water solid distribution coefficient of pce is much larger than the other three contaminants which caused a larger reduced flux by adsorption on soil surface it could be concluded that contaminant with larger henry s law constant and smaller sorption capacity on soil would have greater released flux after groundwater table fluctuations it should be considered that some contaminants may biodegrade whereas other will not however this aspect was not considered in the present study 5 4 3 different soil types and permeability the numerical model showed that groundwater table fluctuations increased the release of ccl4 to the atmosphere most significantly in soils composed with coarse sand and gravel fig 10 a for which the flux increased from 7 08 10 9 g m2 s to 2 70 10 7 g m2 s after fluctuations for 5000 h for medium sand the flux increased from 5 27 10 9 g m2 s to 9 28 10 8 g m2 s after fluctuations for 5000 h it could be deduced that groundwater table fluctuations had higher impact on the increase of released flux for coarse sand and gravel than medium sand however for silt and clay groundwater table fluctuations did not enhance the release of vocs from groundwater to the atmosphere and the released flux of vocs remained nearly constant before and after groundwater table fluctuations fig 10b this phenomenon is related with the distribution of soil moisture content in coarse sand and medium sand the soil moisture content changed significantly in the capillary fringe and the fluctuations of groundwater table would cause a significant variation of soil moisture content at the bottom of unsaturated zone fig 3b the drop of groundwater table would create a zone with high contaminant concentration in the gas phase which would gradually cause a higher gaseous concentration in the unsaturated zone by dispersion and advection as fluctuations proceeded however in silt and clay the variation of soil moisture content during groundwater table fluctuations was insignificant fig a6 5 4 4 effects of infiltration when rainfall events were introduced during the process of groundwater table fluctuations the released flux to the atmosphere significantly decreased fig a7a during the rainfall events the increase of soil moisture content at the top of unsaturated zone blocks the dispersion of contaminants in the gas phase from the unsaturated zone to the atmosphere which causes a sudden drop of released flux shen et al 2012b however after the rainfall ceases the flux quite quickly recovers to the level before rainfall with increased number of rainfall events the flux drop would naturally become more frequent fig a7b the released flux was quite close for rainfall intensity of 200 mm year and 500 mm year after groundwater table fluctuations for 5000 h it can be concluded that the influence of rainfall was quite temporary and could not affect the released flux after the rain stopped for about 100 h 5 4 5 the multiplying number of released flux by the regression model as mentioned in the sections 5 4 1 5 4 3 many parameters affect voc flux during groundwater table fluctuation the key parameters that were determined are the soil permeability i e soil type groundwater table fluctuation amplitude henry s law constant and the organic carbon normalized partition coefficient contaminant characteristics therefore these four parameters were used as known parameters to predict the multiplying number for released flux n after 5000 h of groundwater table fluctuation the following equation was obtained by the multi parameter regression model to predict the multiplying number n 33 n 124 9477 12 0162 lg k s 16 5821 h 50 1644 k oc 231 8718 a the p value of the regression model is 0 0020 0 05 which indicates that it effectively predicts n with small error 6 conclusions and limitations this study developed a numerical model to study the effect of groundwater table fluctuations on the transport of vocs from groundwater to the atmosphere in a sandy aquifer in this numerical model the mass transfer processes between gas and liquid phases and between liquid and solid phases were considered the model was validated by the groundwater table fluctuation experiment by guo 2015 and results showed that the numerical model could simulate the variation trend of released flux during groundwater table fluctuations well however enhanced gas dispersion was found during the experiment which might be caused by the horizontal gas movement in the tank in a sandy aquifer when vocs transported from the contaminated groundwater to the atmosphere without the fluctuation of groundwater table its concentration decreased by more than two order of magnitude from the bottom to the top of the capillary fringe due to the slow diffusion rate in the pore water however groundwater table fluctuations eliminate this blocking effect and greatly enhance voc flux to the atmosphere therefore significantly increasing the potential health risk for human this enhancement of contaminant emission was mainly caused by enhanced dispersion while the mass transfer among three phases would weaken this effect the dispersion in the gas phase was mainly controlled by diffusion while the mechanical dispersion was dominant near the capillary fringe in the liquid phase in the sandy aquifer equilibrium among three phases was almost reached in the unsaturated zone during the groundwater table fluctuations in coarse sand a reduced interfacial area between gas phase and liquid phase leads to a relatively small mass transfer coefficient which causes a non marginal overestimation of the released flux by the equilibrium models further research is needed to carefully determine the mass transfer coefficient among three phases for different contaminants under different conditions e g changes in barometric pressure or the amount of soil organic matter present the released flux increased significantly when the fluctuation amplitude increased from 0 02 m to 0 05 m however a hysteresis effect in soil moisture content limits the increase in voc flux with larger fluctuation amplitudes vocs with higher henry s law constants and lower water solid distribution coefficients will have greater flux levels during groundwater table fluctuations groundwater table fluctuations greatly enhance the released flux of vocs in coarse sand and medium sand however they hardly increase the released flux in silt or clay because the soil moisture content changes little during groundwater table fluctuations rainfall events cause a sudden drop in released flux while its effect is temporal and does not greatly affect the overall increase of released flux during groundwater table fluctuations finally a regression equation was carried out to predict the variation of released flux with groundwater table fluctuation it should be noted that in the present study the soil unsaturated zone was all composed with materials with no soil horizons layers or soil heterogeneity which is unrepresentative of natural soil moreover the adsorption processes solid liquid gas liquid were assumed to be linear and the mixing of salt water and fresh water near the coast the atmospheric pressure fluctuations the preferential flow path the biodegradation effect and some other factors were not considered in this paper these limitation factors could be investigated in further studies based on this model the numerical model presented in this paper is the first step toward improved estimation of vapor intrusion risk

5998,with the onset of climate change regions relied upon for water supply are increasingly subject to end member fluctuations between periods of severe drought followed by extreme precipitation the impacts of these extreme conditions on watershed hydrodynamics in water resource sensitive regions such as california are unknown despite their great importance for resilience and water management purposes understanding these impacts requires high resolution physically based models to capture sharp variations of topography land use wetting fronts etc an integrated hydrologic model was used in a high performance computing framework to study the complex nonlinear dynamics occurring at a representative californian watershed the cosumnes watershed one of the last major rivers in california without a dam offers a rare opportunity to isolate the effects of water management from climate extremes here we show model validation with comparisons between model outputs and local measurements in addition to various satellite based products including 1 snow water equivalent swe with snow data assimilation system snodas and a reconstruction method by bair and co authors 2 soil moisture with soil moisture active passive smap and 3 evapotranspiration et with mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric to assess changes in hydrodynamic behavior during climate extremes and their transitions a simulation spanning a recent drought followed by the highest precipitation year on record 2015 2017 is discussed from these simulations we are able to highlight regions that are the most sensitive to climate extremes which depend on many factors including hydrologic connectivity geology and topography these analyses provide a better understanding of the physical phenomena occurring in the watershed strengthening our knowledge of how the system may respond to extreme conditions which might become the new normal keywords climate extremes high performance computing integrated hydrologic model watershed dynamics remote sensing water management 1 introduction in california as in other parts of the world the effects of climate change have recently been observed as fluctuations between end member climate conditions such as periods of droughts cook et al 2004 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 followed by extreme precipitation events mainly caused by atmospheric rivers dettinger 2011 2013 dettinger et al 2004a ralph et al 2006 ralph and dettinger 2011 oscillations between severe droughts and atmospheric rivers are expected to intensify as a consequence of anthropogenic induced climate warming cloern et al 2011 seager et al 2007 for example swain et al s projections show that the twenty first century emissions will yield a 25 to 100 increase in extreme dry to wet transitions 2018 however the subsequent impacts on watershed hydrology including groundwater recharge evapotranspiration et and river discharge are largely unknown and under studied despite the myriad of climate change studies performed in california brekke et al 2004 dettinger 2011 dettinger et al 2004b maurer and duffy 2005 vicuna and dracup 2007 young et al 2009 our perspective of water management issues today could dramatically change as these conditions will become the new normal in the future where understanding their effects on watershed hydrodynamics will become crucial for water management planning assessing the impact of climate change on water resources requires a better understanding of how the integrated hydrologic cycle responds to perturbations across scales including from deep aquifers through the lower atmosphere ferguson and maxwell 2010 goderniaux et al 2009 jones et al 2008 because several hydrological processes occur simultaneously in a watershed e g groundwater surface water interactions and feedbacks between water and energy fluxes near the land surface accurate budgeting of these hydrological conditions requires physically based numerical models consisting of highly nonlinear equations e g richards and kinematic diffusive wave equations to correctly project into a no analog future where empirical expressions are insufficient tools for prediction due to the nonlinearities of these processes and the associated equations used to describe them these models are computationally expensive often limiting them to coarse spatiotemporal resolutions and hampering their applicability on the real world water management applications however overly coarse resolution models are often incapable of simulating complex topography or sharp wetting fronts which are important when assessing extremes events in this work we use high performance computing hpc and the parallel hydrologic model parflow clm kollet and maxwell 2006 maxwell 2013 maxwell and miller 2005 to simulate and better understand the nonlinear dynamics of a representative californian watershed the cosumnes watershed is one of the last major rivers in california without a dam allowing us to study natural flow conditions by essentially isolating the impacts of climate change from large scale water management the watershed spans the central valley sierra nevada interface a landscape typical of many hydrologically connected yet mixed land use areas across the state i e including urban agriculture and naturally forested areas the central valley is the most productive agricultural region in the united states and among the highest in the world water in this region relies on seasonal snowmelt from the sierra nevada mountains which provides up to approximately 70 of the water storage in the state dettinger and anderson 2015 depending on the year as a result the hydrologic connection between california s central valley and the sierra nevada is important nevertheless previous hydrologic models have mainly focused on modeling the isolated water storage in the central valley neglecting the contribution of the sierra nevada mountains to the central valley hydrodynamics california department of water resources 2018a faunt and geological survey u s 2009 finally the resolution of the model used here 200 m horizontal sub meter to tens of meters vertically is in agreement with regional decision making scales which is unlike previous works that have been relied on coarse resolution models california department of water resources 2018a b faunt and geological survey u s 2009 gilbert et al 2017 gilbert and maxwell 2017 we first demonstrate the model s validation with both local measurements and remote sensing platforms then to assess watershed dynamics during the climate extremes and their transitions a recent historic period of end member water years is simulated results from water years 2015 2017 a period which includes the most severe drought in the last 1200 years griffin and anchukaitis 2014 followed by the wettest year on california record di liberto 2017 scripps institution of oceanography 2017 are discussed to understand system response and dynamics during these extreme periods of water variability we utilize a complex three dimensional hydrological model which includes all components of the water cycle in the critical zone from bedrock to canopy as described in section ii the simulated cosumnes watershed provides a complete picture of the hydrological components occurring at the regional watershed to basin scale including snow accumulation and snowmelt surface runoff groundwater infiltration and also the exchange between the surface water the vadose zone and aquifers our work aims to understand the fundamental behavior of the watershed in response to the extreme changes in climatic conditions and address the following questions how does the transition from extreme dry to wet water years affect groundwater and river storages is a wet water year sufficient to negate the effects of the previous dry year how do hydrologic processes such as et evolve during these end member years which areas within a watershed are most sensitive to climate extremes we assess both the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater and surface water levels as well as et snow water equivalent and soil moisture throughout the modeled region before during and after the dry wet year transition because many parts of california heavily rely on groundwater resources during periods of drought understanding water resources dynamics at these interfaces in i time and ii across the sierra nevada central valley boundary will provide insights into water management issues related to land subsidence degraded water quality and increased electricity costs of pumping due to the intensive groundwater over drafting di liberto 2017 famiglietti et al 2011 faunt and sneed 2015 howitt et al 2015 miro et al 2018 the recent 2012 2015 california drought has also reiterated the need to identify new methods to quantify water storage in mountain snowpack hedrick et al 2018 our methodology provides a scientific basis for stakeholders to better understand how california watersheds inclusive of groundwater aquifers might respond to climate extremes and climate variability descriptions of the simulated site are explained in section 2 followed by the datasets and methods used to construct and validate the model in section 3 finally in section 4 we discuss the results and the next steps of this work 2 site description the cosumnes watershed is located in northern california east of sacramento and southwest of lake tahoe see fig 1 a in all but the upper watershed the basin is bounded by the american and mokelumne rivers and is approximately 7000 km2 fig 1a also illustrates the substantial change in elevation across the model which varies from approximately 2000 m in the upper part and reaches the sea level in the central valley fig 1b depicts the land cover of the cosumnes watershed the blue lines indicate the main branches of the cosumnes river and its associated tributaries as shown in fig 1c the sierra nevada mountains are mainly composed of plutonic rocks granite and an intrusion of volcanic rocks basalt and gabbro at the intersection with the central valley which represents an alluvial aquifer sand and clay materials precipitation varies significantly within the study area the sierra nevada mountains receive up to 1500 mm of precipitation per year usually in form of snow whereas rainfall in the central valley is approximately 660 mm per year on average as calculated by nldas 2 forcing cosgrove et al 2003 due to the topography the geological composition of the sierra nevada mountains and the limited rainfall in the central valley water in the alluvial aquifer is mainly a result of snowmelt therefore a better understanding of the dynamics of the central valley aquifers involves joint modeling of the sierra nevada mountains block and central valley aquifers 3 methodology the integrated hydrologic model parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 maxwell 2013 maxwell and miller 2005 coupled to the community land model clm dai et al 2003 is used to solve the water energy balance from the bedrock to the lower atmosphere maxwell and miller 2005 parflow solves three dimensional variably saturated flow with the richards equation richards 1931 to describe flow in both vadose zone and saturated groundwater using a cell centered finite difference scheme the interdependence of hydrodynamic variables in the variably saturated zone is described by the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 while the nonlinearities are addressed with a newton krylovscheme jones and woodward 2001 two dimensional surface water is solved via the kinematic wave equation at the land surface kollet and maxwell 2006 the model is coupled with clm to describe the interactions between the land surface and the lower atmosphere clm computes feedbacks between water and energy fluxes near the land surface including actual evaporation transpiration snow dynamics and infiltration details on the coupling technique used to pair parflow and clm are described in the work of maxwell and miller 2005 3 1 model development the simulated model is horizontally discretized at a 200 m spatial resolution 8 layers comprise the groundwater model which follows the terrain at a thickness of 80 m with a variable vertical resolution ranging from 10 cm to 30 m see table 1 the thickness of the model is sufficient to capture groundwater variations observed in the central valley which predominantly vary between 25 and 50 m below the land surface in total the model is comprised of 1 3 million active cells land surface elevations were obtained from the usgs at 10 m resolution and up scaled to be consistent with the resolution of the model see fig 1a for elevation distribution slopes are processed with a watershed routing algorithm available through the gis platform grass boundary conditions are delineated by topographic boundaries and neighboring rivers see fig 1b the upper part of the watershed consists of a no flow neumann boundary condition segments of dirichlet boundary conditions are set along the american and mokelumne rivers we define a set of patches denoted by varying colors in fig 1b for which the river stages are imposed as constant values at weekly time intervals values for rivers stages indicated by stars in fig 1b were obtained from usgs and dwr river gauges usgs 2018 and california data exchange center 2018 while further delineations could be made to better characterize fluctuations of the river boundary conditions sensitivity analysis revealed the delineations shown in fig 1b are sufficient to capture the boundary dynamics through space and time as shown in fig 1c subsurface geology is defined based on usgs surficial geologic maps geologic map of california 2015 jennings et al 1977 for each type of geological formation we assigned representative values see table 1 based on a literature review of the following parameters permeability specific storage porosity van genuchten α n faunt et al 2010 faunt and geological survey u s 2009 flint et al 2013 gilbert and maxwell 2017 welch and allen 2014 areas of urban land cover are assigned a low effective permeability while soil layers first 2 m of the model have a higher permeability land cover is defined by the 2011 nlcd dataset homer et al 2015 and was updated to further refine areas of agriculture that are of interest to our simulations specifically alfalfa grape and pasture crops were delineated by the 2010 usda s cropland database boryan et al 2011 and superimposed onto the nlcd map land and vegetation parameters are defined by the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp database igbp 2018 and further refined to account for specific crop characteristics based on differences in leaf area index lai height and reflectance the main crops within the watershed are alfalfa pasture and grape vineyards we derived the properties of alfalfa leaf area index height values see table 1 from the studies of evett et al 2000 orloff 1995 and robison et al 1969 grape properties were obtained from johnson and pierce 2004 vanino et al 2015 pasture properties were obtained from buermann et al 2002 king et al 1986 rahman and lamb 2017 surface roughness is parameterized via manning coefficients chow 2009 as defined in table 1 we performed a simulation spanning five years where the first two years correspond to the spin up period and the last three correspond to this study s period of interest where a dry to wet transition was observed for all simulations during these five years an hourly time step is used the initial condition of the spin up is a pressure distribution obtained by performing a kriging of available groundwater table levels from the usgs database 16 piezometers within the domain provide groundwater table distributions for model construction and validation however because water table values are sparse in time mainly measured between 2005 and 2012 we perform one time spatial kriging to obtain a map of the initial pressure field at the beginning of the spin up period steady state simulations were then performed representative of precipitation minus evapotranspiration average climate forcing over the model to allow water to move along topographic gradients not represented in the kriging step of the spin up we then use the spatial distribution of pressure obtained at the end of the steady state simulation as the initial conditions of the transient 5 year simulation as described above due to the inherent uncertainties of the initial conditions we discarded the first two years of the simulation as a spin up appendix a shows the temporal variations of groundwater and surface water storages as well as pressure heads for these two years the results discussed hereafter only consider the last three years of the simulation the meteorological forcing required by clm includes precipitation temperature east to west and north to south wind speed long and short wave solar radiation air pressure and relative humidity we use phase 2 of the north america land data assimilation system nldas 2 forcing cosgrove et al 2003 dataset to describe the spatiotemporal variation of the meteorological conditions nldas 2 forcing provides hourly atmospheric variables with an approximate resolution of 14 km fig 2 depicts the temporal variation of precipitation and temperature during the three selected water years from october 2014 through september 2017 during this study period the yearly average temperature in the cosumnes watershed is 14 16 c the warmest year is 2015 and the coolest year is 2017 the monthly variations of temperature during these years shown in fig 2c indicate that the variability of temperature is mainly during the winter from november march compared to previous years only the 2017 winter months were colder with average temperature reaching 0 c whereas the summer temperatures remained very similar for these three years with temperatures varying between 25 and 30 c contrary to the average yearly temperature which decreased from 2015 to 2017 the average yearly precipitation increased from 2015 to 2017 the average yearly precipitation of the water year 2017 is approximately 4 mm d almost 2 3 times greater than the average precipitation in water years 2016 and 2015 respectively similar to the trends observed for temperature the monthly variation of precipitation fig 2d shows that these differences are mainly during the winter period regardless of the year or winter conditions the summer in the cosumnes remains hot and with a very limited almost non existent amount of precipitation this trend is typical of many watersheds across the state of california as stated previously the central valley is a highly agricultural area subject to irrigation and pumping to the best of our knowledge there is not an accurate pumping and irrigation dataset available to populate model fluxes in the central valley we therefore approximate these values via an estimation technique that accounts for land use as defined by each county we use cropland data derived from the aforementioned usda cropland map to describe the spatial distribution of crops within the area based on this cropland map we then use an estimation of applied water defined as the amount of water required by a crop to grow optimally via crop and county specific irrigation values as dictated from a dwr database california department of water resources 2010 the total estimated amount of irrigation which is considered as rainfall in the model represents 35 to 75 of precipitation depending on the water year groundwater pumping rates are derived using the calculated quantity of applied water it is assumed that the irrigated water is derived from either a groundwater aquifers or b surface water diversions if the cropland is adjacent to a river cell fractions between groundwater pumping and river diversions have been determined using dwr and usgs database and were used to delineate their proportions groundwater pumping wells locations are approximate and assigned by utilizing an average land parcel size specific to this region equal to 1500 m which acts as an approximate e g through cell centering pumping location in doing so we approximate the distribution of the pumping across the modeled region furthermore we have defined two types of pumping industrial and agricultural which affect the magnitude and duration of extraction in the model we have assumed that the pumping rate for industrial purposes is constant with time while agricultural wells are only active from the beginning of april to the end of november a period determined based on discussions with stakeholders and trends in meteorological data the latter indicates that during this period rainfall is almost non existent therefore irrigation is necessary to meet the water needs of this agricultural area the above procedure ensures closure of the water balance where calculated agricultural and industrial water demands are extracted from either groundwater or surface water sources and re introduced as applied water over irrigated croplands 3 2 comparisons with satellites based products and measurements hydrologic models require many parameters and their spatial distributions all of which are associated with uncertainties that stem from an incomplete knowledge of the system although the hydrologic model used in this study is highly resolved in both time and space parameter values are assigned based on existing datasets and literature values as discussed in the previous paragraphs therefore model calibration which is usually performed by comparing model outputs with measurements e g hydraulic head water levels in rivers or discharge is required while the cosumnes watershed provides an opportunity to study the semi natural stream dynamics occurring at watershed scales this region is typical of many other watersheds across the state in that the measurements for calibration are sparse see in appendix b for a description of the available data publicly available datasets on groundwater and surface water levels are insufficient to correctly describe the strong heterogeneities of the cosumnes watershed through inverse modeling or calibration procedures this is in agreement with the california department of water resources dwr which states that the lack of information is the main limitation when analyzing and accurately quantifying groundwater resources during the water management process we therefore use satellite based data in addition to the few local measurements with good temporal characterization to validate the model although only typically available at large spatial resolutions typically several kilometers these products provide useful information about different components of the hydrologic cycle because the model simulates coupled processes occurring near the surface and in the subsurface we identified three components of the hydrologic cycle impacted by groundwater surface water and land energy processes snowpack evaporation soil moisture 3 2 1 local measurements of surface and groundwater pressures we selected three river gauges the only ones in the area to the best of our knowledge with continuous measurements and four piezometers recording groundwater levels at bimonthly and biweekly time steps to perform comparisons with simulated results fig 1c shows the location of the selected measurement points we note that subsurface monitoring of available data only exists in the central valley region of the model while river gauges observations are located in both the sierra nevada mountains and the central valley comparisons with groundwater and surface water measurements allow us to assess the ability of the model to reproduce subsurface and surface hydrodynamics simulated by parflow 3 2 2 remote sensing products for the land surface processes computed by clm we rely on remote sensing based products as in situ measurements of land surface fluxes are less continuous in time some of these measurements such as et can also be highly uncertain fisher et al 2017 despite advancements in flux tower technologies for example making remote sensing products a good alternative for model comparisons 3 2 2 1 snow water equivalent snow data assimilation system snodas and bair et al 2016 reconstruction the national weather service s snow data assimilation snodas national operational hydrologic remote sensing center 2004 integrates snow data from satellite airborne platforms and ground stations snodas also includes procedures to ingest and downscale output from the numerical weather prediction nwp models and to simulate snow cover using a physically based spatially distributed energy and mass balance snow model the database provides a daily gridded estimate of snow depth swe and related snow parameters at a 1 km resolution within the continental united states the accuracy of snodas data has been assessed in many studies anderson 2011 bair et al 2016 clow et al 2012 hedrick et al 2015 which have shown that snodas provides a reasonable estimation of snow water equivalent comparisons with parflow clm swe distributions allow for the assessment of model performance during different meteorological conditions we also compare the simulated parflow clm swe to a reconstruction method by bair and co authors 2016 which has been shown to represent snow patterns with higher accuracy than snodas the reconstruction method by bair et al uses a full energy balance model to calculate snowmelt it incorporates remotely sensed snow albedo adjusted for light absorbing impurities and utilizes an accurate daily moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis fractional snow covered area from a time space smoothing method that accounts for ephemeral snow the bair et al swe reconstruction maps utilized over the cosumnes watershed are approximately 500 m in resolution and are available at a daily time step 3 2 2 2 mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric metric allen et al 2007 is an image processing tool used to compute efficient and accurate et as a residual of the energy balance at the earth s surface using the following equation et rn g h where rn is the net radiation total net shortwave and longwave radiation at the vegetation or soil surface g is sensible heat flux conducted into the ground and h is sensible to heat flux convected into the air the surface energy balance is internally calibrated using ground based reference et that is based on local weather or gridded weather data such as nldas datasets to reduce computational biases inherent in remotely sensed energy balance allen et al 2007 the fundamental principle underlying metric is that evaporating liquids absorb heat the difference in these three terms above rn g and h represents the amount of energy absorbed during the conversion of liquid water to vapor 3 2 2 3 soil moisture active passive smap smap smap 2015 a nasa mission in response to the national research council s decadal survey launched in 2015 makes global measurements of the soil moisture present at the earth s and surface smap provides a capability for global mapping of soil moisture with good accuracy resolution and coverage the satellite measures direct sensing of soil moisture in the top 5 cm of the soil column with radiometers entekhabi et al 2010 piepmeier et al 2017 nasa has produced the smap data at four different levels in this work we use level 4 smap reichle 2018 reichle et al 2017 the only level integrating the root zone with a reasonable spatial resolution and a sufficient time series of observation to perform comparisons with the simulations in this study chan et al 2016 demonstrated that smap is in good agreement with ground measurements 3 3 watershed dynamics and trends our analyses are focused on studying the impacts of extreme changes in climatic conditions on the spatiotemporal evolutions of the snowpack process based fluxes connecting the land surface to the subsurface e g et and infiltration pressure heads and water storage surface water and groundwater storages are calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 storage sw i 1 n sw δ x i δ y i ψ i where storage sw is the surface water storage n sw is the total number of river cells δ x i and δ y i are discretizations along the x and y directions respectively i is of cell and ψ i is the pressure head note that because parflow clm is an integrated hydrologic model only surface cells whose pressure is greater than 0 are taken into account in the surface water storage summation 2 storage gw i 1 n gw δ x i δ y i δ z i ψ i s s i ϕ i where storage gw is the groundwater storage n gw is the total number of subsurface saturated cells δ z i is the discretization along the vertical direction the cell s s i is the specific storage and ϕ i the porosity in addition to better understanding the changing of hydrological conditions in response to these end member climatic conditions our study evaluates the interconnection between the different hydrological reservoirs as well as all the timing and magnitude of processes leading to the movement of water from the subsurface to the lower atmosphere insights from these simulation results offer a better understanding of how water dynamics across california may change in the future 4 results and discussion in this section comparisons between model outputs swe soil moisture and et and satellite based products and simulated and measured groundwater and surface levels are shown as part of the model validation we further study and explain the yearly variation of these outputs of interest as well as their spatial distributions 4 1 comparisons between model outputs and satellite based products and measurements in addition to comparing the absolute values of the above metrics in time and space comparisons between model outputs local measurements and remotely sensed data will be based on the evaluation of the following metrics i absolute differences are given by 3 l 1 i j x mes i j x sim i j where l 1 i j is the absolute difference associated with cell i and time j x mes i j is the measured or remotely sensed data and x sim i j the simulated value ii relative differences l 2 i j are given by 4 l 2 i j x mes i j x sim i j x mes i j iii we also calculated the pearson correlation coefficient to study the linear correlation between our model and the available data 4 1 1 comparisons with local measurements of surface and groundwater pressure heads fig 3 a illustrates the comparison between measured and simulated surface pressure heads results obtained with parflow clm are in reasonable agreement with measurements in general simulated surface pressure heads signals are smoother than measured signals we calculated the time average of the absolute l 1 and relative l 2 differences between measurements and simulations for the three stations see table 2 the station cnf located upstream in the sierra mountains has a time average l 1 and l 2 equal to 0 8 m and 0 5 respectively due to its location water levels variations reach approximately 7 m in the wet year while they never exceed 4 m in the intrusion and the central valley the mhb station has the lowest time average l 1 and l 2 equal to 0 4 m and 0 36 respectively we noticed that while the model indicates that the pressure head significantly increases in the wet year measurements show that the highest pressure head in the wet year is equal to the highest of the dry year several reasons may be responsible for such an observation including instrumentation errors or water management effects as these measured values are indicative of a kind of threshold the station mfr located on the outskirts of the city of sacramento has the greatest l 2 value equal to 0 8 m measurements values marked by many peaks are very different from the mhb station the large errors might be related to the location of this station close to the city the water regulators could impose water levels variations in the river such regulations are not taken into account in the model however note that the majority of signal peaks occur at the same time in the model as in the measurements comparisons between measured and simulated pressure heads with respect to the bottom of the domain at depth of 80 m are shown in fig 3b table 2 lists l 1 and l 2 values due to the uncertainties in the spatial and temporal variations of pumping rates it is difficult to reproduce the measured groundwater levels piezometers 3 and 4 located in the upper part of the central valley show the best match with measurements i e the lowest absolute and relative errors we noted the piezometer with the best match 3 is the only piezometer in the area with more than 100 years of biweekly monitoring measured groundwater levels at this piezometer show that pressure heads decrease from year to year as calculated in the model for the other piezometers with errors greater than 1 m model results show an increase of groundwater pressure heads in the winter of the wet year 2017 while measurements indicate that the pressure head is not increasing during the wet year such behavior can be explained by a lack of reported pumping we also notice that for these piezometers the decrease in the water table levels observed in summer seems to be shifted in time these comparisons allow us to conclude that the developed model is able to simulate surface and groundwater levels variations and trends in the next sections we will investigate the ability of the model to capture land surface processes swe soil moisture and et as computed by clm 4 1 2 comparisons with remote sensing products 4 1 2 1 comparisons with snodas fig 4 a shows the comparisons between averaged total swe obtained with parflow clm snodas and bair et al s reconstruction through the three water years of interest in general the results obtained with snodas and parflow clm are in good agreement where the peaks as well as the periods without snow are consistent between the two approaches the differences between the two models are most pronounced in the heavy snowfall year the water year 2017 for this year both models reproduce the first peak however the representation of snow in snodas shows trends of faster melting snow in comparison to parflow clm results the time average of l 1 of snodas is equal to 3 09 mm whereas the one associated with bair et al s reconstruction data is 3 80 mm l 2 as well as the correlation coefficient associated with snodas table 2 indicates that the results obtained with the model are more close to snodas than bair et al s reconstruction compared to bair et al s reconstruction the model outputs overestimate swe in the wet year even though the water year 2017 is wet and cold bair et al s reconstruction indicates that the swe for the water year 2017 is slightly superior to the swe of the dry year 2016 within our area of interest the differences of swe obtained with bair et al s reconstruction and parflow clm outputs might due to the spatial resolution of the meteorological forcing bair et al 2016 downscaled nldas data and accounted for elevation changes whereas in the hydrologic model the meteorological forcings are homogeneous over a 14 km resolution grid for the first water year 2015 the differences between parflow clm and snodas are small less than 5 mm swe obtained with snodas are greater than the ones obtained with parflow clm contrary to the water years 2016 and 2017 where the estimated swe obtained with parflow clm is much greater than snodas data the differences can reach 30 mm this difference is most evident during periods of when snowmelt in parflow clm is more rapid than in snodas nevertheless the two results remain in good agreement indicating that our model is capturing the temporal evolution of swe 4 1 2 2 comparisons with metric metric provides actual et values at the daily time step and a spatial resolution up to 30 m however these values are not continuous in time as only a selected number of days is publicly available we compare the relative change of et obtained with parflow clm and metric dataset by normalizing the time series from 0 1 see fig 4b normalization allows us to directly compare the trends in the two time series signals which is most important in assessing the physics based behavior of the system we also limit our comparison to the temporal evolution of the relative variation of domain averaged evapotranspiration since the resolutions of the two datasets parflow clm and metric are quite different in general the results obtained with the two models are very similar for the first two water years 2015 and 2016 which are during the drought however for the water year 2017 which was very wet the metric data indicate a relative variation of et much lower than that of parflow clm the higher relative et simulated by parflow clm is likely due to the integrated nature of the model and the physics of the simulation which allow for water withdrawal from deeper reserves of groundwater in contrast metric calculates an actual et based on a surface energy balance and the type of vegetation neglecting the movement of water in the subsurface and its feedback in the atmosphere such a disparity in these approaches can lead to very different results especially during a dry period followed by a wet period where the three dimensional connection of soil moisture and subsurface saturation to the atmosphere can be very important the calculated l 1 and l 2 show that there is a good agreement between the model and metric however we obtained a low pearson correlation coefficient equal to 0 6 of the two datasets this might due to the strong temporal variations of et 4 1 2 3 comparisons with smap smap data are only available for two years between october 2015 and october 2017 and thus are compared to parflow clm simulations for this time frame only comparisons between smap level 4 which computes the soil moisture within the top 1 m of the land surface is derived by considering measurements of soil moisture coming from radiometers but also a geophysical model to account for the soil moisture within the root zone which is set to 1 m reichle 2018 reichle et al 2017 the spatial resolution of smap is 9 km with outputs every 3 hours to compare the simulated parflow clm model output to smap we compare the scaled variation of soil moisture obtained by normalizing each time series onto a scale between 0 and 1 this normalization is necessary because when looking at the exact values on large scales e g at the 9 km resolution of smap data the parametric uncertainties will have a lower impact on the relative variations than on the exact values fig 4c shows the comparisons between relative variations of soil moisture obtained with parflow clm and smap level 4 which show that the relative variations of soil moisture obtained with the two methods are generally in good agreement with each other our results show that the relative variations between the two models are most similar during summer during winter soil moisture obtained with parflow clm shows strong fluctuations while soil moisture obtained with smap is smoother this is possibly due to the more resolved time step used in the parflow clm 1 hour versus that of smap 3 hours but also the dynamics taken into account in this physics based model beneath 1 m which are not represented in smap contrary to smap parflow clm solves hydrodynamics in the entire system including the deeper vadose zone and groundwater these fluctuations can thus be related to the sharp variations of water content from dry to wet conditions inherent to the resolution of the flow in the vadose zone nevertheless the generally good agreement of the soil moisture variations indicates that the model is correctly reproducing the trends of water content in the soil through time moreover the correlation coefficient shown in table 2 equal to 0 94 indicates that the two results are in agreement 4 2 cosumnes watershed dynamics 4 2 1 actual evapotranspiration fig 5 depicts the time evolution of simulated actual et for the three water years of interest we represent the daily averaged trend of these variations since et values show sharp fluctuations due to the strong hourly variations diurnal cycling and correlations to short term weather conditions simulated actual et for water years 2015 and 2016 are similar while the variation of total et for the water year 2017 the wettest year is greater than the two previous dry years as shown in the preceding paragraphs the precipitation in the 2017 water year is at least twice as large as that of the previous dry years recall that although the 2017 water year is wet the summers are still hot a wet winter leads to wet soil and shallow vadose zone and therefore a sufficient quantity of water to satisfy the strong evaporative demand resulting in a high level of et fig 6 a c shows the spatial distribution of the annual average of actual et for the three water years studied as observed in the analysis of the global variation of actual et per year the wettest water year 2017 is the year with the highest rate of et however we can observe that the trend of the spatial distribution of actual et remains the same over the years and is attributed to mostly differences in land use and land cover but also other factors such as underlying geologic unit topography and proximity to rivers or streams unsurprisingly the forestlands of the sierra nevada mountains have the greatest values of actual et vicinity to the rivers throughout the forests is also important due to the higher availability of water the city of sacramento located at the northwest limit of the watershed has relatively low et compared to the rest of the area the spatial distribution of et is very heterogeneous within the agricultural region of the central valley indeed we can see that the alfalfa fields located at the southwestern end of the model are characterized by a very weak annual et value unlike the pasture fields located at the center portion of the model whose annual et value is very high fig 6d and 6e show the average annual percent change in et relative to the average annual et of the water year 2015 the relative change in et δ et i is computed using the following equation 5 δ et i et i 2015 et i y et i 2015 100 0 where et i 2015 is the annual average of the et of the cell i in 2015 and et i y the annual average of et of the cell i for the water year y y being either 2016 or 2017 as expected one can see that the percent change of et is lower for the dry year 2016 fig 6d where regions of the sierra nevada mountain forests and the city of sacramento experience the highest yearly change of annual et on the order of approximately 10 for the wet year 2017 fig 6e et is at least 20 higher throughout most of the domain additionally large portions of the sierra nevada mountains show high increases in et with some regions of the mountains exhibiting a relative change of et greater than 60 most notably where plutonic rocks exist in the model et changes in the central valley are lower than those in the mountains but are still substantial in 2017 water year average annual et of grape crops change from anywhere between 35 and 60 a variation almost equal to the variation in the sierra nevada mountains and greater than the variation of pasture crops around 20 this indicates that although grapes are characterized by a relatively small amount of et compared to other land use types their changes in et patterns are more sensitive to weather conditions compared to other crops such as pasturelands the spatial trends observed in fig 6d versus those in fig 6e are slightly different while the cosumnes river and its tributaries show a lower annual change in et in the water year 2016 less than 5 et is these areas change by more than 30 in the wet water year 2017 because after a wet water year the water storage in the cosumnes river and its tributaries mainly fed by snowmelt is high the water available to meet the evaporative demand is high the highest percent change in et occurring in the water year 2016 take place across the majority of the sierra nevada mountain range whereas the location of the greatest percent change in the water year 2017 occurs mostly in topographically and geologically distinct areas indicative of groundwater and surface water convergence after a wet winter water will converge towards these areas and will increase soil moisture and the water availability evaporative demand is not water limited in these situations and as a consequence actual et increases the changes in et are higher in the sierra nevada mountains than in the central valley because in the former the presence of pumping wells make et less sensitive to the changes in climate our results show that variations in extreme climate events will impact the et export of water in certain regions of a watershed more than others and that the degree to which a specific region is vulnerable to climate extreme is related to many factors including topography hydrologic connection to adjacent groundwater and surface water bodies pumping and irrigation geologic unit type and parameterization and land use type 4 2 2 surface water as expected the peak surface water storage of the wettest water year 2017 is approximately twice as large as the peak of the previous year fig 7 a annual variation of surface water storage is directly linked to the fluctuation of precipitation and thus the difference between different water years is most prevalent in the winter season in the summer surface water storage is approximately equivalent for all the three water years i e during baseflow conditions reflecting an equilibrium condition of the surface flow dynamic regardless of the amount of moisture in the system during the winter such behavior is typical of watersheds located in an area where winters are cool and wet and the summers are hot and dry jan et al 2004 maurer and duffy 2005 mount et al 2001 moyle et al 2003 4 2 3 groundwater fig 7b shows that the time evolutions of the groundwater and surface water storages have similar trends with regards to peak storage an analysis of daily variations in groundwater storage for the three years shows that these variations are different the water year 2015 is characterized by a groundwater storage peak that occurs early december january while the groundwater storage peak occurs in february and april during the 2016 and 2017 water years this is due to the temporal variation of precipitation for the different water years as shown in section 2 1 precipitation starts earlier in 2015 than in the other water years groundwater storage dynamics between the three simulated water years also reveal interesting trends related to the rate of aquifer rebound in the presence of a precipitation event as shown in fig 7b the shape of the groundwater storage curve in the second year of the drought the water year 2016 is very dissimilar to those of the other water years the shape of the water year 2015 groundwater storage curve has trends similar to those of the associated surface water storage curve fig 7a where individual precipitation events or clusters of events show clear rise and fall signatures in both metrics in contrast the dry antecedent moisture condition of the previous water year influences the shape of the water year 2016 groundwater storage curve to be dampened and unlike that of the associated surface water curve most notably in the first half of the water year groundwater storage significantly increases in the winter during the wet year 2017 with a peak twice as large as the one occurring during the previous dry year however regardless of the magnitude of winter precipitation within a given water year the receding tail of the storage curve shows trends towards nearly equivalent storage values in the summer during the drought water years interestingly the groundwater storage quantity during the summer after the wet 2017 water year shows slightly lower groundwater storage than the storage measured at this point of the year during the drought this is due to the combined effects of 1 the resulting actual et after a wet winter that is so high as discussed in section 4 2 1 and the subsurface will keep losing water therefore its storage decreases and 2 the groundwater pumping rates in the central valley that are high enough and their effects on aquifer depletion intensify from year to year as the size of the vadose zone increases fig 8 depicts the spatial distribution of the relative variation of pressure head at the lowest layer at time a indicated in fig 8b with respect to the pressure head at the same period at the initial condition of the three year simulation the water year 2014 we calculated the relative distribution of pressure head using the following equation 6 δ ψ i ψ i t 0 ψ i t ψ i t 0 where δ ψ i is the relative variation of pressure head at cell i ψ i t 0 is the pressure head of the cell i at 09 30 2013 and ψ i t corresponds to the pressure head at time t where t is 2015 2016 and 2017 at fraction of water year of 0 8 the spatial distribution of the relative variation of the pressure head indicates that the yearly variation of pressure head is less than 1 in the majority of the cosumnes watershed despite the wet year and its high pressure head in winter the pressure head as well as the storage returns to back to a baseline value this is due to the increase of et during the wet year even though the pressure head increases two fold during a wet year the resulting et during the summer is twice which inhibits the effect of the wet year see eqs 5 and 6 note however that these relative variations of pressure head remain higher in the plutonic rocks of the sierra nevada characterized by the highest changes in et as discussed in section 4 2 1 and close to the pumping wells indicating that the effects of pumping wells are hardly masked by the preceding heavy precipitation in the winter indeed the footprint of pumping increases over the years see fig 8 explaining the decrease in storage our study assumes 1 that the annual pumping rate is the same for three years and that 2 the location of these pumping wells is approximate an accurate evaluation of the pumping rate as well as their location might lead to a different map of pressure head distribution nevertheless depletion of groundwater resources in california has been documented in many studies famiglietti et al 2011 which strengthens the general findings in this study storage does not increase despite the increase of a heavy precipitation year our work also demonstrates that this decrease of water storage in this representative california watershed is more related to anthropogenic activities than climate extremes conditions to further assess the decrease of groundwater storage due to these anthropogenic effects and to understand why storage decreases after the wet water year an identical baseline parflow clm simulation was performed without irrigation and pumping the impact of simulated groundwater depletion rates within the central valley and the compounding effect on storage through time is quantified in fig 9 which shows the relative difference see eq 7 between the baseline and pumping irrigation case for the three water years of interest 7 δ s t o r a g e gw t storage gw simulation t storage gw baseline t storage gw simulation t where δ s t o r a g e gw t is the relative difference of the total groundwater storage of groundwater at time t storage gw baseline t is total groundwater storage obtained with the baseline simulation at time t and storage gw simulation t is the total groundwater storage obtained with the simulation with pumping and irrigation at time t in general a 5 10 decrease in storage is observed in the pumping irrigation case compared to the baseline simulation a depleting groundwater storage trend should therefore be evident in the results shown in fig 7b if it was not for the approximately 2 and 4 increase in precipitation in the 2016 and 2017 water years respectively following the drought to assess the effect of climate extreme years on local water table dynamics we selected three different points in the central valley locations shown in fig 1c labeled points a b and c to study their temporal dynamics these points allow us to understand the changes in groundwater levels at different locations ranging from those upstream to those downstream of the cosumnes river like the global variation in groundwater storage dry years are characterized by lower magnitude peaks compared to wet years regardless of whether the winter was after a dry or wet year the water level in the subsurface decreases in summer to reach equilibrium conditions that are nearly identical from year to year the three points show similar temporal variations as indicated in fig 10 the peaks as well as the decreases in pressure head occur at the same time however the amplitudes of the pressure head variation for the three points are different our results show that for the points located in the upper part of the central valley the magnitudes of variation are smaller and water table levels vary significantly in the lower part of the central valley as indicated by the variations at points a and b this is mainly due to the geological characteristics of the aquifer where point c is located in an area with lower hydraulic conductivity which leads to a small amount of infiltration and movement of water to understand how seasonality affects the spatial distribution of groundwater and surface water pressure head fig 11 shows simulated pressure head distribution of the bottom corresponding to the lowest layer of the model for winter a and summer b conditions of the water year 2017 the same spatial distributions have been observed for the water years 2015 and 2016 therefore those results are not shown for succinctness as discussed previously see discussion of the relative variation of pressure in fig 8 the difference between these years is mainly in the amplitude of variation of the storage not its spatial distribution from year to year points with the highest pressure heads sierra nevada mountains as well as those associated with low pressure heads volcanic intrusion depressions created by pumping wells in the upper part remain the same spatial distributions of pressure head fig 11a and b highlight three different zones in the region the central valley the sierra nevada mountains and an intermediate zone characterized by an intrusion of volcanic rocks with very low permeability as shown in the geological map see fig 1c for the geological map due to the geological contrast of these three zones we can observe that the flow has an east west direction in the intermediate zone while the flow direction is from north to south in the sierra and the central valley the intermediate zone plays the role of a barrier and tends to block any subsurface flow from the sierra nevada mountains to the central valley due to its very low permeability such behavior may suggest that these three areas are completely independent which is not the case as demonstrated by the spatial distribution of the pressure head at the surface fig 11c and d the cosumnes river which takes its source in the sierra nevada mountains and is mainly fed by the snowmelt crosses the intermediate zone as well as the central valley interactions between the river and the subsurface within the domain establish a link between the different zones pressure head distributions change significantly between winter and summer in the sierra nevada mountains and the central valley while the latter remains almost constant in the intermediate zone between the two inter seasonal variations are more important in the sierra nevada mountains where winter to summer pressure head variations can reach 40 m because mountains receive a large amount of winter precipitation in this area the geological characteristics and associated low permeability and storage result in high reactivity i e high variations of pressure following a rainfall event the pressure increases very quickly these areas are also located in forestlands which are characterized by high degrees of et thus during the summer the strong et flux in combination with the low storage hydrodynamic properties of the zone leads to a very low pressure head in the central valley this area where inter seasonal variations in pressure head are less marked than in the mountains the footprint of pumping wells is evident regardless of the season we note however that in the lower part of the central valley winter precipitation masks the effects of pumping whereas in the upper part of the central valley i e at the boundary of the intermediate zone the depression created by the pumping wells remains pronounced in both winter and summer seasons because of the almost zero contribution of the lateral flows near this barrier zone the depression is hardly blurred in the spatial distribution maps this is in contrast to the lower part of the watershed where the greater degree of lateral flow homogenizes the pressure field in the absence of pumping during the winter the dynamics of the cosumnes river depend mainly on the meteorological conditions of the sierra nevada mountains as in other parts of the state the cosumnes river depends upon just a few storms to produce the majority of annual runoff whipple et al 2017 a large part of this river is thus perennial because during summer after the snowmelt occurs and in the absence of precipitation the river is not fed as shown by fig 11c and d in winter the drainage area is much larger and water levels can are higher even in the mountainous areas meanwhile in summer the flow is almost exclusively in the central valley as a result many tributaries of the river disappear consistent with observations mount et al 2001 5 conclusions in this work we used a parallelized physically based integrated hydrologic model in a high performance computing framework to assess the impact of climate extremes characterized by a severe drought followed by extreme precipitation events recently observed in a representative california watershed we constructed and validated a model of the cosumnes watershed located in northern california a unique watershed given the un dammed nature of one of the last freely flowing major rivers in the state the watershed also allows studying the complete picture of the hydrology in california including snow dynamics land surface processes surface runoff and groundwater aquifers the simulated model has a high spatiotemporal resolution we incorporated several publicly available datasets as well as discussion with stakeholders to develop the model as a method of model validation we performed several comparisons between model outputs and local in situ measurements groundwater levels and river heights and satellite based products simulated swe was compared to snodas and an alternative swe map reconstruction method bair et al 2016 soil moisture was compared with smap and actual et was compared with metric the reasonably good agreement of the model outputs with satellite based products and local measurements indicates that the model is correctly reproducing the trends of pressure head soil moisture swe and actual et through time enabling confidence in its ability to elucidate feedbacks in critical zone processes the dynamics of the cosumnes river depend mainly on the snowmelt originating from the sierra nevada mountains annual variation of surface water storage is therefore directly linked to the fluctuation of precipitation surface water storage differences between dry and wet water years occur in the winter season in the summer surface water storage is approximately equivalent for all the water years reflecting base flow conditions this is not the case for the total groundwater storage which shows a decrease in time despite the occurrence of a wet water year this is in contrast to what one might expect especially given the presumably high potential for the wettest year on california record to negate the effects of the severe period of drought our results show that groundwater depletion during the wet year is a result of the combined effects of 1 sustained groundwater pumping in the central valley and 2 higher rates of actual et in wetter conditions results show that the pumping occurring in this region is so high that the effect on aquifer depletion compounds from year to year during the wet year a large amount of precipitation leads to a wet shallow subsurface as such the resulting actual et is high which actually leads to a depletion of total storage this is partially because the summer remains hot and dry regardless of whether the preceding winter is wet or dry and thus et is water limited following the dry winter and not following the wet one simulations from our model show that the vulnerability of a specific region to climate extreme depends on a number of factors including topography hydrologic connection to adjacent groundwater and surface water bodies geologic unit type and land use type our results also show that for a dry to wet year transition regions within the watershed characterized by plutonic rocks and located in topographic depressions have the highest sensitivity to et these sensitivities are a result of many interconnected hydrologic processes hence the need for an integrated modeling approach such as the one demonstrated here our study also highlighted that due to the interconnectivity of the snow dynamics surface water and groundwater as well as the often neglected hydrologic connection between the sierra nevada mountains and the central valley an integrated hydrologic model is required to fully understand the hydrodynamics of californian watersheds under a changing climate in this study we estimated pumping and irrigation rates and locations by taking into account land use as defined by each county and approximations made by parcel size although the magnitude of pumping and irrigation was estimated trends in groundwater storage show reasonable agreement with observations however future work will require increased accuracy in pumping and irrigation datasets including changes in inter annual pumping trends based on yearly climate fluctuations if local variations of pressure are desired future studies would also benefit from meteorological forcing with a resolution close to that of the model in order to sufficiently describe an accurate spatial distribution of snow et and localized recharge finally in this work we focused on the transition from intense dry to extreme wet conditions future studies will investigate the opposite change i e from wet to dry conditions and

up the yearly variations of surface and groundwater storages fig a1 show that a two years of relaxation period is sufficient to stabilize the system surface water storage returns to equilibrium baseflow conditions in summer when the rain stops no excess flow due to higher initial conditions or yearly increase of storage due to lower initial conditions is observed for groundwater storage the initial conditions were higher and the storage decreases within the first two years then stabilizes we also investigated the local variation of pressures fig a2 which demonstrate that the two years were sufficient to negate the effects of initial conditions appendix b data availability in the cosumnes watershed one of the main limitations for quantitatively analyzing water resources in california is the lack of data indeed there is no legislation that mandates the reporting of water use and monitoring to date there are two publicly available databases usgs and dwr which includes cdec in the cosumnes watershed these databases consist of around 100 groundwater wells and 12 river gauges see fig b1 however very few wells continuously measure water changes as some wells have just been reported and do not have any data selected river gauges table b1 describes the temporal availability of data for the 12 river stations we can notice that the majority of the usgs stations do not have any data within our period of interest only three cdec stations cnf mfr and mhb continuously measure changes in the water level in the basin these three selected stations are shown in fig b2 selected groundwater observation wells the number of reported groundwater wells is greater than the number of river stations however the majority of these wells do not have any data which is contrary to the river gauges less than twenty wells represented by the stars in fig b2 have data i e at a single time or at several time intervals for our comparisons we selected four piezometers for which water table levels are measured every two months wells 1 2 and 4 and every two weeks well 3 
5998,with the onset of climate change regions relied upon for water supply are increasingly subject to end member fluctuations between periods of severe drought followed by extreme precipitation the impacts of these extreme conditions on watershed hydrodynamics in water resource sensitive regions such as california are unknown despite their great importance for resilience and water management purposes understanding these impacts requires high resolution physically based models to capture sharp variations of topography land use wetting fronts etc an integrated hydrologic model was used in a high performance computing framework to study the complex nonlinear dynamics occurring at a representative californian watershed the cosumnes watershed one of the last major rivers in california without a dam offers a rare opportunity to isolate the effects of water management from climate extremes here we show model validation with comparisons between model outputs and local measurements in addition to various satellite based products including 1 snow water equivalent swe with snow data assimilation system snodas and a reconstruction method by bair and co authors 2 soil moisture with soil moisture active passive smap and 3 evapotranspiration et with mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric to assess changes in hydrodynamic behavior during climate extremes and their transitions a simulation spanning a recent drought followed by the highest precipitation year on record 2015 2017 is discussed from these simulations we are able to highlight regions that are the most sensitive to climate extremes which depend on many factors including hydrologic connectivity geology and topography these analyses provide a better understanding of the physical phenomena occurring in the watershed strengthening our knowledge of how the system may respond to extreme conditions which might become the new normal keywords climate extremes high performance computing integrated hydrologic model watershed dynamics remote sensing water management 1 introduction in california as in other parts of the world the effects of climate change have recently been observed as fluctuations between end member climate conditions such as periods of droughts cook et al 2004 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 followed by extreme precipitation events mainly caused by atmospheric rivers dettinger 2011 2013 dettinger et al 2004a ralph et al 2006 ralph and dettinger 2011 oscillations between severe droughts and atmospheric rivers are expected to intensify as a consequence of anthropogenic induced climate warming cloern et al 2011 seager et al 2007 for example swain et al s projections show that the twenty first century emissions will yield a 25 to 100 increase in extreme dry to wet transitions 2018 however the subsequent impacts on watershed hydrology including groundwater recharge evapotranspiration et and river discharge are largely unknown and under studied despite the myriad of climate change studies performed in california brekke et al 2004 dettinger 2011 dettinger et al 2004b maurer and duffy 2005 vicuna and dracup 2007 young et al 2009 our perspective of water management issues today could dramatically change as these conditions will become the new normal in the future where understanding their effects on watershed hydrodynamics will become crucial for water management planning assessing the impact of climate change on water resources requires a better understanding of how the integrated hydrologic cycle responds to perturbations across scales including from deep aquifers through the lower atmosphere ferguson and maxwell 2010 goderniaux et al 2009 jones et al 2008 because several hydrological processes occur simultaneously in a watershed e g groundwater surface water interactions and feedbacks between water and energy fluxes near the land surface accurate budgeting of these hydrological conditions requires physically based numerical models consisting of highly nonlinear equations e g richards and kinematic diffusive wave equations to correctly project into a no analog future where empirical expressions are insufficient tools for prediction due to the nonlinearities of these processes and the associated equations used to describe them these models are computationally expensive often limiting them to coarse spatiotemporal resolutions and hampering their applicability on the real world water management applications however overly coarse resolution models are often incapable of simulating complex topography or sharp wetting fronts which are important when assessing extremes events in this work we use high performance computing hpc and the parallel hydrologic model parflow clm kollet and maxwell 2006 maxwell 2013 maxwell and miller 2005 to simulate and better understand the nonlinear dynamics of a representative californian watershed the cosumnes watershed is one of the last major rivers in california without a dam allowing us to study natural flow conditions by essentially isolating the impacts of climate change from large scale water management the watershed spans the central valley sierra nevada interface a landscape typical of many hydrologically connected yet mixed land use areas across the state i e including urban agriculture and naturally forested areas the central valley is the most productive agricultural region in the united states and among the highest in the world water in this region relies on seasonal snowmelt from the sierra nevada mountains which provides up to approximately 70 of the water storage in the state dettinger and anderson 2015 depending on the year as a result the hydrologic connection between california s central valley and the sierra nevada is important nevertheless previous hydrologic models have mainly focused on modeling the isolated water storage in the central valley neglecting the contribution of the sierra nevada mountains to the central valley hydrodynamics california department of water resources 2018a faunt and geological survey u s 2009 finally the resolution of the model used here 200 m horizontal sub meter to tens of meters vertically is in agreement with regional decision making scales which is unlike previous works that have been relied on coarse resolution models california department of water resources 2018a b faunt and geological survey u s 2009 gilbert et al 2017 gilbert and maxwell 2017 we first demonstrate the model s validation with both local measurements and remote sensing platforms then to assess watershed dynamics during the climate extremes and their transitions a recent historic period of end member water years is simulated results from water years 2015 2017 a period which includes the most severe drought in the last 1200 years griffin and anchukaitis 2014 followed by the wettest year on california record di liberto 2017 scripps institution of oceanography 2017 are discussed to understand system response and dynamics during these extreme periods of water variability we utilize a complex three dimensional hydrological model which includes all components of the water cycle in the critical zone from bedrock to canopy as described in section ii the simulated cosumnes watershed provides a complete picture of the hydrological components occurring at the regional watershed to basin scale including snow accumulation and snowmelt surface runoff groundwater infiltration and also the exchange between the surface water the vadose zone and aquifers our work aims to understand the fundamental behavior of the watershed in response to the extreme changes in climatic conditions and address the following questions how does the transition from extreme dry to wet water years affect groundwater and river storages is a wet water year sufficient to negate the effects of the previous dry year how do hydrologic processes such as et evolve during these end member years which areas within a watershed are most sensitive to climate extremes we assess both the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater and surface water levels as well as et snow water equivalent and soil moisture throughout the modeled region before during and after the dry wet year transition because many parts of california heavily rely on groundwater resources during periods of drought understanding water resources dynamics at these interfaces in i time and ii across the sierra nevada central valley boundary will provide insights into water management issues related to land subsidence degraded water quality and increased electricity costs of pumping due to the intensive groundwater over drafting di liberto 2017 famiglietti et al 2011 faunt and sneed 2015 howitt et al 2015 miro et al 2018 the recent 2012 2015 california drought has also reiterated the need to identify new methods to quantify water storage in mountain snowpack hedrick et al 2018 our methodology provides a scientific basis for stakeholders to better understand how california watersheds inclusive of groundwater aquifers might respond to climate extremes and climate variability descriptions of the simulated site are explained in section 2 followed by the datasets and methods used to construct and validate the model in section 3 finally in section 4 we discuss the results and the next steps of this work 2 site description the cosumnes watershed is located in northern california east of sacramento and southwest of lake tahoe see fig 1 a in all but the upper watershed the basin is bounded by the american and mokelumne rivers and is approximately 7000 km2 fig 1a also illustrates the substantial change in elevation across the model which varies from approximately 2000 m in the upper part and reaches the sea level in the central valley fig 1b depicts the land cover of the cosumnes watershed the blue lines indicate the main branches of the cosumnes river and its associated tributaries as shown in fig 1c the sierra nevada mountains are mainly composed of plutonic rocks granite and an intrusion of volcanic rocks basalt and gabbro at the intersection with the central valley which represents an alluvial aquifer sand and clay materials precipitation varies significantly within the study area the sierra nevada mountains receive up to 1500 mm of precipitation per year usually in form of snow whereas rainfall in the central valley is approximately 660 mm per year on average as calculated by nldas 2 forcing cosgrove et al 2003 due to the topography the geological composition of the sierra nevada mountains and the limited rainfall in the central valley water in the alluvial aquifer is mainly a result of snowmelt therefore a better understanding of the dynamics of the central valley aquifers involves joint modeling of the sierra nevada mountains block and central valley aquifers 3 methodology the integrated hydrologic model parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 maxwell 2013 maxwell and miller 2005 coupled to the community land model clm dai et al 2003 is used to solve the water energy balance from the bedrock to the lower atmosphere maxwell and miller 2005 parflow solves three dimensional variably saturated flow with the richards equation richards 1931 to describe flow in both vadose zone and saturated groundwater using a cell centered finite difference scheme the interdependence of hydrodynamic variables in the variably saturated zone is described by the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 while the nonlinearities are addressed with a newton krylovscheme jones and woodward 2001 two dimensional surface water is solved via the kinematic wave equation at the land surface kollet and maxwell 2006 the model is coupled with clm to describe the interactions between the land surface and the lower atmosphere clm computes feedbacks between water and energy fluxes near the land surface including actual evaporation transpiration snow dynamics and infiltration details on the coupling technique used to pair parflow and clm are described in the work of maxwell and miller 2005 3 1 model development the simulated model is horizontally discretized at a 200 m spatial resolution 8 layers comprise the groundwater model which follows the terrain at a thickness of 80 m with a variable vertical resolution ranging from 10 cm to 30 m see table 1 the thickness of the model is sufficient to capture groundwater variations observed in the central valley which predominantly vary between 25 and 50 m below the land surface in total the model is comprised of 1 3 million active cells land surface elevations were obtained from the usgs at 10 m resolution and up scaled to be consistent with the resolution of the model see fig 1a for elevation distribution slopes are processed with a watershed routing algorithm available through the gis platform grass boundary conditions are delineated by topographic boundaries and neighboring rivers see fig 1b the upper part of the watershed consists of a no flow neumann boundary condition segments of dirichlet boundary conditions are set along the american and mokelumne rivers we define a set of patches denoted by varying colors in fig 1b for which the river stages are imposed as constant values at weekly time intervals values for rivers stages indicated by stars in fig 1b were obtained from usgs and dwr river gauges usgs 2018 and california data exchange center 2018 while further delineations could be made to better characterize fluctuations of the river boundary conditions sensitivity analysis revealed the delineations shown in fig 1b are sufficient to capture the boundary dynamics through space and time as shown in fig 1c subsurface geology is defined based on usgs surficial geologic maps geologic map of california 2015 jennings et al 1977 for each type of geological formation we assigned representative values see table 1 based on a literature review of the following parameters permeability specific storage porosity van genuchten α n faunt et al 2010 faunt and geological survey u s 2009 flint et al 2013 gilbert and maxwell 2017 welch and allen 2014 areas of urban land cover are assigned a low effective permeability while soil layers first 2 m of the model have a higher permeability land cover is defined by the 2011 nlcd dataset homer et al 2015 and was updated to further refine areas of agriculture that are of interest to our simulations specifically alfalfa grape and pasture crops were delineated by the 2010 usda s cropland database boryan et al 2011 and superimposed onto the nlcd map land and vegetation parameters are defined by the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp database igbp 2018 and further refined to account for specific crop characteristics based on differences in leaf area index lai height and reflectance the main crops within the watershed are alfalfa pasture and grape vineyards we derived the properties of alfalfa leaf area index height values see table 1 from the studies of evett et al 2000 orloff 1995 and robison et al 1969 grape properties were obtained from johnson and pierce 2004 vanino et al 2015 pasture properties were obtained from buermann et al 2002 king et al 1986 rahman and lamb 2017 surface roughness is parameterized via manning coefficients chow 2009 as defined in table 1 we performed a simulation spanning five years where the first two years correspond to the spin up period and the last three correspond to this study s period of interest where a dry to wet transition was observed for all simulations during these five years an hourly time step is used the initial condition of the spin up is a pressure distribution obtained by performing a kriging of available groundwater table levels from the usgs database 16 piezometers within the domain provide groundwater table distributions for model construction and validation however because water table values are sparse in time mainly measured between 2005 and 2012 we perform one time spatial kriging to obtain a map of the initial pressure field at the beginning of the spin up period steady state simulations were then performed representative of precipitation minus evapotranspiration average climate forcing over the model to allow water to move along topographic gradients not represented in the kriging step of the spin up we then use the spatial distribution of pressure obtained at the end of the steady state simulation as the initial conditions of the transient 5 year simulation as described above due to the inherent uncertainties of the initial conditions we discarded the first two years of the simulation as a spin up appendix a shows the temporal variations of groundwater and surface water storages as well as pressure heads for these two years the results discussed hereafter only consider the last three years of the simulation the meteorological forcing required by clm includes precipitation temperature east to west and north to south wind speed long and short wave solar radiation air pressure and relative humidity we use phase 2 of the north america land data assimilation system nldas 2 forcing cosgrove et al 2003 dataset to describe the spatiotemporal variation of the meteorological conditions nldas 2 forcing provides hourly atmospheric variables with an approximate resolution of 14 km fig 2 depicts the temporal variation of precipitation and temperature during the three selected water years from october 2014 through september 2017 during this study period the yearly average temperature in the cosumnes watershed is 14 16 c the warmest year is 2015 and the coolest year is 2017 the monthly variations of temperature during these years shown in fig 2c indicate that the variability of temperature is mainly during the winter from november march compared to previous years only the 2017 winter months were colder with average temperature reaching 0 c whereas the summer temperatures remained very similar for these three years with temperatures varying between 25 and 30 c contrary to the average yearly temperature which decreased from 2015 to 2017 the average yearly precipitation increased from 2015 to 2017 the average yearly precipitation of the water year 2017 is approximately 4 mm d almost 2 3 times greater than the average precipitation in water years 2016 and 2015 respectively similar to the trends observed for temperature the monthly variation of precipitation fig 2d shows that these differences are mainly during the winter period regardless of the year or winter conditions the summer in the cosumnes remains hot and with a very limited almost non existent amount of precipitation this trend is typical of many watersheds across the state of california as stated previously the central valley is a highly agricultural area subject to irrigation and pumping to the best of our knowledge there is not an accurate pumping and irrigation dataset available to populate model fluxes in the central valley we therefore approximate these values via an estimation technique that accounts for land use as defined by each county we use cropland data derived from the aforementioned usda cropland map to describe the spatial distribution of crops within the area based on this cropland map we then use an estimation of applied water defined as the amount of water required by a crop to grow optimally via crop and county specific irrigation values as dictated from a dwr database california department of water resources 2010 the total estimated amount of irrigation which is considered as rainfall in the model represents 35 to 75 of precipitation depending on the water year groundwater pumping rates are derived using the calculated quantity of applied water it is assumed that the irrigated water is derived from either a groundwater aquifers or b surface water diversions if the cropland is adjacent to a river cell fractions between groundwater pumping and river diversions have been determined using dwr and usgs database and were used to delineate their proportions groundwater pumping wells locations are approximate and assigned by utilizing an average land parcel size specific to this region equal to 1500 m which acts as an approximate e g through cell centering pumping location in doing so we approximate the distribution of the pumping across the modeled region furthermore we have defined two types of pumping industrial and agricultural which affect the magnitude and duration of extraction in the model we have assumed that the pumping rate for industrial purposes is constant with time while agricultural wells are only active from the beginning of april to the end of november a period determined based on discussions with stakeholders and trends in meteorological data the latter indicates that during this period rainfall is almost non existent therefore irrigation is necessary to meet the water needs of this agricultural area the above procedure ensures closure of the water balance where calculated agricultural and industrial water demands are extracted from either groundwater or surface water sources and re introduced as applied water over irrigated croplands 3 2 comparisons with satellites based products and measurements hydrologic models require many parameters and their spatial distributions all of which are associated with uncertainties that stem from an incomplete knowledge of the system although the hydrologic model used in this study is highly resolved in both time and space parameter values are assigned based on existing datasets and literature values as discussed in the previous paragraphs therefore model calibration which is usually performed by comparing model outputs with measurements e g hydraulic head water levels in rivers or discharge is required while the cosumnes watershed provides an opportunity to study the semi natural stream dynamics occurring at watershed scales this region is typical of many other watersheds across the state in that the measurements for calibration are sparse see in appendix b for a description of the available data publicly available datasets on groundwater and surface water levels are insufficient to correctly describe the strong heterogeneities of the cosumnes watershed through inverse modeling or calibration procedures this is in agreement with the california department of water resources dwr which states that the lack of information is the main limitation when analyzing and accurately quantifying groundwater resources during the water management process we therefore use satellite based data in addition to the few local measurements with good temporal characterization to validate the model although only typically available at large spatial resolutions typically several kilometers these products provide useful information about different components of the hydrologic cycle because the model simulates coupled processes occurring near the surface and in the subsurface we identified three components of the hydrologic cycle impacted by groundwater surface water and land energy processes snowpack evaporation soil moisture 3 2 1 local measurements of surface and groundwater pressures we selected three river gauges the only ones in the area to the best of our knowledge with continuous measurements and four piezometers recording groundwater levels at bimonthly and biweekly time steps to perform comparisons with simulated results fig 1c shows the location of the selected measurement points we note that subsurface monitoring of available data only exists in the central valley region of the model while river gauges observations are located in both the sierra nevada mountains and the central valley comparisons with groundwater and surface water measurements allow us to assess the ability of the model to reproduce subsurface and surface hydrodynamics simulated by parflow 3 2 2 remote sensing products for the land surface processes computed by clm we rely on remote sensing based products as in situ measurements of land surface fluxes are less continuous in time some of these measurements such as et can also be highly uncertain fisher et al 2017 despite advancements in flux tower technologies for example making remote sensing products a good alternative for model comparisons 3 2 2 1 snow water equivalent snow data assimilation system snodas and bair et al 2016 reconstruction the national weather service s snow data assimilation snodas national operational hydrologic remote sensing center 2004 integrates snow data from satellite airborne platforms and ground stations snodas also includes procedures to ingest and downscale output from the numerical weather prediction nwp models and to simulate snow cover using a physically based spatially distributed energy and mass balance snow model the database provides a daily gridded estimate of snow depth swe and related snow parameters at a 1 km resolution within the continental united states the accuracy of snodas data has been assessed in many studies anderson 2011 bair et al 2016 clow et al 2012 hedrick et al 2015 which have shown that snodas provides a reasonable estimation of snow water equivalent comparisons with parflow clm swe distributions allow for the assessment of model performance during different meteorological conditions we also compare the simulated parflow clm swe to a reconstruction method by bair and co authors 2016 which has been shown to represent snow patterns with higher accuracy than snodas the reconstruction method by bair et al uses a full energy balance model to calculate snowmelt it incorporates remotely sensed snow albedo adjusted for light absorbing impurities and utilizes an accurate daily moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis fractional snow covered area from a time space smoothing method that accounts for ephemeral snow the bair et al swe reconstruction maps utilized over the cosumnes watershed are approximately 500 m in resolution and are available at a daily time step 3 2 2 2 mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric metric allen et al 2007 is an image processing tool used to compute efficient and accurate et as a residual of the energy balance at the earth s surface using the following equation et rn g h where rn is the net radiation total net shortwave and longwave radiation at the vegetation or soil surface g is sensible heat flux conducted into the ground and h is sensible to heat flux convected into the air the surface energy balance is internally calibrated using ground based reference et that is based on local weather or gridded weather data such as nldas datasets to reduce computational biases inherent in remotely sensed energy balance allen et al 2007 the fundamental principle underlying metric is that evaporating liquids absorb heat the difference in these three terms above rn g and h represents the amount of energy absorbed during the conversion of liquid water to vapor 3 2 2 3 soil moisture active passive smap smap smap 2015 a nasa mission in response to the national research council s decadal survey launched in 2015 makes global measurements of the soil moisture present at the earth s and surface smap provides a capability for global mapping of soil moisture with good accuracy resolution and coverage the satellite measures direct sensing of soil moisture in the top 5 cm of the soil column with radiometers entekhabi et al 2010 piepmeier et al 2017 nasa has produced the smap data at four different levels in this work we use level 4 smap reichle 2018 reichle et al 2017 the only level integrating the root zone with a reasonable spatial resolution and a sufficient time series of observation to perform comparisons with the simulations in this study chan et al 2016 demonstrated that smap is in good agreement with ground measurements 3 3 watershed dynamics and trends our analyses are focused on studying the impacts of extreme changes in climatic conditions on the spatiotemporal evolutions of the snowpack process based fluxes connecting the land surface to the subsurface e g et and infiltration pressure heads and water storage surface water and groundwater storages are calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 storage sw i 1 n sw δ x i δ y i ψ i where storage sw is the surface water storage n sw is the total number of river cells δ x i and δ y i are discretizations along the x and y directions respectively i is of cell and ψ i is the pressure head note that because parflow clm is an integrated hydrologic model only surface cells whose pressure is greater than 0 are taken into account in the surface water storage summation 2 storage gw i 1 n gw δ x i δ y i δ z i ψ i s s i ϕ i where storage gw is the groundwater storage n gw is the total number of subsurface saturated cells δ z i is the discretization along the vertical direction the cell s s i is the specific storage and ϕ i the porosity in addition to better understanding the changing of hydrological conditions in response to these end member climatic conditions our study evaluates the interconnection between the different hydrological reservoirs as well as all the timing and magnitude of processes leading to the movement of water from the subsurface to the lower atmosphere insights from these simulation results offer a better understanding of how water dynamics across california may change in the future 4 results and discussion in this section comparisons between model outputs swe soil moisture and et and satellite based products and simulated and measured groundwater and surface levels are shown as part of the model validation we further study and explain the yearly variation of these outputs of interest as well as their spatial distributions 4 1 comparisons between model outputs and satellite based products and measurements in addition to comparing the absolute values of the above metrics in time and space comparisons between model outputs local measurements and remotely sensed data will be based on the evaluation of the following metrics i absolute differences are given by 3 l 1 i j x mes i j x sim i j where l 1 i j is the absolute difference associated with cell i and time j x mes i j is the measured or remotely sensed data and x sim i j the simulated value ii relative differences l 2 i j are given by 4 l 2 i j x mes i j x sim i j x mes i j iii we also calculated the pearson correlation coefficient to study the linear correlation between our model and the available data 4 1 1 comparisons with local measurements of surface and groundwater pressure heads fig 3 a illustrates the comparison between measured and simulated surface pressure heads results obtained with parflow clm are in reasonable agreement with measurements in general simulated surface pressure heads signals are smoother than measured signals we calculated the time average of the absolute l 1 and relative l 2 differences between measurements and simulations for the three stations see table 2 the station cnf located upstream in the sierra mountains has a time average l 1 and l 2 equal to 0 8 m and 0 5 respectively due to its location water levels variations reach approximately 7 m in the wet year while they never exceed 4 m in the intrusion and the central valley the mhb station has the lowest time average l 1 and l 2 equal to 0 4 m and 0 36 respectively we noticed that while the model indicates that the pressure head significantly increases in the wet year measurements show that the highest pressure head in the wet year is equal to the highest of the dry year several reasons may be responsible for such an observation including instrumentation errors or water management effects as these measured values are indicative of a kind of threshold the station mfr located on the outskirts of the city of sacramento has the greatest l 2 value equal to 0 8 m measurements values marked by many peaks are very different from the mhb station the large errors might be related to the location of this station close to the city the water regulators could impose water levels variations in the river such regulations are not taken into account in the model however note that the majority of signal peaks occur at the same time in the model as in the measurements comparisons between measured and simulated pressure heads with respect to the bottom of the domain at depth of 80 m are shown in fig 3b table 2 lists l 1 and l 2 values due to the uncertainties in the spatial and temporal variations of pumping rates it is difficult to reproduce the measured groundwater levels piezometers 3 and 4 located in the upper part of the central valley show the best match with measurements i e the lowest absolute and relative errors we noted the piezometer with the best match 3 is the only piezometer in the area with more than 100 years of biweekly monitoring measured groundwater levels at this piezometer show that pressure heads decrease from year to year as calculated in the model for the other piezometers with errors greater than 1 m model results show an increase of groundwater pressure heads in the winter of the wet year 2017 while measurements indicate that the pressure head is not increasing during the wet year such behavior can be explained by a lack of reported pumping we also notice that for these piezometers the decrease in the water table levels observed in summer seems to be shifted in time these comparisons allow us to conclude that the developed model is able to simulate surface and groundwater levels variations and trends in the next sections we will investigate the ability of the model to capture land surface processes swe soil moisture and et as computed by clm 4 1 2 comparisons with remote sensing products 4 1 2 1 comparisons with snodas fig 4 a shows the comparisons between averaged total swe obtained with parflow clm snodas and bair et al s reconstruction through the three water years of interest in general the results obtained with snodas and parflow clm are in good agreement where the peaks as well as the periods without snow are consistent between the two approaches the differences between the two models are most pronounced in the heavy snowfall year the water year 2017 for this year both models reproduce the first peak however the representation of snow in snodas shows trends of faster melting snow in comparison to parflow clm results the time average of l 1 of snodas is equal to 3 09 mm whereas the one associated with bair et al s reconstruction data is 3 80 mm l 2 as well as the correlation coefficient associated with snodas table 2 indicates that the results obtained with the model are more close to snodas than bair et al s reconstruction compared to bair et al s reconstruction the model outputs overestimate swe in the wet year even though the water year 2017 is wet and cold bair et al s reconstruction indicates that the swe for the water year 2017 is slightly superior to the swe of the dry year 2016 within our area of interest the differences of swe obtained with bair et al s reconstruction and parflow clm outputs might due to the spatial resolution of the meteorological forcing bair et al 2016 downscaled nldas data and accounted for elevation changes whereas in the hydrologic model the meteorological forcings are homogeneous over a 14 km resolution grid for the first water year 2015 the differences between parflow clm and snodas are small less than 5 mm swe obtained with snodas are greater than the ones obtained with parflow clm contrary to the water years 2016 and 2017 where the estimated swe obtained with parflow clm is much greater than snodas data the differences can reach 30 mm this difference is most evident during periods of when snowmelt in parflow clm is more rapid than in snodas nevertheless the two results remain in good agreement indicating that our model is capturing the temporal evolution of swe 4 1 2 2 comparisons with metric metric provides actual et values at the daily time step and a spatial resolution up to 30 m however these values are not continuous in time as only a selected number of days is publicly available we compare the relative change of et obtained with parflow clm and metric dataset by normalizing the time series from 0 1 see fig 4b normalization allows us to directly compare the trends in the two time series signals which is most important in assessing the physics based behavior of the system we also limit our comparison to the temporal evolution of the relative variation of domain averaged evapotranspiration since the resolutions of the two datasets parflow clm and metric are quite different in general the results obtained with the two models are very similar for the first two water years 2015 and 2016 which are during the drought however for the water year 2017 which was very wet the metric data indicate a relative variation of et much lower than that of parflow clm the higher relative et simulated by parflow clm is likely due to the integrated nature of the model and the physics of the simulation which allow for water withdrawal from deeper reserves of groundwater in contrast metric calculates an actual et based on a surface energy balance and the type of vegetation neglecting the movement of water in the subsurface and its feedback in the atmosphere such a disparity in these approaches can lead to very different results especially during a dry period followed by a wet period where the three dimensional connection of soil moisture and subsurface saturation to the atmosphere can be very important the calculated l 1 and l 2 show that there is a good agreement between the model and metric however we obtained a low pearson correlation coefficient equal to 0 6 of the two datasets this might due to the strong temporal variations of et 4 1 2 3 comparisons with smap smap data are only available for two years between october 2015 and october 2017 and thus are compared to parflow clm simulations for this time frame only comparisons between smap level 4 which computes the soil moisture within the top 1 m of the land surface is derived by considering measurements of soil moisture coming from radiometers but also a geophysical model to account for the soil moisture within the root zone which is set to 1 m reichle 2018 reichle et al 2017 the spatial resolution of smap is 9 km with outputs every 3 hours to compare the simulated parflow clm model output to smap we compare the scaled variation of soil moisture obtained by normalizing each time series onto a scale between 0 and 1 this normalization is necessary because when looking at the exact values on large scales e g at the 9 km resolution of smap data the parametric uncertainties will have a lower impact on the relative variations than on the exact values fig 4c shows the comparisons between relative variations of soil moisture obtained with parflow clm and smap level 4 which show that the relative variations of soil moisture obtained with the two methods are generally in good agreement with each other our results show that the relative variations between the two models are most similar during summer during winter soil moisture obtained with parflow clm shows strong fluctuations while soil moisture obtained with smap is smoother this is possibly due to the more resolved time step used in the parflow clm 1 hour versus that of smap 3 hours but also the dynamics taken into account in this physics based model beneath 1 m which are not represented in smap contrary to smap parflow clm solves hydrodynamics in the entire system including the deeper vadose zone and groundwater these fluctuations can thus be related to the sharp variations of water content from dry to wet conditions inherent to the resolution of the flow in the vadose zone nevertheless the generally good agreement of the soil moisture variations indicates that the model is correctly reproducing the trends of water content in the soil through time moreover the correlation coefficient shown in table 2 equal to 0 94 indicates that the two results are in agreement 4 2 cosumnes watershed dynamics 4 2 1 actual evapotranspiration fig 5 depicts the time evolution of simulated actual et for the three water years of interest we represent the daily averaged trend of these variations since et values show sharp fluctuations due to the strong hourly variations diurnal cycling and correlations to short term weather conditions simulated actual et for water years 2015 and 2016 are similar while the variation of total et for the water year 2017 the wettest year is greater than the two previous dry years as shown in the preceding paragraphs the precipitation in the 2017 water year is at least twice as large as that of the previous dry years recall that although the 2017 water year is wet the summers are still hot a wet winter leads to wet soil and shallow vadose zone and therefore a sufficient quantity of water to satisfy the strong evaporative demand resulting in a high level of et fig 6 a c shows the spatial distribution of the annual average of actual et for the three water years studied as observed in the analysis of the global variation of actual et per year the wettest water year 2017 is the year with the highest rate of et however we can observe that the trend of the spatial distribution of actual et remains the same over the years and is attributed to mostly differences in land use and land cover but also other factors such as underlying geologic unit topography and proximity to rivers or streams unsurprisingly the forestlands of the sierra nevada mountains have the greatest values of actual et vicinity to the rivers throughout the forests is also important due to the higher availability of water the city of sacramento located at the northwest limit of the watershed has relatively low et compared to the rest of the area the spatial distribution of et is very heterogeneous within the agricultural region of the central valley indeed we can see that the alfalfa fields located at the southwestern end of the model are characterized by a very weak annual et value unlike the pasture fields located at the center portion of the model whose annual et value is very high fig 6d and 6e show the average annual percent change in et relative to the average annual et of the water year 2015 the relative change in et δ et i is computed using the following equation 5 δ et i et i 2015 et i y et i 2015 100 0 where et i 2015 is the annual average of the et of the cell i in 2015 and et i y the annual average of et of the cell i for the water year y y being either 2016 or 2017 as expected one can see that the percent change of et is lower for the dry year 2016 fig 6d where regions of the sierra nevada mountain forests and the city of sacramento experience the highest yearly change of annual et on the order of approximately 10 for the wet year 2017 fig 6e et is at least 20 higher throughout most of the domain additionally large portions of the sierra nevada mountains show high increases in et with some regions of the mountains exhibiting a relative change of et greater than 60 most notably where plutonic rocks exist in the model et changes in the central valley are lower than those in the mountains but are still substantial in 2017 water year average annual et of grape crops change from anywhere between 35 and 60 a variation almost equal to the variation in the sierra nevada mountains and greater than the variation of pasture crops around 20 this indicates that although grapes are characterized by a relatively small amount of et compared to other land use types their changes in et patterns are more sensitive to weather conditions compared to other crops such as pasturelands the spatial trends observed in fig 6d versus those in fig 6e are slightly different while the cosumnes river and its tributaries show a lower annual change in et in the water year 2016 less than 5 et is these areas change by more than 30 in the wet water year 2017 because after a wet water year the water storage in the cosumnes river and its tributaries mainly fed by snowmelt is high the water available to meet the evaporative demand is high the highest percent change in et occurring in the water year 2016 take place across the majority of the sierra nevada mountain range whereas the location of the greatest percent change in the water year 2017 occurs mostly in topographically and geologically distinct areas indicative of groundwater and surface water convergence after a wet winter water will converge towards these areas and will increase soil moisture and the water availability evaporative demand is not water limited in these situations and as a consequence actual et increases the changes in et are higher in the sierra nevada mountains than in the central valley because in the former the presence of pumping wells make et less sensitive to the changes in climate our results show that variations in extreme climate events will impact the et export of water in certain regions of a watershed more than others and that the degree to which a specific region is vulnerable to climate extreme is related to many factors including topography hydrologic connection to adjacent groundwater and surface water bodies pumping and irrigation geologic unit type and parameterization and land use type 4 2 2 surface water as expected the peak surface water storage of the wettest water year 2017 is approximately twice as large as the peak of the previous year fig 7 a annual variation of surface water storage is directly linked to the fluctuation of precipitation and thus the difference between different water years is most prevalent in the winter season in the summer surface water storage is approximately equivalent for all the three water years i e during baseflow conditions reflecting an equilibrium condition of the surface flow dynamic regardless of the amount of moisture in the system during the winter such behavior is typical of watersheds located in an area where winters are cool and wet and the summers are hot and dry jan et al 2004 maurer and duffy 2005 mount et al 2001 moyle et al 2003 4 2 3 groundwater fig 7b shows that the time evolutions of the groundwater and surface water storages have similar trends with regards to peak storage an analysis of daily variations in groundwater storage for the three years shows that these variations are different the water year 2015 is characterized by a groundwater storage peak that occurs early december january while the groundwater storage peak occurs in february and april during the 2016 and 2017 water years this is due to the temporal variation of precipitation for the different water years as shown in section 2 1 precipitation starts earlier in 2015 than in the other water years groundwater storage dynamics between the three simulated water years also reveal interesting trends related to the rate of aquifer rebound in the presence of a precipitation event as shown in fig 7b the shape of the groundwater storage curve in the second year of the drought the water year 2016 is very dissimilar to those of the other water years the shape of the water year 2015 groundwater storage curve has trends similar to those of the associated surface water storage curve fig 7a where individual precipitation events or clusters of events show clear rise and fall signatures in both metrics in contrast the dry antecedent moisture condition of the previous water year influences the shape of the water year 2016 groundwater storage curve to be dampened and unlike that of the associated surface water curve most notably in the first half of the water year groundwater storage significantly increases in the winter during the wet year 2017 with a peak twice as large as the one occurring during the previous dry year however regardless of the magnitude of winter precipitation within a given water year the receding tail of the storage curve shows trends towards nearly equivalent storage values in the summer during the drought water years interestingly the groundwater storage quantity during the summer after the wet 2017 water year shows slightly lower groundwater storage than the storage measured at this point of the year during the drought this is due to the combined effects of 1 the resulting actual et after a wet winter that is so high as discussed in section 4 2 1 and the subsurface will keep losing water therefore its storage decreases and 2 the groundwater pumping rates in the central valley that are high enough and their effects on aquifer depletion intensify from year to year as the size of the vadose zone increases fig 8 depicts the spatial distribution of the relative variation of pressure head at the lowest layer at time a indicated in fig 8b with respect to the pressure head at the same period at the initial condition of the three year simulation the water year 2014 we calculated the relative distribution of pressure head using the following equation 6 δ ψ i ψ i t 0 ψ i t ψ i t 0 where δ ψ i is the relative variation of pressure head at cell i ψ i t 0 is the pressure head of the cell i at 09 30 2013 and ψ i t corresponds to the pressure head at time t where t is 2015 2016 and 2017 at fraction of water year of 0 8 the spatial distribution of the relative variation of the pressure head indicates that the yearly variation of pressure head is less than 1 in the majority of the cosumnes watershed despite the wet year and its high pressure head in winter the pressure head as well as the storage returns to back to a baseline value this is due to the increase of et during the wet year even though the pressure head increases two fold during a wet year the resulting et during the summer is twice which inhibits the effect of the wet year see eqs 5 and 6 note however that these relative variations of pressure head remain higher in the plutonic rocks of the sierra nevada characterized by the highest changes in et as discussed in section 4 2 1 and close to the pumping wells indicating that the effects of pumping wells are hardly masked by the preceding heavy precipitation in the winter indeed the footprint of pumping increases over the years see fig 8 explaining the decrease in storage our study assumes 1 that the annual pumping rate is the same for three years and that 2 the location of these pumping wells is approximate an accurate evaluation of the pumping rate as well as their location might lead to a different map of pressure head distribution nevertheless depletion of groundwater resources in california has been documented in many studies famiglietti et al 2011 which strengthens the general findings in this study storage does not increase despite the increase of a heavy precipitation year our work also demonstrates that this decrease of water storage in this representative california watershed is more related to anthropogenic activities than climate extremes conditions to further assess the decrease of groundwater storage due to these anthropogenic effects and to understand why storage decreases after the wet water year an identical baseline parflow clm simulation was performed without irrigation and pumping the impact of simulated groundwater depletion rates within the central valley and the compounding effect on storage through time is quantified in fig 9 which shows the relative difference see eq 7 between the baseline and pumping irrigation case for the three water years of interest 7 δ s t o r a g e gw t storage gw simulation t storage gw baseline t storage gw simulation t where δ s t o r a g e gw t is the relative difference of the total groundwater storage of groundwater at time t storage gw baseline t is total groundwater storage obtained with the baseline simulation at time t and storage gw simulation t is the total groundwater storage obtained with the simulation with pumping and irrigation at time t in general a 5 10 decrease in storage is observed in the pumping irrigation case compared to the baseline simulation a depleting groundwater storage trend should therefore be evident in the results shown in fig 7b if it was not for the approximately 2 and 4 increase in precipitation in the 2016 and 2017 water years respectively following the drought to assess the effect of climate extreme years on local water table dynamics we selected three different points in the central valley locations shown in fig 1c labeled points a b and c to study their temporal dynamics these points allow us to understand the changes in groundwater levels at different locations ranging from those upstream to those downstream of the cosumnes river like the global variation in groundwater storage dry years are characterized by lower magnitude peaks compared to wet years regardless of whether the winter was after a dry or wet year the water level in the subsurface decreases in summer to reach equilibrium conditions that are nearly identical from year to year the three points show similar temporal variations as indicated in fig 10 the peaks as well as the decreases in pressure head occur at the same time however the amplitudes of the pressure head variation for the three points are different our results show that for the points located in the upper part of the central valley the magnitudes of variation are smaller and water table levels vary significantly in the lower part of the central valley as indicated by the variations at points a and b this is mainly due to the geological characteristics of the aquifer where point c is located in an area with lower hydraulic conductivity which leads to a small amount of infiltration and movement of water to understand how seasonality affects the spatial distribution of groundwater and surface water pressure head fig 11 shows simulated pressure head distribution of the bottom corresponding to the lowest layer of the model for winter a and summer b conditions of the water year 2017 the same spatial distributions have been observed for the water years 2015 and 2016 therefore those results are not shown for succinctness as discussed previously see discussion of the relative variation of pressure in fig 8 the difference between these years is mainly in the amplitude of variation of the storage not its spatial distribution from year to year points with the highest pressure heads sierra nevada mountains as well as those associated with low pressure heads volcanic intrusion depressions created by pumping wells in the upper part remain the same spatial distributions of pressure head fig 11a and b highlight three different zones in the region the central valley the sierra nevada mountains and an intermediate zone characterized by an intrusion of volcanic rocks with very low permeability as shown in the geological map see fig 1c for the geological map due to the geological contrast of these three zones we can observe that the flow has an east west direction in the intermediate zone while the flow direction is from north to south in the sierra and the central valley the intermediate zone plays the role of a barrier and tends to block any subsurface flow from the sierra nevada mountains to the central valley due to its very low permeability such behavior may suggest that these three areas are completely independent which is not the case as demonstrated by the spatial distribution of the pressure head at the surface fig 11c and d the cosumnes river which takes its source in the sierra nevada mountains and is mainly fed by the snowmelt crosses the intermediate zone as well as the central valley interactions between the river and the subsurface within the domain establish a link between the different zones pressure head distributions change significantly between winter and summer in the sierra nevada mountains and the central valley while the latter remains almost constant in the intermediate zone between the two inter seasonal variations are more important in the sierra nevada mountains where winter to summer pressure head variations can reach 40 m because mountains receive a large amount of winter precipitation in this area the geological characteristics and associated low permeability and storage result in high reactivity i e high variations of pressure following a rainfall event the pressure increases very quickly these areas are also located in forestlands which are characterized by high degrees of et thus during the summer the strong et flux in combination with the low storage hydrodynamic properties of the zone leads to a very low pressure head in the central valley this area where inter seasonal variations in pressure head are less marked than in the mountains the footprint of pumping wells is evident regardless of the season we note however that in the lower part of the central valley winter precipitation masks the effects of pumping whereas in the upper part of the central valley i e at the boundary of the intermediate zone the depression created by the pumping wells remains pronounced in both winter and summer seasons because of the almost zero contribution of the lateral flows near this barrier zone the depression is hardly blurred in the spatial distribution maps this is in contrast to the lower part of the watershed where the greater degree of lateral flow homogenizes the pressure field in the absence of pumping during the winter the dynamics of the cosumnes river depend mainly on the meteorological conditions of the sierra nevada mountains as in other parts of the state the cosumnes river depends upon just a few storms to produce the majority of annual runoff whipple et al 2017 a large part of this river is thus perennial because during summer after the snowmelt occurs and in the absence of precipitation the river is not fed as shown by fig 11c and d in winter the drainage area is much larger and water levels can are higher even in the mountainous areas meanwhile in summer the flow is almost exclusively in the central valley as a result many tributaries of the river disappear consistent with observations mount et al 2001 5 conclusions in this work we used a parallelized physically based integrated hydrologic model in a high performance computing framework to assess the impact of climate extremes characterized by a severe drought followed by extreme precipitation events recently observed in a representative california watershed we constructed and validated a model of the cosumnes watershed located in northern california a unique watershed given the un dammed nature of one of the last freely flowing major rivers in the state the watershed also allows studying the complete picture of the hydrology in california including snow dynamics land surface processes surface runoff and groundwater aquifers the simulated model has a high spatiotemporal resolution we incorporated several publicly available datasets as well as discussion with stakeholders to develop the model as a method of model validation we performed several comparisons between model outputs and local in situ measurements groundwater levels and river heights and satellite based products simulated swe was compared to snodas and an alternative swe map reconstruction method bair et al 2016 soil moisture was compared with smap and actual et was compared with metric the reasonably good agreement of the model outputs with satellite based products and local measurements indicates that the model is correctly reproducing the trends of pressure head soil moisture swe and actual et through time enabling confidence in its ability to elucidate feedbacks in critical zone processes the dynamics of the cosumnes river depend mainly on the snowmelt originating from the sierra nevada mountains annual variation of surface water storage is therefore directly linked to the fluctuation of precipitation surface water storage differences between dry and wet water years occur in the winter season in the summer surface water storage is approximately equivalent for all the water years reflecting base flow conditions this is not the case for the total groundwater storage which shows a decrease in time despite the occurrence of a wet water year this is in contrast to what one might expect especially given the presumably high potential for the wettest year on california record to negate the effects of the severe period of drought our results show that groundwater depletion during the wet year is a result of the combined effects of 1 sustained groundwater pumping in the central valley and 2 higher rates of actual et in wetter conditions results show that the pumping occurring in this region is so high that the effect on aquifer depletion compounds from year to year during the wet year a large amount of precipitation leads to a wet shallow subsurface as such the resulting actual et is high which actually leads to a depletion of total storage this is partially because the summer remains hot and dry regardless of whether the preceding winter is wet or dry and thus et is water limited following the dry winter and not following the wet one simulations from our model show that the vulnerability of a specific region to climate extreme depends on a number of factors including topography hydrologic connection to adjacent groundwater and surface water bodies geologic unit type and land use type our results also show that for a dry to wet year transition regions within the watershed characterized by plutonic rocks and located in topographic depressions have the highest sensitivity to et these sensitivities are a result of many interconnected hydrologic processes hence the need for an integrated modeling approach such as the one demonstrated here our study also highlighted that due to the interconnectivity of the snow dynamics surface water and groundwater as well as the often neglected hydrologic connection between the sierra nevada mountains and the central valley an integrated hydrologic model is required to fully understand the hydrodynamics of californian watersheds under a changing climate in this study we estimated pumping and irrigation rates and locations by taking into account land use as defined by each county and approximations made by parcel size although the magnitude of pumping and irrigation was estimated trends in groundwater storage show reasonable agreement with observations however future work will require increased accuracy in pumping and irrigation datasets including changes in inter annual pumping trends based on yearly climate fluctuations if local variations of pressure are desired future studies would also benefit from meteorological forcing with a resolution close to that of the model in order to sufficiently describe an accurate spatial distribution of snow et and localized recharge finally in this work we focused on the transition from intense dry to extreme wet conditions future studies will investigate the opposite change i e from wet to dry conditions and

up the yearly variations of surface and groundwater storages fig a1 show that a two years of relaxation period is sufficient to stabilize the system surface water storage returns to equilibrium baseflow conditions in summer when the rain stops no excess flow due to higher initial conditions or yearly increase of storage due to lower initial conditions is observed for groundwater storage the

were sufficient to negate the effects of initial conditions appendix b data availability in the cosumnes watershed one of the main limitations for quantitatively analyzing water resources in california is the lack of data indeed there is no legislation that mandates the reporting of water use and monitoring to date there are two publicly available databases usgs and dwr which includes cdec in the cosumnes watershed these databases consist of around 100 groundwater wells and 12 river gauges see fig b1 however very few wells continuously measure water changes as some wells have just been reported and do not have any data selected river gauges table b1 describes the temporal availability of data for the 12 river stations we can notice that the majority of the usgs stations do not have any data within our period of interest only three cdec stations cnf mfr and mhb continuously measure changes in the water level in the basin these three selected stations are shown in fig b2 selected groundwater observation wells the number of reported groundwater wells is greater than the number of river stations however the majority of these wells do not have any data which is contrary to the river gauges less than twenty wells represented by the stars in fig b2 have data i e at a single time or at several time intervals for our comparisons we selected four piezometers for which

5999,groundwater flooding is a phenomenon which has become recognised as a significant natural hazard in recent years the gort lowland karst catchment situated in south co galway on the western coast of ireland has experienced two extreme groundwater flood events in the past decade leading to considerable damage and disruption groundwater flooding in the catchment typically occurs following periods of sustained heavy rainfall when sufficient capacity is not available in the bedrock to store and convey water to the sea the underground karst conduit system therefore surcharges to the ground surface through a system of estavelles and floods low lying areas of ground known as turloughs ephemeral lakes a 1d 2d pipe network model of the karst conduit system of the gort lowland karst was developed in order to simulate the flooding mechanisms across the catchment as well as to assess flood alleviation options the nature of the underground karstic connections in the system has been determined from a combination of available field data dye tracing water chemistry data etc and cross frequency analysis on the turlough fluctuation time series data over several years the availability of high accuracy lidar data of the catchment then allowed the flooding regime to be accurately simulated on the ground surface the model was calibrated using historic continuous water level data for a number of turloughs in the catchment and then validated using historic peak spot flood levels the model was then used to identify appropriate potential groundwater flood alleviation measures for the catchment the impacts of such measures on both the salinity of kinvara bay through increased freshwater discharges and eco hydrology of the protected wetland habitats within the turloughs was also investigated the study demonstrated that the measures proposed can be developed without inducing undesirable impacts to either salinity in kinvara bay and thus mariculture or to the protected turlough habitats the study has also demonstrated the suitability and functionality of such karst models for examining groundwater flood management options and eco hydrology in karst catchments keywords groundwater flooding karst modelling groundwater flood alleviation submarine groundwater discharge 1 introduction groundwater flooding has gained widespread recognition as a natural hazard in recent decades following extensive damage to property and infrastructure across europe in the winter of 2000 2001 finch et al 2004 pinault et al 2005 hughes et al 2011 significant groundwater flooding also occurred in the uk at oxford 2007 and at berkshire downs and chilterns 2014 and in galway ireland in 2009 2015 2016 naughton et al 2017 whilst groundwater flooding rarely poses a risk to human life it typically causes damage and disruption over a long duration particularly when compared to fluvial flooding morris et al 2008 cobby et al 2009 the main mechanisms by which groundwater flooding occurs can be summarised as inundation of river floodplains caused by the saturation of alluvium deposits adjacent to a main river channel finch et al 2004 groundwater rebound whereby the groundwater table rapidly rises following a reduction cessation in abstraction from large aquifers causing flooding of subsurface structures such as basements or tunnels macdonald et al 2014 and increases in groundwater levels in bedrock aquifers which causes the water table to reach the ground surface and flood low lying basins and valleys finch et al 2004 naughton et al 2012 groundwater flooding events in ireland predominantly occurs within the lowland karstified limestone areas of the west of the country naughton et al 2012 naughton et al 2018 via the third mechanism described above the flooding is inherently linked to the underlying bedrock geology where extensive interactions between ground and surface waters predominate with sinking and rising rivers streams common with surface water features absent completely in many areas drew 2008 the dominant drainage path for many areas of the catchment is through the karstified limestone bedrock however the limited storage within such secondary porosity dominated rocks means that the fractures or conduits within the limestone are unable to drain the recharge fast enough during intense or prolonged rainfall the result being surcharging of groundwater above the surface this flood water is usually contained within low lying topographic depressions known as turloughs which represent the principal form of extensive recurrent groundwater flooding in ireland coxon 1987a coxon 1987b in ireland the most susceptible region to groundwater flooding is the gort lowlands in south galway which is a lowland karst catchment covering an area of approximately 500 km2 naughton et al 2018 modelling karst systems is a complex task and has been the subject of continuing research globally hartmann 2017 there is a broad range of different modelling approaches to simulate karst hydrology however these can be generally be grouped into three categories which are differentiated by their level of complexity input data requirements and or the accuracy of their output lumped or reservoir approaches provide a conceptual model designed to simulate the aquifer outflow usually spring discharge as well as water level variations within the karst conduit system the saturated bedrock zone kong a siou et al 2014 hartmann 2017 these models are usually implemented by representing the karst system which includes both the epikarst and conduit zones as well as the overlying subsoil unsaturated zone by a series of reservoirs each of these reservoirs contain different controlling parameters and represent different inflows and outflows within the karst system typically different reservoirs are used to represent zones such as the fast and slow soil infiltration the epikarst and the conduit zones fleury et al 2009 semi distributed models aim to address this general simplification of the catchment by acknowledging that the variability of the spatial input information and the catchment properties have significant impacts on the hydrologic responses of the system semi distributed models usually sub divide the catchment into area averaged input data where the distributed properties such as the land cover soil type and precipitation are lumped into discrete zones or points which aims to more accurately represent how the catchment operates an example of a semi distributed model is the varkarst model which considers the spatial variability of karst system properties by distribution functions representing the soil epikarst and karst bedrock hartmann et al 2013 the soil storage takes account of the soil moisture budget allowing the seasonal changes to be accounted for overland runoff can also be included between model elements this model was found to outperform a calibrated lumped reservoir routing model when both were applied to the same catchment hartmann 2017 mayaud et al 2019 recently demonstrated the use of a semi distributed pipe network model for simulating flooding in karst poljes in slovenia which are similar to irish turloughs physically based distributed models are capable of accounting for all of the spatial distribution of meteorological conditions precipitation evapotranspiration etc and physical parameters e g soil saturation land cover properties etc throughout the catchment and have the advantage of being an accurate representation of the entire catchment in order to fully benefit from the added complexity of a fully distributed model this approach requires a wealth of input data throughout the catchment which is often not readily available this data requirement together with the danger of over parameterisation however often leads to poor model calibration in fact it has been reported that a lumped model generally outperforms a fully distributed model except in rigorously studied catchments hartmann 2017 smith et al 2019 extensive flooding associated within the turloughs across the south galway karst limestone lowlands of ireland is known to have occurred on six occasions over the past 20 years 1989 1990 1991 1994 1995 2009 and 2015 2016 the flooding in 2009 was the most severe on record until it was surpassed in many areas by the events of 2015 the two most recent flood events led to considerable damage disruption and hardship for local residents and farmers over 24 km2 of land was flooded for up to 6 months with many residents and farms cut off due to roads being impassable for extended periods this study was therefore proposed with the aim to better understand the occurrence and behaviour of these flood events as well providing insight and guidance with respect to potential alleviation measures a combination of limited records and detail of historic groundwater flooding coupled with a lack of data regarding flow within the karst bedrock renders the development of a karst model representing the system to be a challenging and unique task 2 materials and methods 2 1 catchment description the gort lowlands catchment covers an area of approximately 500 km2 in south co galway on the western coast of ireland three river systems discharge runoff from adjacent mountains to the lowland karst catchment and another smaller river drains to the catchment from the border of the burren limestone pavement to the south the surface hydrology of the gort lowlands becomes extremely complex once these four rivers flow into the catchment due to the karstified nature of the limestone bedrock the hydrogeology and surface hydrology of the gort lowlands are therefore closely linked due to the extensive bedrock karstification with water exchanged between the surface and subsurface in large volumes throughout the catchment through sinking streams swallow holes large springs and river risings the entire catchment drains to a number of intertidal springs at kinvara bay through the karst limestone bedrock see fig 2 a comprehensive description of the catchment and its complex hydrogeology is given in naughton et al 2018 2 2 model setup calibration this present study created a new expanded pipe network model of the semi distributive model of the complex karst system within the gort lowlands that had been developed over a 10 year period for five turloughs gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 the conceptual model was initially informed by extensive tracing studies previously carried out within the catchment southern water global 1998 flows within the main rivers meteorology across the catchment and water hydrochemistry allowed a deeper understanding of the system and how it operates time series analyses of the fluctuating turlough water levels were subsequently undertaken this revealed additional hydraulic characteristics regarding the nature of the catchment gill et al 2013b such as whether the turloughs act as surcharge tanks or not and whether a turlough is connected to the mainline system or is located offline an additional 10 turloughs and floodplains were added to the model and the model catchment was expanded from 95 8 km2 to 159 2 km2 an additional inflow from the cloonteen river located to the south west of the catchment was also added to the model which was identified as a lacunae during previous modelling efforts mccormack et al 2014 fig 2 below identifies the turloughs and floodplains contained within the model and the locations of the various river inputs fig 1 presents a schematic overview of all elements of the model development and calibration process undertaken within this study including the various data inputs each of the various data inputs and steps involved in the model development and calibration process are further described in the following sections 2 2 1 model inputs rainfall data were available from two tipping bucket arg100 rain gauges which were previously installed at kilchreest in the lowlands 70 mod and francis gap in the slieve aughty mountains elevation 250 mod gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 the data were available intermittently between 2007 and 2016 however many gaps existed within the dataset due to periods of instrumentation failure or periods of in operation the data from other rain gauges in the area operated by met eireann were therefore also gathered in order to provide comparison with the two project gauges and to determine a means for obtaining a complete dataset the gort derrybrien gauge presented the longest rainfall dataset within the catchment with data available from 1982 although rainfall was only available at daily frequency in order to fill in missing gaps in the dataset from 2007 to 2018 data the gort derrybrien gauge was utilised and redistributed from daily to hourly using the shannon and athenry gauges as metrics a correlation analysis indicated that gort derrybrien daily totals were moderately correlated with both the shannon and athenry gauges with pearson correlation coefficients of 0 60 and 0 55 respectively the redistribution process involved taking the daily total at gort derrybrien and dividing it over each hour of the day in the same hourly proportion observed at shannon on the same date for days where rainfall occurred at gort derrybrien but not at shannon the athenry guage was utilised for a very small number of dates rainfall occurred at derrybrien but did not occur at either shannon or athenry and in this circumstance a uniform 24 h distribution was utilised a sensitivity analysis was carried out comparing the simulated river hydrographs for a period when data was available at kilchreest and francis gap using actual observations with gort derrybrien data redistributed using the three metrics described above and no appreciable change in either the timing or extent of hydrographs were observed the redistributed data were therefore used to supplement the kilchreest and francis gap datasets which were required for generating river inputs 2 2 2 river rating curves hydrometric data the flows in the three main rivers draining the slieve aughty mountains and the cloonteen river were constantly measured at respective gauging stations operated by the office of public works opw these gauges consist of a pressure transducer embedded into the river referenced against a staff gauge at the stream edge rating curves i e flow against stage relationship were previously developed for each of the three gauging stations on the rivers flowing off the slieve aughty mountains gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 a number of flow measurements were also taken on the cloonteen river during 2017 and these measurements were supplemented using referenced data collected during the original gort flood study southern water global 1998 to allow a rating curve to be developed a number of additional flow measurements were undertaken during 2017 and 2018 by the opw and these measurements served to validate the existing rating curves but did not increase the range of gauged flows 2 2 3 rainfall runoff models in order to fill any intermittent gaps in the river flows which were used to calculate allogenic inflows to the main karst model rainfall runoff rr models were required these models were developed on mike11 nam dhi software which is a single catchment watershed lumped parameter model for simulating rainfall runoff and the hydrological cycle developing a rr model within mike11 nam requires simple catchment descriptors with rainfall and potential evaporation as inputs that are then calibrated against a known discharge runoff calibration is achieved by adjusting nine parameters relating to the surface rootzone and groundwater within controlled bounds the calibration period chosen for each river contained a minimum of one hydrological year which also contained a number of representative peaks in discharge runoff during calibration initial parameters were selected based on previous work by others gill et al 2013a o brien et al 2013 mccormack et al 2014 and the model was run in auto calibration mode the model simulation results during calibration were checked for coefficient of optimisation r2 and visually analysed for degree of agreement between simulated and observed runoff the model parameters were then further adjusted to obtain the set of best fit model parameters which could simulate the observed runoff in term of timings peaks and total volume with a high degree of agreement once an acceptable calibration was achieved the model was then run for the period between 2007 and 2016 for validation purposes 2010 2016 for the cloonteen river no logger was installed pre 2010 2 2 4 turlough water level profiles water levels in five turloughs blackrock coy coole garyland caherglassaun within the catchment were measured continuously by pressure transducers as outlined by gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 data were available intermittently between 2007 and 2016 however many gaps existed within the dataset due to periods of instrumentation failure or periods of in operation additional water level monitoring stations were installed at 8 locations within the catchment in 2016 by geological survey ireland gsi with data available for some or all of the period between november 2016 and april 2018 for use within the model calibration and validation in addition water levels within turloughs were manually estimated for specific dates of interest using a combination of sentinel 1 satellite imagery and lidar data sentinel 1 comprises two satellites equipped with c band synthetic aperture radar instruments and are operated by the european space agency under their copernicus programme the extents of flooding at specific dates was visually identified using darker pixel shading within the various bands of the imagery and matched with a corresponding topographical contour to yield a flood elevation 2 2 5 tide level monitoring tide level data for kinvara bay were obtained from the marine institute of ireland for the galway port tide gauge which is located c 15 km to the north tide levels were previously recorded at kinvara bay and compared to the record for galway bay during the same period of time and the levels were found to be comparable albeit with a slight shift of c 15 min in the magnitude of the tide level gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 2 2 6 depth volume area relationships depth area relationships for each of the turloughs and floodplains were computed using arcgis and or infoworks icm software for use within the model the data used to create these depth area and subsequently volume relationships generally consisted of lidar mapping available for the catchment in the form of a digital elevation model dem with a grid spacing of 2 m and a vertical accuracy of 0 15 m this lidar was flown when some of the turloughs contained standing water and therefore accurate topographical data for the bottom of these basins was not available topographical survey data obtained from manual surveys carried out using a trimble 4700 gps system with a minimum accuracy of 0 01 m horizontal and vertical direction were available for a number of the turlough basins in addition bathymetric surveys were also undertaken where permanent water was present to accurately represent the base levels at these locations coole caherglassaun hawkhill and newtown these surveys were carried out using a remote controlled acoustic doppler current profiler adcp integrated with the global positioning system gps to record both vertical depth and horizontal position measurements respectively these topographical data were combined with the available lidar data in arcgis and a new integrated dem was constructed using the kriging method with a 2 m grid spacing and thus accurate depth area relationships were generated for all turlough and floodplain locations 2 2 7 1d pipe network model the pipe network was initially developed with reference to the previously developed model for five turloughs within the catchment by gill et al 2013a a ground model was generated in the infoworks icm software using the dem data discussed above each of the turloughs or floodplains were then represented by storage nodes with a depth area relationship developed using this ground model a total of 15 storage areas were added to the network as shown on fig 2 the initial connections between turloughs and storage areas was informed by the existing model reviewing tracing studies available in the gsi karst database and statistical analysis of time series data collected at these new locations after gill et al 2013b the initial network was adjusted and modified significantly as the calibration process progressed the calibration process was carried out by trial and error with pipe dimensions and the various controls varied in an iterative process rivers were represented using open channels with dimensions approximated from digital mapping and physical surveys overflow channels between basins were added as open channels with dimensions informed by digital mapping physical surveys and maximum flood extents mapping the catchment was divided into sub catchments based on topography and these were connected to the pipe network using conduits and nodes with autogenic recharge applied to these sub catchments using a ground infiltration module with infoworks icm as described by gill et al 2013a whilst the 1d modelling approach described above is considered to be robust and performed very well in terms of matching flooded volumes and flood stages the overland flow between turlough floodplain basins was simplified for incorporation into the 1d environment thus whilst the over spilled volume of water between floodplains that occurred during extreme events could be quantified together with the timing of same there was no capacity to simulate the overland flow paths and accurately represent their associated velocities and corresponding flooded extents outside storage basins the only means to quantify these data is through the use of a 2d model the infoworks icm integrated all source catchment modelling software incorporates 1d 2d coupling capabilities which are typically utilised to simulate fluvial flooding therefore once the expanded 1d model was calibrated it was modified with the addition of 2d zones for modelling capability of the surface overland flows 2 2 8 2d overland pipe network model the development of the 2d overland flow model from the calibrated 1d model required first removing all storage nodes which represented turloughs and floodplains in order to create the 2d aspect of the network high resolution lidar data were used a ground digital elevation model dem was created using a combination of lidar data topographical data and bathymetric data these data were combined arcgis v10 4 1 and a new integrated dem was constructed using the kriging method with a 2 m grid spacing a 2d mesh was then created using this ground model within the model network domain incorporating the full extents of the catchment where overland flooding and flow is known to occur in order to gain efficiencies in model computation terrain sensitive meshing was utilised whereby the resolution of the mesh is increased in areas where large variations in height occur the maximum height variation allowed during the generation of the mesh was 0 25 m in the interest of reducing run times many parameters such as roughness coefficient were kept constant across the 2d surface the 1d pipe network representing flow within the karst bedrock was linked to this 2d mesh using 2d nodes flow between the 2d mesh towards a 1d node and vice versa was based on a standard head discharge relationship modification of the original calibrated 1d model was kept to the minimum required to effectively incorporate these 2d elements with an aim of reducing the recalibration effort required 3 results 3 1 1d model calibration the calibration period was between 01 11 2016 and 31 03 2018 with continuous water level data available during this period for 12 of the 15 locations no data at ballyloughan corker and ballylee shown in fig 2 as the primary objective of this model was for flooding purposes the calibration process particularly focussed on matching the timing and magnitude of the peak surface water levels the calibration process was iterative with the catchment broken into two sections based on elevations and close frequency interactions between turloughs the model calibration was checked for goodness of fit using the nash sutcliffe nse and kling gupta kge model efficiencies for both flood water stage mod and turlough volume m3 a sample model calibration plot of observed flood levels against simulated flood levels for the coole lough is presented in fig 3 below model efficiencies ranging between 0 87 and 0 98 were achieved for water level mod and between 0 77 and 0 99 for volume m3 at all but two locations see table 1 poorer model efficiencies 0 25 0 62 were achieved at the location of large underground river risings at castletown and kiltartan which display extremely flashy behaviour this is due to the sharp interface at these locations between the pressurised pipe system and atmospheric flow conditions representing the physical dynamics of such flashy karst features was an inherently challenging however neither of these locations contribute significantly to the overall water balance of the catchment and so did not affect the overall catchment flood statistics 3 2 1d model validation 3 2 1 short term validation 2015 2016 extreme flood event there were only two operational loggers in the study area during the 2015 2016 extreme flood event located at blackrock and caherglassaun turloughs model simulation results for blackrock turlough during this event are presented in fig 4 nse and kges of between 0 95 and 0 99 were achieved at both locations for stage and 0 94 0 99 for volume m3 during the 2015 2016 flood event in the absence of other calibration data for this extreme flood event georeferenced synthetic aperture rader sar satellite imagery were combined with lidar contour mapping of the area to approximate the peak flood levels at other locations for validation purposes these data were further corroborated through comparison with historical peak flood levels throughout the catchment which were surveyed for the 2015 2016 extreme event as part of a local authority flood relief project ryan hanley 2018 the simulated peak flood levels for the 2015 2016 flood event at all locations were found to match the actual surveyed flood levels to within 0 3 6 level difference 0 1 0 4 m 3 3 medium term validation 2007 2016 model validation took place for the period between january 2007 to march 2018 covering the entire period for which data were available at five locations goodness of fit statistics were calculated for these combined datasets and are summarised in fig 5 below a sample model calibration plot of observed flood levels against simulated flood levels for the caherglassaun lough is also presented in table 2 model efficiencies ranging between 0 82 and 0 99 were achieved for this validation period 3 4 long term model validation 1989 2018 daily rainfall data were available at a met eireann operated rain gauge within the catchment with uninterrupted records extending back to 1988 three historical large flood events occurred within the catchment in the early 1990 s and spot flood level data were available at blackrock and coole macdermot 1995 g s i 1992 during these events flood level data were also acquired for the period 1999 2003 from a study carried out for an adjoining road construction project utilising the full rainfall record and rainfall runoff models for the four river inputs a long term model validation simulation was carried out for the period 1989 2007 the model accurately predicted the extreme flood events of 1989 1990 and 1994 1995 to within 0 15 0 4 m as summarised in table 3 3 5 simulation of spring discharge to kinvara bay submarine groundwater discharge a number of previous studies have focussed on quantifying the submarine groundwater discharge sgd to kinvara bay drew 2008 suggested a spring discharge ranging between 5 30 m3 s while cave and henry 2011 suggested outflows of between 14 96 m3 s more recent numerical modelling approaches by gill et al 2013a and mccormack et al 2014 estimated the average outflow to kinvara west to be approximately 10 m3 s with a maximum outflow of 16 6 m3 s for the periods 2007 2009 and 2010 2013 the calibrated model allowed the outflow to kinvara west springs to be quantified for the catchment the average spring discharge from the catchment found during the period 2007 2018 was 12 32 m3 s with a peak discharge of 35 81 m3 s occurring during the extreme flood event of 2015 2016 observed negative flow values indicate tidal intrusion into the karst network during low flow periods occurring at high tides and the pressure transfer of this tidal signal has been picked up by level loggers in caherglassaun turlough 5 km inland at low lake stages whist the peak values differ from previous numerical modelling estimates which is expected due to the current simulation including two extreme flood events the average values are generally of a similar order of magnitude given that the current model accounts for a larger catchment area and includes for more turlough flood storage areas the simulated 90th percentile discharge indicates that outflow at kinvara west springs rarely exceeds 23 4 m3 s 3 6 2d model results the 2d model scenario simulation was computationally expensive particularly given the size of the 2d zone 62 5 km2 and the number of mesh elements 1 106 required with simulations of 6 month duration a typical extreme flood period taking up to 10 days to complete initially efficiencies were achieved in computation time through the use of high specification graphics processing unit gpu cards for computation of the 2d element of the simulation reducing a 6 month simulation duration to approximately 72 h a calibrated model was eventually achieved but did not perform as well as the 1d model in terms of efficiency for stage or volume over the validation period particularly at lower levels for the 2015 16 flood event model error in peak simulated flood levels mod ranged between 0 29 and 8 23 avg 2 55 which represented an actual error in flood levels of 0 08 1 41 m avg 0 42 m the 2d model did however facilitate simulation of the overland flood path between floodplains an example of same is shown in fig 6 a which demonstrates how the model correctly simulated the overland flow which occurred between blackrock turlough through skehanagh village to ballylee during the 2015 2016 extreme flood event the overland flood flow path matched very well with what was mapped for this flood event by geological survey of ireland gsi shown in red on fig 6 a similarly the overland flow paths simulated between lough coole and caherglassaun turlough and then on towards cahermore turlough were in good agreement with what actually occurred during the flood event see fig 6 b the final 2d flood extents for the 2015 16 flood event together with the historical maximum flood extents mapped by the gsi are shown in fig 6 below spot flow measurements taken during the overland flow event on the 7th of january 2016 estimated a discharge of 5 15 m3 s between cahermore and kinvara the 2d simulation predicted a discharge of 5 44 m3 s at the same time and date which was the only verifiable overland flood flow measurement with which to validate the model other than mapped flood extents and spot flood levels 4 model application 4 1 flood alleviation simulations the volume of water stored across the system within turlough and floodplain basins during extreme flood events is extremely large for example the total flooded volume during the 2015 2016 flood event was c 92 mm3 in addition some or all of these basins are overtopped during extreme events indicating that the maximum possible storage within the system has been exceeded it has therefore been suggested previously southern water global 1997 1998 that the only viable way to lower peak flood levels is through the provision of a series of engineered controlled overflow channels allowing water to drain directly to the sea the option of slowing the flow into the lowlands by provision of control structures and temporary storage areas in the adjacent mountains was deemed economically and environmentally impractical and would introduce a larger risk from catastrophic failure of such structures achieving a reduction in flood levels at any one location within the catchment is complicated by the high degree of hydraulic connectivity within the underground karst system a measure which might be targeted at one specific location at the lower end of the catchment would be ineffective as the overall hydraulic gradient within the system would simply cause water from another slightly higher elevation to flow towards that location similarly at the higher end of the catchment displacing water further down the system would improve the situation at that location whilst exacerbating flooding further down the system for this reason a holistic approach was taken to develop a solution that sequentially moves water down the system towards the sea in a controlled manner the calibrated 1d pipe network model was utilised to investigate the effectiveness and practicality of such flood alleviation measures the modelling approach involved engineered channels being added to the model between turloughs and floodplains at known overflow locations in an incremental manner from the bottom of the system i e starting with the final channel to the sea back inland channels ol 1 ol 6 with 1 1 side slopes and a manning s n roughness value of 0 05 equivalent to a stony grassed winding channel were incrementally added at the locations shown in fig 1 to achieve the required reductions in peak flood levels at all locations the sensitivity of the manning s roughness values were also investigated ranging between 0 025 and 0 1 determine the influence of channel type on the required channel dimensions over 100 different scenarios combining different channel properties were simulated for the period 2007 2018 with the final optimal solution summarised in table 4 as expected the optimal solution is ultimately controlled by the width and roughness of channel ol 6 with channel ol 4 also of high importance from a conveyance perspective choosing a lower manning s n roughness allowed narrower channels to be incorporated however in reality considering constructability and cost a value of 0 035 is reasonable representing a relatively straight channel with some short grass weeds present avoiding lined channels altogether the optimal solution resulted in an average reduction in peak flood volumes of 1 1 m with a total volume of flood water redirected overland to the sea at kinvara instead of through the underground conduits of 48 6 mm3 whilst peak flood levels at nearly all turloughs were reduced the overall length of inundation was very similar due to the overflows only activating at higher levels refer to fig 7 for sample flood hydrograph at caherglassaun a summary of the flood levels at all locations within the model extents before and after the optimal solution was incorporated in the model for the 2015 2016 extreme flood event are given in fig 8 below 4 2 impacts to salinity in kinvara bay kinvara bay has been reported to be a site of important commercial shellfish value and designated as shellfish waters under the shellfish waters directive cave and henry 2011 sudden exposure to low salinity water may affect the quality of the shellfish stock which have been reported to cease feeding and have reduced growth rates during these conditions riisgård 2012 the salinity of kinvara bay must therefore be considered when implementing any solution to groundwater flooding within the catchment given that the addition of large volumes of fresh water to the bay over a relatively short time could potentially adversely impact commercial shellfish production fig 9 a below illustrates the simulated sgd to kinvara bay from the linked conduit karst network together with the overland discharge which briefly occurred during the peak of the 2015 2016 extreme flood event the addition of the optimal flood alleviation solution outlined above would alter these outflows as shown in fig 9 b the main change to the discharge profile to kinvara bay occurs during the period 14 12 15 to 11 01 16 when the average daily discharge volume increases from 0 11 to 0 15 mm3 which equates to an average increase of 32 in daily discharge to the bay the peak discharge during the simulation with no flood alleviation occurred on the 10 01 2016 refer to fig 9 c when a combined outflow of 38 17 m3 s discharged to the bay discharge values are shown as daily averages in fig 9 c in comparison the peak discharge during the simulation incorporating flood alleviation channels occurred on the 04 01 2016 6 days earlier and was almost 10 m3 s higher at 47 52 m3 s in order to demonstrate the impacts of such a discharge on the overall salinity of kinvara bay the proportional change in volume of freshwater versus the total volume of the bay during high and low tide was used to assess the potential net dilution whilst it is acknowledged that a more complicated mixing model of kinvara bay would more accurately predict the impacts of such additional freshwater discharge incorporating hydrodynamics within the bay such as currents mixing and additional deep springs this more simple calculation demonstrates the broader impact from such an intervention in addition the relative complexity and associated margin for error and absence of long term historical salinity data for calibration purposes renders the accurate development of such a spatially distributed mixing model very challenging bathymetry and lidar data for the seabed of kinvara bay was obtained from geological survey of ireland and the marine institute with a spatial resolution of 5 m the data were processed using spatial analyst in arcgis esri and combined with tidal level data to accurately represent the volume of the bay at low and high tide during the period between 01 12 15 to 31 01 16 found to be 0 85 mm3 and 15 84 mm3 respectively average 5 46 mm3 previous studies o toole 1990 mccormack et al 2014 highlighted that the bay is not well mixed at its head where a film of freshwater was found to exist at the top of the water column which dissipated with distance out into the bay c 2 km compared to outer kinvara bay which has been shown to be well mixed in addition smith and cave 2012 suggested that land geometry at the mouth of kinvara bay likely traps a portion of ebb water which may in fact re enter kinvara bay on the next flood tide the assumption of a well mixed bay allows for the application of more simplistic modelling approach and is considered reasonable for most of the shellfish farming locations which are located in the deeper areas of the bay closer to the mouth in reality complex dynamics likely occur within the bay itself with freshwater lens likely present mccormack et al 2014 and re entry of partially mixed freshwater contributing to the modelling complexity which would be required for a full bay mixing model given the assumption that kinvara bay is well mixed the approach outlined by barber and wearing 2004 which consists a simplified 1d pollution flushing model was employed for predicting the concentration of continuously released pollutants into a tidal embayment this model has previously been successfully applied to a small bay with submarine freshwater discharge along the irish coast by schuler et al 2018 barber and wearing 2004 proposed that the pollutant concentration c and volume of water v within the bay satisfy the following equations during ebb and flood tides 1 d dt c v c dv dt v dc dt q c e b b t i d e i n t e r v a l 2 d dt c v c dv dt v dc dt 0 f l o o d t i d e i n t e r v a l and also for both flood and ebb tide intervals 3 dv dt q q f where q represents the discharge through the entrance of kinvara bay q 0 on the flood tide q 0 on the ebb tide and qf is the steady freshwater discharge into the bay from the karst springs for the purposes of the development of this dynamic salinity model for kinvara bay the salinity of the sea water was considered as a conservative pollutant which varies with the exchange of saline water with galway bay and the outflow of freshwater from kinvara springs over the tidal period a stage volume curve for kinvara bay was established utilising lidar bathymetric for the bay and was then used to compute the changing volume of the bay at each hourly time step using the tidal level marine institute buoy at galway port similarly the simulated freshwater discharge to the bay together with any overland discharges during peak flood events were extracted from the calibrated pipe network model cave and henry 2011 carried out salinity measurements at the outlet of kinvara bay and found that the salinity of the top 10 15 m of seawater at high tide was 33 5 0 3 practical salinity units psu the salinity of the incoming freshwater was assumed to be zero psu a script was then developed in matlab which calculated the direction of the tide for each time step and then solved eqs 1 3 accordingly salinity values within the bay at the beginning of each time step were updated from the previous time step as suggested by smith and cave 2012 an allowance was made for some re entry to the bay of less saline water from the previous ebb tide with the next flood tide the salinity of the water entering the bay during the flood tide was partitioned between saline seawater and less saline water as determined by the last time step of the previous ebb tide in the absence of any actual previous quantification the proportion of return flow was assumed to be 0 1 the script was implemented between 1 6 2015 to 31 05 2016 in order to include the extreme flood event of december 2015 2016 an initialisation period of 12 months had previously been implemented in order to determine initial conditions at the beginning of the simulation period the resulting time series of salinity values during high and low tide for summer and winter months and the impact of the large freshwater discharges during the flood event see fig 10 was compared with observed data collected during previous studies cave and henry 2011 smith and cave 2012 mccormack et al 2014 and was found to show good agreement for example following the extreme flood event of november 2009 similar to the 2015 2016 flood event smith and cave 2012 reported a salinity low in kinvara bay of 17 psu which compares with the proposed salinity model which predicted a salinity low of 16 35 psu following the 2015 2016 flood event the script was then run again using the modified simulated time series for freshwater discharges to the bay following the inclusion of the flood alleviation options outlined above the resulting time series of salinity within kinvara bay was compared with the scenario without the flood alleviation options see fig 10 which reveals only a very marginal change for example the minimum salinity value predicted in the bay 16 68 psu was actually similar to what was predicted to have actually occurred 16 35 psu a small downward shift in salinity values in the bay during low and high tide was observed in the period 10 12 15 01 02 16 however the magnitude of this shift was small with a maximum observed difference in salinity between the two time series of 1 03 psu in fact the salinity of the bay was actually shifted upwards following the inclusion of the flood alleviation measures in the period 14 03 16 10 05 16 due to the tailing off in freshwater discharges following larger overland releases at an earlier date an examination of the summary statistics for the two salinity profiles further illustrates the marginal changes caused by the inclusion of overland flood alleviation discharges see fig 10 the european communities quality of shellfish waters regulations 2006 specify guideline values for salinity in shellfish waters of between 12 and 38 psu smith and cave 2012 the results of the dynamic salinity model therefore suggest that the provision of flood alleviation as outlined in this study would not have a significant adverse impact on existing salinity profiles within the bay during extreme flood events these findings must be cautioned given the underlying assumption of a well mixed bay which has been shown not to be valid closer to the head of the bay the model also does not take account of potential additional freshwater discharges from other catchments or indeed other unknown freshwater discharges further out in the bay 4 3 implications for protected groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems gwdtes the ecology of turloughs is unique and complex and directly related to the periodic inundation of the basins for varying periods goodwillie 1992 goodwillie et al 2003 sheehy skeffington et al 2006 moran et al 2008 porst and irvine 2009 naughton et al 2012 hence the potential impacts of any flood alleviation measures on the eco hydrology of these gwdtes also needs to considered given they are protected under the european habitats directive the largest turlough within the study catchment lough coole has been shown to be an integral control for levels within the entire catchment gill et al 2013b and so the potential ecological impacts of the optimum flood alleviation measures have been examined for this turlough as a representative wetland the long term simulated water levels at lough coole in the period 1988 2018 demonstrated that peak winter flood levels generally range between 8 and 11 5 mod with the frequency of more extreme flood peaks tending to increase after 2009 fig 11 demonstrates the impact that the optimum flood alleviation measures would have on peak flood level and duration in the validated period 2007 2018 at coole during this period six flood events would have been significantly impacted with the flood alleviation channels with peak flood levels reduced by up to 1 8 m the resulting recessions are also typically altered to reduce the overall length of time the basin is flooded and depth duration curves are given in fig 12 fig 12 a shows the total number of days that each flood level in the basin was exceeded in the simulation period indicating a small downward shift in the curve when the optimum flood alleviation measures are included which increases for water levels above a stage of 9 m the number of days for which each flood level was exceeded was averaged annually and a similar plot produced fig 12 b with the addition of a similar plot for the full 1988 2018 simulation dashed black line again the average number of days exceeding the higher stages is reduced in the period 2007 2018 but interestingly almost the entire curve for the period 1988 2018 is lower than both scenarios this would appear to indicate that the period 2007 2018 included higher flood events which may highlight a changing climatological trend for example when comparing the annually averaged flooded durations in the validated period 2007 2018 the flood alleviation measures indicate an annual reduction of flooded levels in excess of 12 m of 17 55 days a 68 reduction however when the flood alleviation scenario averages are compared with the long term averages for the period 1988 2018 the difference drops to 7 18 days a 46 reduction similarly for durations of levels exceeding 11 m there was an average 13 4 day reduction which compares to 3 8 days when using the long term simulated averages from an ecological perspective the wetland habitats which exist at these higher zones of the basins are limited due to the relatively infrequent flooding cycles which they are exposed to irvine et al 2018 generally the presence of an established the tree line around the perimeter of the turlough basis identifies the normal annual inundation level waldren 2015 irvine et al 2018 for the above example at coole turlough flood levels above 12 mod extends well into the established tree line indicated how infrequently these events occur frequent visits to the area over many years have identified sections of very mature established tree lines 100 years old which have died out following the extreme flood of 2009 and 2015 16 whilst the analysis does predict minor changes to the annual averaged flooded duration for flood levels below 11 mod the average annual changes are small 3 days and if compared with the long term simulated averages 1988 2018 there is almost no difference observed it is therefore conservatively concluded that the ecology of the turloughs will experience a minimal impact should the optimum flood alleviation measures be implemented and may in fact benefit from the protection afforded to habitats at higher elevations not capable of surviving under flood waters for extended periods 5 conclusion this study demonstrated the successful development of a 1d 2d pipe network model of a large karst catchment which includes 15 turloughs and floodplains for simulating groundwater flooding the addition of the 2d aspect of the model coupled with the 1d pipe network which is a novel achievement for a karst groundwater system has been shown to successfully simulate overland flooding between basins that are overtopped during extreme flood events the calibrated model has been used to predict sgd to kinvara bay over a long term period providing further insight into the catchment hydrology the peak sgd estimated by the model to kinvara bay from the catchment during an extreme flood event was 35 8 m3 s only marginal impacts on salinity within kinvara bay are predicted with the introduction overland flood relief channels resulting in accelerated water transfer to the bay with a peak reduction in salinity of 1 03 psu predicted during an extreme flood event similarly no significant ecological impact on the protected wetland habitats within the turlough basins would result with a yearly average reduction in inundation duration of below what is considered to be a normal flooding range of 3 days an apparent upward shift in the flooded duration curves in the catchment over the last decade which may be an indicator of changing climate was identified and presents an opportunity for further study this study has demonstrated the practical applications for simulating groundwater flood alleviation measures of such models with an optimum suite of flood alleviation measures for the catchment successfully demonstrated the capability of such models for groundwater flood management and related eco hydrology could be utilised in other conduit dominated karst systems especially those featuring ephermeral lakes such poljes credit authorship

5999,groundwater flooding is a phenomenon which has become recognised as a significant natural hazard in recent years the gort lowland karst catchment situated in south co galway on the western coast of ireland has experienced two extreme groundwater flood events in the past decade leading to considerable damage and disruption groundwater flooding in the catchment typically occurs following periods of sustained heavy rainfall when sufficient capacity is not available in the bedrock to store and convey water to the sea the underground karst conduit system therefore surcharges to the ground surface through a system of estavelles and floods low lying areas of ground known as turloughs ephemeral lakes a 1d 2d pipe network model of the karst conduit system of the gort lowland karst was developed in order to simulate the flooding mechanisms across the catchment as well as to assess flood alleviation options the nature of the underground karstic connections in the system has been determined from a combination of available field data dye tracing water chemistry data etc and cross frequency analysis on the turlough fluctuation time series data over several years the availability of high accuracy lidar data of the catchment then allowed the flooding regime to be accurately simulated on the ground surface the model was calibrated using historic continuous water level data for a number of turloughs in the catchment and then validated using historic peak spot flood levels the model was then used to identify appropriate potential groundwater flood alleviation measures for the catchment the impacts of such measures on both the salinity of kinvara bay through increased freshwater discharges and eco hydrology of the protected wetland habitats within the turloughs was also investigated the study demonstrated that the measures proposed can be developed without inducing undesirable impacts to either salinity in kinvara bay and thus mariculture or to the protected turlough habitats the study has also demonstrated the suitability and functionality of such karst models for examining groundwater flood management options and eco hydrology in karst catchments keywords groundwater flooding karst modelling groundwater flood alleviation submarine groundwater discharge 1 introduction groundwater flooding has gained widespread recognition as a natural hazard in recent decades following extensive damage to property and infrastructure across europe in the winter of 2000 2001 finch et al 2004 pinault et al 2005 hughes et al 2011 significant groundwater flooding also occurred in the uk at oxford 2007 and at berkshire downs and chilterns 2014 and in galway ireland in 2009 2015 2016 naughton et al 2017 whilst groundwater flooding rarely poses a risk to human life it typically causes damage and disruption over a long duration particularly when compared to fluvial flooding morris et al 2008 cobby et al 2009 the main mechanisms by which groundwater flooding occurs can be summarised as inundation of river floodplains caused by the saturation of alluvium deposits adjacent to a main river channel finch et al 2004 groundwater rebound whereby the groundwater table rapidly rises following a reduction cessation in abstraction from large aquifers causing flooding of subsurface structures such as basements or tunnels macdonald et al 2014 and increases in groundwater levels in bedrock aquifers which causes the water table to reach the ground surface and flood low lying basins and valleys finch et al 2004 naughton et al 2012 groundwater flooding events in ireland predominantly occurs within the lowland karstified limestone areas of the west of the country naughton et al 2012 naughton et al 2018 via the third mechanism described above the flooding is inherently linked to the underlying bedrock geology where extensive interactions between ground and surface waters predominate with sinking and rising rivers streams common with surface water features absent completely in many areas drew 2008 the dominant drainage path for many areas of the catchment is through the karstified limestone bedrock however the limited storage within such secondary porosity dominated rocks means that the fractures or conduits within the limestone are unable to drain the recharge fast enough during intense or prolonged rainfall the result being surcharging of groundwater above the surface this flood water is usually contained within low lying topographic depressions known as turloughs which represent the principal form of extensive recurrent groundwater flooding in ireland coxon 1987a coxon 1987b in ireland the most susceptible region to groundwater flooding is the gort lowlands in south galway which is a lowland karst catchment covering an area of approximately 500 km2 naughton et al 2018 modelling karst systems is a complex task and has been the subject of continuing research globally hartmann 2017 there is a broad range of different modelling approaches to simulate karst hydrology however these can be generally be grouped into three categories which are differentiated by their level of complexity input data requirements and or the accuracy of their output lumped or reservoir approaches provide a conceptual model designed to simulate the aquifer outflow usually spring discharge as well as water level variations within the karst conduit system the saturated bedrock zone kong a siou et al 2014 hartmann 2017 these models are usually implemented by representing the karst system which includes both the epikarst and conduit zones as well as the overlying subsoil unsaturated zone by a series of reservoirs each of these reservoirs contain different controlling parameters and represent different inflows and outflows within the karst system typically different reservoirs are used to represent zones such as the fast and slow soil infiltration the epikarst and the conduit zones fleury et al 2009 semi distributed models aim to address this general simplification of the catchment by acknowledging that the variability of the spatial input information and the catchment properties have significant impacts on the hydrologic responses of the system semi distributed models usually sub divide the catchment into area averaged input data where the distributed properties such as the land cover soil type and precipitation are lumped into discrete zones or points which aims to more accurately represent how the catchment operates an example of a semi distributed model is the varkarst model which considers the spatial variability of karst system properties by distribution functions representing the soil epikarst and karst bedrock hartmann et al 2013 the soil storage takes account of the soil moisture budget allowing the seasonal changes to be accounted for overland runoff can also be included between model elements this model was found to outperform a calibrated lumped reservoir routing model when both were applied to the same catchment hartmann 2017 mayaud et al 2019 recently demonstrated the use of a semi distributed pipe network model for simulating flooding in karst poljes in slovenia which are similar to irish turloughs physically based distributed models are capable of accounting for all of the spatial distribution of meteorological conditions precipitation evapotranspiration etc and physical parameters e g soil saturation land cover properties etc throughout the catchment and have the advantage of being an accurate representation of the entire catchment in order to fully benefit from the added complexity of a fully distributed model this approach requires a wealth of input data throughout the catchment which is often not readily available this data requirement together with the danger of over parameterisation however often leads to poor model calibration in fact it has been reported that a lumped model generally outperforms a fully distributed model except in rigorously studied catchments hartmann 2017 smith et al 2019 extensive flooding associated within the turloughs across the south galway karst limestone lowlands of ireland is known to have occurred on six occasions over the past 20 years 1989 1990 1991 1994 1995 2009 and 2015 2016 the flooding in 2009 was the most severe on record until it was surpassed in many areas by the events of 2015 the two most recent flood events led to considerable damage disruption and hardship for local residents and farmers over 24 km2 of land was flooded for up to 6 months with many residents and farms cut off due to roads being impassable for extended periods this study was therefore proposed with the aim to better understand the occurrence and behaviour of these flood events as well providing insight and guidance with respect to potential alleviation measures a combination of limited records and detail of historic groundwater flooding coupled with a lack of data regarding flow within the karst bedrock renders the development of a karst model representing the system to be a challenging and unique task 2 materials and methods 2 1 catchment description the gort lowlands catchment covers an area of approximately 500 km2 in south co galway on the western coast of ireland three river systems discharge runoff from adjacent mountains to the lowland karst catchment and another smaller river drains to the catchment from the border of the burren limestone pavement to the south the surface hydrology of the gort lowlands becomes extremely complex once these four rivers flow into the catchment due to the karstified nature of the limestone bedrock the hydrogeology and surface hydrology of the gort lowlands are therefore closely linked due to the extensive bedrock karstification with water exchanged between the surface and subsurface in large volumes throughout the catchment through sinking streams swallow holes large springs and river risings the entire catchment drains to a number of intertidal springs at kinvara bay through the karst limestone bedrock see fig 2 a comprehensive description of the catchment and its complex hydrogeology is given in naughton et al 2018 2 2 model setup calibration this present study created a new expanded pipe network model of the semi distributive model of the complex karst system within the gort lowlands that had been developed over a 10 year period for five turloughs gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 the conceptual model was initially informed by extensive tracing studies previously carried out within the catchment southern water global 1998 flows within the main rivers meteorology across the catchment and water hydrochemistry allowed a deeper understanding of the system and how it operates time series analyses of the fluctuating turlough water levels were subsequently undertaken this revealed additional hydraulic characteristics regarding the nature of the catchment gill et al 2013b such as whether the turloughs act as surcharge tanks or not and whether a turlough is connected to the mainline system or is located offline an additional 10 turloughs and floodplains were added to the model and the model catchment was expanded from 95 8 km2 to 159 2 km2 an additional inflow from the cloonteen river located to the south west of the catchment was also added to the model which was identified as a lacunae during previous modelling efforts mccormack et al 2014 fig 2 below identifies the turloughs and floodplains contained within the model and the locations of the various river inputs fig 1 presents a schematic overview of all elements of the model development and calibration process undertaken within this study including the various data inputs each of the various data inputs and steps involved in the model development and calibration process are further described in the following sections 2 2 1 model inputs rainfall data were available from two tipping bucket arg100 rain gauges which were previously installed at kilchreest in the lowlands 70 mod and francis gap in the slieve aughty mountains elevation 250 mod gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 the data were available intermittently between 2007 and 2016 however many gaps existed within the dataset due to periods of instrumentation failure or periods of in operation the data from other rain gauges in the area operated by met eireann were therefore also gathered in order to provide comparison with the two project gauges and to determine a means for obtaining a complete dataset the gort derrybrien gauge presented the longest rainfall dataset within the catchment with data available from 1982 although rainfall was only available at daily frequency in order to fill in missing gaps in the dataset from 2007 to 2018 data the gort derrybrien gauge was utilised and redistributed from daily to hourly using the shannon and athenry gauges as metrics a correlation analysis indicated that gort derrybrien daily totals were moderately correlated with both the shannon and athenry gauges with pearson correlation coefficients of 0 60 and 0 55 respectively the redistribution process involved taking the daily total at gort derrybrien and dividing it over each hour of the day in the same hourly proportion observed at shannon on the same date for days where rainfall occurred at gort derrybrien but not at shannon the athenry guage was utilised for a very small number of dates rainfall occurred at derrybrien but did not occur at either shannon or athenry and in this circumstance a uniform 24 h distribution was utilised a sensitivity analysis was carried out comparing the simulated river hydrographs for a period when data was available at kilchreest and francis gap using actual observations with gort derrybrien data redistributed using the three metrics described above and no appreciable change in either the timing or extent of hydrographs were observed the redistributed data were therefore used to supplement the kilchreest and francis gap datasets which were required for generating river inputs 2 2 2 river rating curves hydrometric data the flows in the three main rivers draining the slieve aughty mountains and the cloonteen river were constantly measured at respective gauging stations operated by the office of public works opw these gauges consist of a pressure transducer embedded into the river referenced against a staff gauge at the stream edge rating curves i e flow against stage relationship were previously developed for each of the three gauging stations on the rivers flowing off the slieve aughty mountains gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 a number of flow measurements were also taken on the cloonteen river during 2017 and these measurements were supplemented using referenced data collected during the original gort flood study southern water global 1998 to allow a rating curve to be developed a number of additional flow measurements were undertaken during 2017 and 2018 by the opw and these measurements served to validate the existing rating curves but did not increase the range of gauged flows 2 2 3 rainfall runoff models in order to fill any intermittent gaps in the river flows which were used to calculate allogenic inflows to the main karst model rainfall runoff rr models were required these models were developed on mike11 nam dhi software which is a single catchment watershed lumped parameter model for simulating rainfall runoff and the hydrological cycle developing a rr model within mike11 nam requires simple catchment descriptors with rainfall and potential evaporation as inputs that are then calibrated against a known discharge runoff calibration is achieved by adjusting nine parameters relating to the surface rootzone and groundwater within controlled bounds the calibration period chosen for each river contained a minimum of one hydrological year which also contained a number of representative peaks in discharge runoff during calibration initial parameters were selected based on previous work by others gill et al 2013a o brien et al 2013 mccormack et al 2014 and the model was run in auto calibration mode the model simulation results during calibration were checked for coefficient of optimisation r2 and visually analysed for degree of agreement between simulated and observed runoff the model parameters were then further adjusted to obtain the set of best fit model parameters which could simulate the observed runoff in term of timings peaks and total volume with a high degree of agreement once an acceptable calibration was achieved the model was then run for the period between 2007 and 2016 for validation purposes 2010 2016 for the cloonteen river no logger was installed pre 2010 2 2 4 turlough water level profiles water levels in five turloughs blackrock coy coole garyland caherglassaun within the catchment were measured continuously by pressure transducers as outlined by gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 data were available intermittently between 2007 and 2016 however many gaps existed within the dataset due to periods of instrumentation failure or periods of in operation additional water level monitoring stations were installed at 8 locations within the catchment in 2016 by geological survey ireland gsi with data available for some or all of the period between november 2016 and april 2018 for use within the model calibration and validation in addition water levels within turloughs were manually estimated for specific dates of interest using a combination of sentinel 1 satellite imagery and lidar data sentinel 1 comprises two satellites equipped with c band synthetic aperture radar instruments and are operated by the european space agency under their copernicus programme the extents of flooding at specific dates was visually identified using darker pixel shading within the various bands of the imagery and matched with a corresponding topographical contour to yield a flood elevation 2 2 5 tide level monitoring tide level data for kinvara bay were obtained from the marine institute of ireland for the galway port tide gauge which is located c 15 km to the north tide levels were previously recorded at kinvara bay and compared to the record for galway bay during the same period of time and the levels were found to be comparable albeit with a slight shift of c 15 min in the magnitude of the tide level gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 2 2 6 depth volume area relationships depth area relationships for each of the turloughs and floodplains were computed using arcgis and or infoworks icm software for use within the model the data used to create these depth area and subsequently volume relationships generally consisted of lidar mapping available for the catchment in the form of a digital elevation model dem with a grid spacing of 2 m and a vertical accuracy of 0 15 m this lidar was flown when some of the turloughs contained standing water and therefore accurate topographical data for the bottom of these basins was not available topographical survey data obtained from manual surveys carried out using a trimble 4700 gps system with a minimum accuracy of 0 01 m horizontal and vertical direction were available for a number of the turlough basins in addition bathymetric surveys were also undertaken where permanent water was present to accurately represent the base levels at these locations coole caherglassaun hawkhill and newtown these surveys were carried out using a remote controlled acoustic doppler current profiler adcp integrated with the global positioning system gps to record both vertical depth and horizontal position measurements respectively these topographical data were combined with the available lidar data in arcgis and a new integrated dem was constructed using the kriging method with a 2 m grid spacing and thus accurate depth area relationships were generated for all turlough and floodplain locations 2 2 7 1d pipe network model the pipe network was initially developed with reference to the previously developed model for five turloughs within the catchment by gill et al 2013a a ground model was generated in the infoworks icm software using the dem data discussed above each of the turloughs or floodplains were then represented by storage nodes with a depth area relationship developed using this ground model a total of 15 storage areas were added to the network as shown on fig 2 the initial connections between turloughs and storage areas was informed by the existing model reviewing tracing studies available in the gsi karst database and statistical analysis of time series data collected at these new locations after gill et al 2013b the initial network was adjusted and modified significantly as the calibration process progressed the calibration process was carried out by trial and error with pipe dimensions and the various controls varied in an iterative process rivers were represented using open channels with dimensions approximated from digital mapping and physical surveys overflow channels between basins were added as open channels with dimensions informed by digital mapping physical surveys and maximum flood extents mapping the catchment was divided into sub catchments based on topography and these were connected to the pipe network using conduits and nodes with autogenic recharge applied to these sub catchments using a ground infiltration module with infoworks icm as described by gill et al 2013a whilst the 1d modelling approach described above is considered to be robust and performed very well in terms of matching flooded volumes and flood stages the overland flow between turlough floodplain basins was simplified for incorporation into the 1d environment thus whilst the over spilled volume of water between floodplains that occurred during extreme events could be quantified together with the timing of same there was no capacity to simulate the overland flow paths and accurately represent their associated velocities and corresponding flooded extents outside storage basins the only means to quantify these data is through the use of a 2d model the infoworks icm integrated all source catchment modelling software incorporates 1d 2d coupling capabilities which are typically utilised to simulate fluvial flooding therefore once the expanded 1d model was calibrated it was modified with the addition of 2d zones for modelling capability of the surface overland flows 2 2 8 2d overland pipe network model the development of the 2d overland flow model from the calibrated 1d model required first removing all storage nodes which represented turloughs and floodplains in order to create the 2d aspect of the network high resolution lidar data were used a ground digital elevation model dem was created using a combination of lidar data topographical data and bathymetric data these data were combined arcgis v10 4 1 and a new integrated dem was constructed using the kriging method with a 2 m grid spacing a 2d mesh was then created using this ground model within the model network domain incorporating the full extents of the catchment where overland flooding and flow is known to occur in order to gain efficiencies in model computation terrain sensitive meshing was utilised whereby the resolution of the mesh is increased in areas where large variations in height occur the maximum height variation allowed during the generation of the mesh was 0 25 m in the interest of reducing run times many parameters such as roughness coefficient were kept constant across the 2d surface the 1d pipe network representing flow within the karst bedrock was linked to this 2d mesh using 2d nodes flow between the 2d mesh towards a 1d node and vice versa was based on a standard head discharge relationship modification of the original calibrated 1d model was kept to the minimum required to effectively incorporate these 2d elements with an aim of reducing the recalibration effort required 3 results 3 1 1d model calibration the calibration period was between 01 11 2016 and 31 03 2018 with continuous water level data available during this period for 12 of the 15 locations no data at ballyloughan corker and ballylee shown in fig 2 as the primary objective of this model was for flooding purposes the calibration process particularly focussed on matching the timing and magnitude of the peak surface water levels the calibration process was iterative with the catchment broken into two sections based on elevations and close frequency interactions between turloughs the model calibration was checked for goodness of fit using the nash sutcliffe nse and kling gupta kge model efficiencies for both flood water stage mod and turlough volume m3 a sample model calibration plot of observed flood levels against simulated flood levels for the coole lough is presented in fig 3 below model efficiencies ranging between 0 87 and 0 98 were achieved for water level mod and between 0 77 and 0 99 for volume m3 at all but two locations see table 1 poorer model efficiencies 0 25 0 62 were achieved at the location of large underground river risings at castletown and kiltartan which display extremely flashy behaviour this is due to the sharp interface at these locations between the pressurised pipe system and atmospheric flow conditions representing the physical dynamics of such flashy karst features was an inherently challenging however neither of these locations contribute significantly to the overall water balance of the catchment and so did not affect the overall catchment flood statistics 3 2 1d model validation 3 2 1 short term validation 2015 2016 extreme flood event there were only two operational loggers in the study area during the 2015 2016 extreme flood event located at blackrock and caherglassaun turloughs model simulation results for blackrock turlough during this event are presented in fig 4 nse and kges of between 0 95 and 0 99 were achieved at both locations for stage and 0 94 0 99 for volume m3 during the 2015 2016 flood event in the absence of other calibration data for this extreme flood event georeferenced synthetic aperture rader sar satellite imagery were combined with lidar contour mapping of the area to approximate the peak flood levels at other locations for validation purposes these data were further corroborated through comparison with historical peak flood levels throughout the catchment which were surveyed for the 2015 2016 extreme event as part of a local authority flood relief project ryan hanley 2018 the simulated peak flood levels for the 2015 2016 flood event at all locations were found to match the actual surveyed flood levels to within 0 3 6 level difference 0 1 0 4 m 3 3 medium term validation 2007 2016 model validation took place for the period between january 2007 to march 2018 covering the entire period for which data were available at five locations goodness of fit statistics were calculated for these combined datasets and are summarised in fig 5 below a sample model calibration plot of observed flood levels against simulated flood levels for the caherglassaun lough is also presented in table 2 model efficiencies ranging between 0 82 and 0 99 were achieved for this validation period 3 4 long term model validation 1989 2018 daily rainfall data were available at a met eireann operated rain gauge within the catchment with uninterrupted records extending back to 1988 three historical large flood events occurred within the catchment in the early 1990 s and spot flood level data were available at blackrock and coole macdermot 1995 g s i 1992 during these events flood level data were also acquired for the period 1999 2003 from a study carried out for an adjoining road construction project utilising the full rainfall record and rainfall runoff models for the four river inputs a long term model validation simulation was carried out for the period 1989 2007 the model accurately predicted the extreme flood events of 1989 1990 and 1994 1995 to within 0 15 0 4 m as summarised in table 3 3 5 simulation of spring discharge to kinvara bay submarine groundwater discharge a number of previous studies have focussed on quantifying the submarine groundwater discharge sgd to kinvara bay drew 2008 suggested a spring discharge ranging between 5 30 m3 s while cave and henry 2011 suggested outflows of between 14 96 m3 s more recent numerical modelling approaches by gill et al 2013a and mccormack et al 2014 estimated the average outflow to kinvara west to be approximately 10 m3 s with a maximum outflow of 16 6 m3 s for the periods 2007 2009 and 2010 2013 the calibrated model allowed the outflow to kinvara west springs to be quantified for the catchment the average spring discharge from the catchment found during the period 2007 2018 was 12 32 m3 s with a peak discharge of 35 81 m3 s occurring during the extreme flood event of 2015 2016 observed negative flow values indicate tidal intrusion into the karst network during low flow periods occurring at high tides and the pressure transfer of this tidal signal has been picked up by level loggers in caherglassaun turlough 5 km inland at low lake stages whist the peak values differ from previous numerical modelling estimates which is expected due to the current simulation including two extreme flood events the average values are generally of a similar order of magnitude given that the current model accounts for a larger catchment area and includes for more turlough flood storage areas the simulated 90th percentile discharge indicates that outflow at kinvara west springs rarely exceeds 23 4 m3 s 3 6 2d model results the 2d model scenario simulation was computationally expensive particularly given the size of the 2d zone 62 5 km2 and the number of mesh elements 1 106 required with simulations of 6 month duration a typical extreme flood period taking up to 10 days to complete initially efficiencies were achieved in computation time through the use of high specification graphics processing unit gpu cards for computation of the 2d element of the simulation reducing a 6 month simulation duration to approximately 72 h a calibrated model was eventually achieved but did not perform as well as the 1d model in terms of efficiency for stage or volume over the validation period particularly at lower levels for the 2015 16 flood event model error in peak simulated flood levels mod ranged between 0 29 and 8 23 avg 2 55 which represented an actual error in flood levels of 0 08 1 41 m avg 0 42 m the 2d model did however facilitate simulation of the overland flood path between floodplains an example of same is shown in fig 6 a which demonstrates how the model correctly simulated the overland flow which occurred between blackrock turlough through skehanagh village to ballylee during the 2015 2016 extreme flood event the overland flood flow path matched very well with what was mapped for this flood event by geological survey of ireland gsi shown in red on fig 6 a similarly the overland flow paths simulated between lough coole and caherglassaun turlough and then on towards cahermore turlough were in good agreement with what actually occurred during the flood event see fig 6 b the final 2d flood extents for the 2015 16 flood event together with the historical maximum flood extents mapped by the gsi are shown in fig 6 below spot flow measurements taken during the overland flow event on the 7th of january 2016 estimated a discharge of 5 15 m3 s between cahermore and kinvara the 2d simulation predicted a discharge of 5 44 m3 s at the same time and date which was the only verifiable overland flood flow measurement with which to validate the model other than mapped flood extents and spot flood levels 4 model application 4 1 flood alleviation simulations the volume of water stored across the system within turlough and floodplain basins during extreme flood events is extremely large for example the total flooded volume during the 2015 2016 flood event was c 92 mm3 in addition some or all of these basins are overtopped during extreme events indicating that the maximum possible storage within the system has been exceeded it has therefore been suggested previously southern water global 1997 1998 that the only viable way to lower peak flood levels is through the provision of a series of engineered controlled overflow channels allowing water to drain directly to the sea the option of slowing the flow into the lowlands by provision of control structures and temporary storage areas in the adjacent mountains was deemed economically and environmentally impractical and would introduce a larger risk from catastrophic failure of such structures achieving a reduction in flood levels at any one location within the catchment is complicated by the high degree of hydraulic connectivity within the underground karst system a measure which might be targeted at one specific location at the lower end of the catchment would be ineffective as the overall hydraulic gradient within the system would simply cause water from another slightly higher elevation to flow towards that location similarly at the higher end of the catchment displacing water further down the system would improve the situation at that location whilst exacerbating flooding further down the system for this reason a holistic approach was taken to develop a solution that sequentially moves water down the system towards the sea in a controlled manner the calibrated 1d pipe network model was utilised to investigate the effectiveness and practicality of such flood alleviation measures the modelling approach involved engineered channels being added to the model between turloughs and floodplains at known overflow locations in an incremental manner from the bottom of the system i e starting with the final channel to the sea back inland channels ol 1 ol 6 with 1 1 side slopes and a manning s n roughness value of 0 05 equivalent to a stony grassed winding channel were incrementally added at the locations shown in fig 1 to achieve the required reductions in peak flood levels at all locations the sensitivity of the manning s roughness values were also investigated ranging between 0 025 and 0 1 determine the influence of channel type on the required channel dimensions over 100 different scenarios combining different channel properties were simulated for the period 2007 2018 with the final optimal solution summarised in table 4 as expected the optimal solution is ultimately controlled by the width and roughness of channel ol 6 with channel ol 4 also of high importance from a conveyance perspective choosing a lower manning s n roughness allowed narrower channels to be incorporated however in reality considering constructability and cost a value of 0 035 is reasonable representing a relatively straight channel with some short grass weeds present avoiding lined channels altogether the optimal solution resulted in an average reduction in peak flood volumes of 1 1 m with a total volume of flood water redirected overland to the sea at kinvara instead of through the underground conduits of 48 6 mm3 whilst peak flood levels at nearly all turloughs were reduced the overall length of inundation was very similar due to the overflows only activating at higher levels refer to fig 7 for sample flood hydrograph at caherglassaun a summary of the flood levels at all locations within the model extents before and after the optimal solution was incorporated in the model for the 2015 2016 extreme flood event are given in fig 8 below 4 2 impacts to salinity in kinvara bay kinvara bay has been reported to be a site of important commercial shellfish value and designated as shellfish waters under the shellfish waters directive cave and henry 2011 sudden exposure to low salinity water may affect the quality of the shellfish stock which have been reported to cease feeding and have reduced growth rates during these conditions riisgård 2012 the salinity of kinvara bay must therefore be considered when implementing any solution to groundwater flooding within the catchment given that the addition of large volumes of fresh water to the bay over a relatively short time could potentially adversely impact commercial shellfish production fig 9 a below illustrates the simulated sgd to kinvara bay from the linked conduit karst network together with the overland discharge which briefly occurred during the peak of the 2015 2016 extreme flood event the addition of the optimal flood alleviation solution outlined above would alter these outflows as shown in fig 9 b the main change to the discharge profile to kinvara bay occurs during the period 14 12 15 to 11 01 16 when the average daily discharge volume increases from 0 11 to 0 15 mm3 which equates to an average increase of 32 in daily discharge to the bay the peak discharge during the simulation with no flood alleviation occurred on the 10 01 2016 refer to fig 9 c when a combined outflow of 38 17 m3 s discharged to the bay discharge values are shown as daily averages in fig 9 c in comparison the peak discharge during the simulation incorporating flood alleviation channels occurred on the 04 01 2016 6 days earlier and was almost 10 m3 s higher at 47 52 m3 s in order to demonstrate the impacts of such a discharge on the overall salinity of kinvara bay the proportional change in volume of freshwater versus the total volume of the bay during high and low tide was used to assess the potential net dilution whilst it is acknowledged that a more complicated mixing model of kinvara bay would more accurately predict the impacts of such additional freshwater discharge incorporating hydrodynamics within the bay such as currents mixing and additional deep springs this more simple calculation demonstrates the broader impact from such an intervention in addition the relative complexity and associated margin for error and absence of long term historical salinity data for calibration purposes renders the accurate development of such a spatially distributed mixing model very challenging bathymetry and lidar data for the seabed of kinvara bay was obtained from geological survey of ireland and the marine institute with a spatial resolution of 5 m the data were processed using spatial analyst in arcgis esri and combined with tidal level data to accurately represent the volume of the bay at low and high tide during the period between 01 12 15 to 31 01 16 found to be 0 85 mm3 and 15 84 mm3 respectively average 5 46 mm3 previous studies o toole 1990 mccormack et al 2014 highlighted that the bay is not well mixed at its head where a film of freshwater was found to exist at the top of the water column which dissipated with distance out into the bay c 2 km compared to outer kinvara bay which has been shown to be well mixed in addition smith and cave 2012 suggested that land geometry at the mouth of kinvara bay likely traps a portion of ebb water which may in fact re enter kinvara bay on the next flood tide the assumption of a well mixed bay allows for the application of more simplistic modelling approach and is considered reasonable for most of the shellfish farming locations which are located in the deeper areas of the bay closer to the mouth in reality complex dynamics likely occur within the bay itself with freshwater lens likely present mccormack et al 2014 and re entry of partially mixed freshwater contributing to the modelling complexity which would be required for a full bay mixing model given the assumption that kinvara bay is well mixed the approach outlined by barber and wearing 2004 which consists a simplified 1d pollution flushing model was employed for predicting the concentration of continuously released pollutants into a tidal embayment this model has previously been successfully applied to a small bay with submarine freshwater discharge along the irish coast by schuler et al 2018 barber and wearing 2004 proposed that the pollutant concentration c and volume of water v within the bay satisfy the following equations during ebb and flood tides 1 d dt c v c dv dt v dc dt q c e b b t i d e i n t e r v a l 2 d dt c v c dv dt v dc dt 0 f l o o d t i d e i n t e r v a l and also for both flood and ebb tide intervals 3 dv dt q q f where q represents the discharge through the entrance of kinvara bay q 0 on the flood tide q 0 on the ebb tide and qf is the steady freshwater discharge into the bay from the karst springs for the purposes of the development of this dynamic salinity model for kinvara bay the salinity of the sea water was considered as a conservative pollutant which varies with the exchange of saline water with galway bay and the outflow of freshwater from kinvara springs over the tidal period a stage volume curve for kinvara bay was established utilising lidar bathymetric for the bay and was then used to compute the changing volume of the bay at each hourly time step using the tidal level marine institute buoy at galway port similarly the simulated freshwater discharge to the bay together with any overland discharges during peak flood events were extracted from the calibrated pipe network model cave and henry 2011 carried out salinity measurements at the outlet of kinvara bay and found that the salinity of the top 10 15 m of seawater at high tide was 33 5 0 3 practical salinity units psu the salinity of the incoming freshwater was assumed to be zero psu a script was then developed in matlab which calculated the direction of the tide for each time step and then solved eqs 1 3 accordingly salinity values within the bay at the beginning of each time step were updated from the previous time step as suggested by smith and cave 2012 an allowance was made for some re entry to the bay of less saline water from the previous ebb tide with the next flood tide the salinity of the water entering the bay during the flood tide was partitioned between saline seawater and less saline water as determined by the last time step of the previous ebb tide in the absence of any actual previous quantification the proportion of return flow was assumed to be 0 1 the script was implemented between 1 6 2015 to 31 05 2016 in order to include the extreme flood event of december 2015 2016 an initialisation period of 12 months had previously been implemented in order to determine initial conditions at the beginning of the simulation period the resulting time series of salinity values during high and low tide for summer and winter months and the impact of the large freshwater discharges during the flood event see fig 10 was compared with observed data collected during previous studies cave and henry 2011 smith and cave 2012 mccormack et al 2014 and was found to show good agreement for example following the extreme flood event of november 2009 similar to the 2015 2016 flood event smith and cave 2012 reported a salinity low in kinvara bay of 17 psu which compares with the proposed salinity model which predicted a salinity low of 16 35 psu following the 2015 2016 flood event the script was then run again using the modified simulated time series for freshwater discharges to the bay following the inclusion of the flood alleviation options outlined above the resulting time series of salinity within kinvara bay was compared with the scenario without the flood alleviation options see fig 10 which reveals only a very marginal change for example the minimum salinity value predicted in the bay 16 68 psu was actually similar to what was predicted to have actually occurred 16 35 psu a small downward shift in salinity values in the bay during low and high tide was observed in the period 10 12 15 01 02 16 however the magnitude of this shift was small with a maximum observed difference in salinity between the two time series of 1 03 psu in fact the salinity of the bay was actually shifted upwards following the inclusion of the flood alleviation measures in the period 14 03 16 10 05 16 due to the tailing off in freshwater discharges following larger overland releases at an earlier date an examination of the summary statistics for the two salinity profiles further illustrates the marginal changes caused by the inclusion of overland flood alleviation discharges see fig 10 the european communities quality of shellfish waters regulations 2006 specify guideline values for salinity in shellfish waters of between 12 and 38 psu smith and cave 2012 the results of the dynamic salinity model therefore suggest that the provision of flood alleviation as outlined in this study would not have a significant adverse impact on existing salinity profiles within the bay during extreme flood events these findings must be cautioned given the underlying assumption of a well mixed bay which has been shown not to be valid closer to the head of the bay the model also does not take account of potential additional freshwater discharges from other catchments or indeed other unknown freshwater discharges further out in the bay 4 3 implications for protected groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems gwdtes the ecology of turloughs is unique and complex and directly related to the periodic inundation of the basins for varying periods goodwillie 1992 goodwillie et al 2003 sheehy skeffington et al 2006 moran et al 2008 porst and irvine 2009 naughton et al 2012 hence the potential impacts of any flood alleviation measures on the eco hydrology of these gwdtes also needs to considered given they are protected under the european habitats directive the largest turlough within the study catchment lough coole has been shown to be an integral control for levels within the entire catchment gill et al 2013b and so the potential ecological impacts of the optimum flood alleviation measures have been examined for this turlough as a representative wetland the long term simulated water levels at lough coole in the period 1988 2018 demonstrated that peak winter flood levels generally range between 8 and 11 5 mod with the frequency of more extreme flood peaks tending to increase after 2009 fig 11 demonstrates the impact that the optimum flood alleviation measures would have on peak flood level and duration in the validated period 2007 2018 at coole during this period six flood events would have been significantly impacted with the flood alleviation channels with peak flood levels reduced by up to 1 8 m the resulting recessions are also typically altered to reduce the overall length of time the basin is flooded and depth duration curves are given in fig 12 fig 12 a shows the total number of days that each flood level in the basin was exceeded in the simulation period indicating a small downward shift in the curve when the optimum flood alleviation measures are included which increases for water levels above a stage of 9 m the number of days for which each flood level was exceeded was averaged annually and a similar plot produced fig 12 b with the addition of a similar plot for the full 1988 2018 simulation dashed black line again the average number of days exceeding the higher stages is reduced in the period 2007 2018 but interestingly almost the entire curve for the period 1988 2018 is lower than both scenarios this would appear to indicate that the period 2007 2018 included higher flood events which may highlight a changing climatological trend for example when comparing the annually averaged flooded durations in the validated period 2007 2018 the flood alleviation measures indicate an annual reduction of flooded levels in excess of 12 m of 17 55 days a 68 reduction however when the flood alleviation scenario averages are compared with the long term averages for the period 1988 2018 the difference drops to 7 18 days a 46 reduction similarly for durations of levels exceeding 11 m there was an average 13 4 day reduction which compares to 3 8 days when using the long term simulated averages from an ecological perspective the wetland habitats which exist at these higher zones of the basins are limited due to the relatively infrequent flooding cycles which they are exposed to irvine et al 2018 generally the presence of an established the tree line around the perimeter of the turlough basis identifies the normal annual inundation level waldren 2015 irvine et al 2018 for the above example at coole turlough flood levels above 12 mod extends well into the established tree line indicated how infrequently these events occur frequent visits to the area over many years have identified sections of very mature established tree lines 100 years old which have died out following the extreme flood of 2009 and 2015 16 whilst the analysis does predict minor changes to the annual averaged flooded duration for flood levels below 11 mod the average annual changes are small 3 days and if compared with the long term simulated averages 1988 2018 there is almost no difference observed it is therefore conservatively concluded that the ecology of the turloughs will experience a minimal impact should the optimum flood alleviation measures be implemented and may in fact benefit from the protection afforded to habitats at higher elevations not capable of surviving under flood waters for extended periods 5 conclusion this study demonstrated the successful development of a 1d 2d pipe network model of a large karst catchment which includes 15 turloughs and floodplains for simulating groundwater flooding the addition of the 2d aspect of the model coupled with the 1d pipe network which is a novel achievement for a karst groundwater system has been shown to successfully simulate overland flooding between basins that are overtopped during extreme flood events the calibrated model has been used to predict sgd to kinvara bay over a long term period providing further insight into the catchment hydrology the peak sgd estimated by the model to kinvara bay from the catchment during an extreme flood event was 35 8 m3 s only marginal impacts on salinity within kinvara bay are predicted with the introduction overland flood relief channels resulting in accelerated water transfer to the bay with a peak reduction in salinity of 1 03 psu predicted during an extreme flood event similarly no significant ecological impact on the protected wetland habitats within the turlough basins would result with a yearly average reduction in inundation duration of below what is considered to be a normal flooding range of 3 days an apparent upward shift in the flooded duration curves in the catchment over the last decade which may be an indicator of changing climate was identified and presents an opportunity for further study this study has demonstrated the practical applications for simulating groundwater flood alleviation measures of such models with an optimum suite of flood alleviation measures for the catchment successfully demonstrated the capability of such models for groundwater flood management and related eco hydrology could be utilised in other conduit dominated karst systems especially those featuring ephermeral lakes such poljes credit authorship
