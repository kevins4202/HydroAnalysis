4940,in regional frequency analysis extreme rainfall patterns in a nonstationary environment are characterized by the time dependent regional growth curves in which location and scale parameters are the weighted values of at site estimates from the sites within a homogeneous group however under different climate change scenarios the monotonic trend assumption about these two regional growth curve parameters can be questionable to consider the non monotonic change behavior of extreme rainfall events in regional frequency analysis an unscented kalman filter based regional approach is proposed for location scale and shape parameters estimation using the scaled datasets within a homogeneous group at different temporal states or periods to consider nonlinear relationships for the parameters in state transition function stf and measurement function mf between sequential temporal periods the unscented kalman filter ukf is applied for the filtering of state estimates in the proposed methodology to avoid the degradation of ukf performance which is caused by inaccurate state and measurement noise covariances a monte carlo simulation based procedure is proposed for their noise estimations to reduce the parameter uncertainty associated with the distribution fitting process and consider the spatial correlations amongst the stations within a homogeneous group balancing resamples are used to improve state estimates in regional frequency analysis this ukf based approach addresses the non monotonic change behavior of the extreme rainfall events in a nonstationary environment and fills the gap of considering spatial correlation for dynamic state estimation in regional frequency analysis this proposed methodology was successfully applied to three homogeneous groups in canada and goodness of fit tests were used to validate the parameter estimates and prove the superiority over traditional covariate approach for providing effective rainfall quantile estimates in the upper tail of the distribution keywords regional frequency analysis nonstationary environment unscented kalman filter dynamic state estimation extreme rainfall events 1 introduction extreme rainfall induced flood has become a life threatening natural hazard worldwide zong and chen 2000 boyd 2010 khazai et al 2013 sandink 2013 in the last two decades 3148 flooding events including rainfall induced and snowmelt events affected 1 5 billion people with direct economic losses of 656 billion cred and unisdr 2018 this is mainly caused by ineffective flood mitigation facilities in both rural and urban areas under climate change non stationarity in the extreme rainfall events has been observed in india canada brazil and china etc ma et al 2015 mondal and mujumdar 2015 simonovic et al 2016 fernandes and rodrigues 2017 to balance the construction costs of flood mitigation system and the potential damages caused by future extreme rainfall events accurate estimates of extreme rainfall quantiles are essential for the sustainable planning of the urban drainage system considering engineering economic administrative and cultural aspects zhou 2014 in a nonstationary environment several methods have been proposed for the quantification of extreme rainfall frequency using the at site or regional frequency approach at site approach focuses on the estimation of time dependent location and scale parameters through maximum likelihood or bayesian inference katz et al 2002 nadarajah 2005 cheng et al 2014 using multiple records from stations in a homogeneous group regional approach considers the time dependent nonstationarity in two components the parameters in the regional growth curve function the index event value which represents the mean extreme rainfalls at individual stations nam et al 2015 assuming that non stationarity is only detected in the first and second moments of the extreme rainfall statistics cunderlik and burn 2003 estimated location and scale parameters using the de trended records within a homogeneous group o brien and burn 2014 propoesed to use the weighted combination of location and scale parameters resulted from applying nontationary at site approach at each station in a homoegenous group hanel et al 2009 considered the non stationarity in both regional growth curve and index events values through using unscaled records several issues arise from applying above methods in a nonstationary environment 1 insufficient data records to quantify the changes in the extreme rainfall events in at site approach to reach low uncertainty in the quantile estimates at a return period t the record length should exceed two times the t jacob et al 1999 the annual maximum records which satisfy this requirement especially when t equals to 100 are rare thus the regional approach is used in this study to reduce the uncertainty in the estimates through gathering records from multiple stations 2 the linear assumption about the changing patterns in growth curve parameters may be impractical the nonstationary extreme rainfall patterns are caused by changes in the interactions amongst synoptic processes large scale circulations and anthropogenic aerosols wang and zhou 2005 ipcc 2014 ohba et al 2015 and their non monotonic change behaviors have been observed in historical records burn et al 2011 gao et al 2016 addressed this issue using generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss in at site approach due to the increasing variability of near surface moisture pendergrass et al 2017 an approach that considers the non monotonic patterns of the parameters in regional growth curve is necessary for the regional frequency analysis in a nonstationary environment dynamic state estimation dse is widely used to estimate the non monotonic change patterns of the extreme values in at site approach bayesian inference with linear transition functions gaetan and grigoletto 2004 johnston and djurić 2019 or particle filtering toulemonde et al 2013 have been applied however considering the spatial correlation amongst the stations in a homogeneous group these methods are difficult to apply in the regional frequency analysis to conduct the dse in regional frequency analysis of extreme rainfall in a nonstationary environment ukf based approach is proposed and aims to address the following issues that cannot be achieved in traditional kalman filter wan and van der merwe 2000 hadwin and peterson 2017 1 issue 1 non gaussian distributed state parameters and measurements 2 issue 2 the nonlinear stfs and mfs used for the quantification of extreme rainfall quantiles 3 issue 3 the unreliable state estimates caused by using insufficient samples at each state the possibility of using large samples to improve kalman filter is proven in ensemble kalman filter evensen and van leeuwen 1996 but it is not applicable in this study as it is designed for the dse of gaussian variables with linear stfs and mfs particle filtering is another dse method involves sampling and is not recommended as enormous number of samples are needed to reduce uncertainty hadwin and peterson 2017 4 issue 4 the performance degradation caused by inaccurate noises used at different states to address the non monotonic change patterns of extreme rainfall in a nonstationary environment and fill the gap of considering the spatial correlation for dse in the regional frequency analysis a one step forward procedure which is constructed using ukf with resamples is proposed in this paper the rest of this paper is organized in following sequence the traditional method for regional frequency analysis of the extreme rainfall events in a nonstationary environment is introduced in section 2 the proposed methodology is described in section 3 simulations that are used to explore the changes of state noises under different scenarios and prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology are described in section 4 the application of the proposed methodology is presented in section 5 the paper concludes in section 6 with conclusions and a discussion of potential avenues for future works 2 regional frequency analysis for extreme rainfall events in nonstationary environment regional frequency analysis assumes that rainfall series from stations in a homogeneous group share the similar extreme rainfall distributions and is used for the characterization of extreme rainfall patterns regional approach is advantageous for the reduction of uncertainty in the quantile estimates especially at long return periods in comparison with at site approach in regional frequency analysis quantile estimates are calculated using a index event equation dalrymple 1960 1 q i t ξ i q t where q i t is the extreme rainfall quantile of site i at t year return period ξ i is the index event of site i mean of the extreme rainfall records and q t is the regional dimensionless growth curve in canada the extreme rainfall records the annual maximum rainfall series ams in this study are quantified using the generalized extreme value gev distribution which can be described as jenkinson 1955 alila 1999 2 f y g e v y 1 σ t y κ 1 e t y t y 1 y μ σ ξ 1 κ ξ 0 e y μ σ ξ 0 where μ σ and κ are the location scale and shape parameters respectively in a nonstationary environment eq 1 is modified to consider the changes in regional growth curves o brien and burn 2014 3 q i t t ξ i q t t where the parameters in q t are weighted combination of the estimates from applying generalized linear models glm at each station using following equation o brien and burn 2014 4 μ t u 0 u 1 t σ t α 0 α 1 t κ t κ where μ t σ t and κ t are the estimates of the location scale and shape parameters at time t u 0 u 1 and α 0 α 1 are the regression parameters used for the estimation the parameters estimates in eq 4 can be obtained using maximum likelihood o brien and burn 2014 this traditional glm based regional parameter estimation method will be used as the comparison approach in this study 3 methodology to consider the non monotonic change behavior of the extreme rainfall events and fill the gap of considering the spatial correlation for dse in regional frequency analysis of extreme rainfall values a one step forward procedure is proposed in this section in section 3 1 the rationale and applicability of dynamic state estimation for the regional frequency analysis are explained and the solutions for issue 1 and 2 are introduced in section 3 2 ukf algorithm is described and the solution for issue 3 is proposed in section 3 3 the monte carlo simulation based methods for state and measurement noise estimation are proposed to provide the solution for issue 4 the one step forward procedure is summarized in section 3 4 3 1 dynamic state estimation dse the dse technique can be conducted through the following steps shivakumar and jain 2008 1 state parameters in this study three parameters location scale and shape parameters in the regional growth curve are used to represent the statistical characteristics of the system at target states to consider the non stationarity in regional growth curves additional regression parameters are added as state parameters to reflect their changes between successive states 2 identification of stfs and mfs the stf which is used to describe the transition of state parameters is 5 x k f x k 1 w k where x k is the state parameter vector at state k and contains all the state parameters described in step 1 f represents the transition function w k is the state noise vector at state k the mf which is used to connect state parameters with measurements is 6 z k h x k v k where z k is the measurement vector at state k h represents the function used for measurement calculation with the state parameters v k is the measurement noise vector at state k 3 state prediction state parameters at state k can be predicted using stfs shivakumar and jain 2008 4 state filtering and updating after the state parameters at state k having been predicted they can be filtered when measurements at state k are available to be used in the mf this filtering can be achieved through minimizing the sum of measurement residuals and predicted state vector residuals shivakumar and jain 2008 however because of non gaussian and nonlinear problems mentioned in issue 1 and 2 the dse algorithm specifically the kalman filter may not generate accurate estimates in the regional frequency analysis of extreme rainfall events to resolve these problems the following procedures are proposed 1 to address issue 2 the ukf algorithm is adopted for state parameter estimation ukf algorithm conducts the state propagation using a chosen set of sample points to consider the nonlinearity in stfs and mf and reduces the inaccurate state estimates caused by non gaussian noises wan and van der merwe 2000 the state approximations using sampling points can be accurate to the third order of taylor series expansion for gaussian inputs and second order for non gaussian inputs van der merwe and wan 2001 2 to further improve the accuracy in state estimates and address issue 1 state parameters are transformed before being used in ukf algorithm in the gev distribution location parameters and log transformed scale parameter can be consider as gaussian distributed variables park 2005 yoon et al 2010 the shape parameter follows a beta distribution and needs to be transformed into a gaussian variable through quantile to quantile transformation before being used as a state parameter park 2005 yoon et al 2010 the potential stfs for the transformed distribution parameters and regression parameters are linear functions lll in eq 7 or quadratic functions qqq in

annual maximum observations from n stations within a homogeneous group at the kth state and let z k 1 z k n be the corresponding order statistics the quantile function of the gev distribution in regional frequency analysis is used as the mf 9 z k h μ k σ k κ k v k μ k ln y κ k 1 σ k κ k v k κ k 0 μ k ln y σ k v k κ k 0 where μ k σ k κ k are the regional estimates of location scale and shape parameters at state k and can be obtained using the pd estimates in the state parameter vector the maxima observations are widely used as measurements in dse process gaetan and grigoletto 2004 johnston and djurić 2019 y j n 1 j 1 2 n is a set of space even probabilities and used for measurement calculation thus the calculations for n measurements can be conducted through the following

for the filtering 3 2 unscented kalman filter ukf the standard ukf algorithm can be conducted through the following steps meng et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 1 initialization set the values for initial state estimates and state error covariance matrix 11 x 0 e x 0 p 0 e x 0 x 0 x 0 x 0 t where x 0 is the initial state estimate p 0 is the initial state error covariance matrix 2 sigma points selection the unscented transformation ut a procedure that can be used to estimate the statistics for a random variable experiencing nonlinear transformation wan and van der merwe 2000 is used to select sample

in the state estimates can be generated from ukf algorithm especially in the quantification of regional growth curves using limited number of measurements in at site approach ensemble kalman filter uses a monte carlo simulation to improve the state estimates but is designed for the gaussian variables propagating through linear transitions houtekamer and mitchell 1998 to improve state estimates for regional frequency analysis and consider spatial correlation in dse a one step forward procedure using resamples is proposed in this section this procedure can be conducted through applying ukf algorithm through the successive states the previous and target states using the following steps a resamples at two states 1000 sets of measurement samples with the same sample size and average cross correlation value are generated at each state b pds and prs are estimated at the target state applying ukf algorithm through previous and target states using two random sets of samples thus obtain one set of the pds and prs estimates at target state c 1000 sets of pds estimates can be obtained by repeating step b with 1000 sets of samples at each of the two states d the average pd values can be obtained from 1000 state estimates and are used to quantify the final regional growth curve at target state this one step forward procedure is conducted sequentially at every target state for the state parameter estimation for regional frequency analysis in a nonstationary environment 3 3 estimation of the noise covariance to avoid performance degradation in ukf algorithm and provide the solution for issue 4 meng et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 noise estimation procedures are proposed several methods have been proposed for the noise covariance estimation 1 online methods noise covariances for state and measurements are estimated using the information at each state and can be further divided into four categories bavdekar et al 2011 a correlation methods commonly applied in linear dynamic systems noise covariance can be estimated using least square method based on recurrent autocorrelations between error covariance and innovation covariance mehra 1970 bélanger 1974 odelson et al 2006 b bayesian methods numerical optimisations or expectation maximization methods are used for noise covariance estimation in nonlinear systems through maximizing the likelihood function dempster et al 1977 shumway and stoffer 2000 c monte carlo simulations large state samples are generated conditioned upon priori knowledge and can be used to determine state noise covariance valappil and georgakis 2000 2 adaptive methods based on the state error and innovation covariance the adjusted noise covariances can be constructed using different methods cho and choi 2006 proposed a sigma point based receding horizon kalman filter to resist the deterioration in the state estimates caused by using inaccurate noises zheng et al 2018 presented a covariance correction method to adjust the noise covariances through applying a weighting factor however the adaptive approach is not favourable in this study since high uncertainty and bias can be introduced in the noise covariance adjustments from using one limited measurement sample thus online method specifically the monte carlo simulations is applied for the noise covariance estimation the noise which can be referred as random error is used to describe the random differences between the estimates and the true values at the target state to resolve the problem that true values are unknown at each state the noise estimations are conducted with 1000 generated samples the state noises are estimated through the following steps 1 sample generation for the measurements at the successive states based on the original samples at the successive states one set of measurement samples with the same sample size and average cross correlation value is generated at each of the two states 2 pd sample generation at successive states to generate reliable samples for the distribution parameters and consider the uncertainty associated with using limited number of measurements at each state a simulation based sample generation approach which utilizes both sampling prior and fitting prior in the generation is applied wang and gelfand 2002 the sampling prior which is an informative uniform distribution can be constructed based on the prior knowledge of the distribution parameters and is added to constrain the samples to a reliable portion of the parameter space wang and gelfand 2002 the fitting prior a noninformative vague distribution with large variance is used to fit the distribution once the samples are generated from the sampling prior wang and gelfand 2002 in this study the sampling prior is the confidence intervals for the distribution parameters and constructed using the measurements from step 1 while the fitting priors for location and log transformed scale parameters are the normal distribution with mean set to zero and variance equalling to 104 and for the shape parameter is the beta distribution with the hyper parameters u v set to 6 9 park 2005 yoon et al 2010 random walk metropolis hastings ms algorithm is applied to generate distribution parameter samples using these two priors the transition kernels are normally distributed with means set to zero and variances set to 0 1 0 1 and 0 04 respectively for location scale and shape parameter yoon et al 2010 as a result 1000 sets of distribution parameter samples at each state can be generated using the measurement samples from step 1 and are transformed into the correct forms to be considered as pd samples 3 pr calculation between successive states the pd samples generated in step 2 are used as the inputs in equations 7 or 8 for the estimation of prs one set of pr samples can be obtained from this step 4 noise estimation for the pds based on the regression analysis in step 3 mean squares of the differences between the pd estimates from the regression analysis and the pd samples at the target states are used as one random set of state noises for the pds 5 noise estimation for the prs for each set of pds generated in the successive states from step 2 one set of local prs can be generated to reach the equilibrium state in eq 9 while staying close to the true pr values obtained from regression analysis in step 3 the mean squares of differences between all the local optimal prs for each set of pds and true prs for all the pds are regarded as the state noises for the prs 6 finalization for the pd and pr noise estimates repeat steps 1 to 5 100 times the average values of these 100 sets of noise estimates are used as the diagonal values in the state noise covariance matrix nilsson 2006 compared to state noise covariance measurement noise covariance has less impact on the performance of ukf algorithm meng et al 2016 measurement noises are the random errors between the measurement estimates and their true and unbiased values and can be estimated using the input measurements valappil and georgakis 2000 measurement noise can be affected by the sample size and average cross correlation value amongst the stations in the homogeneous group large sets of random samples are used to estimate the measurement noise through following steps 1 initialization using the measurements at target state the fitted gev distribution and average cross correlation values can be determined 2 sample generation 1000 sets of random samples with the same sample size and average cross correlation value can be generated using the parametric sampling based on the fitted gev distribution from step 1 within each set the generated samples are arranged in increasing order 3 designed quantile calculation using the fitted gev distribution in eq 9 a set of quantiles at design probabilities can be obtained and are arranged in increasing order 4 measurement noise calculation mean squared value of measurement differences can be obtained using one sample sets from step 2 and the empirical quantiles from step 3 5 repeat step 4 for all 1000 samples from step 2 and the final average value for all the mean squared differences can be used as the diagonal values in the measurement noise covariance bryson and ho 1975 akhlaghi et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 the fitted gev distribution in step 1 may be unreliable as samples used in the distribution fitting may be insufficient and the solution for this problem has been reflected in the process 3 4 ukf application in regional frequency analysis the one step forward procedure for regional frequency analysis of extreme rainfall events in a nonstationary environment can be summarized to the following steps as shown in fig 1 1 homogeneous group formation trend centered pooling approach proposed by o brien and burn 2014 is used to identify stations sharing similar rainfall patterns with the target site in a nonstationary environment after applying the mann kendall trend test at stations within the similar climate regions select the stations showing similar trend i e stationary positive or negative trends with the target site then region of influence approach can be applied to further select the stations in the homogeneous group for the target site burn 1990 2 observations processing extreme rainfall series from the homogeneous group from step 1 are scaled by their individual index event values 3 temporal step selection since the proposed methodology is conducted under the assumption that the estimated reginal growth curve can be used to represent the extreme rainfall patterns at each state each temporal period the number of rainfall observations within the selected temporal period should be enough to generate reliable rainfall statistics in the traditional regional approach of frequency analysis 5 t station years should be included in the homogeneous group to provide reliable quantile estimates for the t year return period robson and reed 1999 this rule is applied here for the determination of the lengths of temporal steps for different return periods 4 the construction of state zero state zero is used for the state estimates at state one in this study the measurements at state zero are the replicates of the measurements at state one 5 sample generation to generate reliable measurement samples that can be applied in the one step forward procedure a balanced resampling approach is used burn 2003 compared to the traditional resampling with replacements this approach achieves a balance in the resamples by ensuring that each data point appears the same number of times through following steps a concatenate 999 copies of the original sample into an extended sample b randomly rearrange the original order in the extended sample c the final samples can be obtained through dividing the rearranged extended sample into 999 copies each one of the final 999 resamples plus the original sample i e 1000 sets of samples in summary will be used as the measurements for the estimation at each state furthermore to preserve the spatial correlations among the stations in a homogeneous group a vector resampling approach in which balanced resampling procedure is conducted on the given years of the included stations is implemented burn 2003 6 application of the one step forward procedure at state one randomly select the samples generated from step 5 at state zero and one the one step forward procedure is applied for the pd estimation at state one the noise covariances for all state parameters and measurements are estimated using the procedures described in section 3 3 while the initial values for the pds are the regional estimates through applying the method of l moments in the original sample at state zero the initial values are set to 1 for the p r i 1 and zero for the rest of prs 7 application of the one step forward procedure at latter states with the samples generated from step 5 the same one step forward procedure with 1000 generated samples at each state is applied for the pd estimates at latter states the average state estimates and the average error covariance for the state parameters and measurements obtained from previous states are used in the initial settings for the application of one step forward procedure in the following states 8 uncertainty quantification for the estimated rainfall quantiles 1000 rainfall quantiles at different return periods can be calculated from using 1000 samples of state estimates in the application of one step forward procedure at step 6 and 7 the 95 confidence intervals cis at the target site are calculated based on these quantiles 9 verification and comparison to verify the estimates of the distribution parameter the goodness of fit test specifically the anderson darling ad test is used with the original samples at each temporal step the parameter estimates are considered valid if the p value from the ad test is larger than 0 05 to compare the parameter estimates from the proposed methodology and the traditional glm based method in the regional context the ad test at the upper tail adup which is conducted through assigning higher weights to the data at upper tail of the distribution is used to compare their goodness of fit chernobai et al 2015 4 simulations this section is conducted for two purposes 1 the exploration of state noises under different scenarios between successive states in section 4 1 different change scenarios for the distribution parameters between the successive states were constructed for this exploration 2 the selection of optimal forms for stfs in section 4 2 the selection and testing for the ideal stf forms that could be used in the proposed methodology were conducted 4 1 state noise estimation since measurement noises are affected by the function used in mf the measurement sample size and average cross correlation amongst the measurements from included stations they can be considered as the same at different states when the three factors are fixed the following simulations are used to explore the changes in state noises under different scenarios in regional frequency analysis four factors may affect the state noises in the proposed methodology 1 sample size of the extreme rainfall measurements from a homogeneous group 2 magnitudes of changes for the distribution parameters between successive states 3 average cross correlation values amongst the stations included in the homogeneous group and 4 the forms of stfs used in the ukf algorithm among these four factors sample size has been a long established factor affecting the uncertainty in parameter estimates adcock 1997 wang and gelfand 2002 this section explores the impacts from factors 2 3 and 4 through the following scenarios in which the values for the three factors are set to 1 factor 2 in each scenario two of the three parameters used in the regional growth curve remain the same at all states while different magnitudes of changes for the other parameter are incorporated between successive states the parameter values for all three scenarios are listed in table 1 and the second state in the two successive states is regarded as the target state in the estimation 2 factor 3 for each scenario listed in table 1 the state noises for the pds and prs are estimated using different average cross correlation ranging from 0 to 0 6 with 0 1 being as the increment 3 factor 4 the two types of stfs described in eqs 7 and 8 are tested the details of the simulated group at each scenario are as follows 1 index event values the index events are set to 1 at all stations 2 station number and sample size there are 20 stations each with 20 data points at a state 3 sample generation if the average cross correlation value is zero the 20 data points in each station are random values from a pre set gev distribution at each state and then multiplied by their index events for non zero average cross correlation values samples at each state are generated through following steps a normally distributed sample matrix generation generate a group of data points using standard normal distribution and divide them into a 20 by 20 matrix b correlated normal distributed samples the sample matrix from step a is multiplied by the cholesky decomposition of a diagonal matrix with the correlation value being as the main diagonal entries c the cross correlated sample that fits a gev distribution transform correlated normally distributed sample to the target gev distribution to analyse the state noises generating from using the proposed methodology in section 3 3 in above simulations they are summarized and shown as situation a and b in fig 2 situation a compare state noises with respect to the differences of distribution parameters between successive states in each scenario the noise estimates for pds and prs using seven correlation values are first averaged at each state then for each parameter a boxplot is created based on ratios between the individual average at each state over the overall average for all ten states situation b compare state noises with respect to different cross correlation values in each scenario the noise estimates for pds and prs in all the ten states are first averaged for each cross correlation value then for each parameter a boxplot is created based on ratios between the individual average for each cross correlation value over the overall average for all seven cross correlation values all the boxplots are created separately for stfs in lll and qqq forms the following conclusions can be drawn based on the boxplots in fig 2 1 the state noises are unlikely affected by factor 2 in lll a situations for location and scale parameters the interquartile ranges of the ratios for their pds and prs in all scenarios are close to zero for shape parameters slightly wider interquartile ranges are observed this indicates no obvious change in the state noise is observed similar results are observed in qqq a situation 2 the state noises are unlikely affected by factor 3 in lll b situations for almost all scenarios the interquartile ranges of the ratios for almost all the state noises are close to zero and a slightly wider interquartile range is observed for the pr3 2 in scenario 3 similar results are detected in qqq b situation 3 the state noise is not affected by factor 4 in situation a and b the two conclusions from previous analysis can be drawn using different choices of stfs in the proposed methodology based on the simulation results when the homogeneous group for the target site are fixed across different states the same state and measurement noises can be used in the one step forward procedure for the regional frequency analysis in a nonstationary environment 4 2 the selection of optimal stfs to select the optimal stfs in the one step forward procedure the performance of stfs in lll and qqq forms are evaluated in a simulated homogeneous group the details of this simulated group are as follows 1 station number and samples size at each state there are 20 stations and each with 10 data points at a state 2 number of states 24 states are characterized by different gev distributions 3 index event values the index events are set to 1 at all stations 4 cross correlation values the cross correlation for this simulated group is set from 0 to 0 6 with 0 1 being used as the increment 5 sample generation the same sample generation method used in section 4 1 is applied here for the cross correlated sample generation at each state 1000 sets of samples are generated for the calculations and final state estimates are the average values of the results from using these samples the three scenarios used to evaluate the performance of different stfs is presented in table 2 and shown as the black lines in figs 3 and 4 the reasons for choosing these scenarios are 1 to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology in different trends three trends sinusoidal linear and exponential are incorporated in the design of distribution parameters the linear trends are designed to be in a constant state for evaluating the performance of proposed methodology in a stationary environment 2 to evaluate the performance of proposed methodology when the changes in the distribution parameters are not synchronized while location and shape parameter change at the same rate with different magnitudes in all three scenarios the change directions of scale parameter vary in scenario 1 the scale parameter changes at the same rate and direction as the other distribution parameters but follows different trends in scenario 2 during the two thirds of the simulated states the scale parameter changes at different rates from the other parameters in scenario 3 the scale parameter changes at the same rates but follows opposite direction and different trends from the other parameters the parameters estimation using the proposed methodology in three scenarios can be conducted by following step 4 to 7 introduced in section 3 4 based on the conclusions obtained in section 4 2 the same state and measurement noises which are estimated using the procedure in section 3 3 are applied at different states to select the optimal stfs for the proposed methodology the estimates of the distribution parameters in all scenarios with average cross correlation value being set to zero are conducted using stfs in lll and qqq forms the parameter estimates from using stfs in lll forms are shown in fig 3 while those from using stfs in qqq forms are shown in the first columns of each plot in fig 4 several conclusions can be obtained from comparing these estimates 1 trend depiction the stfs in both lll and qqq forms can successfully describe the changing trends in location scale and shape parameters in all three scenarios 2 noticeable differences are observed in the values of parameter estimates between using stfs in lll and qqq forms the stfs in qqq form generate better parameter estimates by showing values close to the design values for all distribution parameters especially for the shape parameter at all states and scale and location parameters at stationary states thus the stfs in qqq form are selected as the optimal stfs in the proposed methodology to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with stfs in qqq form it is tested in all three scenarios with different average cross correlation values the parameter estimates in three scenarios are depicted in fig 4 the following conclusions are obtained 1 the proposed methodology can accurately capture the trends for the location and scale parameters and reasonably simulate the trends in the shape parameter with different average cross correlation values 2 the accuracy for both location and scale parameter estimates reach the highest levels when average correlation is 0 and decreases when the average correlation value increases the uncertainty for the shape parameter estimates reaches the lowest level when the average correlation value is 0 4 and decreases when the correlation value deviates from this value 3 since small differences are detected between the design values and estimated ones for the shape parameter they have similar levels of goodness of fit based on ad test 5 application this section is used to evaluate the proposed methodology and compare it with the traditional glm based approach introduced in section 2 5 1 study area and data processing following steps are conducted for the initial settings in the application of the proposed methodology for regional frequency analysis in a non stationary environment 1 the selection of testing regions two testing regions are selected in canada 1 region 1 includes most of the rainfall stations in british columbia from pacific maritime and cordilleran climate regions 2 region 2 includes rainfall stations in ontario and quebec from boreal and southeastern climate regions 2 the extraction of 24 h ams the ams of extreme rainfall records at 24 hr duration from 2011 to 2100 are extracted from the na cordex archive at 25 km 0 22 spatial resolution using canesm2 canrcm4 model under the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 scenario bias corrected data records were not available when this study was conducted the 24 h ams are extracted annually from march to november in british columbia and from april to november in ontario and quebec requena et al 2019 3 trend analysis stations exhibiting trends need to first be identified the mann kendall nonparametric test is applied at every station using the extracted 24 h ams for the trend detection mann 1945 kendall 1948 pettitt test is applied to remove stations with change points thus 15 stations with increasing trends are identified in region 1 and 35 stations are identified in region 2 4 homogeneous group formation three homogeneous groups are formed 1 small homogeneous group for station 1 climate id 1060841 in region 1 hg1 6 stations are included with a heterogeneity measure of 0 92 2 small homogeneous group for station 2 climate id 1160899 in region 1 hg2 6 stations are included with a heterogeneity measure of 1 49 3 large homogeneous group for station 3 climate id 7031375 in region 2 hg3 30 stations are included with a heterogeneity measure of 1 2 the geographic display of these homogeneous groups is shown in fig 5 in this step the heterogeneity measure is calculated based on the difference between regional and at site l cvs hosking and wallis 1997 5 the ams scaling the extracted ams at all selected stations are scaled by their index event values 5 2 validation and comparison this section is used for two purposes the verification of the parameter estimates from the proposed methodology and the comparison of goodness of fit between estimates from the proposed methodology and traditional glm based approach at the upper tail of the measurements both procedures were conducted at different temporal steps for following purposes 1 to prove the superiority of the proposed methodology over the traditional glm based method since the traditional glm based method is conducted on a yearly basis the superiority of the proposed methodology can be confirmed when it is proven to provide better estimates on 1 year temporal step 2 to capture the dynamic behavior of distribution parameters and reduce the uncertainty in the final quantile estimates while small temporal steps should be used to meet the first requirement larger uncertainty for the quantile estimates especially at long return periods can be generated to balance these two goals the 5 t rule for gathering data records in the regional context is applied for the selection of temporal steps in the application of the proposed methodology for quantile estimation at different return periods 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year thus the potential temporal steps used in this section are 2 year 5 year 9 year 22 year for the homogeneous groups formed at station 1 and 2 1 year 2 year 3 year 5 year 9 year and 15 year for the homogeneous groups formed at station 3 the parameter estimates from using the proposed methodology are verified through using ad test with the original data records at different temporal steps the percentages of the valid estimates from using the proposed methodology and traditional glm based method at different temporal steps are shown in table 3 the following conclusions can be obtained 1 both the proposed methodology and traditional approach can generate high percentages of valid estimates at different temporal steps the proposed methodology is superior by providing higher percentages at different temporal steps 2 the level of homogeneity can affect the validity of the parameter estimates in both approaches the homogeneous group formed for station 1 has the highest level of homogeneity and the highest percentage of valid estimates at different temporal steps to prove the superiority of the proposed methodology for providing better parameter estimates for the extreme rainfall quantile estimation at the upper tail the adup test is used as the goodness of fit test the percentages of proposed methodology generating better parameter estimates than that from using the traditional glm based approach at different temporal steps are shown in table 4 the following conclusions can be obtained 1 parameter estimates from the proposed methodology are better fits for the rainfall quantiles at upper tail than that from the traditional glm based approach when using 1 year temporal step the estimates from proposed methodology are generally better fits at the upper tail as the percentages for being superior are higher than 50 for all three groups for all groups the level of homogeneity can affect the performance of the proposed methodology since the percentage for parameter estimates being superior is the highest at the most homogeneous group for station 1 while the lowest at the least homogeneous group for station 2 with similar level of homogeneity the performance of the proposed methodology is affected by sample size as the percentages for parameter estimates being superior are higher at the homogeneous group for station 3 than that at station 2 2 the superiority of the proposed methodology is prominent when the temporal step is larger than 3 year since most of the percentages for parameter estimates being superior are higher than 80 5 3 quantile estimation based on the comparison shown in table 4 and following the 5 t rule the temporal steps used for the quantile estimation for the homogeneous groups at three selected stations are shown in table 5 the quantile calculations with the 95 confidence intervals for stations 1 2 and 3 at different return periods are shown in fig 6 based on fig 6 the following conclusions can be reached 1 the basic trends of the extreme rainfall quantiles at different return periods from using the proposed methodology are consistent with that from using the traditional glm based method all three homogeneous groups were formed by gathering stations showing increasing trends thus the overall increasing trends of extreme rainfall quantiles at different return periods are consistent with the trend analysis 2 dynamic behavior of the extreme rainfall quantiles can be observed at different return periods compared to the linear increasing trend depicted in the extreme rainfall quantiles through using the traditional glm based method more dynamic behavior for the extreme rainfall quantiles is observed especially at short return periods for station 1 and 2 and all return periods for station 3 6 conclusions under climate change the extreme rainfall patterns around the world are changing the traditional glm based approach for the regional frequency analysis in a nonstationary environment is conducted under the assumption that the parameters in the regional growth curve are undergoing monotonic changes and can be questionable since non monotonic behavior of the extreme rainfall events having been observed to consider the dynamic behavior of the extreme rainfall in regional frequency analysis a ukf based procedure with spatial correlated resamples is established to accurately capture the highly nonlinear relationships amongst the distribution parameters in the regional growth curve and consider their nonlinear transitions between successive states the unscented kalman filter is used to reduce the uncertainty caused by limited number of rainfall records and consider the impacts form cross correlation amongst the input stations large sets of cross correlated measurement resamples are generated for the quantification of the regional growth curve at each state to reduce the possibility of performance degradation in the ukf application which is caused by using inaccurate noise covariance monte carlo simulation based method is used to explore the patterns of state and measurement noises compared to the traditional approach the proposed methodology is demonstrated to 1 fully utilize the advantage that the rainfall records from multiple stations are available for the parameter estimation in regional frequency analysis 2 consider the uncertainty associated with using limited rainfall records at each temporal period and the impacts from cross correlation amongst the stations within a homogeneous group 3 consider the potential non monotonic trends for the extreme rainfall quantiles at different return periods the proposed methodology has provided reliable parameter estimates for the regional growth curve at stations exhibiting increasing

4940,in regional frequency analysis extreme rainfall patterns in a nonstationary environment are characterized by the time dependent regional growth curves in which location and scale parameters are the weighted values of at site estimates from the sites within a homogeneous group however under different climate change scenarios the monotonic trend assumption about these two regional growth curve parameters can be questionable to consider the non monotonic change behavior of extreme rainfall events in regional frequency analysis an unscented kalman filter based regional approach is proposed for location scale and shape parameters estimation using the scaled datasets within a homogeneous group at different temporal states or periods to consider nonlinear relationships for the parameters in state transition function stf and measurement function mf between sequential temporal periods the unscented kalman filter ukf is applied for the filtering of state estimates in the proposed methodology to avoid the degradation of ukf performance which is caused by inaccurate state and measurement noise covariances a monte carlo simulation based procedure is proposed for their noise estimations to reduce the parameter uncertainty associated with the distribution fitting process and consider the spatial correlations amongst the stations within a homogeneous group balancing resamples are used to improve state estimates in regional frequency analysis this ukf based approach addresses the non monotonic change behavior of the extreme rainfall events in a nonstationary environment and fills the gap of considering spatial correlation for dynamic state estimation in regional frequency analysis this proposed methodology was successfully applied to three homogeneous groups in canada and goodness of fit tests were used to validate the parameter estimates and prove the superiority over traditional covariate approach for providing effective rainfall quantile estimates in the upper tail of the distribution keywords regional frequency analysis nonstationary environment unscented kalman filter dynamic state estimation extreme rainfall events 1 introduction extreme rainfall induced flood has become a life threatening natural hazard worldwide zong and chen 2000 boyd 2010 khazai et al 2013 sandink 2013 in the last two decades 3148 flooding events including rainfall induced and snowmelt events affected 1 5 billion people with direct economic losses of 656 billion cred and unisdr 2018 this is mainly caused by ineffective flood mitigation facilities in both rural and urban areas under climate change non stationarity in the extreme rainfall events has been observed in india canada brazil and china etc ma et al 2015 mondal and mujumdar 2015 simonovic et al 2016 fernandes and rodrigues 2017 to balance the construction costs of flood mitigation system and the potential damages caused by future extreme rainfall events accurate estimates of extreme rainfall quantiles are essential for the sustainable planning of the urban drainage system considering engineering economic administrative and cultural aspects zhou 2014 in a nonstationary environment several methods have been proposed for the quantification of extreme rainfall frequency using the at site or regional frequency approach at site approach focuses on the estimation of time dependent location and scale parameters through maximum likelihood or bayesian inference katz et al 2002 nadarajah 2005 cheng et al 2014 using multiple records from stations in a homogeneous group regional approach considers the time dependent nonstationarity in two components the parameters in the regional growth curve function the index event value which represents the mean extreme rainfalls at individual stations nam et al 2015 assuming that non stationarity is only detected in the first and second moments of the extreme rainfall statistics cunderlik and burn 2003 estimated location and scale parameters using the de trended records within a homogeneous group o brien and burn 2014 propoesed to use the weighted combination of location and scale parameters resulted from applying nontationary at site approach at each station in a homoegenous group hanel et al 2009 considered the non stationarity in both regional growth curve and index events values through using unscaled records several issues arise from applying above methods in a nonstationary environment 1 insufficient data records to quantify the changes in the extreme rainfall events in at site approach to reach low uncertainty in the quantile estimates at a return period t the record length should exceed two times the t jacob et al 1999 the annual maximum records which satisfy this requirement especially when t equals to 100 are rare thus the regional approach is used in this study to reduce the uncertainty in the estimates through gathering records from multiple stations 2 the linear assumption about the changing patterns in growth curve parameters may be impractical the nonstationary extreme rainfall patterns are caused by changes in the interactions amongst synoptic processes large scale circulations and anthropogenic aerosols wang and zhou 2005 ipcc 2014 ohba et al 2015 and their non monotonic change behaviors have been observed in historical records burn et al 2011 gao et al 2016 addressed this issue using generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss in at site approach due to the increasing variability of near surface moisture pendergrass et al 2017 an approach that considers the non monotonic patterns of the parameters in regional growth curve is necessary for the regional frequency analysis in a nonstationary environment dynamic state estimation dse is widely used to estimate the non monotonic change patterns of the extreme values in at site approach bayesian inference with linear transition functions gaetan and grigoletto 2004 johnston and djurić 2019 or particle filtering toulemonde et al 2013 have been applied however considering the spatial correlation amongst the stations in a homogeneous group these methods are difficult to apply in the regional frequency analysis to conduct the dse in regional frequency analysis of extreme rainfall in a nonstationary environment ukf based approach is proposed and aims to address the following issues that cannot be achieved in traditional kalman filter wan and van der merwe 2000 hadwin and peterson 2017 1 issue 1 non gaussian distributed state parameters and measurements 2 issue 2 the nonlinear stfs and mfs used for the quantification of extreme rainfall quantiles 3 issue 3 the unreliable state estimates caused by using insufficient samples at each state the possibility of using large samples to improve kalman filter is proven in ensemble kalman filter evensen and van leeuwen 1996 but it is not applicable in this study as it is designed for the dse of gaussian variables with linear stfs and mfs particle filtering is another dse method involves sampling and is not recommended as enormous number of samples are needed to reduce uncertainty hadwin and peterson 2017 4 issue 4 the performance degradation caused by inaccurate noises used at different states to address the non monotonic change patterns of extreme rainfall in a nonstationary environment and fill the gap of considering the spatial correlation for dse in the regional frequency analysis a one step forward procedure which is constructed using ukf with resamples is proposed in this paper the rest of this paper is organized in following sequence the traditional method for regional frequency analysis of the extreme rainfall events in a nonstationary environment is introduced in section 2 the proposed methodology is described in section 3 simulations that are used to explore the changes of state noises under different scenarios and prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology are described in section 4 the application of the proposed methodology is presented in section 5 the paper concludes in section 6 with conclusions and a discussion of potential avenues for future works 2 regional frequency analysis for extreme rainfall events in nonstationary environment regional frequency analysis assumes that rainfall series from stations in a homogeneous group share the similar extreme rainfall distributions and is used for the characterization of extreme rainfall patterns regional approach is advantageous for the reduction of uncertainty in the quantile estimates especially at long return periods in comparison with at site approach in regional frequency analysis quantile estimates are calculated using a index event equation dalrymple 1960 1 q i t ξ i q t where q i t is the extreme rainfall quantile of site i at t year return period ξ i is the index event of site i mean of the extreme rainfall records and q t is the regional dimensionless growth curve in canada the extreme rainfall records the annual maximum rainfall series ams in this study are quantified using the generalized extreme value gev distribution which can be described as jenkinson 1955 alila 1999 2 f y g e v y 1 σ t y κ 1 e t y t y 1 y μ σ ξ 1 κ ξ 0 e y μ σ ξ 0 where μ σ and κ are the location scale and shape parameters respectively in a nonstationary environment eq 1 is modified to consider the changes in regional growth curves o brien and burn 2014 3 q i t t ξ i q t t where the parameters in q t are weighted combination of the estimates from applying generalized linear models glm at each station using following equation o brien and burn 2014 4 μ t u 0 u 1 t σ t α 0 α 1 t κ t κ where μ t σ t and κ t are the estimates of the location scale and shape parameters at time t u 0 u 1 and α 0 α 1 are the regression parameters used for the estimation the parameters estimates in eq 4 can be obtained using maximum likelihood o brien and burn 2014 this traditional glm based regional parameter estimation method will be used as the comparison approach in this study 3 methodology to consider the non monotonic change behavior of the extreme rainfall events and fill the gap of considering the spatial correlation for dse in regional frequency analysis of extreme rainfall values a one step forward procedure is proposed in this section in section 3 1 the rationale and applicability of dynamic state estimation for the regional frequency analysis are explained and the solutions for issue 1 and 2 are introduced in section 3 2 ukf algorithm is described and the solution for issue 3 is proposed in section 3 3 the monte carlo simulation based methods for state and measurement noise estimation are proposed to provide the solution for issue 4 the one step forward procedure is summarized in section 3 4 3 1 dynamic state estimation dse the dse technique can be conducted through the following steps shivakumar and jain 2008 1 state parameters in this study three parameters location scale and shape parameters in the regional growth curve are used to represent the statistical characteristics of the system at target states to consider the non stationarity in regional growth curves additional regression parameters are added as state parameters to reflect their changes between successive states 2 identification of stfs and mfs the stf which is used to describe the transition of state parameters is 5 x k f x k 1 w k where x k is the state parameter vector at state k and contains all the state parameters described in step 1 f represents the transition function w k is the state noise vector at state k the mf which is used to connect state parameters with measurements is 6 z k h x k v k where z k is the measurement vector at state k h represents the function used for measurement calculation with the state parameters v k is the measurement noise vector at state k 3 state prediction state parameters at state k can be predicted using stfs shivakumar and jain 2008 4 state filtering and updating after the state parameters at state k having been predicted they can be filtered when measurements at state k are available to be used in the mf this filtering can be achieved through minimizing the sum of measurement residuals and predicted state vector residuals shivakumar and jain 2008 however because of non gaussian and nonlinear problems mentioned in issue 1 and 2 the dse algorithm specifically the kalman filter may not generate accurate estimates in the regional frequency analysis of extreme rainfall events to resolve these problems the following procedures are proposed 1 to address issue 2 the ukf algorithm is adopted for state parameter estimation ukf algorithm conducts the state propagation using a chosen set of sample points to consider the nonlinearity in stfs and mf and reduces the inaccurate state estimates caused by non gaussian noises wan and van der merwe 2000 the state approximations using sampling points can be accurate to the third order of taylor series expansion for gaussian inputs and second order for non gaussian inputs van der merwe and wan 2001 2 to further improve the accuracy in state estimates and address issue 1 state parameters are transformed before being used in ukf algorithm in the gev distribution location parameters and log transformed scale parameter can be consider as gaussian distributed variables park 2005 yoon et al 2010 the shape parameter follows a beta distribution and needs to be transformed into a gaussian variable through quantile to quantile transformation before being used as a state parameter park 2005 yoon et al 2010 the potential stfs for the transformed distribution parameters and regression parameters are linear functions lll in eq 7 or quadratic functions qqq in

uses a monte carlo simulation to improve the state estimates but is designed for the gaussian variables propagating through linear transitions houtekamer and mitchell 1998 to improve state estimates for regional frequency analysis and consider spatial correlation in dse a one step forward procedure using resamples is proposed in this section this procedure can be conducted through applying ukf algorithm through the successive states the previous and target states using the following steps a resamples at two states 1000 sets of measurement samples with the same sample size and average cross correlation value are generated at each state b pds and prs are estimated at the target state applying ukf algorithm through previous and target states using two random sets of samples thus obtain one set of the pds and prs estimates at target state c 1000 sets of pds estimates can be obtained by repeating step b with 1000 sets of samples at each of the two states d the average pd values can be obtained from 1000 state estimates and are used to quantify the final regional growth curve at target state this one step forward procedure is conducted sequentially at every target state for the state parameter estimation for regional frequency analysis in a nonstationary environment 3 3 estimation of the noise covariance to avoid performance degradation in ukf algorithm and provide the solution for issue 4 meng et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 noise estimation procedures are proposed several methods have been proposed for the noise covariance estimation 1 online methods noise covariances for state and measurements are estimated using the information at each state and can be further divided into four categories bavdekar et al 2011 a correlation methods commonly applied in linear dynamic systems noise covariance can be estimated using least square method based on recurrent autocorrelations between error covariance and innovation covariance mehra 1970 bélanger 1974 odelson et al 2006 b bayesian methods numerical optimisations or expectation maximization methods are used for noise covariance estimation in nonlinear systems through maximizing the likelihood function dempster et al 1977 shumway and stoffer 2000 c monte carlo simulations large state samples are generated conditioned upon priori knowledge and can be used to determine state noise covariance valappil and georgakis 2000 2 adaptive methods based on the state error and innovation covariance the adjusted noise covariances can be constructed using different methods cho and choi 2006 proposed a sigma point based receding horizon kalman filter to resist the deterioration in the state estimates caused by using inaccurate noises zheng et al 2018 presented a covariance correction method to adjust the noise covariances through applying a weighting factor however the adaptive approach is not favourable in this study since high uncertainty and bias can be introduced in the noise covariance adjustments from using one limited measurement sample thus online method specifically the monte carlo simulations is applied for the noise covariance estimation the noise which can be referred as random error is used to describe the random differences between the estimates and the true values at the target state to resolve the problem that true values are unknown at each state the noise estimations are conducted with 1000 generated samples the state noises are estimated through the following steps 1 sample generation for the measurements at the successive states based on the original samples at the successive states one set of measurement samples with the same sample size and average cross correlation value is generated at each of the two states 2 pd sample generation at successive states to generate reliable samples for the distribution parameters and consider the uncertainty associated with using limited number of measurements at each state a simulation based sample generation approach which utilizes both sampling prior and fitting prior in the generation is applied wang and gelfand 2002 the sampling prior which is an informative uniform distribution can be constructed based on the prior knowledge of the distribution parameters and is added to constrain the samples to a reliable portion of the parameter space wang and gelfand 2002 the fitting prior a noninformative vague distribution with large variance is used to fit the distribution once the samples are generated from the sampling prior wang and gelfand 2002 in this study the sampling prior is the confidence intervals for the distribution parameters and constructed using the measurements from step 1 while the fitting priors for location and log transformed scale parameters are the normal distribution with mean set to zero and variance equalling to 104 and for the shape parameter is the beta distribution with the hyper parameters u v set to 6 9 park 2005 yoon et al 2010 random walk metropolis hastings ms algorithm is applied to generate distribution parameter samples using these two priors the transition kernels are normally distributed with means set to zero and variances set to 0 1 0 1 and 0 04 respectively for location scale and shape parameter yoon et al 2010 as a result 1000 sets of distribution parameter samples at each state can be generated using the measurement samples from step 1 and are transformed into the correct forms to be considered as pd samples 3 pr calculation between successive states the pd samples generated in step 2 are used as the inputs in equations 7 or 8 for the estimation of prs one set of pr samples can be obtained from this step 4 noise estimation for the pds based on the regression analysis in step 3 mean squares of the differences between the pd estimates from the regression analysis and the pd samples at the target states are used as one random set of state noises for the pds 5 noise estimation for the prs for each set of pds generated in the successive states from step 2 one set of local prs can be generated to reach the equilibrium state in eq 9 while staying close to the true pr values obtained from regression analysis in step 3 the mean squares of differences between all the local optimal prs for each set of pds and true prs for all the pds are regarded as the state noises for the prs 6 finalization for the pd and pr noise estimates repeat steps 1 to 5 100 times the average values of these 100 sets of noise estimates are used as the diagonal values in the state noise covariance matrix nilsson 2006 compared to state noise covariance measurement noise covariance has less impact on the performance of ukf algorithm meng et al 2016 measurement noises are the random errors between the measurement estimates and their true and unbiased values and can be estimated using the input measurements valappil and georgakis 2000 measurement noise can be affected by the sample size and average cross correlation value amongst the stations in the homogeneous group large sets of random samples are used to estimate the measurement noise through following steps 1 initialization using the measurements at target state the fitted gev distribution and average cross correlation values can be determined 2 sample generation 1000 sets of random samples with the same sample size and average cross correlation value can be generated using the parametric sampling based on the fitted gev distribution from step 1 within each set the generated samples are arranged in increasing order 3 designed quantile calculation using the fitted gev distribution in eq 9 a set of quantiles at design probabilities can be obtained and are arranged in increasing order 4 measurement noise calculation mean squared value of measurement differences can be obtained using one sample sets from step 2 and the empirical quantiles from step 3 5 repeat step 4 for all 1000 samples from step 2 and the final average value for all the mean squared differences can be used as the diagonal values in the measurement noise covariance bryson and ho 1975 akhlaghi et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 the fitted gev distribution in step 1 may be unreliable as samples used in the distribution fitting may be insufficient and the solution for this problem has been reflected in the process 3 4 ukf application in regional frequency analysis the one step forward procedure for regional frequency analysis of extreme rainfall events in a nonstationary environment can be summarized to the following steps as shown in fig 1 1 homogeneous group formation trend centered pooling approach proposed by o brien and burn 2014 is used to identify stations sharing similar rainfall patterns with the target site in a nonstationary environment after applying the mann kendall trend test at stations within the similar climate regions select the stations showing similar trend i e stationary positive or negative trends with the target site then region of influence approach can be applied to further select the stations in the homogeneous group for the target site burn 1990 2 observations processing extreme rainfall series from the homogeneous group from step 1 are scaled by their individual index event values 3 temporal step selection since the proposed methodology is conducted under the assumption that the estimated reginal growth curve can be used to represent the extreme rainfall patterns at each state each temporal period the number of rainfall observations within the selected temporal period should be enough to generate reliable rainfall statistics in the traditional regional approach of frequency analysis 5 t station years should be included in the homogeneous group to provide reliable quantile estimates for the t year return period robson and reed 1999 this rule is applied here for the determination of the lengths of temporal steps for different return periods 4 the construction of state zero state zero is used for the state estimates at state one in this study the measurements at state zero are the replicates of the measurements at state one 5 sample generation to generate reliable measurement samples that can be applied in the one step forward procedure a balanced resampling approach is used burn 2003 compared to the traditional resampling with replacements this approach achieves a balance in the resamples by ensuring that each data point appears the same number of times through following steps a concatenate 999 copies of the original sample into an extended sample b randomly rearrange the original order in the extended sample c the final samples can be obtained through dividing the rearranged extended sample into 999 copies each one of the final 999 resamples plus the original sample i e 1000 sets of samples in summary will be used as the measurements for the estimation at each state furthermore to preserve the spatial correlations among the stations in a homogeneous group a vector resampling approach in which balanced resampling procedure is conducted on the given years of the included stations is implemented burn 2003 6 application of the one step forward procedure at state one randomly select the samples generated from step 5 at state zero and one the one step forward procedure is applied for the pd estimation at state one the noise covariances for all state parameters and measurements are estimated using the procedures described in section 3 3 while the initial values for the pds are the regional estimates through applying the method of l moments in the original sample at state zero the initial values are set to 1 for the p r i 1 and zero for the rest of prs 7 application of the one step forward procedure at latter states with the samples generated from step 5 the same one step forward procedure with 1000 generated samples at each state is applied for the pd estimates at latter states the average state estimates and the average error covariance for the state parameters and measurements obtained from previous states are used in the initial settings for the application of one step forward procedure in the following states 8 uncertainty quantification for the estimated rainfall quantiles 1000 rainfall quantiles at different return periods can be calculated from using 1000 samples of state estimates in the application of one step forward procedure at step 6 and 7 the 95 confidence intervals cis at the target site are calculated based on these quantiles 9 verification and comparison to verify the estimates of the distribution parameter the goodness of fit test specifically the anderson darling ad test is used with the original samples at each temporal step the parameter estimates are considered valid if the p value from the ad test is larger than 0 05 to compare the parameter estimates from the proposed methodology and the traditional glm based method in the regional context the ad test at the upper tail adup which is conducted through assigning higher weights to the data at upper tail of the distribution is used to compare their goodness of fit chernobai et al 2015 4 simulations this section is conducted for two purposes 1 the exploration of state noises under different scenarios between successive states in section 4 1 different change scenarios for the distribution parameters between the successive states were constructed for this exploration 2 the selection of optimal forms for stfs in section 4 2 the selection and testing for the ideal stf forms that could be used in the proposed methodology were conducted 4 1 state noise estimation since measurement noises are affected by the function used in mf the measurement sample size and average cross correlation amongst the measurements from included stations they can be considered as the same at different states when the three factors are fixed the following simulations are used to explore the changes in state noises under different scenarios in regional frequency analysis four factors may affect the state noises in the proposed methodology 1 sample size of the extreme rainfall measurements from a homogeneous group 2 magnitudes of changes for the distribution parameters between successive states 3 average cross correlation values amongst the stations included in the homogeneous group and 4 the forms of stfs used in the ukf algorithm among these four factors sample size has been a long established factor affecting the uncertainty in parameter estimates adcock 1997 wang and gelfand 2002 this section explores the impacts from factors 2 3 and 4 through the following scenarios in which the values for the three factors are set to 1 factor 2 in each scenario two of the three parameters used in the regional growth curve remain the same at all states while different magnitudes of changes for the other parameter are incorporated between successive states the parameter values for all three scenarios are listed in table 1 and the second state in the two successive states is regarded as the target state in the estimation 2 factor 3 for each scenario listed in table 1 the state noises for the pds and prs are estimated using different average cross correlation ranging from 0 to 0 6 with 0 1 being as the increment 3 factor 4 the two types of stfs described in eqs 7 and 8 are tested the details of the simulated group at each scenario are as follows 1 index event values the index events are set to 1 at all stations 2 station number and sample size there are 20 stations each with 20 data points at a state 3 sample generation if the average cross correlation value is zero the 20 data points in each station are random values from a pre set gev distribution at each state and then multiplied by their index events for non zero average cross correlation values samples at each state are generated through following steps a normally distributed sample matrix generation generate a group of data points using standard normal distribution and divide them into a 20 by 20 matrix b correlated normal distributed samples the sample matrix from step a is multiplied by the cholesky decomposition of a diagonal matrix with the correlation value being as the main diagonal entries c the cross correlated sample that fits a gev distribution transform correlated normally distributed sample to the target gev distribution to analyse the state noises generating from using the proposed methodology in section 3 3 in above simulations they are summarized and shown as situation a and b in fig 2 situation a compare state noises with respect to the differences of distribution parameters between successive states in each scenario the noise estimates for pds and prs using seven correlation values are first averaged at each state then for each parameter a boxplot is created based on ratios between the individual average at each state over the overall average for all ten states situation b compare state noises with respect to different cross correlation values in each scenario the noise estimates for pds and prs in all the ten states are first averaged for each cross correlation value then for each parameter a boxplot is created based on ratios between the individual average for each cross correlation value over the overall average for all seven cross correlation values all the boxplots are created separately for stfs in lll and qqq forms the following conclusions can be drawn based on the boxplots in fig 2 1 the state noises are unlikely affected by factor 2 in lll a situations for location and scale parameters the interquartile ranges of the ratios for their pds and prs in all scenarios are close to zero for shape parameters slightly wider interquartile ranges are observed this indicates no obvious change in the state noise is observed similar results are observed in qqq a situation 2 the state noises are unlikely affected by factor 3 in lll b situations for almost all scenarios the interquartile ranges of the ratios for almost all the state noises are close to zero and a slightly wider interquartile range is observed for the pr3 2 in scenario 3 similar results are detected in qqq b situation 3 the state noise is not affected by factor 4 in situation a and b the two conclusions from previous analysis can be drawn using different choices of stfs in the proposed methodology based on the simulation results when the homogeneous group for the target site are fixed across different states the same state and measurement noises can be used in the one step forward procedure for the regional frequency analysis in a nonstationary environment 4 2 the selection of optimal stfs to select the optimal stfs in the one step forward procedure the performance of stfs in lll and qqq forms are evaluated in a simulated homogeneous group the details of this simulated group are as follows 1 station number and samples size at each state there are 20 stations and each with 10 data points at a state 2 number of states 24 states are characterized by different gev distributions 3 index event values the index events are set to 1 at all stations 4 cross correlation values the cross correlation for this simulated group is set from 0 to 0 6 with 0 1 being used as the increment 5 sample generation the same sample generation method used in section 4 1 is applied here for the cross correlated sample generation at each state 1000 sets of samples are generated for the calculations and final state estimates are the average values of the results from using these samples the three scenarios used to evaluate the performance of different stfs is presented in table 2 and shown as the black lines in figs 3 and 4 the reasons for choosing these scenarios are 1 to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology in different trends three trends sinusoidal linear and exponential are incorporated in the design of distribution parameters the linear trends are designed to be in a constant state for evaluating the performance of proposed methodology in a stationary environment 2 to evaluate the performance of proposed methodology when the changes in the distribution parameters are not synchronized while location and shape parameter change at the same rate with different magnitudes in all three scenarios the change directions of scale parameter vary in scenario 1 the scale parameter changes at the same rate and direction as the other distribution parameters but follows different trends in scenario 2 during the two thirds of the simulated states the scale parameter changes at different rates from the other parameters in scenario 3 the scale parameter changes at the same rates but follows opposite direction and different trends from the other parameters the parameters estimation using the proposed methodology in three scenarios can be conducted by following step 4 to 7 introduced in section 3 4 based on the conclusions obtained in section 4 2 the same state and measurement noises which are estimated using the procedure in section 3 3 are applied at different states to select the optimal stfs for the proposed methodology the estimates of the distribution parameters in all scenarios with average cross correlation value being set to zero are conducted using stfs in lll and qqq forms the parameter estimates from using stfs in lll forms are shown in fig 3 while those from using stfs in qqq forms are shown in the first columns of each plot in fig 4 several conclusions can be obtained from comparing these estimates 1 trend depiction the stfs in both lll and qqq forms can successfully describe the changing trends in location scale and shape parameters in all three scenarios 2 noticeable differences are observed in the values of parameter estimates between using stfs in lll and qqq forms the stfs in qqq form generate better parameter estimates by showing values close to the design values for all distribution parameters especially for the shape parameter at all states and scale and location parameters at stationary states thus the stfs in qqq form are selected as the optimal stfs in the proposed methodology to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with stfs in qqq form it is tested in all three scenarios with different average cross correlation values the parameter estimates in three scenarios are depicted in fig 4 the following conclusions are obtained 1 the proposed methodology can accurately capture the trends for the location and scale parameters and reasonably simulate the trends in the shape parameter with different average cross correlation values 2 the accuracy for both location and scale parameter estimates reach the highest levels when average correlation is 0 and decreases when the average correlation value increases the uncertainty for the shape parameter estimates reaches the lowest level when the average correlation value is 0 4 and decreases when the correlation value deviates from this value 3 since small differences are detected between the design values and estimated ones for the shape parameter they have similar levels of goodness of fit based on ad test 5 application this section is used to evaluate the proposed methodology and compare it with the traditional glm based approach introduced in section 2 5 1 study area and data processing following steps are conducted for the initial settings in the application of the proposed methodology for regional frequency analysis in a non stationary environment 1 the selection of testing regions two testing regions are selected in canada 1 region 1 includes most of the rainfall stations in british columbia from pacific maritime and cordilleran climate regions 2 region 2 includes rainfall stations in ontario and quebec from boreal and southeastern climate regions 2 the extraction of 24 h ams the ams of extreme rainfall records at 24 hr duration from 2011 to 2100 are extracted from the na cordex archive at 25 km 0 22 spatial resolution using canesm2 canrcm4 model under the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 scenario bias corrected data records were not available when this study was conducted the 24 h ams are extracted annually from march to november in british columbia and from april to november in ontario and quebec requena et al 2019 3 trend analysis stations exhibiting trends need to first be identified the mann kendall nonparametric test is applied at every station using the extracted 24 h ams for the trend detection mann 1945 kendall 1948 pettitt test is applied to remove stations with change points thus 15 stations with increasing trends are identified in region 1 and 35 stations are identified in region 2 4 homogeneous group formation three homogeneous groups are formed 1 small homogeneous group for station 1 climate id 1060841 in region 1 hg1 6 stations are included with a heterogeneity measure of 0 92 2 small homogeneous group for station 2 climate id 1160899 in region 1 hg2 6 stations are included with a heterogeneity measure of 1 49 3 large homogeneous group for station 3 climate id 7031375 in region 2 hg3 30 stations are included with a heterogeneity measure of 1 2 the geographic display of these homogeneous groups is shown in fig 5 in this step the heterogeneity measure is calculated based on the difference between regional and at site l cvs hosking and wallis 1997 5 the ams scaling the extracted ams at all selected stations are scaled by their index event values 5 2 validation and comparison this section is used for two purposes the verification of the parameter estimates from the proposed methodology and the comparison of goodness of fit between estimates from the proposed methodology and traditional glm based approach at the upper tail of the measurements both procedures were conducted at different temporal steps for following purposes 1 to prove the superiority of the proposed methodology over the traditional glm based method since the traditional glm based method is conducted on a yearly basis the superiority of the proposed methodology can be confirmed when it is proven to provide better estimates on 1 year temporal step 2 to capture the dynamic behavior of distribution parameters and reduce the uncertainty in the final quantile estimates while small temporal steps should be used to meet the first requirement larger uncertainty for the quantile estimates especially at long return periods can be generated to balance these two goals the 5 t rule for gathering data records in the regional context is applied for the selection of temporal steps in the application of the proposed methodology for quantile estimation at different return periods 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year thus the potential temporal steps used in this section are 2 year 5 year 9 year 22 year for the homogeneous groups formed at station 1 and 2 1 year 2 year 3 year 5 year 9 year and 15 year for the homogeneous groups formed at station 3 the parameter estimates from using the proposed methodology are verified through using ad test with the original data records at different temporal steps the percentages of the valid estimates from using the proposed methodology and traditional glm based method at different temporal steps are shown in table 3 the following conclusions can be obtained 1 both the proposed methodology and traditional approach can generate high percentages of valid estimates at different temporal steps the proposed methodology is superior by providing higher percentages at different temporal steps 2 the level of homogeneity can affect the validity of the parameter estimates in both approaches the homogeneous group formed for station 1 has the highest level of homogeneity and the highest percentage of valid estimates at different temporal steps to prove the superiority of the proposed methodology for providing better parameter estimates for the extreme rainfall quantile estimation at the upper tail the adup test is used as the goodness of fit test the percentages of proposed methodology generating better parameter estimates than that from using the traditional glm based approach at different temporal steps are shown in table 4 the following conclusions can be obtained 1 parameter estimates from the proposed methodology are better fits for the rainfall quantiles at upper tail than that from the traditional glm based approach when using 1 year temporal step the estimates from proposed methodology are generally better fits at the upper tail as the percentages for being superior are higher than 50 for all three groups for all groups the level of homogeneity can affect the performance of the proposed methodology since the percentage for parameter estimates being superior is the highest at the most homogeneous group for station 1 while the lowest at the least homogeneous group for station 2 with similar level of homogeneity the performance of the proposed methodology is affected by sample size as the percentages for parameter estimates being superior are higher at the homogeneous group for station 3 than that at station 2 2 the superiority of the proposed methodology is prominent when the temporal step is larger than 3 year since most of the percentages for parameter estimates being superior are higher than 80 5 3 quantile estimation based on the comparison shown in table 4 and following the 5 t rule the temporal steps used for the quantile estimation for the homogeneous groups at three selected stations are shown in table 5 the quantile calculations with the 95 confidence intervals for stations 1 2 and 3 at different return periods are shown in fig 6 based on fig 6 the following conclusions can be reached 1 the basic trends of the extreme rainfall quantiles at different return periods from using the proposed methodology are consistent with that from using the traditional glm based method all three homogeneous groups were formed by gathering stations showing increasing trends thus the overall increasing trends of extreme rainfall quantiles at different return periods are consistent with the trend analysis 2 dynamic behavior of the extreme rainfall quantiles can be observed at different return periods compared to the linear increasing trend depicted in the extreme rainfall quantiles through using the traditional glm based method more dynamic behavior for the extreme rainfall quantiles is observed especially at short return periods for station 1 and 2 and all return periods for station 3 6 conclusions under climate change the extreme rainfall patterns around the world are changing the traditional glm based approach for the regional frequency analysis in a nonstationary environment is conducted under the assumption that the parameters in the regional growth curve are undergoing monotonic changes and can be questionable since non monotonic behavior of the extreme rainfall events having been observed to consider the dynamic behavior of the extreme rainfall in regional frequency analysis a ukf based procedure with spatial correlated resamples is established to accurately capture the highly nonlinear relationships amongst the distribution parameters in the regional growth curve and consider their nonlinear transitions between successive states the unscented kalman filter is used to reduce the uncertainty caused by limited number of rainfall records and consider the impacts form cross correlation amongst the input stations large sets of cross correlated measurement resamples are generated for the quantification of the regional growth curve at each state to reduce the possibility of performance degradation in the ukf application which is caused by using inaccurate noise covariance monte carlo simulation based method is used to explore the patterns of state and measurement noises compared to the traditional approach the proposed methodology is demonstrated to 1 fully utilize the advantage that the rainfall records from multiple stations are available for the parameter estimation in regional frequency analysis 2 consider the uncertainty associated with using limited rainfall records at each temporal period and the impacts from cross correlation amongst the stations within a homogeneous group 3 consider the potential non monotonic trends for the extreme rainfall quantiles at different return periods the proposed methodology has provided reliable parameter estimates for the regional growth curve at stations exhibiting increasing trends and captured the non monotonic change behavior of the extreme rainfall quantiles at different return periods credit authorship contribution statement zhe yang conceptualization methodology

4941,various of data assimilation methods such as the ensemble kalman filter enkf have been established in physical science and engineering for the fusion of observed data with physically motivated models however there are cases where a physically motivated model is not available in particular the unsaturated flow model is often difficult to build due to the intrinsic nonlinearity and heterogeneity of soil flow process in this paper a nonparametric sequential data assimilation scheme kalman gp is introduced based on the filtering equations of enkf and data driven modeling with gaussian process gp the method replaces the physical model with gp constructed directly from available multiple source data and observations of state variables of interest while using the kalman update formulation to reconcile real time observations we tested the proposed kalman gp method in a real world case study of soil moisture profile simulation the performance of kalman gp was compared with two different data assimilation methods i e the traditional enkf with a physical model kalman physics and a hybrid filter which integrated a dynamic gp error model into physics based enkf kalman physics gp zhang et al 2019 results showed that without knowledge of any governing equation the kalman gp filter was able to reconstruct soil moisture dynamics to a level comparable with the parametric enkf even exhibit superior performance the kalman physics gp led to a better soil moisture estimation than kalman gp however at the expense of dependence on the underlying physical model and more requirements of prior knowledge in contrast the proposed kalman gp requires only easy to obtain meteorological data and can be a better alternative to achieve good tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency especially in areas short of hydrogeological data when less prior physical knowledge is available the advantage of the proposed kalman gp over the kalman physics was enhanced while the superiority of the hybrid filter over the kalman gp was weakened keywords nonparametric data assimilation gaussian process soil moisture model error 1 introduction data assimilation da approaches bertino et al 2003 barker et al 2004 lorenc et al 2000 wikle and berliner 2007 shi et al 2015 abbaszadeh et al 2020 xu et al 2020 have been established in physical science and engineering for the fusion of observations with physically motivated models the core of these da methods i e traditional parametric filters is that they rely on an existing known physically motivated model tandeo et al 2015 lguensat et al 2017 gavahi et al 2020 however in many cases a model may be not available or available models may be inaccurate an accurate modeling of unsaturated flow in soils has long been challenging due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of soil physical process richards 1931 soil heterogeneity elkateb et al 2003 non uniform root water uptake and changing boundary conditions van dam and feddes 2000 when calibrating an imperfect physical model with the parametric filter soil hydraulic parameters tend to be over adjusted to compensate for the triggered model structural error xu and valocchi 2016 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 this may result in biased predictions when such calibrated models are used to forecast soil moisture profile responses to new forcing doherty and welter 2010 erdal et al 2012 during the past decades various methods have been developed to tackle this potential model deficiency including multiple models averaging parrish et al 2012 or ensemble branicki and majda 2015 doblas reyes et al 2005 hagedorn et al 2005 prior or background error covariance inflation anderson 2007 anderson and anderson 1999 bauser et al 2018 hamill and whitaker 2005 and bias correction dee 2005 dee and da silva 1998 drécourt et al 2006 abbaszadeh et al 2019 integrated four dimensional variational assimilation method with the particle filter to account for model structural model parameter and forcing uncertainties simultaneously zhang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 proposed a hybrid da scheme by integrating a dynamic error model into the traditional process based da framework based on a physical model in an inductive data driven manner this dynamic model learned the unknown relationships between various explanatory data and soil moisture bias through gaussian process gp regression the learned error model corrected the bias in original prediction from physical models and yielded a more stable parameter estimation even in different and contrasting scenarios e g sudden rainfall events inspired by zhang et al 2019 one more provocative scientific question arises since gp based statistical learning techniques can construct error models based on data alone is it feasible to further bypass the dependence on underlying governing equations and advance soil moisture dynamics completely nonparametrically if so is this purely data driven approach capable of avoiding or alleviating the adverse effects of model structural errors and exhibiting superior performance than parametric methods much of the relevant literature since the early 20th century emphasized the employment of analog forecasting which can be traced to the point of symmetry theory in time and space of weather forecasting developed by weickmann 1924 and championed by krick 1942 and elliott 1943 critical to this approach is having a dataset that encompasses sufficient library of historical scenarios and an appropriate mechanism to decide how best to evaluate a match mcdermott and wikle 2016 in the early 1980s for analog forecasting takens 1981 proposed to construct strange attractor to replace the underlying physical model with a nonparametric data driven model using delay coordinate vectors hamilton et al 2016 2017 khaki et al 2018 in the past two decades machine learning approaches for example gaussian process gp bishop 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 are gaining popularity in reconstructing hydrogeological dynamics in hydrology and other fields marrel et al 2008 used gp to simulate radionuclide transport in groundwater based on simulation results of a numerical groundwater solute transport model zhang et al 2016 integrated gp and mcmc to adaptively construct locally accurate surrogates for bayesian experimental design in groundwater contaminant source identification problems ju et al 2018 proposed an adaptive gp based iterative ensemble smoother gpies to estimate heterogeneous conductivity in saturated and unsaturated flow the gp surrogate models in these studies were trained based on a representative catalog of physical model simulation results with varying parameter values and can thus capture a range of dynamics that the physical model resolves however under real world circumstances the model predictions may deviate from the real system dynamics due to uncertainties in model parameters and structure on the other hand the value of the ever increasing stream of multi source data in system reconstruction is far from being tapped reichstein et al 2019 as a follow up study of zhang et al 2019 the primary contribution of this paper is to propose a nonparametric data driven scheme without resorting to any governing equation or physical properties the underlying physics in soil moisture dynamics is represented with an approximate mapping from easy to measure variables to the output of interest e g soil moisture profile learned via gaussian process regression however implementing the data driven approach in unsaturated flow applications may be twofold first the noises in soil moisture observations under real world circumstances is more complicated than in synthetic cases in previous studies second the highly nonlinear behavior of the vadose zone is known to be difficult to model broadbridge et al 2017 hopmans et al 2002 zha et al 2019a 2019b to overcome these challenges the second contribution of this paper is to integrate the gp based dynamical model into ensemble kalman filter enkf framework hereafter abbreviated as kalman gp in real world unsaturated flow problems compared with the original or extended kalman filter enkf is able to deal with mild nonlinear problems because the ensemble statistics can be accurately evolved in time with nonlinear models and higher order moments are retained burgers et al 1998 nowak 2009 meanwhile the surprising power of kalman update in handling substantial noises in the observed data has also been demonstrated in hamilton et al 2016 hamilton et al 2017 and khaki et al 2018 by combining enkf with machine learning our approach enables the reconstructed dynamical process to be refined sequentially hamilton et al 2016 this exactly caters to the interest in the real time integration of measurements being boosted by the increasing ability of online data acquisition and the growing demand for real time prediction and management wang et al 2018 despite the use of enkf in this study it is worthy to mention that enkf has some inherent disadvantages in soil moisture data assimilation including the gaussian assumption of errors linear updating rule within the enkf and violation of water balance dechant and moradkhani 2012 abbaszadeh et al 2019 particle filters pf and iterative filters can be effective substitutes to enkf in future study abbaszadeh et al 2018 zha et al 2019a 2019b to understand the roles of data and physics in dynamic process reconstruction we compare the proposed kalman gp with the traditional da based on a physical model kalman physics and the hybrid da kalman physics gp zhang et al 2019 using real world datasets from three typical stations with different climate regimes through the comparison study we aim to address the following questions 1 is the physical mechanism indispensable in simulating dynamic processes 2 without any physical constraints how and to what extent can data driven methods capture soil moisture dynamics 3 which da strategy among the three is better targeting different application scenarios and 4 how would the performance of kalman gp vary under different hydrometeorological conditions in the remainder of the manuscript section 2 presents the principles of gaussian process and ensemble kalman filter the proposed kalman gp method as well as the hybrid da in zhang et al 2019 are also described in this section then we summarize the experimental data and model setup of three typical stations in section 3 section 4 presents a set of real world examples to validate the necessity of kalman update in kalman gp a comparison of three driving strategies i e kalman physics kalman physics gp and kalman gp is also discussed in detail in this section finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 models and methods 2 1 one dimensional soil water flow model in parametric da in this paper vertical one dimensional soil water movement is considered as a

rasmussen and williams 2006 a gaussian process can be fully specified with a mean function m x and a covariance function k x x to define these two functions hyper parameters β σ λ are introduced in this study thereinto β is the linear coefficient σ 2 controls the marginal variance of output and λ controls the dependence strength in each of the component directions of x thus a linear mean function and an isotropic squared exponential covariance function can be given as 5 m x β t x 6 k x x σ 2 exp 1 λ 2 x x t x x however poor prior information is usually known on these hyper parameters to make the gp model more effective hyper parameters β σ λ can be inferred in the light of the training data x k 1 d k 1 obs firstly the probability of the data given the hyper parameters can be easily derived under the assumption that the data satisfy gaussian distribution 7 l log p d k 1 obs x k 1 1 2 d k 1 obs μ t σ 1 d k 1 obs μ 1 2 log σ n 2 log 2 π where μ μ x represents the prior mean

likelihood in eq 7 in this study gaussian process inference is implemented using gpml matlab toolbox version 4 2 http gaussianprocess org gpml code matlab doc based on the training data state vector of interest at t k corresponding to new inputs x k y k f is then predicted through interpolating at these training points via statistical conditioning the prior joint distribution of d k 1 obs in eq 4

at the current time t k can be expressed as 12 y k f y k 1 f y k 2 f y k m f y k n f where y k m f denotes the forecasted state vector of interest for gp k m m 1 2 n at t k superscripts f refers to forecast 2 2 2 the kalman update in ensemble kalman filter the ensemble kalman filter first developed by evensen 1994 has been widely applied to water resources problems chen and zhang 2006 liu et al 2008 due to its simple conceptual formulation and easiness of implementation evensen 2003 the enkf moves sequentially from one measurement time to the next and performs a forecast step and an update or analysis step reichle et al 2002 the forecast step is conventionally performed by running a physical model in our kalman gp approach the gp model is used instead for any ensemble member at the given time k the state vector is updated by combining dynamical model predictions and observations 13 y k a y k f k k d k obs h y k f where y k a is the improved estimates for the ensemble member of state vector conditioned on the observed information at t k superscript a refers to analysis step h is the observation operator which relates the state and observation vectors the kalman gain k k is given by 14 k k c k f h t h c k f h t r k 1 where r k e ε k ε k t is the covariance matrix of observation error ε k c k f is the covariance matrix of state vector which can be estimated by 15 c k f 1 n 1 m 1 n y k m f y k f y k m f y k f t where y k f denotes the ensemble mean of y k f 2 2 3 kalman gp the purely data driven da scheme we present a new da scheme that is completely data driven in that the physical model is replaced with gaussian process regression within the enkf framework a narrative description of kalman gp is summarized as follows step 1 the observed time series from t 1 to t is corrupted by the prescribed observation noises satisfying gaussian distribution to generate n sets of training data i e x t d t obs 1 x t d t obs 2 x t d t obs n step 2 at time k 1 k t n gaussian process models are constructed based on the base points from t 0 to k 1 i e x k 1 d k 1 obs m m 1 2 n via eqs 5 and 6 for any gp k m model at t k the number of training data is k by n obs n obs is the number of observations at each time step it should be emphasized that in this paper the gp input x includes monitoring time location daily precipitation and other candidate information such as air temperature step 3 once n dynamical gp models have been determined the state vector y k f under new input x k which consists of n state variables of interest y k m f m 1 2 n is forecasted using eq 11 step 4 the updated state vector y k a is calculated by assimilating the predictions of gp models y k f with the current available observation d k obs using eqs 9 11 step 5 repeat steps 2 4 until all available observations are assimilated 2 2 4 kalman physics gp the comparative hybrid da scheme in most cases a physically motivated model is subject to model structural error due to an inability to perfectly represent the complex reality in order to address the potential imperfections of physical models zhang et al 2019 integrated a dynamic data driven error model based on gaussian process regression into the conventional da framework here we present a brief description of this hybrid da more technical details can be found in zhang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 step 1 in the forecast step the state at t k is forecasted y k f based on the state at t k 1 through the physical model g it is worth noting that y k f is an augmented state vector which includes both the parameters e g soil hydraulic conductivity and the state variable vector soil moisture step 2 in the analysis step the joint state vector y k f at t k is updated to y k a by assimilating the current observation data d k obs via eqs 9 11 hence the physical parameter including α n and ks in this study are updated step 3 the forward model g is rerun with the mean of the updated physical based parameters to obtain new values of the state variables of interest from t 1 to k step 4 a gp error model is constructed based on the training data x d obs g in addition to the entries similar to the gp input in section 2 2 3 the physically based model s output g is also included in x the output of error model d obs g is the difference between the observed data and the corresponding simulation results step 5 the model error at t k can be estimated using the refined gp error model in step 4 and combined with the original state vector y k a to gain the optimal estimates of state variables step 6 repeat steps 1 5 until the end of the simulation period 3 description of experimental data and model setup 3 1 data source and site description in order to test the kalman gp method under different soil types and climatic regimes in situ observations at three different sites fig 1 were downloaded from the international soil moisture network ismn https ismn geo tuwien ac at en the first site falkenberg station

station 37 2907 n 75 9270 w hereafter referred to as cape of uscrn network was located in anheuser busch coastal res ctr univ of va oyster data collection at this site began on 2nd august and ended on 9th november in 2004 the third site dahra station 15 4035 n 15 4320 w was located in the louga region of senegal data collection at dahra was conducted from 18th july to 25th october in 2011 in this study we use the usda soil texture classification and classified the soil according to the dominant fraction of clay silt and sand for two layers topsoil 0 0 0 3 m subsoil 0 3 1 0 m the soil at falkenberg is sandy loam and the dahra soil is loamy sand the topsoil and subsoil at cape are clay loam and loamy clay respectively the fractions of sand silt and clay for each site are summarized in table 1 trime ez imko stevens hydraprobe ii sdi 12 stevens water inc and thetaprobe ml2x delta t devices were used at falkenberg cape and dahra respectively to measure soil moisture the depths of measurements at the three sites were 1 0 08 m 0 15 m 0 30 m 0 45 m 0 60 m and 0 90 m 2 0 05 m 0 10 m 0 20 m 0 50 m and 1 00 m and 3 0 05 m 0 10 m 0 50 m and 1 00 m respectively the temporal changes of soil moisture at various depths at all three sites are shown in fig 2 a c apart from soil water measurements at different depths regular meteorological variables including daily precipitation and air temperature at 2 m height are also provided from the ismn as shown in fig 2 d i the falkenberg has a continental climate with warm summer and frequent but less intense precipitation during the simulation period having a humid subtropical climate the cape receives the highest rates rainfall among the three sites and there were a few rainstorm events during the study period e g up to 150 mm d on september 8 2014 the region of dahra has a tropical climate with well defined dry and humid seasons the simulation period is in its humid season when frequent but less intense rainfall events occurs and the daily average air temperature is about 30 c to run the physical model i e ross model the potential evapotranspiration at three sites are estimated using penman monteith formula and shown in fig 2 d f 3 2 model simulations the key parameters of the numerical cases are listed in table 2 in this study a soil column with the height of 1 m is considered the soil column is discretized into 2 cm grids with a local refinement of 1 cm monitoring depths i e 0 15 m and 0 45 m deep for falkenberg and 0 05 m deep for cape and dahra correspondingly the total number of nodes at the sites is 53 52 and 52 respectively the state vector y includes soil moisture of all nodes at each site while the trained and assimilated observations d obs refer to available soil moisture observations at all observed depths as described in section 3 1 unless otherwise specified the soil moisture measurement error is set to be 0 03 m3 m3 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2018 for the comparison purpose the simulation settings of ross model and gp dynamical error model in the three driving strategies including kalman physics kalman physics gp and kalman gp are summarized as follows kalman physics we constructed physically motivated models within the classical kalman physics framework with an ensemble size of n 50 as stated in eqs 2 and 3 the physical parameters required by van genuchten s hydraulic model include residual θ r and saturated θ s moisture content and hydraulic conductivity α n and ks thereinto the values of θ s are available from ismn as listed in table 1 while other parameters are completely unknown considering the limited available data i e the fractions of sand silt and clay the neural network prediction module of hydrus 1d rosetta lite version 1 1 schaap et al 2001 is used to estimate the prior values of α n and ks table 2 rosetta lite s powerful ability of estimating soil hydraulic properties from the particle size distribution using a bootstrap neural network optimization method has been demonstrated in previous studies hilten et al 2008 jha et al 2017 saâdi et al 2018 the prior standard deviations sd of these parameters are specified empirically table 2 to ensure positive values of soil hydraulic parameters we assume that the α n and ks follow the logarithmic normal distribution the transformed means and sds of ln α ln n and ln ks are not shown here then their n 50 initial realizations are generated from the prior distributions e g ln α n 1 284 0 220 in topsoil at falkenberg as real time soil moisture observations are assimilated these parameter ensembles are updated sequentially moreover θ r is assumed to be invariable and estimated using rosetta lite the top boundary of soil column is set as atmospheric boundary for all sites at the lower boundary a condition of free drainage is assumed at cape and dahra while a condition of constant water content at falkenberg kalman physics gp for the hybrid method kalman physics gp the physical model parameters are identical to those in kalman physics the physical parameters including α n and ks are also updated sequentially similar to zhang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 the driving data of gp error model includes monitoring time day depth daily precipitation simulated actual evapotranspiration and simulated soil moisture from ross model while the output is the soil moisture bias between the observed and simulated soil moisture for example the observations on the 10th day at dahra can provide four training data points at 0 05 m 0 10 m 0 50 m and 1 00 m and hence the gp model on this day contains 10 1 4 36 training points it should be emphasized that all input data were linearly scaled to 0 1 because they are of different magnitudes the hyper parameters of gp models at each time step are inferred according to eqs 7 9 based on the new training data augmented over time hence the hyper parameters can be regarded as being updated at each time step but not in a sequential data assimilation manner kalman gp similar to kalman physics gp the monitoring time day depth and daily precipitation are included in the gp input however simulated actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture are not available in purely gp based dynamical models due to the complete abandonment of physical equations e g penman monteith formula fortunately the hidden worth of indirect data which are not directly involved the underlying physical equations e g soil temperature and regular meteorological data regarding the identification of dynamical model has been demonstrated by wang et al 2020 hence as an alternative to the traditional evapotranspiration calculation air temperature is trained together with other information within the proposed kalman gp framework the output is the soil moisture at the corresponding time and depth similarly at each time step the hyper parameters are re inferred based on the new training data augmented over time 3 3 case design a suite of cases table 3 is designed to serve our research purposes all the cases are performed at all three sites case c1 is set as the base case to verify the feasibility of reconstructing soil moisture dynamics with the proposed model free filter i e kalman gp in c1 once gp models are constructed using historical training data prior to the current time step the real time soil moisture observations d obs are assimilated sequentially a comparison between c1 and c2 is designed to investigate the necessity of kalman update in the proposed kalman gp in c2 the forecasted state vector y f is regarded as the posterior one while there is no assimilation of real time observations the procedures of constructing gp models at the forecast step are identical to that in c1 here this fully model free run in c2 is abbreviated as gp it should be noted that since no physical model is involved in either kalman gp or gp the layer structure of soil is not considered in c1 and c2 to clarify the respective contributions of physical mechanisms and data in reproducing soil moisture dynamics two more test cases i e c3 and c4 are considered using kalman physics and kalman physics gp respectively one advantage of kalman gp is the omission of describing soil layer structures in contrast misrepresentation of soil stratification is often an important cause of imperfections in physical models regarding kalman physics and kalman physics gp hence we deliberately simplify two layer soils given from the ismn to one layer soils in c5 and c6 to investigate the effect of less prior physical knowledge on three driving da strategies 3 4 evaluation setup to evaluate the accuracy of different data assimilation strategies the absolute values of soil moisture bias and the time averaged root mean square error rmse between the observed and estimated soil moisture after each assimilation during the whole simulation period are calculated respectively 16 b i a s k θ k f θ k obs 17 rmse 1 t k 1 t θ k f θ k obs 2 where θ k f represents the mean of n 50 estimated soil moisture samples at time k θ k obs is the corresponding observed value in addition to compare the uncertainty in soil moisture estimation using different data assimilation strategies the standard deviation sd of n 50 estimated soil moisture samples at time k is also calculated 18 sd k m 1 n θ k m f θ k f 2 n 1 m 1 2 n where m is the ensemble number index meanwhile the 95 exceedance ratio er95 moradkhani et al 2006 is also introduced to evaluate the spread of the ensemble 19 e r 95 n exceedance t 100 1 t k

observation θ k obs falls outside θ 2 5 k f θ 97 5 k f during the total number of analysis period t a perfect ensemble has a 5 exceedance of the 95 predictive bounds a value greater than 5 too narrow predictive distribution indicates an overconfident forecast while a value less than 5 too wide predictive distribution indicates an underconfident forecast abbaszadeh et al 2019 4 results and discussions 4 1 the necessity of kalman update in gp based nonparametric da scheme c1 and c2 we firstly examine the performance of the proposed data driven modeling strategy with and without kalman update corresponding to kalman gp in c1 and purely gp in c2 respectively fig 3 shows the time averaged rmses between estimated and observed soil moisture at various depths at falkenberg cape and dahra site respectively yielded by the two methods for all sites and monitoring depths kalman gp led to lower rmse suggesting kalman update effectively improved soil moisture estimation accuracy figs 4 and 5 further present spatiotemporal patterns of b i a s k at the observed depths and sd k at all nodes from the kalman gp and gp respectively it can be observed that the gp models alone were generally able to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture however once confronted with conditions in terms of rainfall intensity in this study different from the training period the values of bias k and sd k became unacceptably large for instance a torrential rain up to 150 mm on the 38th day at cape site which has not been encountered during the training period from the 1st to 37th day induced a bias of up to 0 13 m3 m3 fig 4e and a larger sd larger fig 5e in topsoil for gp gp extrapolation is triggered when the encountered condition is not included in the training period however spatiotemporal extrapolation based solely on statistical learning is often unreliable and unstable li et al 2018 and anomalous soil moisture prediction samples may be generated such anomaly of gp extrapolation often occurred at the early stage of simulation due to insufficient training data for example only 3 1 4 8 available data points were used as training data on the 3rd day at dahra the large sd was induced as depicted in the black rectangles of fig 5 fortunately soil moisture estimates with significantly smaller bias fig 4 a c and uncertainty fig 5 a c can be obtained after kalman update for kalman gp soil moisture observations at several representative depths as well as time series of ensemble and mean of soil moisture achieved by kalman gp and purely gp are compared in fig 6 it is seen that soil moisture estimates obtained by kalman gp were closer to real observations compared to the purely gp method meanwhile the values of er95 with the kalman gp at three sites are also closer to the optimal value 5 indicating a more accurate uncertainty characterization these results demonstrated again the necessity of kalman update in kalman gp the gp interpolation extrapolation in space conditioned with sparse observations may also generate considerable predictive uncertainty at unobserved depths e g z 0 50 1 00 m at cape fig 5e and z 0 90 1 00 m at falkenberg fig 5d however by combining with kalman update the forecast cross covariance c k f h t between the state y k f and the predictions corresponding to available observations h y k f in eq 14 constrained the otherwise high error covariances of state variables at unobserved depths gottwald et al 2011 ott et al 2004 this constrains resulted in a significantly reduced uncertainty for kalman gp relative to gp so the introduction of the kalman update brings benefit for soil water content estimation under sparse observations 4 2 comparison of process based nonparametric and hybrid da schemes as previously described we attempt to reveal the contributions of data and physical mechanism in reconstructing soil moisture dynamics by comparing different data assimilation strategies in pairs thus a detailed comparative analysis of kalman physics and kalman physics gp are also performed in this section 4 2 1 process based kalman physics in c3 vs hybrid da schemes kalman physics gp in c4 figs 7 and 8 a f present the temporal changes of time averaged rmse and absolute value of soil moisture bias between the observed and estimated soil moisture from kalman physics case c3 and kalman physics gp case c4 respectively the significantly smaller soil moisture bias and reduced rmse given by kalman physics gp suggested that the hybrid strategy led to more accurate estimation these results are in line with the findings by zhang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 fig 8 g l shows the temporal evolutions of sd from kalman physics and kalman physics gp at three sites respectively it is seen that the retrieved soil moisture profile from the hybrid method suffered from higher uncertainty this is because the total posterior uncertainty of the hybrid filter has two components the first component is from the imperfect physical model and another one is from the gp error model fig 9 further presents the total ensemble standard deviation on the 100th day as well as the contributions from two components it is shown that gp error models made significant contribution to the total uncertainty of kalman physics gp method however it should be emphasized that such higher uncertainties are not necessarily detrimental for data assimilation methods that involve physical parameter updates on the contrary the state covariance matrix is inflated due to this additional uncertainty from gp correction which facilitates a quicker update of the parameter to the truth this can prevent the hybrid filter from inbreeding hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 yu et al 2019 leading to better results than with kalman physics 4 2 2 nonparametric da schemes kalman gp in c1 vs process based kalman physics in c3 from fig 7 it is seen that kalman gp was able to reproduce soil moisture profile at an accuracy comparable to the parametric filter in terms of rmse even no physical knowledge involved in the nonparametric filter however a comparison of figs 5 a c and 8 g i reveals that the sd from kalman gp are significantly larger than those from kalman physics we recall that unreliable extrapolation is apt to be triggered in gp although the kalman update has been introduced the adverse effects of gp extrapolation cannot be entirely eliminated for example some soil moisture realizations at z 1 00 m estimated by kalman gp were even lower than the residual moisture content θ r 0 054 at dahra not shown here the soil moisture ensemble thus has a larger variation range due to the lack of physical constraint on the contrary soil moisture estimates outside of θ r θ s do not occur with kalman physics however it is also found that the sd from kalman physics is high around soil layers interface highlighted by black rectangle in fig 8 g i while such phenomenon does not exist for kalman gp see fig 5 a c due to the neglect of soil layer hereafter we defined the depth at which the soil moisture is to be estimated as the target depth in all the above cases the target depths are a subset of all available observation depths e g z 0 08 m 0 15 m 0 30 m 0 45 m 0 60 m and 0 90 m at falkenberg if the target depth is not included by the trained and assimilated depths it will be necessary to investigate the interpolation and extrapolation ability of kalman gp three more test cases were considered where surface tc1 middle tc2 and deep tc3 soil moisture were respectively estimated using observations at other depths the case configurations about trained assimilated and target depths in tc1 tc3 are listed in table 4 fig 10 shows the time averaged rmse between the observed and estimated soil moisture in cases tc1 tc3 from kalman physics and kalman gp respectively it is seen that the nonparametric filter was able to achieve equivalent accuracy with the traditional parametric filter when retrieving surface soil moisture tc1 however the estimated deep soil moisture tc3 from kalman gp suffered obvious degradation this is because some key factors such as precipitation that strongly influence surface soil moisture content have been included in the input when training gp model however the deep soil moisture is strongly controlled by the lower boundary condition and the delayed response to atmospheric conditions which are not included in gp training on the contrary the bottom boundary conditions are specified a priori for the parametric filter for instance the prescribed constant water content at the bottom boundary z 1 0 m of falkenberg site and the richards equation effectively constrain the soil moisture estimates at z 0 90 m a perfect physical model often requires the ability to accurately characterize each sub process of soil water dynamics e g rainfall infiltration evaporation and root water uptake in the traditional process based da schemes the acquisition of these information and physically modeling of the corresponding sub processes are often time consuming and challenging the above results indicate that without knowledge of any governing equation our proposed kalman gp was able to reconstruct soil moisture dynamics to a level comparable with the parametric enkf relying only on some readily available measurements e g rainfall and air temperature this significantly reduces the cost of data acquisition and physical modeling in practical applications however it is worth emphasizing that a qualified gp based nonparametric model should also be capable of capturing the main components that dominate each sub process as much as possible as a driving force but this may be challenging based on the comparison of tc1 tc3 it still seems necessary to put some constraints based on physical common sense on the purely data driven method in a non intrusive way in the future study 4 2 3 nonparametric kalman gp in c1 vs hybrid da schemes kalman physics gp in c4 a smaller rmse with the hybrid da reveals its superiority of retrieving soil moisture profile compared to the proposed kalman gp as shown in fig 7 there is no doubt that this advantage of the kalman physics gp stems mainly from its preservation of the physical model however this also implies that more prior information is required in the hybrid da to build a physically motivated model as listed in table 5 for instance meteorological data other than air temperature e g radiation and wind speed are also needed in order to calculate the potential evaporation using the penman monteith equation in other words the superior performance of hybrid da in reshaping soil moisture dynamics comes at the expense of higher data acquisition costs furthermore the preserved physical equations instead produce an additional part of the uncertainty from physical models in kalman physics gp as has been shown in fig 9 in general the requirement of more prior physical knowledge and higher prediction uncertainty make the hybrid da not always the optimal data driven strategy in contrast although only suboptimal performance was obtained the proposed kalman gp can be regarded as a effective alternative for soil moisture data assimilation the computational costs of three different da strategies are also investigated at dahra site the cpu times spent for kalamn physics kalman physics gp and kalman gp are 4 5 min 9 min and 60 min respectively on a 3 60 ghz intel core i7 4790 cpu and 8 gb ram pc platform the proposed klaman gp requires heavier computational burden than the other two methods it is noted that the computational costs of kalamn physics and kalman physics gp depend on the solution of richards equation which may vary considerably for different problems when the richards equation is highly nonlinear the numerical solution may suffer convergence difficulty or even failure unless using unpractical time steps making simulations extremely costly qi et al 2008 however the computation time for kalman gp is not dependent on specific problem since there is no need to solve nonlinear soil water equation hence as one attractive compensation and benefit the high cost of measuring or estimating soil hydraulic parameters can be avoided for kalman gp 4 3 impacts of the amount of prior physical knowledge on three da schemes c5 and c6 as mentioned earlier the main advantage of our proposed kalman gp over the other two approaches is its less demand for prior knowledge for example the information about soil stratification and corresponding soil parameters are not required yet these data are essential for running physical models in kalman physics gp and kalman physics hence an even more provocative question arises when such information is scarce in the study area does the superiority of the kalman gp over the kalman physics method become more prominent will the gap between kalman gp and kalman physics gp which currently has the best estimation accuracy be narrowed to examine this question two more test cases were designed using kalman physics case c5 and kalman physics gp case c6 respectively unlike c3 and c4 in these two new cases we assume that information on soil stratification is unknown and that the two layered soil given by ismn had to be simplified to one homogeneous layered soil other prior information of this one layered soil column is identical to that of the original topsoil fig 11 presents the time averaged rmses between observed and estimated soil moisture with kalman gp kalman physics and kalman physics gp in the two layer and simplified one layer soils respectively only the results at falkenberg are shown here it should be noted that the rmse of the kalman gp is not affected by altered soil stratification due to its abandonment of physical models we can find that the performance of kalman physcis deteriorated with the significantly increased rmse when the two layer soil is simplified to one layer soil this subsequently leads to much higher estimation accuracy with kalman gp than that with kalman physics at most depths e g z 0 15 m 0 30 m and 0 45 m this result reveals more significant advantages using the nonparametric filter when less prior knowledge is available this may provide a technical option for soil water dynamics retrieval in those areas that short of hydrogeological data compared to that in the two layer soil a larger rmse in the one layer soil can also be observed for kalman physics gp from fig 11 this may be because less prior physical knowledge is prone to triggering more complex model structural errors which increases the difficulty of using gp error models to compensate for soil moisture bias hence the advantage of the hybrid filter over the proposed nonparametric filter in estimation accuracy is reduced we have reason to believe that the superiority of the kalman physics gp is likely to be further weakened when available prior information continues to diminish this result indicate again that the hybrid filter may not the best choice due to the potential risk of performance collapse in study areas with extremely lack of physical knowledge 5 summary and conclusions in this study a nonparametric data assimilation scheme kalman gp is introduced to exploit the complementary strengths of the two methodologies in unsaturated flow problems at the forecast step gp based dynamical models are built to reconstruct soil moisture dynamics bypassing the identification of soil hydraulic properties and solution of richards equation the nonlinear relationship between relevant multi source data including time location daily precipitation and air temperature and soil moisture is automatically learned via gp regression however the empirical nature of gp interpolation extrapolation may degrade the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval and overestimate the ensemble variance especially under varying meteorological conditions e g sudden rainfall events kalman update at the analysis step takes advantage of observations and leads to an improved estimation compared to using gp alone to enhance our understanding on the roles of data and physics in the reconstruction of soil moisture dynamics three different data assimilation schemes i e traditional process based kalman physics nonparametric kalman gp and hybrid kalman physics gp filters were compared the following conclusions can be drawn 1 without any knowledge of model equations the proposed nonparametric da is able to reproduce soil moisture dynamics especially topsoil moisture to a level comparable with the parametric enkf even exhibit superior performance however considering the often unavailable lower boundary conditions and delayed responses to atmospheric conditions it is still challenging for nonparametric da to estimate deep soil moisture by only training historical surface or and middle soil water content data 2 the hybrid da leads to a better soil moisture estimation than the kalman gp however at the expense of dependence on the underlying physical model and more requirements of prior knowledge meanwhile the highest uncertainty of soil moisture estimation of kalman physics gp further makes it probably not the best choice to achieve good tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency 3 when the prior physical knowledge of soil water systems is inadequate the advantages of the kalman gp over the kalman physics are evident and the superiority of the kalman physics gp over the kalman gp is likely to be weakened hence the proposed nonparametric filter can yet be regarded as a robust candidate in study areas that short of hydrogeological data credit authorship contribution statement yakun wang methodology software writing original draft

4941,various of data assimilation methods such as the ensemble kalman filter enkf have been established in physical science and engineering for the fusion of observed data with physically motivated models however there are cases where a physically motivated model is not available in particular the unsaturated flow model is often difficult to build due to the intrinsic nonlinearity and heterogeneity of soil flow process in this paper a nonparametric sequential data assimilation scheme kalman gp is introduced based on the filtering equations of enkf and data driven modeling with gaussian process gp the method replaces the physical model with gp constructed directly from available multiple source data and observations of state variables of interest while using the kalman update formulation to reconcile real time observations we tested the proposed kalman gp method in a real world case study of soil moisture profile simulation the performance of kalman gp was compared with two different data assimilation methods i e the traditional enkf with a physical model kalman physics and a hybrid filter which integrated a dynamic gp error model into physics based enkf kalman physics gp zhang et al 2019 results showed that without knowledge of any governing equation the kalman gp filter was able to reconstruct soil moisture dynamics to a level comparable with the parametric enkf even exhibit superior performance the kalman physics gp led to a better soil moisture estimation than kalman gp however at the expense of dependence on the underlying physical model and more requirements of prior knowledge in contrast the proposed kalman gp requires only easy to obtain meteorological data and can be a better alternative to achieve good tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency especially in areas short of hydrogeological data when less prior physical knowledge is available the advantage of the proposed kalman gp over the kalman physics was enhanced while the superiority of the hybrid filter over the kalman gp was weakened keywords nonparametric data assimilation gaussian process soil moisture model error 1 introduction data assimilation da approaches bertino et al 2003 barker et al 2004 lorenc et al 2000 wikle and berliner 2007 shi et al 2015 abbaszadeh et al 2020 xu et al 2020 have been established in physical science and engineering for the fusion of observations with physically motivated models the core of these da methods i e traditional parametric filters is that they rely on an existing known physically motivated model tandeo et al 2015 lguensat et al 2017 gavahi et al 2020 however in many cases a model may be not available or available models may be inaccurate an accurate modeling of unsaturated flow in soils has long been challenging due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of soil physical process richards 1931 soil heterogeneity elkateb et al 2003 non uniform root water uptake and changing boundary conditions van dam and feddes 2000 when calibrating an imperfect physical model with the parametric filter soil hydraulic parameters tend to be over adjusted to compensate for the triggered model structural error xu and valocchi 2016 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 this may result in biased predictions when such calibrated models are used to forecast soil moisture profile responses to new forcing doherty and welter 2010 erdal et al 2012 during the past decades various methods have been developed to tackle this potential model deficiency including multiple models averaging parrish et al 2012 or ensemble branicki and majda 2015 doblas reyes et al 2005 hagedorn et al 2005 prior or background error covariance inflation anderson 2007 anderson and anderson 1999 bauser et al 2018 hamill and whitaker 2005 and bias correction dee 2005 dee and da silva 1998 drécourt et al 2006 abbaszadeh et al 2019 integrated four dimensional variational assimilation method with the particle filter to account for model structural model parameter and forcing uncertainties simultaneously zhang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 proposed a hybrid da scheme by integrating a dynamic error model into the traditional process based da framework based on a physical model in an inductive data driven manner this dynamic model learned the unknown relationships between various explanatory data and soil moisture bias through gaussian process gp regression the learned error model corrected the bias in original prediction from physical models and yielded a more stable parameter estimation even in different and contrasting scenarios e g sudden rainfall events inspired by zhang et al 2019 one more provocative scientific question arises since gp based statistical learning techniques can construct error models based on data alone is it feasible to further bypass the dependence on underlying governing equations and advance soil moisture dynamics completely nonparametrically if so is this purely data driven approach capable of avoiding or alleviating the adverse effects of model structural errors and exhibiting superior performance than parametric methods much of the relevant literature since the early 20th century emphasized the employment of analog forecasting which can be traced to the point of symmetry theory in time and space of weather forecasting developed by weickmann 1924 and championed by krick 1942 and elliott 1943 critical to this approach is having a dataset that encompasses sufficient library of historical scenarios and an appropriate mechanism to decide how best to evaluate a match mcdermott and wikle 2016 in the early 1980s for analog forecasting takens 1981 proposed to construct strange attractor to replace the underlying physical model with a nonparametric data driven model using delay coordinate vectors hamilton et al 2016 2017 khaki et al 2018 in the past two decades machine learning approaches for example gaussian process gp bishop 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 are gaining popularity in reconstructing hydrogeological dynamics in hydrology and other fields marrel et al 2008 used gp to simulate radionuclide transport in groundwater based on simulation results of a numerical groundwater solute transport model zhang et al 2016 integrated gp and mcmc to adaptively construct locally accurate surrogates for bayesian experimental design in groundwater contaminant source identification problems ju et al 2018 proposed an adaptive gp based iterative ensemble smoother gpies to estimate heterogeneous conductivity in saturated and unsaturated flow the gp surrogate models in these studies were trained based on a representative catalog of physical model simulation results with varying parameter values and can thus capture a range of dynamics that the physical model resolves however under real world circumstances the model predictions may deviate from the real system dynamics due to uncertainties in model parameters and structure on the other hand the value of the ever increasing stream of multi source data in system reconstruction is far from being tapped reichstein et al 2019 as a follow up study of zhang et al 2019 the primary contribution of this paper is to propose a nonparametric data driven scheme without resorting to any governing equation or physical properties the underlying physics in soil moisture dynamics is represented with an approximate mapping from easy to measure variables to the output of interest e g soil moisture profile learned via gaussian process regression however implementing the data driven approach in unsaturated flow applications may be twofold first the noises in soil moisture observations under real world circumstances is more complicated than in synthetic cases in previous studies second the highly nonlinear behavior of the vadose zone is known to be difficult to model broadbridge et al 2017 hopmans et al 2002 zha et al 2019a 2019b to overcome these challenges the second contribution of this paper is to integrate the gp based dynamical model into ensemble kalman filter enkf framework hereafter abbreviated as kalman gp in real world unsaturated flow problems compared with the original or extended kalman filter enkf is able to deal with mild nonlinear problems because the ensemble statistics can be accurately evolved in time with nonlinear models and higher order moments are retained burgers et al 1998 nowak 2009 meanwhile the surprising power of kalman update in handling substantial noises in the observed data has also been demonstrated in hamilton et al 2016 hamilton et al 2017 and khaki et al 2018 by combining enkf with machine learning our approach enables the reconstructed dynamical process to be refined sequentially hamilton et al 2016 this exactly caters to the interest in the real time integration of measurements being boosted by the increasing ability of online data acquisition and the growing demand for real time prediction and management wang et al 2018 despite the use of enkf in this study it is worthy to mention that enkf has some inherent disadvantages in soil moisture data assimilation including the gaussian assumption of errors linear updating rule within the enkf and violation of water balance dechant and moradkhani 2012 abbaszadeh et al 2019 particle filters pf and iterative filters can be effective substitutes to enkf in future study abbaszadeh et al 2018 zha et al 2019a 2019b to understand the roles of data and physics in dynamic process reconstruction we compare the proposed kalman gp with the traditional da based on a physical model kalman physics and the hybrid da kalman physics gp zhang et al 2019 using real world datasets from three typical stations with different climate regimes through the comparison study we aim to address the following questions 1 is the physical mechanism indispensable in simulating dynamic processes 2 without any physical constraints how and to what extent can data driven methods capture soil moisture dynamics 3 which da strategy among the three is better targeting different application scenarios and 4 how would the performance of kalman gp vary under different hydrometeorological conditions in the remainder of the manuscript section 2 presents the principles of gaussian process and ensemble kalman filter the proposed kalman gp method as well as the hybrid da in zhang et al 2019 are also described in this section then we summarize the experimental data and model setup of three typical stations in section 3 section 4 presents a set of real world examples to validate the necessity of kalman update in kalman gp a comparison of three driving strategies i e kalman physics kalman physics gp and kalman gp is also discussed in detail in this section finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 models and methods 2 1 one dimensional soil water flow model in parametric da in this paper vertical one dimensional soil water movement is considered as a comparison the traditional parametric enkf i e kalman physics and the hybrid filter i e kalman physics gp are also conducted where unsaturated flow is described by richards equation richards 1931 1 θ

θ r in this paper we employ the ross method ross 2003 2006 which is a non iterative numerical scheme to obtain a fast solution of one dimensional richards equation in the kalman physics and kalman physics gp the advantages of ross method can be found in zha et al 2013 2 2 methods 2 2 1 the construction of data driven dynamics with gaussian process within the kalman gp framework gp models are constructed at each time step in a sequential way as new data are recorded here we describe the process of one training model at step k gp k m where k 1 2 t and t is the total duration of the simulation time period m 1 2 n and n is the ensemble size the subscript m will be omitted below at the time t k the input and output of training data in gp k can be represented as 4 input x k 1 x 1 x 2 x k 1 o u t p u t d k 1 obs d 1 obs d 2 obs d k 1 obs where d k 1 obs and x k 1 denote observations and corresponding input at t k 1 respectively d k 1 obs and x k 1 denote a collection of d obs and x from t 1 to t k 1 respectively it should be noted that input x may consist of any relevant information in addition to the time and location of quantity of interest xu and valocchi 2016 as stated in rasmussen and williams 2006 a gaussian process can be fully specified with a mean function m x and a covariance function k x x to define these two functions hyper parameters β σ λ are introduced in this study thereinto β is the linear coefficient σ 2 controls the marginal variance of output and λ controls the dependence strength in each of the component directions of x thus a linear mean function and an isotropic squared exponential covariance function can be given as 5 m x β t x 6 k x x σ 2 exp 1 λ 2 x x t x x however poor prior information is usually known on these hyper parameters to make the gp model more effective hyper parameters β σ λ can be inferred in the light of the training data x k 1 d k 1 obs firstly the probability of the data given the hyper parameters can be easily derived under the assumption that the data satisfy gaussian distribution 7 l log p d k 1 obs x k 1 1 2 d k 1 obs μ t σ 1 d k 1 obs μ 1 2 log σ n 2 log 2 π where μ μ x represents the prior mean of d k 1 obs the covariance matrix σ is calculated using the specified covariance function in eq 6 and its ijth entry is σ ij k x i x j we can now find the values of the hyper parameters based on its partial derivatives which are easily evaluated rasmussen and williams 2006 8 l m d k 1 obs μ t σ 1 m m 9 l k 1 2 t r a c e σ 1 σ k 1 2 d k 1 obs μ t σ k σ 1 σ k d k 1 obs μ where m and k are used to indicate hyper parameters of the mean and covariance functions i e β and σ λ respectively then eqs 8 and 9 can conveniently be used to identify hyper parameters by maximizing this log marginal likelihood in eq 7 in this study gaussian process inference is implemented using gpml matlab toolbox version 4 2 http gaussianprocess org gpml code matlab doc based on the training data state vector of interest at t k corresponding to new inputs x k y k f is then predicted through interpolating at these training points via statistical conditioning the prior joint distribution of d k 1 obs in eq 4 and y k f is given as follows 10 d k 1 obs y k f n μ μ σ σ σ t σ where σ denotes the covariance matrix of d k 1 obs whose element on the ith row and jth column is σ ij k x i x j similarly σ σ t is the covariance matrix between d k 1 obs and y k f with σ ij k x i x j and σ is the prior covariance of y k f with σ ij k x i x j μ is the prior mean of y k f finally the predicted state vector at t k y k f can be obtained according to bayesian inference box and tiao 2011 11 y k f μ σ t σ 1 d k 1 obs μ as a collection of y k f from n gp based dynamical models the resultant forecasted state vector y k f at the current time t k can be expressed as 12 y k f y k 1 f y k 2 f y k m f y k n f where y k m f denotes the forecasted state vector of interest for gp k m m 1 2 n at t k superscripts f refers to forecast 2 2 2 the kalman update in ensemble kalman filter the ensemble kalman filter first developed by evensen 1994 has been widely applied to water resources problems chen and zhang 2006 liu et al 2008 due to its simple conceptual formulation and easiness of implementation evensen 2003 the enkf moves sequentially from one measurement time to the next and performs a forecast step and an update or analysis step reichle et al 2002 the forecast step is conventionally performed by running a physical model in our kalman gp approach the gp model is used instead for any ensemble member at the given time k the state vector is updated by combining dynamical model predictions and observations 13 y k a y k f k k d k obs h y k f where y k a is the improved estimates for the ensemble member of state vector conditioned on the observed information at t k superscript a refers to analysis step h is the observation operator which relates the state and observation vectors the kalman gain k k is given by 14 k k c k f h t h c k f h t r k 1 where r k e ε k ε k t is the covariance matrix of observation error ε k c k f is the covariance matrix of state vector which can be estimated by 15 c k f 1 n 1 m 1 n y k m f y k f y k m f y k f t where y k f denotes the ensemble mean of y k f 2 2 3 kalman gp the purely data driven da scheme we present a new da scheme that is completely data driven in that the physical model is replaced with gaussian process regression within the enkf framework a narrative description of kalman gp is summarized as follows step 1 the observed time series from t 1 to t is corrupted by the prescribed observation noises satisfying gaussian distribution to generate n sets of training data i e x t d t obs 1 x t d t obs 2 x t d t obs n step 2 at time k 1 k t n gaussian process models are constructed based on the base points from t 0 to k 1 i e x k 1 d k 1 obs m m 1 2 n via eqs 5 and 6 for any gp k m model at t k the number of training data is k by n obs n obs is the number of observations at each time step it should be emphasized that in this paper the gp input x includes monitoring time location daily precipitation and other candidate information such as air temperature step 3 once n dynamical gp models have been determined the state vector y k f under new input x k which consists of n state variables of interest y k m f m 1 2 n is forecasted using eq 11 step 4 the updated state vector y k a is calculated by assimilating the predictions of gp models y k f with the current available observation d k obs using eqs 9 11 step 5 repeat steps 2 4 until all available observations are assimilated 2 2 4 kalman physics gp the comparative hybrid da scheme in most cases a physically motivated model is subject to model structural error due to an inability to perfectly represent the complex reality in order to address the potential imperfections of physical models zhang et al 2019 integrated a dynamic data driven error model based on gaussian process regression into the conventional da framework here we present a brief description of this hybrid da more technical details can be found in zhang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 step 1 in the forecast step the state at t k is forecasted y k f based on the state at t k 1 through the physical model g it is worth noting that y k f is an augmented state vector which includes both the parameters e g soil hydraulic conductivity and the state variable vector soil moisture step 2 in the analysis step the joint state vector y k f at t k is updated to y k a by assimilating the current observation data d k obs via eqs 9 11 hence the physical parameter including α n and ks in this study are updated step 3 the forward model g is rerun with the mean of the updated physical based parameters to obtain new values of the state variables of interest from t 1 to k step 4 a gp error model is constructed based on the training data x d obs g in addition to the entries similar to the gp input in section 2 2 3 the physically based model s output g is also included in x the output of error model d obs g is the difference between the observed data and the corresponding simulation results step 5 the model error at t k can be estimated using the refined gp error model in step 4 and combined with the original state vector y k a to gain the optimal estimates of state variables step 6 repeat steps 1 5 until the end of the simulation period 3 description of experimental data and model setup 3 1 data source and site description in order to test the kalman gp method under different soil types and climatic regimes in situ observations at three different sites fig 1 were downloaded from the international soil moisture network ismn https ismn geo tuwien ac at en the first site falkenberg station 52 1669 n 14 1241 e of mol rao network was located in brandenburg germany data collection at this site was carried out between 25th april and 2nd august in 2005 the second site cape charles 5 ene station 37 2907 n 75 9270 w hereafter referred to as cape of uscrn network was located in anheuser busch coastal res ctr univ of va oyster data collection at this site began on 2nd august and ended on 9th november in 2004 the third site dahra station 15 4035 n 15 4320 w was located in the louga region of senegal data collection at dahra was conducted from 18th july to 25th october in 2011 in this study we use the usda soil texture classification and classified the soil according to the dominant fraction of clay silt and sand for two layers topsoil 0 0 0 3 m subsoil 0 3 1 0 m the soil at falkenberg is sandy loam and the dahra soil is loamy sand the topsoil and subsoil at cape are clay loam and loamy clay respectively the fractions of sand silt and clay for each site are summarized in table 1 trime ez imko stevens hydraprobe ii sdi 12 stevens water inc and thetaprobe ml2x delta t devices were used at falkenberg cape and dahra respectively to measure soil moisture the depths of measurements at the three sites were 1 0 08 m 0 15 m 0 30 m 0 45 m 0 60 m and 0 90 m 2 0 05 m 0 10 m 0 20 m 0 50 m and 1 00 m and 3 0 05 m 0 10 m 0 50 m and 1 00 m respectively the temporal changes of soil moisture at various depths at all three sites are shown in fig 2 a c apart from soil water measurements at different depths regular meteorological variables including daily precipitation and air temperature at 2 m height are also provided from the ismn as shown in fig 2 d i the falkenberg has a continental climate with warm summer and frequent but less intense precipitation during the simulation period having a humid subtropical climate the cape receives the highest rates rainfall among the three sites and there were a few rainstorm events during the study period e g up to 150 mm d on september 8 2014 the region of dahra has a tropical climate with well defined dry and humid seasons the simulation period is in its humid season when frequent but less intense rainfall events occurs and the daily average air temperature is about 30 c to run the physical model i e ross model the potential evapotranspiration at three sites are estimated using penman monteith formula and shown in fig 2 d f 3 2 model simulations the key parameters of the numerical cases are listed in table 2 in this study a soil column with the height of 1 m is considered the soil column is discretized into 2 cm grids with a local refinement of 1 cm monitoring depths i e 0 15 m and 0 45 m deep for falkenberg and 0 05 m deep for cape and dahra correspondingly the total number of nodes at the sites is 53 52 and 52 respectively the state vector y includes soil moisture of all nodes at each site while the trained and assimilated observations d obs refer to available soil moisture observations at all observed depths as described in section 3 1 unless otherwise specified the soil moisture measurement error is set to be 0 03 m3 m3 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2018 for the comparison purpose the simulation settings of ross model and gp dynamical error model in the three driving strategies including kalman physics kalman physics gp and kalman gp are summarized as follows kalman physics we constructed physically motivated models within the classical kalman physics framework with an ensemble size of n 50 as stated in eqs 2 and 3 the physical parameters required by van genuchten s hydraulic model include residual θ r and saturated θ s moisture content and hydraulic conductivity α n and ks thereinto the values of θ s are available from ismn as listed in table 1 while other parameters are completely unknown considering the limited available data i e the fractions of sand silt and clay the neural network prediction module of hydrus 1d rosetta lite version 1 1 schaap et al 2001 is used to estimate the prior values of α n and ks table 2 rosetta lite s powerful ability of estimating soil hydraulic properties from the particle size distribution using a bootstrap neural network optimization method has been demonstrated in previous studies hilten et al 2008 jha et al 2017 saâdi et al 2018 the prior standard deviations sd of these parameters are specified empirically table 2 to ensure positive values of soil hydraulic parameters we assume that the α n and ks follow the logarithmic normal distribution the transformed means and sds of ln α ln n and ln ks are not shown here then their n 50 initial realizations are generated from the prior distributions e g ln α n 1 284 0 220 in topsoil at falkenberg as real time soil moisture observations are assimilated these parameter ensembles are updated sequentially moreover θ r is assumed to be invariable and estimated using rosetta lite the top boundary of soil column is set as atmospheric boundary for all sites at the lower boundary a condition of free drainage is assumed at cape and dahra while a condition of constant water content at falkenberg kalman physics gp for the hybrid method kalman physics gp the physical model parameters are identical to those in kalman physics the physical parameters including α n and ks are also updated sequentially similar to zhang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 the driving data of gp error model includes monitoring time day depth daily precipitation simulated actual evapotranspiration and simulated soil moisture from ross model while the output is the soil moisture bias between the observed and simulated soil moisture for example the observations on the 10th day at dahra can provide four training data points at 0 05 m 0 10 m 0 50 m and 1 00 m and hence the gp model on this day contains 10 1 4 36 training points it should be emphasized that all input data were linearly scaled to 0 1 because they are of different magnitudes the hyper parameters of gp models at each time step are inferred according to eqs 7 9 based on the new training data augmented over time hence the hyper parameters can be regarded as being updated at each time step but not in a sequential data assimilation manner kalman gp similar to kalman physics gp the monitoring time day depth and daily precipitation are included in the gp input however simulated actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture are not available in purely gp based dynamical models due to the complete abandonment of physical equations e g penman monteith formula fortunately the hidden worth of indirect data which are not directly involved the underlying physical equations e g soil temperature and regular meteorological data regarding the identification of dynamical model has been demonstrated by wang et al 2020 hence as an alternative to the traditional evapotranspiration calculation air temperature is trained together with other information within the proposed kalman gp framework the output is the soil moisture at the corresponding time and depth similarly at each time step the hyper parameters are re inferred based on the new training data augmented over time 3 3 case design a suite of cases table 3 is designed to serve our research purposes all the cases are performed at all three sites case c1 is set as the base case to verify the feasibility of reconstructing soil moisture dynamics with the proposed model free filter i e kalman gp in c1 once gp models are constructed using historical training data prior to the current time step the real time soil moisture observations d obs are assimilated sequentially a comparison between c1 and c2 is designed to investigate the necessity of kalman update in the proposed kalman gp in c2 the forecasted state vector y f is regarded as the posterior one while there is no assimilation of real time observations the procedures of constructing gp models at the forecast step are identical to that in c1 here this fully model free run in c2 is abbreviated as gp it should be noted that since no physical model is involved in either kalman gp or gp the layer structure of soil is not considered in c1 and c2 to clarify the respective contributions of physical mechanisms and data in reproducing soil moisture dynamics two more test cases i e c3 and c4 are considered using kalman physics and kalman physics gp respectively one advantage of kalman gp is the omission of describing soil layer structures in contrast misrepresentation of soil stratification is often an important cause of imperfections in physical models regarding kalman physics and kalman physics gp hence we deliberately simplify two layer soils given from the ismn to one layer soils in c5 and c6 to investigate the effect of less prior physical knowledge on three driving da strategies 3 4 evaluation setup to evaluate the accuracy of different data assimilation strategies the absolute values of soil moisture bias and the time averaged root mean square error rmse between the observed and estimated soil moisture after each assimilation during the whole simulation period are calculated respectively 16 b i a s k θ k f θ k obs 17 rmse 1 t k 1 t θ k f θ k obs 2 where θ k f represents the mean of n 50 estimated soil moisture samples at time k θ k obs is the corresponding observed value in addition to compare the uncertainty in soil moisture estimation using different data assimilation strategies the standard deviation sd of n 50 estimated soil moisture samples at time k is also calculated 18 sd k m 1 n θ k m f θ k f 2 n 1 m 1 2 n where m is the ensemble number index meanwhile the 95 exceedance ratio er95 moradkhani et al 2006 is also introduced to evaluate the spread of the ensemble 19 e r 95 n exceedance t 100 1 t k

observation θ k obs falls outside θ 2 5 k f θ 97 5 k f during the total number of analysis period t a perfect ensemble has a 5 exceedance of the 95 predictive bounds a value greater than 5 too narrow predictive distribution indicates an overconfident forecast while a value less than 5 too wide predictive distribution indicates an underconfident forecast abbaszadeh et al 2019 4 results and discussions 4 1 the necessity of kalman update in gp based nonparametric da scheme c1 and c2 we firstly examine the performance of the proposed data driven modeling strategy with and without kalman update corresponding to kalman gp in c1 and purely gp in c2 respectively fig 3 shows the time averaged rmses between estimated and observed soil moisture at various depths at falkenberg cape and dahra site respectively yielded by the two methods for all sites and monitoring depths kalman gp led to lower rmse suggesting kalman update effectively improved soil moisture estimation accuracy figs 4 and 5 further present spatiotemporal patterns of b i a s k at the observed depths and sd k at all nodes from the kalman gp and gp respectively it can be observed that the gp models alone were generally able to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture however once confronted with conditions in terms of rainfall intensity in this study different from the training period the values of bias k and sd k became unacceptably large for instance a torrential rain up to 150 mm on the 38th day at cape site which has not been encountered during the training period from the 1st to 37th day induced a bias of up to 0 13 m3 m3 fig 4e and a larger sd larger fig 5e in topsoil for gp gp extrapolation is triggered when the encountered condition is not included in the training period however spatiotemporal extrapolation based solely on statistical learning is often unreliable and unstable li et al 2018 and anomalous soil moisture prediction samples may be generated such anomaly of gp extrapolation often occurred at the early stage of simulation due to insufficient training data for example only 3 1 4 8 available data points were used as training data on the 3rd day at dahra the large sd was induced as depicted in the black rectangles of fig 5 fortunately soil moisture estimates with significantly smaller bias fig 4 a c and uncertainty fig 5 a c can be obtained after kalman update for kalman gp soil moisture observations at several representative depths as well as time series of ensemble and mean of soil moisture achieved by kalman gp and purely gp are compared in fig 6 it is seen that soil moisture estimates obtained by kalman gp were closer to real observations compared to the purely gp method meanwhile the values of er95 with the kalman gp at three sites are also closer to the optimal value 5 indicating a more accurate uncertainty characterization these results demonstrated again the necessity of kalman update in kalman gp the gp interpolation extrapolation in space conditioned with sparse observations may also generate considerable predictive uncertainty at unobserved depths e g z 0 50 1 00 m at cape fig 5e and z 0 90 1 00 m at falkenberg fig 5d however by combining with kalman update the forecast cross covariance c k f h t between the state y k f and the predictions corresponding to available observations h y k f in eq 14 constrained the otherwise high error covariances of state variables at unobserved depths gottwald et al 2011 ott et al 2004 this constrains resulted in a significantly reduced uncertainty for kalman gp relative to gp so the introduction of the kalman update brings benefit for soil water content estimation under sparse observations 4 2 comparison of process based nonparametric and hybrid da schemes as previously described we attempt to reveal the contributions of data and physical mechanism in reconstructing soil moisture dynamics by comparing different data assimilation strategies in pairs thus a detailed comparative analysis of kalman physics and kalman physics gp are also performed in this section 4 2 1 process based kalman physics in c3 vs hybrid da schemes kalman physics gp in c4 figs 7 and 8 a f present the temporal changes of time averaged rmse and absolute value of soil moisture bias between the observed and estimated soil moisture from kalman physics case c3 and kalman physics gp case c4 respectively the significantly smaller soil moisture bias and reduced rmse given by kalman physics gp suggested that the hybrid strategy led to more accurate estimation these results are in line with the findings by zhang et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 fig 8 g l shows the temporal evolutions of sd from kalman physics and kalman physics gp at three sites respectively it is seen that the retrieved soil moisture profile from the hybrid method suffered from higher uncertainty this is because the total posterior uncertainty of the hybrid filter has two components the first component is from the imperfect physical model and another one is from the gp error model fig 9 further presents the total ensemble standard deviation on the 100th day as well as the contributions from two components it is shown that gp error models made significant contribution to the total uncertainty of kalman physics gp method however it should be emphasized that such higher uncertainties are not necessarily detrimental for data assimilation methods that involve physical parameter updates on the contrary the state covariance matrix is inflated due to this additional uncertainty from gp correction which facilitates a quicker update of the parameter to the truth this can prevent the hybrid filter from inbreeding hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 yu et al 2019 leading to better results than with kalman physics 4 2 2 nonparametric da schemes kalman gp in c1 vs process based kalman physics in c3 from fig 7 it is seen that kalman gp was able to reproduce soil moisture profile at an accuracy comparable to the parametric filter in terms of rmse even no physical knowledge involved in the nonparametric filter however a comparison of figs 5 a c and 8 g i reveals that the sd from kalman gp are significantly larger than those from kalman physics we recall that unreliable extrapolation is apt to be triggered in gp although the kalman update has been introduced the adverse effects of gp extrapolation cannot be entirely eliminated for example some soil moisture realizations at z 1 00 m estimated by kalman gp were even lower than the residual moisture content θ r 0 054 at dahra not shown here the soil moisture ensemble thus has a larger variation range due to the lack of physical constraint on the contrary soil moisture estimates outside of θ r θ s do not occur with kalman physics however it is also found that the sd from kalman physics is high around soil layers interface highlighted by black rectangle in fig 8 g i while such phenomenon does not exist for kalman gp see fig 5 a c due to the neglect of soil layer hereafter we defined the depth at which the soil moisture is to be estimated as the target depth in all the above cases the target depths are a subset of all available observation depths e g z 0 08 m 0 15 m 0 30 m 0 45 m 0 60 m and 0 90 m at falkenberg if the target depth is not included by the trained and assimilated depths it will be necessary to investigate the interpolation and extrapolation ability of kalman gp three more test cases were considered where surface tc1 middle tc2 and deep tc3 soil moisture were respectively estimated using observations at other depths the case configurations about trained assimilated and target depths in tc1 tc3 are listed in table 4 fig 10 shows the time averaged rmse between the observed and estimated soil moisture in cases tc1 tc3 from kalman physics and kalman gp respectively it is seen that the nonparametric filter was able to achieve equivalent accuracy with the traditional parametric filter when retrieving surface soil moisture tc1 however the estimated deep soil moisture tc3 from kalman gp suffered obvious degradation this is because some key factors such as precipitation that strongly influence surface soil moisture content have been included in the input when training gp model however the deep soil moisture is strongly controlled by the lower boundary condition and the delayed response to atmospheric conditions which are not included in gp training on the contrary the bottom boundary conditions are specified a priori for the parametric filter for instance the prescribed constant water content at the bottom boundary z 1 0 m of falkenberg site and the richards equation effectively constrain the soil moisture estimates at z 0 90 m a perfect physical model often requires the ability to accurately characterize each sub process of soil water dynamics e g rainfall infiltration evaporation and root water uptake in the traditional process based da schemes the acquisition of these information and physically modeling of the corresponding sub processes are often time consuming and challenging the above results indicate that without knowledge of any governing equation our proposed kalman gp was able to reconstruct soil moisture dynamics to a level comparable with the parametric enkf relying only on some readily available measurements e g rainfall and air temperature this significantly reduces the cost of data acquisition and physical modeling in practical applications however it is worth emphasizing that a qualified gp based nonparametric model should also be capable of capturing the main components that dominate each sub process as much as possible as a driving force but this may be challenging based on the comparison of tc1 tc3 it still seems necessary to put some constraints based on physical common sense on the purely data driven method in a non intrusive way in the future study 4 2 3 nonparametric kalman gp in c1 vs hybrid da schemes kalman physics gp in c4 a smaller rmse with the hybrid da reveals its superiority of retrieving soil moisture profile compared to the proposed kalman gp as shown in fig 7 there is no doubt that this advantage of the kalman physics gp stems mainly from its preservation of the physical model however this also implies that more prior information is required in the hybrid da to build a physically motivated model as listed in table 5 for instance meteorological data other than air temperature e g radiation and wind speed are also needed in order to calculate the potential evaporation using the penman monteith equation in other words the superior performance of hybrid da in reshaping soil moisture dynamics comes at the expense of higher data acquisition costs furthermore the preserved physical equations instead produce an additional part of the uncertainty from physical models in kalman physics gp as has been shown in fig 9 in general the requirement of more prior physical knowledge and higher prediction uncertainty make the hybrid da not always the optimal data driven strategy in contrast although only suboptimal performance was obtained the proposed kalman gp can be regarded as a effective alternative for soil moisture data assimilation the computational costs of three different da strategies are also investigated at dahra site the cpu times spent for kalamn physics kalman physics gp and kalman gp are 4 5 min 9 min and 60 min respectively on a 3 60 ghz intel core i7 4790 cpu and 8 gb ram pc platform the proposed klaman gp requires heavier computational burden than the other two methods it is noted that the computational costs of kalamn physics and kalman physics gp depend on the solution of richards equation which may vary considerably for different problems when the richards equation is highly nonlinear the numerical solution may suffer convergence difficulty or even failure unless using unpractical time steps making simulations extremely costly qi et al 2008 however the computation time for kalman gp is not dependent on specific problem since there is no need to solve nonlinear soil water equation hence as one attractive compensation and benefit the high cost of measuring or estimating soil hydraulic parameters can be avoided for kalman gp 4 3 impacts of the amount of prior physical knowledge on three da schemes c5 and c6 as mentioned earlier the main advantage of our proposed kalman gp over the other two approaches is its less demand for prior knowledge for example the information about soil stratification and corresponding soil parameters are not required yet these data are essential for running physical models in kalman physics gp and kalman physics hence an even more provocative question arises when such information is scarce in the study area does the superiority of the kalman gp over the kalman physics method become more prominent will the gap between kalman gp and kalman physics gp which currently has the best estimation accuracy be narrowed to examine this question two more test cases were designed using kalman physics case c5 and kalman physics gp case c6 respectively unlike c3 and c4 in these two new cases we assume that information on soil stratification is unknown and that the two layered soil given by ismn had to be simplified to one homogeneous layered soil other prior information of this one layered soil column is identical to that of the original topsoil fig 11 presents the time averaged rmses between observed and estimated soil moisture with kalman gp kalman physics and kalman physics gp in the two layer and simplified one layer soils respectively only the results at falkenberg are shown here it should be noted that the rmse of the kalman gp is not affected by altered soil stratification due to its abandonment of physical models we can find that the performance of kalman physcis deteriorated with the significantly increased rmse when the two layer soil is simplified to one layer soil this subsequently leads to much higher estimation accuracy with kalman gp than that with kalman physics at most depths e g z 0 15 m 0 30 m and 0 45 m this result reveals more significant advantages using the nonparametric filter when less prior knowledge is available this may provide a technical option for soil water dynamics retrieval in those areas that short of hydrogeological data compared to that in the two layer soil a larger rmse in the one layer soil can also be observed for kalman physics gp from fig 11 this may be because less prior physical knowledge is prone to triggering more complex model structural errors which increases the difficulty of using gp error models to compensate for soil moisture bias hence the advantage of the hybrid filter over the proposed nonparametric filter in estimation accuracy is reduced we have reason to believe that the superiority of the kalman physics gp is likely to be further weakened when available prior information continues to diminish this result indicate again that the hybrid filter may not the best choice due to the potential risk of performance collapse in study areas with extremely lack of physical knowledge 5 summary and conclusions in this study a nonparametric data assimilation scheme kalman gp is introduced to exploit the complementary strengths of the two methodologies in unsaturated flow problems at the forecast step gp based dynamical models are built to reconstruct soil moisture dynamics bypassing the identification of soil hydraulic properties and solution of richards equation the nonlinear relationship between relevant multi source data including time location daily precipitation and air temperature and soil moisture is automatically learned via gp regression however the empirical nature of gp interpolation extrapolation may degrade the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval and overestimate the ensemble variance especially under varying meteorological conditions e g sudden rainfall events kalman update at the analysis step takes advantage of observations and leads to an improved estimation compared to using gp alone to enhance our understanding on the roles of data and physics in the reconstruction of soil moisture dynamics three different data assimilation schemes i e traditional process based kalman physics nonparametric kalman gp and hybrid kalman physics gp filters were compared the following conclusions can be drawn 1 without any knowledge of model equations the proposed nonparametric da is able to reproduce soil moisture dynamics especially topsoil moisture to a level comparable with the parametric enkf even exhibit superior performance however considering the often unavailable lower boundary conditions and delayed responses to atmospheric conditions it is still challenging for nonparametric da to estimate deep soil moisture by only training historical surface or and middle soil water content data 2 the hybrid da leads to a better soil moisture estimation than the kalman gp however at the expense of dependence on the underlying physical model and more requirements of prior knowledge meanwhile the highest uncertainty of soil moisture estimation of kalman physics gp further makes it probably not the best choice to achieve good tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency 3 when the prior physical knowledge of soil water systems is inadequate the advantages of the kalman gp over the kalman physics are evident and the superiority of the kalman physics gp over the kalman gp is likely to be weakened hence the proposed nonparametric filter can yet be regarded as a robust candidate in study areas that short of hydrogeological data credit authorship contribution statement yakun wang methodology software writing original draft

4942,over the last two decades various studies on transient hydraulic tomography tht have shown that it is an effective approach to characterize subsurface heterogeneity typically high resolution hydraulic conductivity k distributions were recovered while the spatial variability of specific storage ss was found to be smooth in some studies ss heterogeneity has been intentionally ignored due to the belief that ss is less variable than k therefore one may question the importance of considering ss heterogeneity during tht and its impact on the reliability of estimated hydraulic parameters to investigate these issues three modeling approaches i e effective parameters geological and geostatistics based were used to obtain k and ss estimates of varying spatial resolutions the reliability of k and ss estimates were evaluated by comparing their drawdown prediction performances the values of using different prior k and ss information for tht analyses were investigated our results revealed that 1 the k distribution estimated from the geostatistics based steady state ht analysis accurately predicted the late time drawdowns while further improvements in transient drawdowns were obtained only after jointly treating the ss field as heterogeneous 2 ss heterogeneity should be considered in addition to k for tht inversions even when the estimated ss field is smooth and 3 using k and ss estimates from the calibrated geological model as initial mean distributions for the geostatistical inversion approach were helpful in capturing both interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of k and ss these findings suggested that ss heterogeneity should be properly considered during the implementation of tht keywords aquifer heterogeneity specific storage hydraulic tomography model calibration and validation 1 introduction the accurate knowledge of hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss is critical in groundwater flow modeling contaminant transport and water resource management issues traditional analytical solutions e g theis 1935 or cooper and jacob 1946 treat the aquifer to be homogeneous and yield equivalent estimates for hydraulic properties over the support volume of a test whereas in reality hydraulic parameters are inherently heterogeneous at multiple scales in order to deal with subsurface heterogeneity different laboratory and field characterization approaches as well as modeling techniques have been developed koltermann and gorelick 1996 de marsily et al 2005 hendricks franssen et al 2009 linde et al 2015 for example a large number of core samples have been subjected to laboratory permeameter tests sudicky 1986 sudicky et al 2010 alexander et al 2011 smith et al 2016 slug tests have been conducted at multiple locations yeh et al 1995 aristodemo et al 2018 flowmeter tests have been performed along multiple wells molz et al 1989 rehfeldt et al 1992 klepikova et al 2013 tamayo mas et al 2018 and direct push measurements dietrich et al 2008 liu et al 2009 bianchi and zheng 2016 have been utilized to delineate the heterogeneous distribution of k in sedimentary deposits in contrast the distribution of ss which has been typically estimated from methods such as single hole tests or consolidation experiments e g neuman and witherspoon 1972 keller et al 1989 shaver 1998 quinn et al 2016 is less frequently considered in many field investigations as its heterogeneity has been assumed to be much less than k e g dagan 1989 gelhar 1993 tartakovsky and neuman 1998 lu and robinson 2006 kuang et al 2020 based on the linear relationship between solid matrix compressibility and k proposed by freeze 1975 dagan 1989 suggested that ss is one order of magnitude less variable than k hoeksema and kitanidis 1985 found that both k and storage coefficient s values from 31 aquifers can be generally considered as log normally distributed in stochastic analyses of transient flow problems early studies treated k and ss or s as statistically homogeneous stationary variables e g dagan 1982 sun and yeh 1992 zhang 1999 and ss or s were sometimes taken to be constant for simplicity e g dagan and rubin 1988 tartakovsky and neuman 1998 panzeri et al 2013 these assumptions seem plausible when the aquifer is composed of a single geological unit while can be violated for aquifers with complicated geological structures and facies to evaluate the impacts of structural heterogeneity on flow winter and tartakovsky 2000 2002 proposed the composite medium model in which hydraulic parameters were represented through pairing a random boundary process that determines block geometry with a stationary process that defines hydraulic properties within a material block winter et al 2002 concluded that the structural variability of k had a more significant effect on flow prediction than local scale variability within the material block in aquifer systems composed of multiple geological materials ss values determined for the same field can vary several orders of magnitude younger 1993 shaver 1998 alexander et al 2011 acworth et al 2017 wu et al 2005 stated that when the aquifer is composed of contrasting storage property blocks the estimated s value from traditional aquifer test analyses correlated well with the s value of the block where the observation point was located in thus far studies have shown that ss or s as well as their spatial variability play important roles in hydrogeological research such as groundwater flow predictions alexander et al 2011 quinn et al 2016 groundwater storage and depletion konikow and neuzil 2007 ojha et al 2018 land subsidence domenico and mifflin 1965 hung et al 2012 erban et al 2013 zhuang et al 2017 and solute transport under transient flow conditions goode and konikow 1990 elfeki et al 2012 pool et al 2016 for example elfeki et al 2012 reported that an increase in s led to a decrease in plume spatial moments and longitudinal macrodispersion inouchi et al 1990 found that longitudinal and transverse mixing induced by tides in confined coastal aquifers strongly depended on the value of ss through numerical experiments pool et al 2014 revealed that large storativity caused fluctuations in the flow boundary conditions to propagate through the aquifer with a spatially variable speed which enhanced mixing and was especially important for contaminant migration at the regional scale appropriate identification of aquifer storage parameters is critical for groundwater resource management wu et al 2005 rodell et al 2007 sun et al 2010 konikow 2011 béjar pizarro et al 2017 since groundwater availability analyses are directly affected by aquifer storage parameters inaccurate estimates of ss or s could lead to serious consequences to regional groundwater assessment in the study of mississippi river basin rodell et al 2007 stated that uncertainty in specific yield sy would significantly change the amplitude of computed groundwater fluctuations which highlighted the importance of using distributed aquifer storage parameters instead of assuming global mean values in aquifer systems experiencing significant land subsidence the rate and magnitude of consolidation relies heavily on the inelastic storage coefficient while the elastic storage coefficient only has a smaller effect on the rate of subsidence don et al 2005 suggesting that quantification of inelastic storativity is essential for the sustainable water resources management erban et al 2014 rezaei et al 2020 over the past two decades hydraulic tomography ht has been proposed and developed e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 to characterize both k and ss heterogeneity at high resolutions the fundamental idea of ht is to obtain high density hydraulic response data from transient state tht or steady state ssht compared to ssht which only estimates k distributions tht that properly considers k and ss heterogeneity enables the simultaneous estimation of k and ss values zhu and yeh 2005 thus far the performance of ht has been demonstrated via laboratory experiments e g liu et al 2002 2007 illman et al 2010 berg and illman 2011a zhao et al 2016 and field studies e g straface et al 2007 bohling et al 2007 brauchler et al 2011 2013 berg and illman 2011b castagna et al 2011 cardiff et al 2012 2013 hochstetler et al 2016 paradis et al 2016 mao et al 2018 fischer et al 2020 for a number of tht studies geostatistics based inverse modeling approaches have been adopted typically high resolution k distributions have been recovered through tht inversions while the spatial variability of ss has been found to be smooth or lacking of structural features e g liu et al 2007 berg and illman 2011a 2011b zhao and illman 2018 in particular liu et al 2007 presented the first validation study of tht in a laboratory sandbox with a synthetic aquifer packed in a deterministic layered pattern they found that the recovered structural pattern noticeable in the k tomogram was not mapped for the ss tomogram when visually compared with the image of sandbox aquifer instead a general decreasing trend in ss values with depth was observed the smooth nature of the ss tomogram was due to various size sands used in the sandbox experiments while silts and clays were not used similar smooth ss results have also been reported for other tht studies conducted in different sandboxes berg and illman 2011a luo et al 2017 and also under field conditions straface et al 2007 berg and illman 2011b the lower degree of ss heterogeneity observed by various researchers in comparison to k may have caused some researchers to ignore ss variability in their tht analyses e g li et al 2005 cardiff and barrash 2011 tiedeman and barrash 2020 in particular li et al 2005 and cardiff and barrash 2011 stated that treating ss and or sy as constants during inverse modeling even when these fields are variable would not lead to dramatic deviations in the estimated k or t fields in contrast castagna et al 2011 through synthetic experiments concluded that incorrectly treating the spatially heterogeneous s field to be homogeneous yielded a consistent representation of t field but entirely misrepresented the s field and deteriorated the quality of the inversion moreover jiménez et al 2015 showed that the consideration of ss heterogeneity in addition to k in the inversion process could improve the fitting of model results to transient data while the structural features were only slightly changed these controversial findings lead to the question whether one should consider ss heterogeneity in inverse groundwater modeling or not and whether the reliability of estimated values is impacted or not thus far only a few published works have tried to address the above issues through numerical studies sun et al 2013 suggested a temporal sampling strategy of pressure head data from ht survey to improve the estimation of heterogeneous t and s fields based on the cross correlation analyses between the pressure head and s values they suggested using early time tm data from drawdown curves when the observed head and s values are most correlated the time tm is approximately equal to the intercept time t0 at which the extrapolated drawdown from the first straight portion of the drawdown log time curve becomes zero based on a well studied laboratory sandbox aquifer initially constructed by illman et al 2010 luo et al 2017 compared model performances of different conceptualizations for tht analyses and investigated the potential benefits of using both k and ss estimates from calibrated geological models as initial distributions for the geostatistics based tht inversion approach they found that geological features were preserved in the estimated k tomograms while the estimated ss tomogram almost remained as smooth as the case without using any geological information the work by luo et al 2017 together with the findings from other studies e g wu et al 2005 liu et al 2007 xiang et al 2009 berg and illman 2011b zha et al 2019 highlighted that it is more difficult to estimate ss heterogeneity than those of k during tht analyses studies have also demonstrated the performances of ht in reconstructing ss or sy distributions through inverting different types of information such as head and self potential data soueid ahmed et al 2016 head and time lapse gravity data tsai et al 2017 which would require additional experimental efforts in one recent tht study conducted at the highly heterogeneous north campus research site ncrs zhao and illman 2018 found that estimated k distributions showed the very heterogeneous double layer aquifer features of a multi aquifer aquitard system but the jointly estimated ss tomograms were quite smooth despite the large number of pressure head data used for model calibrations this is so despite the fact that the ss of aquifers and aquitards typically varies over several orders of magnitude reflecting this highly variable nature of the aquifer aquitard system at the ncrs alexander et al 2011 reported ss estimates ranging up to five orders of magnitude from 2 6 10 8 m to 3 8 10 3 m with a geometric mean of 3 1 10 5 m based on the type curve analysis of a pumping test such different results suggest that ss heterogeneity could have been potentially overlooked during the inversion process and additional efforts may be needed in order to obtain ss estimates at finer resolutions for the geostatistics based tht analysis the main purposes of this study are to systematically investigate the importance of ss heterogeneity for ht and whether ss heterogeneity can be reliably mapped or not in addition to k heterogeneity through tht we first examine the performance of different inverse modeling approaches in a multi layered laboratory sandbox with known stratigraphy following the temporal data sampling strategy suggested by sun et al 2013 to evaluate whether heterogeneous structures of ss could be more clearly mapped then we systematically investigate the reliability of k and ss estimates from various modeling approaches the impacts of different kinds of prior information were evaluated for tht analyses through synthetic experiments which contain composite materials similar to the ncrs site findings from this study should yield further insights for tht implementations in the field 2 laboratory sandbox study 2 1 sandbox settings and experimental data a synthetic 18 layer heterogeneous sandbox aquifer was constructed by illman et al 2010 through cyclically depositing sediments of different sizes under varying water flow and sediment feeding rates to mimic an interfingering deposition of natural fluvial aquifers as shown in fig 1 a the sandbox aquifer is 160 0 cm long 78 0 cm high and 10 2 cm wide at each end of the sandbox a series of 4 inch perforated plate mesh combination was installed to serve as a sand water interface and to provide hydraulic control forty eight fully penetrating horizontal wells along six columns were installed on the back wall of the sandbox which can also be utilized for pumping and injection purposes each well was instrumented with a 0 to 1 psig pounds per square inch gauge setra model 209 pressure transducer to obtain local k values constant head permeameter tests were conducted on core samples extracted at 48 port locations the extracted materials were quite uniform based on visual inspection and showed no obvious layering therefore the anisotropy in k within each layer was neglected table 1 lists the sand types and k estimates for each layer of the sandbox aquifer when multiple ports intersect a given layer a geometric mean of the calculated k values was provided it is important to note that k values can be different for the same sand type due to the impacts of sediment deposition compaction in situ coring and testing for example average k values are different for 20 30 sand layers deposited at various sections of the sandbox aquifer in particular the particle diameter for which 50 of the weight is finer d50 is adopted from craig 2005 for each different sand type provided in table 1 single hole pumping tests were performed in the heterogeneous sandbox aquifer to estimate k and ss values at locations of the 48 ports the tests were conducted by pumping water from each port at a constant rate 1 25 ml s and monitoring the transient head changes at the pumped locations using a pressure transducer for each test data collection was started before pumping to collect the initial hydraulic heads at all monitoring ports a peristaltic pump was then activated and run at a constant flow rate until the development of steady state conditions the entire transient hydrograph was manually matched using vsaft2 yeh et al 1993 by treating the aquifer to be homogeneous the estimated k and ss for different layers are also listed in table 1 if multiple ports are in the same layer then the geometric mean of k or ss is presented 2 2 pumping tests and data selections we utilized 24 cross hole tests conducted at different ports with constant pumping rates that ranged from 2 50 to 3 17 ml s for this study during each test the left right and top faces of the sandbox were hydraulically connected to produce constant head boundaries of 77 5 cm illman et al 2010 meanwhile hydraulic head changes were observed at all 48 ports until steady state conditions for all pumping tests steady state conditions were reached within 20 s since the initiation of pumping the pump was then shut off and hydraulic heads were monitored to full recovery eight pumping tests ports 2 5 14 17 32 35 44 and 47 along two well columns indicated on fig 1a were chosen for model calibration while the other 16 independent pumping tests ports 8 11 13 15 16 18 20 23 26 29 37 38 39 40 41 and 42 were kept for model validation purposes prior to extracting data points from hydrographs pressure head data from observation ports were fitted with a fifth or sixth order polynomial curve luo et al 2017 or denoised using the wavelet toolbox in matlab to remove pressure transducer noise the denoised drawdown curves at selected observation ports are plotted in figs s1 s8 the signal to noise ratios snr were calculated for each drawdown curve using the method provided in xiang et al 2009 to examine the quality of denoised data previously xiang et al 2009 stated that low snr pumping test data could lead to erroneous estimation of the ss field and the denoised data could improve the ss field although not as good as using noise free data they suggested that snr should be larger than 1 in order to provide useful information of drawdown as shown in fig s9 of the supplementary information section snr values of the denoised data are generally larger than 1 except for several data points in the very early time period and or from the observation ports i e ports 1 3 4 and 6 at the upper part of the sandbox for these ports data were selected at time points having snr larger than 1 in studies of the asymptotic analysis approach e g illman and tartakovsky 2006 pressure transients at the intermediate to late time were used to estimate k and ss values previous studies like leven and dietrich 2006 through sensitivity analyses sun et al 2013 and mao et al 2013a through cross correlation analyses yeh et al 2015 through numerical model have also highlighted the importance of using early time data for accurate s or ss estimation therefore data points that cover the early intermediate and late time of aquifer responses were extracted from each drawdown curve unlike the data sampling schemes used in previous studies e g zhu and yeh 2005 liu et al 2007 luo et al 2017 we newly selected three to four data points at and around the time t0 representing the early time response as shown in figs s1 s8 during the early time noticeable drawdown develops and propagates to observation wells which leads to early changes in drawdown log time curves the time t0 was defined as the time at which the extrapolated drawdown from the first straight portion of an observed drawdown log time curve becomes zero sun et al 2013 which were reported to contain the most information about ss heterogeneity in the region between the pumping and observation locations wu et al 2005 mao et al 2013a sun et al 2013 during the intermediate and late times the impact of ss on head change diminishes and groundwater flow reaches steady state conditions pressure head during this time contains more information about k heterogeneity sun et al 2013 thus one to two data points from intermediate and late time were extracted in total 1514 data points were selected from eight pumping tests for model calibration 3 analysis of laboratory sandbox data 3 1 groundwater flow modeling in order to examine the necessity of capturing ss heterogeneity for tht analyses we characterized the k and ss distributions of the sandbox aquifer using four different approaches namely the effective parameter approach the geological modeling approach and the geostatistics based ssht and tht approaches for all groundwater flow models considered the synthetic aquifer was discretized into 741 elements and 1600 nodes with average element dimensions of 4 1 cm 4 1 cm 10 2 cm the left right and top faces of the sandbox were set as constant head boundaries while the bottom front and back faces were set as no flow boundaries 3 1 1 effective parameter modeling approach the sandbox aquifer is first treated as homogeneous and isotropic to estimate the effective k keff and ss sseff values through coupling the forward groundwater flow model mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 with the parameter estimation code pest doherty 2005 the effective parameter model can be used to describe the overall behaviour of the aquifer when being calibrated to multiple pumping tests more importantly this model provides the baseline scenario for model calibration and validation performance comparisons among more sophisticated groundwater flow models furthermore the estimated keff and sseff values can be used as initial guesses of hydraulic parameters to facilitate the calibration of other groundwater flow models 3 1 2 geological modeling approach construction of a geological model is the standard approach in building groundwater flow and transport models typically geological models are built by interpolating stratigraphy information obtained from borehole logs for this study we constructed a geological model utilized for forward and inverse groundwater flow modeling consisting of multiple zones fig 1b based on the layering information shown on the glass fig 1a that is we assume perfect knowledge of stratification for the entire sandbox aquifer which is not available with current field technology unlike the geological models constructed by luo et al 2017 through interpolations of borehole logs of varying accuracy this geological model can be considered as the best case scenario in terms of knowledge of stratification in total k and ss of 18 layers were estimated by coupling mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 with pest doherty 2005 3 1 3 geostatistical inverse modeling approaches ssht and tht in order to characterize the heterogeneous k and ss fields at a resolution higher than the effective and geological modeling approaches we performed geostatistical inverse analyses of eight pumping tests using the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle code xiang et al 2009 tht analysis was performed to simultaneously estimate k and ss values while ssht analysis was used to estimate the k distribution only both analyses were run using the same pumping and observation densities however unlike inverting all 1514 data points for tht analysis only 374 steady state pressure heads were chosen for the ssht analysis the geostatistical inversion approach implemented in simsle treats the natural log values of hydraulic parameters e g ln k and or ln ss of the heterogeneous porous media as stochastic processes with given prior information like the unconditional means variances σ 2 lnk σ2 lnss and correlation scales λx λy and λz simsle creates the initial parameter fields through conditioning on available measurements of hydraulic parameters with cokriging the parameter field is then used to solve the transient or steady state flow equation to obtain simulated pressure heads based on the differences between simulated and observed pressure heads simsle iteratively improves the estimated hydraulic parameter fields until the difference between the two continuous estimated hydraulic parameter fields or the largest difference between simulated and observed heads is smaller than a specified tolerance we assumed that the hydraulic parameter fields can be described by the exponential covariance model the initial values of k and ss were set as keff and sseff respectively while σ2 lnk σ2 lnss 3 0 λx 50 cm λy 10 2 cm and λz 10 0 cm in order to be consistent with a previous investigation zhao et al 2016 3 2 model calibration and validation all calibration runs for groundwater flow models were performed on the same pc with a quad core cpu and 16 gb of random access memory calibrations of the effective parameter and geological models were performed by minimizing an objective function that represents a weighted sum of squared differences between simulated and observed pressure heads model parameters were iteratively optimized by pest based on the derivatives of all observations with respect to all adjustable parameters pest is a versatile and model independent parameter estimation program which could be readily coupled with other types of forward models the levenberg marquardt method implemented in pest was utilized to minimize the objective function the optimization process converged when the lowest four objective function values were within a relative distance of 0 05 defined as 1 φ i φ min φ i 0 05 where фi is the objective function value at the end of the ith optimization iteration фmin is the lowest objective function achieved during i th to i 3 th optimization iteration the lowest objective functions during the calibrations of the effective parameter and geological models were summarized in table s1 the effective parameter model calibration took five optimization iterations 28 pest model calls since only one pair of k and ss was estimated each model call consisted of one forward simulation of eight pumping tests run by mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 and parameter estimation run by pest doherty 2005 with further conceptualizing the sandbox aquifer as a stratigraphy constrained geological model it took 10 optimization iterations 576 pest model calls to converge for 18 pairs of k and ss values on the other hand the geostatistical inversion approach based on simsle does not rely on geological structures it instead uses pixel by pixel correlation relationships between hydraulic parameters e g k or ss and pressure heads at observed locations represented as cross covariance coefficients that evolve dynamically to reflect the incorporation of head data for the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion models we selected inversion results from the iteration step at which the l2 norms have stabilized indicating the convergences of the inversion processes as suggested by xiang et al 2009 to validate the estimated k and ss distributions from all models the 16 pumping tests not used in model calibration efforts were simulated the quality of matches between simulated and observed drawdowns was assessed through scatterplots and the best fit lines and coefficient of determination r2 the mean absolute error l1 and mean square error l2 were also calculated for each pumping test to further evaluate the fits between observed and simulated drawdowns the l2 norm magnifies large discrepancies and allows one to better assess the different models those quantities were computed as 2 l 1 1 n i 1 n χ i χ i 3 l 2 1 n i 1 n χ i χ i 2 where n is the total number of drawdowns i indicates the data number χ i and χ i represent the simulated and measured drawdowns respectively 3 3 results from the laboratory sandbox 3 3 1 k and ss estimates of different modeling approaches the estimated k value of the effective parameter approach is 8 81 10 2 cm s with lower and upper 95 confidence limits of 8 64 10 2 cm s and 9 00 10 2 cm s respectively the estimated ss value is 9 37 10 5 cm with lower and upper 95 confidence limits of 8 95 10 5 cm and 9 81 10 5 cm respectively the effective parameters have previously been determined by taking geometric means of 48 single hole k and ss estimates k 6 0 10 2 cm s and ss 6 1 10 4 cm berg and illman 2011a from calibration of a transient flow model k 9 57 10 2 cm s and ss 6 32 10 5 cm luo et al 2017 and from calibration of steady state flow model k 8 9 10 2 cm s illman et al 2015 our estimated value of k is close to that from illman et al 2015 and ss value is slightly higher than that from luo et al 2017 given the large number of transient data points selected from eight pumping tests especially the increased number of early time data around the time point t0 as defined by sun et al 2013 the k and ss estimates from this study should be sufficient for predicting the averaged spatial trend of observed heads in a heterogeneous aquifer yeh et al 2015 the k and ss distributions estimated from the calibration of the perfect geological model were plotted as figs 2 a and b and corresponding values were listed in table s2 figs 2c and d were the estimated k and ss fields from the tht analysis respectively while the estimated k distribution from the ssht analysis was plotted as fig 2e we also populated the geological model fig 1b with ss values estimated from single hole tests shown as fig 2f for visual comparisons of ss values obtained from different approaches black lines in fig 2 indicate the true layer boundaries delineated in the photograph of the sandbox aquifer fig 1a we see from figs 2a f and table s2 that the estimated k values of the calibrated geological model ranged from a low k value of 9 69 10 3 cm s in layer 6 to a high k value of 4 55 10 1 cm s in layer 1 while the estimated ss values ranged from a low ss value of 6 46 10 6 cm in layer 1 to a high ss value of 2 56 10 4 cm in layer 15 specifically the estimated k values generally increased with increasing grain sizes d50 in table 1 plotted as fig 2g showing a low value range of 1 06 10 2 cm s to 2 46 10 2 cm s for layers 3 10 14 and 17 with fine sands d50 0 151 0 204 mm a middle range of 4 25 10 2 cm s to 1 99 10 1 cm s for layers 2 4 7 8 9 11 and 15 with medium sands d50 0 355 0 578 mm and a high value range of 2 93 10 1 cm s to 4 55 10 1 cm s for layers 1 13 12 and 18 with coarse sands d50 0 750 0 872 mm this is reasonable since that coarse sand is more permeable than the fine sand on the other hand such a trend had not been obviously identified when comparing the estimated ss values in table s2 with grain size parameter d50 in table 1 and comparing fig 2b with fig 2g however clear structural features have been captured for the ss tomogram in fig 2b which had not been previously identified by luo et al 2017 the improved structural distinctions in fig 2b could be attributed to the inclusion of increased number of early time response data points at and around the time t0 into the model calibration procedure for the current study by definition ss is the volume of water released from storage of a unit volume of aquifer due to the expansion of the water and compression of the aquifer skeleton under a unit change in average head which has been mathematically expressed as ss ρg α nβ where ρ is water density m l3 g is acceleration of gravity l t2 n is matrix porosity α and β are compressibility of aquifer skeleton and water lt2 m respectively although the estimated ss values in the calibrated geological model table s2 showed no clear correlation with d50 values of different sands table 1 in our sandbox study we can still see that the estimated ss values for layers with the same sand type generally showed a decreasing trend with increasing depth specifically for sand type 20 30 in layers 1 13 and 18 the estimated ss value is 1 13 10 04 cm for the top layer 18 9 45 10 05 cm for layer 13 in the center and 6 46 10 06 cm for layer 1 at the bottom of the sandbox similar trends were also shown for sand types f 85 in layers 3 and 17 and 20 40 in layers 4 9 and 15 this trend was also evident in single hole test ss values table 1 and fig 2f although ss estimates from single hole tests ss 1 75 10 04 3 38 10 03 cm were nearly one order of magnitude larger than those from the calibrated geological model ss 6 46 10 06 2 56 10 04 cm note that the color scale in fig 2f was changed to better show the distribution pattern of data this decreasing trend of ss with depth can be physically plausible as sands in the upper part of the sandbox were less compressed by overlying materials than deeper sands e g liu et al 2007 brauchler et al 2013 paradis et al 2016 given the fact that uncertainty in the ss estimate is substantial for different characterization approaches rau et al 2018 kuang et al 2020 rigorous derivations of ss values based on measurable physical properties like α n and β from laboratory consolidation tests would certainly provide useful insights to examine our estimates from the interpretation of pumping tests and single hole tests data yet a detailed study of quantifying spatial ss heterogeneity through sampling and laboratory testing has never been performed for both laboratory and field hydraulic tomography analyses this is partly due to the fact that results obtained from disturbed samples were deemed to be questionable in representing in situ conditions e g smith et al 2013 moreover subjecting the miniature samples from this sandbox for consolidation tests was also not possible instead single hole tests were conducted to obtain local estimates of ss by illman et al 2010 therefore we further justify our k and ss tomograms in the following sections through predictions of 16 independent pumping tests not used in model calibration efforts in particular accurate predictions of early to intermediate time drawdowns most sensitive to ss should logically lead to the conclusion that ss estimates are more reliable than when the predictions are poor the estimated k tomograms from tht fig 2c and ssht fig 2e analyses showed distribution patterns similar to fig 2a although the high and low k layer boundaries and connectivities were not as consistent as those of the calibrated geological model when being compared to the black lines compared to the ss tomogram estimated through the calibration of the geological model fig 2b the ss tomogram obtained from tht analysis fig 2d was still smooth and nearly same to the results in luo et al 2017 both showing an obviously low value zone at the bottom of the aquifer results of figs 2b and d suggested that impacts of using an increased number of early time data on revealing ss heterogeneity could be different for different modeling approaches thus using a simple geological model instead of a geostatistical model as a first cut approach is likely to be more favourable in capturing structural features of ss fields if a geological model could be reliably constructed these results suggested that information other than early time response data e g geological and geophysical information local ss data from slug and or single hole tests information on aquifer aquitard compressibility might have to be jointly considered for the geostatistical inversion approach in order to yield improved ss estimates meanwhile when comparing figs 2b and d with fig 2f we found that ss distributions of the calibrated geological model and the tht analysis were quite different from the geological model populated with single hole test ss values 3 3 2 reliability of k and ss estimates for drawdown predictions in order to further evaluate the reliability of estimated k and ss values we systematically compared the drawdown prediction performance of 16 independent pumping tests by six groundwater models using combinations of k and ss fields obtained from different characterization approaches the effective parameter model the geological model populated with single hole test data the calibrated geological model and the geostatistical models these six models were named as 1 case 1a homo using estimated keff and sseff values from the effective parameter modeling approach 2 case 1b ssht ss eff using the high resolution k field from ssht and sseff value from the effective parameter modeling approach 3 case 1c ssht ss sgh using k field from ssht and ss field of the geological model populated with ss values from single hole tests 4 case 1d ssht ss geo using k field from ssht and ss field from the calibrated geological model 5 case 1e geomodel using both k and ss fields from the calibrated geological model and 6 case 1f tht using both k and ss fields from tht by comparing the results of these models we could examine the performance and benefits of conceptualizing the heterogeneous k and ss fields of groundwater models to varying resolutions the simulated versus observed drawdowns at several time points 0 25 0 5 1 2 5 and 15 s from the drawdown curves of 16 pumping tests were selected and shown as fig 3 the linear fit results were also included in each subfigure in particular the simulated drawdown curves for cases 1a 1b 1d and 1f were plotted for all 16 pumping tests at 15 selected observation ports to compare with the observed drawdowns fig 4 and figs s11 s25 in the supplementary information comparing fig 3a with fig 3b the coefficient of determination r2 value increased from 0 83 for case 1a to 0 95 for case 1b from fig 4 we see that the homogeneous model in case 1a poorly predicted the drawdown curves for early intermediate and late time for most of the selected observation ports while using the heterogeneous k field of high resolution in case 1b accurately simulated the late time drawdowns since ss heterogeneities were ignored in both cases these results suggested that k heterogeneity have to be considered in order to accurately predict steady state groundwater flow fields comparisons among figs 3b d revealed that 1 drawdown predictions were improved when treating the ss values as a geologically distributed field fig 3d instead of as a homogeneous field fig 3b and the improvements originated from the more accurate predictions of the transient drawdowns at some observation ports e g ports 13 25 30 37 39 42 as shown in fig 4 and figs s11 s25 2 drawdown predictions were significantly biased in fig 3c for case 1c indicating that ss values estimated through single hole tests should be used with caution for groundwater flow models when conceptualizing the sandbox aquifer as perfect geological and geostatistical models drawdown predictions of both models were satisfactory and similar figs 3e and f although the latter had a slightly higher r2 value and a less scattered fit than the former these findings on one hand revealed that reliable ss estimates can be obtained through the calibration of an accurate geological model if such a model can be obtained and on the other hand suggested that the ss field of the sandbox aquifer was not very heterogeneous 3 3 3 impacts of ignoring ss heterogeneity in tht although the k and ss tomograms of the geostatistical inversion approach had predicted drawdowns of 16 pumping tests most accurately the estimated ss tomogram from tht was smooth fig 2d and the heterogeneity of ss in this laboratory sandbox aquifer was milder in comparison to that of the k based on these results another tht analysis case 2 was performed to investigate whether ss heterogeneity of the synthetic sandbox aquifer could be ignored for the inverse modeling procedure that is the k field was treated as heterogeneous to be estimated by the geostatistical inversion approach implemented in simsle while the ss field was treated to be homogeneous by fixing the value equalling sseff all other initial inputs e g σ 2 lnk λ and data points selected for model calibration were kept the same as in case 1f fig 5 showed the estimated k tomogram for case 2 and validation scatterplots for 16 pumping tests were presented as fig 6 compared to case 1f fig 2c which treated both k and ss fields as spatially heterogeneous fig 5 showed similar distribution patterns of high and low k value zones in the tomogram however some noticeable differences can be found between figs 2c and 5 in terms of geometries of high k value zones around the boundaries of the modeling domain and connectivities of high k zones in the central layers layers 7 9 13 and 15 of the sandbox meanwhile drawdown predictions of 16 pumping tests of case 2 were slightly deteriorated in terms of r2 values revealing a larger scatter when comparing fig 6 with fig 3f through cross correlation analysis wu et al 2005 and others mao et al 2013a sun et al 2013 found that the observed head was only correlated with s or ss within a narrow region between the pumping and observation wells during the early stage of pumping tests while the observed head was correlated with t or k through early intermediate and late times in the cone of depression giving the fact that the number of unknown parameters was far more than the number of observation locations in our sandbox study the necessary conditions mao et al 2013b yeh et al 2015 enabling the inverse problem to be well defined were not met for such ill posed estimation problems of tht the geostatistical inversion scheme implemented in simsle xiang et al 2009 seeks the most likely conditional effective k and ss fields honouring the head measurements at sampling locations the estimated k and ss fields were then iteratively updated by the estimator based on the differences between the simulated and observed heads relying on cross correlation coefficients between the heads and parameters to be estimated in case 2 when ss heterogeneity was intentionally ignored the head differences caused by k and ss heterogeneity were attributed solely to the k field leading to noticeable differences that can be found between figs 2c and 5 tables 2 and 3 summarized the geometric means kg ssg variances σ2 lnk σ2 lnss and correlation lengths λx λz fitted to the exponential model for the resulting k and ss tomograms of the geological model ssht and tht cases generally the values of kg and ssg were very close among different cases and also close to the k 8 81 10 2 cm s and ss 9 37 10 5 cm values estimated by the effective parameter model suggesting that reliable mean values could be obtained by different model approaches for the sandbox on the other hand there were some noticeable differences in the estimated variances and correlation lengths when the same transient dataset was used for inversions the estimated σ2 lnk of the geological model was nearly twice the value of the tht case 1f and the difference between estimated σ2 lnss for both modeling cases was smaller this finding implied that an accurate geological model might be more favourable over the highly parameterized geostatistical model to reveal the interlayer heterogeneity pattern benefiting from the stratigraphy information for the full simulation domain while the latter had to rely solely on the hydraulic response data to reconstruct it however this is based on the premise that an accurate geological model could be obtained when only using the steady state data for model calibration the ssht case obtained kg σ2 lnk λx and λz values that were similar to the geological modeling approach while the estimated σ2 lnk was twice the value of the tht case 1f table 2 the large differences in σ2 lnk values of ssht and tht case 1f could be attributed to the fact that the former captured more low k zones than the latter this result suggested that ssht analyses might be a better choice to estimate k tomograms when steady state pumping test data are available since the number of unknowns to be inversely estimated by ssht is only half of that of the tht case when incorrectly treating the heterogeneous ss field to be homogeneous the σ2 lnk of the estimated k field for tht case 2 was higher than that of the tht case 1f table 2 confirming our computational analysis that the head differences caused by k and ss heterogeneity were solely reflected in the k field the influence of ss heterogeneity on model calibrations and validations were quantitatively evaluated through comparing average l1 and l2 values obtained for different pumping tests l1 and l2 values of model calibrations were summarized in fig s10 presented in the supplementary information for the effective parameter model case 1a homo the perfect geological model case 1e geomodel and the geostatistics based inversion models case 1f tht case 2 tht with fixed ss 9 37 10 5 cm note that l1 and l2 values of the ssht analysis case are not listed since it used a different number of pressure head data for model calibration i e only steady state we also calculated the l1 and l2 norms for the drawdown predictions of each of the 16 pumping tests in cases 1a 1f and case 2 based on fig s10 and fig 7 we can see that influences of the ss heterogeneity on pressure head simulations are noticeable in our sandbox study for model calibration results in fig s10 comparing case 2 to case 1f average l1 and l2 values increase by 24 4 and by 92 9 respectively for model validation results in the fig 7 comparing case 2 to case 1f average l1 and l2 values increase by 19 8 and by 41 8 respectively the large differences in l1 and l2 values for model calibration can be attributed to our data sampling strategy in which more early time data are used than data from the intermediate and late time examinations of l1 and l2 norms in fig 7 of observed versus simulated drawdowns for each of the 16 pumping tests showed that 1 case 1d performed the best and case 1f based on tht came a close second 2 case 2 performed worse than cases 1d and 1f which treated both k and ss as heterogeneous in terms of l1 and l2 norm ranks 3 case 2 performed even worse than case 1b which used k field from ssht and sseff value from the effective parameter modeling approach these results collectively suggested that it is important to consider ss heterogeneity for groundwater flow models when transient drawdown data are inverted to recover the subsurface heterogeneity even for a mildly heterogeneous aquifer otherwise utilizing steady state data based on ssht analysis instead of ignoring ss heterogeneity for tht analysis could estimate k distribution more reasonably and quickly as well as predicting pumping tests more accurately comparing results of case 1b to case 1d and case 1f to case 2 in fig 7 we can see that considering the ss heterogeneity for the sandbox aquifer model generally leads to improved model validation performances when the k field from ssht was used treating ss values as a geologically distributed field instead of using an uniform sseff value yielded decreases in average l1 and l2 values by 15 8 and 30 4 respectively for tht inversion cases after considering ss heterogeneity the average l1 and l2 values for 16 pumping tests decreased by 16 5 and 29 5 respectively we should also note that l1 and l2 values for some tests e g port 8 port 16 increased slightly when comparing case 1d to case 1b suggesting the need for further improvement of the heterogeneous ss field fig 2b overall our laboratory sandbox study indicated that ss heterogeneity should be considered in addition to k for the tht analysis even when the estimated ss field is smooth however for a mildly heterogeneous aquifer ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of ss would not significantly bias the drawdown predictions when the k field estimated from ssht is used for groundwater flow modeling purposes as clearly shown in figs 3 4 and 7 4 synthetic experiments 4 1 experimental design in the previous sections the true fields of k and ss of the sandbox aquifer were unknown and it is not possible to directly evaluate the accuracy of k and ss estimates from different approaches additionally the sandbox in fig 1 was built with sand of various sizes lacking of less permeable clay layers which were frequently encountered during field investigations therefore a synthetic numerical model which contained both high and low permeable materials was constructed to systematically investigate the issue of obtaining ss estimates at finer resolutions for geostatistics based tht analyses the synthetic aquifer had a groundwater flow model setting identical to the sandbox aquifer as described in the section 2 except that sand types k and ss values for each of 18 layers were assumed to be known and the degree of heterogeneity to be much higher than the actual sandbox the k values for the synthetic aquifer as shown in fig 8 a were generated through 1 constructing a layered mean ln k field using values listed in the table s3 2 generating a set of normally distributed random numbers with a mean of zero and a variance of 0 10 representing variations of ln k and 3 variations of ln k were added to the mean ln k field and then back transformed yielding a k field with both interlayer and intralayer variability the ss field was created following the same procedure and plotted as fig 9 a the mean values of ln k and ln ss listed in table s3 were based on k estimates for sediments typical at the ncrs site on the university of waterloo campus from alexander et al 2011 and on ranges of ss values suggested for porous media in batu 1998 through this approach we built a synthetic numerical aquifer with geological information as in the laboratory sandbox constructed by illman et al 2010 while the hydraulic parameters for each of 18 layers similar to the values estimated for the highly heterogeneous ncrs berg and illman 2011b after generating the true fields for k and ss pumping tests were simulated at eight ports ports 2 5 14 17 32 35 44 and 47 with a constant withdrawal rate of 10 ml min for 200 min to ensure that steady state conditions were reached during each pumping test head data were collected at the other 47 observation ports not used for pumping these pumping and observation locations were the same as fig 1a five data points were extracted from each drawdown curve for model calibration and the same data sampling strategy as described in section 2 2 was utilized in total 1880 data points were selected from eight pumping tests to calibrate the effective parameter model the geological model and the geostatistical inversion model the effective parameter model was calibrated to yield effective hydraulic parameters keff and sseff that were used as the initial guesses of hydraulic parameters for other models for the geostatistical inversion model the other prior information σ 2 lnk σ2 lnss λx λy and λz were assumed to be the same as those values given in the section 3 1 3 to meet our study objectives five inverse modeling scenarios cases 3a 3b 3c 3d and 3e were designed and their performances in recovering the true k and ss fields were compared in case 3a we assumed that the stratification of the geological model was perfectly known for the entire simulation domain in case 3b the geostatistical inversion started with homogeneous mean fields of keff and sseff in case 3c the estimated k values from model calibration of case 3a and the sseff values from case 3b were used as initial parameter fields in case 3d the estimated ss values from model calibration of case 3a and the keff values from case 3b were used as the initial parameter fields in case 3e both k and ss values from case 3a were used as the initial mean fields the usefulness of initial k and or ss distributions for geostatistical inversion approach can be evaluated through comparing results from cases 3b 3c 3d and 3e 4 2 results of the synthetic experiments to facilitate visual comparisons k and ss estimates for cases 3a 3b 3c 3d and 3e were plotted in figs 8b f and 9b f respectively meanwhile the estimated hydraulic parameters were quantitatively compared to true fields in figs 10 a e and 11 a e respectively comparing fig 8b with fig 8a the calibrated geological model of case 3a revealed the heterogeneity pattern of k quite accurately which could be attributed to the facts that accurate knowledge of stratigraphy information was assumed to be available and a large amount of pumping test data were used for model calibration the linear fitting results in fig 10a also showed that r2 reached 0 95 suggesting a very good match of estimated k with the true values on the other hand the estimated ss field in fig 9b captured the main heterogeneity pattern in fig 9a while losing details in the two high ss value zones near the upper boundary and overestimating the low value areas fig 11a these results emphasize that ss heterogeneity is more difficult to be accurately estimated than k wu et al 2005 liu et al 2007 zha et al 2019 for the geostatistical inversion case 3b we see that fig 8c showed the five low k zones located in the central part with some details missing from areas around the left and right boundaries the estimated ss tomogram in fig 9c showed the featured high value zones in fig 9a however the low values were also overestimated in fig 9c for case 3c after using k values of the calibrated geological model fig 8b as the initial mean k field for the geostatistical inversion approach the estimated k tomogram in fig 8d showed significant improvements over fig 8c of the case 3b however the estimated ss field of the case 3c showed less details than figs 9b case 3a and c case 3b with worse results in terms of the linear model fit in fig 11c than those in figs 11a and b when using ss values in fig 9b as the initial mean ss field for case 3d the geostatistical inversion approach yielded the best ss estimates among cases 3a 3b 3c and 3d with a higher r2 value of 0 54 in fig 11d than those in figs 11a r2 0 39 b r2 0 33 and c r2 0 22 however the k estimates of case 3c fig 10d were generally the same as those of case 3b fig 10b for case 3e both k and ss fields figs 8f and 9f were improved compared to those of case 3b with increased r2 values and lowered l1 and l2 norms when comparing figs 10e and 11e to figs 10b and 11b these results suggested that using only k or ss values from the calibrated geological model as the initial mean field for the geostatistical inversion approach did not necessarily benefit the accurate estimation of the other parameter ss or k field the summarized statistical parameters of the true case and cases 3a 3e tables s4 and s5 also suggested similar findings that 1 geometric means of ss fields were generally overestimated in cases 3a 3e 2 using geologically distributed k or ss values for the geostatistical inversion approach was helpful for the estimation of corresponding k or ss tomograms therefore in order to capture both interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of k and ss values for the tht analysis reliable prior information have to be included 5 summary and conclusions in this study we investigated whether the spatial heterogeneity of ss should be considered during the interpretation of transient hydraulic tomography tht data to reliably characterize the heterogeneity of a laboratory sandbox aquifer we selected three modeling approaches of different complexities and parameterization schemes to map the k and ss heterogeneity of the laboratory sandbox aquifer at varying resolutions including 1 the effective parameter model 2 the perfect geological model and 3 the geostatistics based inversion models in addition we examined the value of geologically distributed k and ss values for the tht analysis by using them as prior distributions for the geostatistical inversion approach with a synthetic case study our work resulted in the following major findings and conclusions 1 the estimated k values from the calibration of the perfect geological model corresponded well with the grain size information of the laboratory sandbox aquifer when the inversion started with homogeneous parameter estimates the geostatistics based tht and ssht analyses yielded k tomograms with high and low k zones that resembled the geological model but lacked in consistency in terms of layer boundaries on the other hand with the inclusion of increased number of early time response data at and around the time t0 as suggested by sun et al 2013 into the calibration procedure the geological model revealed clearer structural features for the ss field of the laboratory aquifer while the ss tomogram obtained from tht analysis was still smooth and revealed no distinctive geological features therefore to reconstruct the ss field more reliably the combined use of both geological information and pumping tests data seems more favourable for tht analyses 2 the effective parameter approach that treats both k and ss fields as homogeneous poorly predicted the drawdown curves at early intermediate and late times for 16 independent pumping tests used for model validation when the high resolution k field estimated from ssht was used for the groundwater flow model ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of ss could still predict late time drawdowns accurately further conceptualizing the ss values as a geologically distributed field obtained from model calibration was reliable and led to improved drawdown predictions at sites with complex geological structures groundwater models based on the composite media concept winter and tartakovsky 2000 clark et al 2020 or the general statistical framework suggested by zha et al 2017 that account for both boundary geometry variability and intralayer heterogeneity should be more routinely adopted for estimating both k and ss fields ss values estimated from single hole tests should be used with caution in groundwater flow models since they could lead to significantly biased drawdown predictions 3 although ss heterogeneity in this laboratory sandbox aquifer was milder in comparison to that of k and the estimated ss tomogram from tht was found to be smooth ss heterogeneity should still be considered in order to accurately estimate k values from the inverse analysis of transient pumping test data this agrees with the conclusions by castagna et al 2011 the variance of ss field for the sandbox is smaller σ2 lnss 0 6 0 8 than that of the synthetic experiment σ2 lnss 3 3 while in the former we evaluated the reliability of ss estimates through validation pumping tests and in the latter we directly compared the estimates to the true ss values results from both experiments suggested that ss may be reliably estimated or recovered through model calibration efforts if proper parameterization schemes and modeling approaches were used 4 finally we conclude that the inclusion of reliable geological information of k and ss are helpful for tht analyses to better characterize the inherent heterogeneous hydraulic parameter fields at fine resolutions meanwhile in order to map the ss field reliably it is important to use sufficient non redundant information regarding aquifer heterogeneity and a reasonable data sampling strategy for tht analyses sun et al 2013 wen et al 2020 in this regard methods involving analyses of slug test data sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves etc may be jointly used for future research to provide valuable in situ estimates of ss kuang et al 2020 furthermore we believe the results of this sandbox study could help to guide the interpretation of tht under field conditions in order to help map both k and ss distributions more accurately credit authorship contribution statement zhanfeng zhao conceptualization

4942,over the last two decades various studies on transient hydraulic tomography tht have shown that it is an effective approach to characterize subsurface heterogeneity typically high resolution hydraulic conductivity k distributions were recovered while the spatial variability of specific storage ss was found to be smooth in some studies ss heterogeneity has been intentionally ignored due to the belief that ss is less variable than k therefore one may question the importance of considering ss heterogeneity during tht and its impact on the reliability of estimated hydraulic parameters to investigate these issues three modeling approaches i e effective parameters geological and geostatistics based were used to obtain k and ss estimates of varying spatial resolutions the reliability of k and ss estimates were evaluated by comparing their drawdown prediction performances the values of using different prior k and ss information for tht analyses were investigated our results revealed that 1 the k distribution estimated from the geostatistics based steady state ht analysis accurately predicted the late time drawdowns while further improvements in transient drawdowns were obtained only after jointly treating the ss field as heterogeneous 2 ss heterogeneity should be considered in addition to k for tht inversions even when the estimated ss field is smooth and 3 using k and ss estimates from the calibrated geological model as initial mean distributions for the geostatistical inversion approach were helpful in capturing both interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of k and ss these findings suggested that ss heterogeneity should be properly considered during the implementation of tht keywords aquifer heterogeneity specific storage hydraulic tomography model calibration and validation 1 introduction the accurate knowledge of hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss is critical in groundwater flow modeling contaminant transport and water resource management issues traditional analytical solutions e g theis 1935 or cooper and jacob 1946 treat the aquifer to be homogeneous and yield equivalent estimates for hydraulic properties over the support volume of a test whereas in reality hydraulic parameters are inherently heterogeneous at multiple scales in order to deal with subsurface heterogeneity different laboratory and field characterization approaches as well as modeling techniques have been developed koltermann and gorelick 1996 de marsily et al 2005 hendricks franssen et al 2009 linde et al 2015 for example a large number of core samples have been subjected to laboratory permeameter tests sudicky 1986 sudicky et al 2010 alexander et al 2011 smith et al 2016 slug tests have been conducted at multiple locations yeh et al 1995 aristodemo et al 2018 flowmeter tests have been performed along multiple wells molz et al 1989 rehfeldt et al 1992 klepikova et al 2013 tamayo mas et al 2018 and direct push measurements dietrich et al 2008 liu et al 2009 bianchi and zheng 2016 have been utilized to delineate the heterogeneous distribution of k in sedimentary deposits in contrast the distribution of ss which has been typically estimated from methods such as single hole tests or consolidation experiments e g neuman and witherspoon 1972 keller et al 1989 shaver 1998 quinn et al 2016 is less frequently considered in many field investigations as its heterogeneity has been assumed to be much less than k e g dagan 1989 gelhar 1993 tartakovsky and neuman 1998 lu and robinson 2006 kuang et al 2020 based on the linear relationship between solid matrix compressibility and k proposed by freeze 1975 dagan 1989 suggested that ss is one order of magnitude less variable than k hoeksema and kitanidis 1985 found that both k and storage coefficient s values from 31 aquifers can be generally considered as log normally distributed in stochastic analyses of transient flow problems early studies treated k and ss or s as statistically homogeneous stationary variables e g dagan 1982 sun and yeh 1992 zhang 1999 and ss or s were sometimes taken to be constant for simplicity e g dagan and rubin 1988 tartakovsky and neuman 1998 panzeri et al 2013 these assumptions seem plausible when the aquifer is composed of a single geological unit while can be violated for aquifers with complicated geological structures and facies to evaluate the impacts of structural heterogeneity on flow winter and tartakovsky 2000 2002 proposed the composite medium model in which hydraulic parameters were represented through pairing a random boundary process that determines block geometry with a stationary process that defines hydraulic properties within a material block winter et al 2002 concluded that the structural variability of k had a more significant effect on flow prediction than local scale variability within the material block in aquifer systems composed of multiple geological materials ss values determined for the same field can vary several orders of magnitude younger 1993 shaver 1998 alexander et al 2011 acworth et al 2017 wu et al 2005 stated that when the aquifer is composed of contrasting storage property blocks the estimated s value from traditional aquifer test analyses correlated well with the s value of the block where the observation point was located in thus far studies have shown that ss or s as well as their spatial variability play important roles in hydrogeological research such as groundwater flow predictions alexander et al 2011 quinn et al 2016 groundwater storage and depletion konikow and neuzil 2007 ojha et al 2018 land subsidence domenico and mifflin 1965 hung et al 2012 erban et al 2013 zhuang et al 2017 and solute transport under transient flow conditions goode and konikow 1990 elfeki et al 2012 pool et al 2016 for example elfeki et al 2012 reported that an increase in s led to a decrease in plume spatial moments and longitudinal macrodispersion inouchi et al 1990 found that longitudinal and transverse mixing induced by tides in confined coastal aquifers strongly depended on the value of ss through numerical experiments pool et al 2014 revealed that large storativity caused fluctuations in the flow boundary conditions to propagate through the aquifer with a spatially variable speed which enhanced mixing and was especially important for contaminant migration at the regional scale appropriate identification of aquifer storage parameters is critical for groundwater resource management wu et al 2005 rodell et al 2007 sun et al 2010 konikow 2011 béjar pizarro et al 2017 since groundwater availability analyses are directly affected by aquifer storage parameters inaccurate estimates of ss or s could lead to serious consequences to regional groundwater assessment in the study of mississippi river basin rodell et al 2007 stated that uncertainty in specific yield sy would significantly change the amplitude of computed groundwater fluctuations which highlighted the importance of using distributed aquifer storage parameters instead of assuming global mean values in aquifer systems experiencing significant land subsidence the rate and magnitude of consolidation relies heavily on the inelastic storage coefficient while the elastic storage coefficient only has a smaller effect on the rate of subsidence don et al 2005 suggesting that quantification of inelastic storativity is essential for the sustainable water resources management erban et al 2014 rezaei et al 2020 over the past two decades hydraulic tomography ht has been proposed and developed e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 to characterize both k and ss heterogeneity at high resolutions the fundamental idea of ht is to obtain high density hydraulic response data from transient state tht or steady state ssht compared to ssht which only estimates k distributions tht that properly considers k and ss heterogeneity enables the simultaneous estimation of k and ss values zhu and yeh 2005 thus far the performance of ht has been demonstrated via laboratory experiments e g liu et al 2002 2007 illman et al 2010 berg and illman 2011a zhao et al 2016 and field studies e g straface et al 2007 bohling et al 2007 brauchler et al 2011 2013 berg and illman 2011b castagna et al 2011 cardiff et al 2012 2013 hochstetler et al 2016 paradis et al 2016 mao et al 2018 fischer et al 2020 for a number of tht studies geostatistics based inverse modeling approaches have been adopted typically high resolution k distributions have been recovered through tht inversions while the spatial variability of ss has been found to be smooth or lacking of structural features e g liu et al 2007 berg and illman 2011a 2011b zhao and illman 2018 in particular liu et al 2007 presented the first validation study of tht in a laboratory sandbox with a synthetic aquifer packed in a deterministic layered pattern they found that the recovered structural pattern noticeable in the k tomogram was not mapped for the ss tomogram when visually compared with the image of sandbox aquifer instead a general decreasing trend in ss values with depth was observed the smooth nature of the ss tomogram was due to various size sands used in the sandbox experiments while silts and clays were not used similar smooth ss results have also been reported for other tht studies conducted in different sandboxes berg and illman 2011a luo et al 2017 and also under field conditions straface et al 2007 berg and illman 2011b the lower degree of ss heterogeneity observed by various researchers in comparison to k may have caused some researchers to ignore ss variability in their tht analyses e g li et al 2005 cardiff and barrash 2011 tiedeman and barrash 2020 in particular li et al 2005 and cardiff and barrash 2011 stated that treating ss and or sy as constants during inverse modeling even when these fields are variable would not lead to dramatic deviations in the estimated k or t fields in contrast castagna et al 2011 through synthetic experiments concluded that incorrectly treating the spatially heterogeneous s field to be homogeneous yielded a consistent representation of t field but entirely misrepresented the s field and deteriorated the quality of the inversion moreover jiménez et al 2015 showed that the consideration of ss heterogeneity in addition to k in the inversion process could improve the fitting of model results to transient data while the structural features were only slightly changed these controversial findings lead to the question whether one should consider ss heterogeneity in inverse groundwater modeling or not and whether the reliability of estimated values is impacted or not thus far only a few published works have tried to address the above issues through numerical studies sun et al 2013 suggested a temporal sampling strategy of pressure head data from ht survey to improve the estimation of heterogeneous t and s fields based on the cross correlation analyses between the pressure head and s values they suggested using early time tm data from drawdown curves when the observed head and s values are most correlated the time tm is approximately equal to the intercept time t0 at which the extrapolated drawdown from the first straight portion of the drawdown log time curve becomes zero based on a well studied laboratory sandbox aquifer initially constructed by illman et al 2010 luo et al 2017 compared model performances of different conceptualizations for tht analyses and investigated the potential benefits of using both k and ss estimates from calibrated geological models as initial distributions for the geostatistics based tht inversion approach they found that geological features were preserved in the estimated k tomograms while the estimated ss tomogram almost remained as smooth as the case without using any geological information the work by luo et al 2017 together with the findings from other studies e g wu et al 2005 liu et al 2007 xiang et al 2009 berg and illman 2011b zha et al 2019 highlighted that it is more difficult to estimate ss heterogeneity than those of k during tht analyses studies have also demonstrated the performances of ht in reconstructing ss or sy distributions through inverting different types of information such as head and self potential data soueid ahmed et al 2016 head and time lapse gravity data tsai et al 2017 which would require additional experimental efforts in one recent tht study conducted at the highly heterogeneous north campus research site ncrs zhao and illman 2018 found that estimated k distributions showed the very heterogeneous double layer aquifer features of a multi aquifer aquitard system but the jointly estimated ss tomograms were quite smooth despite the large number of pressure head data used for model calibrations this is so despite the fact that the ss of aquifers and aquitards typically varies over several orders of magnitude reflecting this highly variable nature of the aquifer aquitard system at the ncrs alexander et al 2011 reported ss estimates ranging up to five orders of magnitude from 2 6 10 8 m to 3 8 10 3 m with a geometric mean of 3 1 10 5 m based on the type curve analysis of a pumping test such different results suggest that ss heterogeneity could have been potentially overlooked during the inversion process and additional efforts may be needed in order to obtain ss estimates at finer resolutions for the geostatistics based tht analysis the main purposes of this study are to systematically investigate the importance of ss heterogeneity for ht and whether ss heterogeneity can be reliably mapped or not in addition to k heterogeneity through tht we first examine the performance of different inverse modeling approaches in a multi layered laboratory sandbox with known stratigraphy following the temporal data sampling strategy suggested by sun et al 2013 to evaluate whether heterogeneous structures of ss could be more clearly mapped then we systematically investigate the reliability of k and ss estimates from various modeling approaches the impacts of different kinds of prior information were evaluated for tht analyses through synthetic experiments which contain composite materials similar to the ncrs site findings from this study should yield further insights for tht implementations in the field 2 laboratory sandbox study 2 1 sandbox settings and experimental data a synthetic 18 layer heterogeneous sandbox aquifer was constructed by illman et al 2010 through cyclically depositing sediments of different sizes under varying water flow and sediment feeding rates to mimic an interfingering deposition of natural fluvial aquifers as shown in fig 1 a the sandbox aquifer is 160 0 cm long 78 0 cm high and 10 2 cm wide at each end of the sandbox a series of 4 inch perforated plate mesh combination was installed to serve as a sand water interface and to provide hydraulic control forty eight fully penetrating horizontal wells along six columns were installed on the back wall of the sandbox which can also be utilized for pumping and injection purposes each well was instrumented with a 0 to 1 psig pounds per square inch gauge setra model 209 pressure transducer to obtain local k values constant head permeameter tests were conducted on core samples extracted at 48 port locations the extracted materials were quite uniform based on visual inspection and showed no obvious layering therefore the anisotropy in k within each layer was neglected table 1 lists the sand types and k estimates for each layer of the sandbox aquifer when multiple ports intersect a given layer a geometric mean of the calculated k values was provided it is important to note that k values can be different for the same sand type due to the impacts of sediment deposition compaction in situ coring and testing for example average k values are different for 20 30 sand layers deposited at various sections of the sandbox aquifer in particular the particle diameter for which 50 of the weight is finer d50 is adopted from craig 2005 for each different sand type provided in table 1 single hole pumping tests were performed in the heterogeneous sandbox aquifer to estimate k and ss values at locations of the 48 ports the tests were conducted by pumping water from each port at a constant rate 1 25 ml s and monitoring the transient head changes at the pumped locations using a pressure transducer for each test data collection was started before pumping to collect the initial hydraulic heads at all monitoring ports a peristaltic pump was then activated and run at a constant flow rate until the development of steady state conditions the entire transient hydrograph was manually matched using vsaft2 yeh et al 1993 by treating the aquifer to be homogeneous the estimated k and ss for different layers are also listed in table 1 if multiple ports are in the same layer then the geometric mean of k or ss is presented 2 2 pumping tests and data selections we utilized 24 cross hole tests conducted at different ports with constant pumping rates that ranged from 2 50 to 3 17 ml s for this study during each test the left right and top faces of the sandbox were hydraulically connected to produce constant head boundaries of 77 5 cm illman et al 2010 meanwhile hydraulic head changes were observed at all 48 ports until steady state conditions for all pumping tests steady state conditions were reached within 20 s since the initiation of pumping the pump was then shut off and hydraulic heads were monitored to full recovery eight pumping tests ports 2 5 14 17 32 35 44 and 47 along two well columns indicated on fig 1a were chosen for model calibration while the other 16 independent pumping tests ports 8 11 13 15 16 18 20 23 26 29 37 38 39 40 41 and 42 were kept for model validation purposes prior to extracting data points from hydrographs pressure head data from observation ports were fitted with a fifth or sixth order polynomial curve luo et al 2017 or denoised using the wavelet toolbox in matlab to remove pressure transducer noise the denoised drawdown curves at selected observation ports are plotted in figs s1 s8 the signal to noise ratios snr were calculated for each drawdown curve using the method provided in xiang et al 2009 to examine the quality of denoised data previously xiang et al 2009 stated that low snr pumping test data could lead to erroneous estimation of the ss field and the denoised data could improve the ss field although not as good as using noise free data they suggested that snr should be larger than 1 in order to provide useful information of drawdown as shown in fig s9 of the supplementary information section snr values of the denoised data are generally larger than 1 except for several data points in the very early time period and or from the observation ports i e ports 1 3 4 and 6 at the upper part of the sandbox for these ports data were selected at time points having snr larger than 1 in studies of the asymptotic analysis approach e g illman and tartakovsky 2006 pressure transients at the intermediate to late time were used to estimate k and ss values previous studies like leven and dietrich 2006 through sensitivity analyses sun et al 2013 and mao et al 2013a through cross correlation analyses yeh et al 2015 through numerical model have also highlighted the importance of using early time data for accurate s or ss estimation therefore data points that cover the early intermediate and late time of aquifer responses were extracted from each drawdown curve unlike the data sampling schemes used in previous studies e g zhu and yeh 2005 liu et al 2007 luo et al 2017 we newly selected three to four data points at and around the time t0 representing the early time response as shown in figs s1 s8 during the early time noticeable drawdown develops and propagates to observation wells which leads to early changes in drawdown log time curves the time t0 was defined as the time at which the extrapolated drawdown from the first straight portion of an observed drawdown log time curve becomes zero sun et al 2013 which were reported to contain the most information about ss heterogeneity in the region between the pumping and observation locations wu et al 2005 mao et al 2013a sun et al 2013 during the intermediate and late times the impact of ss on head change diminishes and groundwater flow reaches steady state conditions pressure head during this time contains more information about k heterogeneity sun et al 2013 thus one to two data points from intermediate and late time were extracted in total 1514 data points were selected from eight pumping tests for model calibration 3 analysis of laboratory sandbox data 3 1 groundwater flow modeling in order to examine the necessity of capturing ss heterogeneity for tht analyses we characterized the k and ss distributions of the sandbox aquifer using four different approaches namely the effective parameter approach the geological modeling approach and the geostatistics based ssht and tht approaches for all groundwater flow models considered the synthetic aquifer was discretized into 741 elements and 1600 nodes with average element dimensions of 4 1 cm 4 1 cm 10 2 cm the left right and top faces of the sandbox were set as constant head boundaries while the bottom front and back faces were set as no flow boundaries 3 1 1 effective parameter modeling approach the sandbox aquifer is first treated as homogeneous and isotropic to estimate the effective k keff and ss sseff values through coupling the forward groundwater flow model mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 with the parameter estimation code pest doherty 2005 the effective parameter model can be used to describe the overall behaviour of the aquifer when being calibrated to multiple pumping tests more importantly this model provides the baseline scenario for model calibration and validation performance comparisons among more sophisticated groundwater flow models furthermore the estimated keff and sseff values can be used as initial guesses of hydraulic parameters to facilitate the calibration of other groundwater flow models 3 1 2 geological modeling approach construction of a geological model is the standard approach in building groundwater flow and transport models typically geological models are built by interpolating stratigraphy information obtained from borehole logs for this study we constructed a geological model utilized for forward and inverse groundwater flow modeling consisting of multiple zones fig 1b based on the layering information shown on the glass fig 1a that is we assume perfect knowledge of stratification for the entire sandbox aquifer which is not available with current field technology unlike the geological models constructed by luo et al 2017 through interpolations of borehole logs of varying accuracy this geological model can be considered as the best case scenario in terms of knowledge of stratification in total k and ss of 18 layers were estimated by coupling mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 with pest doherty 2005 3 1 3 geostatistical inverse modeling approaches ssht and tht in order to characterize the heterogeneous k and ss fields at a resolution higher than the effective and geological modeling approaches we performed geostatistical inverse analyses of eight pumping tests using the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle code xiang et al 2009 tht analysis was performed to simultaneously estimate k and ss values while ssht analysis was used to estimate the k distribution only both analyses were run using the same pumping and observation densities however unlike inverting all 1514 data points for tht analysis only 374 steady state pressure heads were chosen for the ssht analysis the geostatistical inversion approach implemented in simsle treats the natural log values of hydraulic parameters e g ln k and or ln ss of the heterogeneous porous media as stochastic processes with given prior information like the unconditional means variances σ 2 lnk σ2 lnss and correlation scales λx λy and λz simsle creates the initial parameter fields through conditioning on available measurements of hydraulic parameters with cokriging the parameter field is then used to solve the transient or steady state flow equation to obtain simulated pressure heads based on the differences between simulated and observed pressure heads simsle iteratively improves the estimated hydraulic parameter fields until the difference between the two continuous estimated hydraulic parameter fields or the largest difference between simulated and observed heads is smaller than a specified tolerance we assumed that the hydraulic parameter fields can be described by the exponential covariance model the initial values of k and ss were set as keff and sseff respectively while σ2 lnk σ2 lnss 3 0 λx 50 cm λy 10 2 cm and λz 10 0 cm in order to be consistent with a previous investigation zhao et al 2016 3 2 model calibration and validation all calibration runs for groundwater flow models were performed on the same pc with a quad core cpu and 16 gb of random access memory calibrations of the effective parameter and geological models were performed by minimizing an objective function that represents a weighted sum of squared differences between simulated and observed pressure heads model parameters were iteratively optimized by pest based on the derivatives of all observations with respect to all adjustable parameters pest is a versatile and model independent parameter estimation program which could be readily coupled with other types of forward models the levenberg marquardt method implemented in pest was utilized to minimize the objective function the optimization process converged when the lowest four objective function values were within a relative distance of 0 05 defined as 1 φ i φ min φ i 0 05 where фi is the objective function value at the end of the ith optimization iteration фmin is the lowest objective function achieved during i th to i 3 th optimization iteration the lowest objective functions during the calibrations of the effective parameter and geological models were summarized in table s1 the effective parameter model calibration took five optimization iterations 28 pest model calls since only one pair of k and ss was estimated each model call consisted of one forward simulation of eight pumping tests run by mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 and parameter estimation run by pest doherty 2005 with further conceptualizing the sandbox aquifer as a stratigraphy constrained geological model it took 10 optimization iterations 576 pest model calls to converge for 18 pairs of k and ss values on the other hand the geostatistical inversion approach based on simsle does not rely on geological structures it instead uses pixel by pixel correlation relationships between hydraulic parameters e g k or ss and pressure heads at observed locations represented as cross covariance coefficients that evolve dynamically to reflect the incorporation of head data for the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion models we selected inversion results from the iteration step at which the l2 norms have stabilized indicating the convergences of the inversion processes as suggested by xiang et al 2009 to validate the estimated k and ss distributions from all models the 16 pumping tests not used in model calibration efforts were simulated the quality of matches between simulated and observed drawdowns was assessed through scatterplots and the best fit lines and coefficient of determination r2 the mean absolute error l1 and mean square error l2 were also calculated for each pumping test to further evaluate the fits between observed and simulated drawdowns the l2 norm magnifies large discrepancies and allows one to better assess the different models those quantities were computed as 2 l 1 1 n i 1 n χ i χ i 3 l 2 1 n i 1 n χ i χ i 2 where n is the total number of drawdowns i indicates the data number χ i and χ i represent the simulated and measured drawdowns respectively 3 3 results from the laboratory sandbox 3 3 1 k and ss estimates of different modeling approaches the estimated k value of the effective parameter approach is 8 81 10 2 cm s with lower and upper 95 confidence limits of 8 64 10 2 cm s and 9 00 10 2 cm s respectively the estimated ss value is 9 37 10 5 cm with lower and upper 95 confidence limits of 8 95 10 5 cm and 9 81 10 5 cm respectively the effective parameters have previously been determined by taking geometric means of 48 single hole k and ss estimates k 6 0 10 2 cm s and ss 6 1 10 4 cm berg and illman 2011a from calibration of a transient flow model k 9 57 10 2 cm s and ss 6 32 10 5 cm luo et al 2017 and from calibration of steady state flow model k 8 9 10 2 cm s illman et al 2015 our estimated value of k is close to that from illman et al 2015 and ss value is slightly higher than that from luo et al 2017 given the large number of transient data points selected from eight pumping tests especially the increased number of early time data around the time point t0 as defined by sun et al 2013 the k and ss estimates from this study should be sufficient for predicting the averaged spatial trend of observed heads in a heterogeneous aquifer yeh et al 2015 the k and ss distributions estimated from the calibration of the perfect geological model were plotted as figs 2 a and b and corresponding values were listed in table s2 figs 2c and d were the estimated k and ss fields from the tht analysis respectively while the estimated k distribution from the ssht analysis was plotted as fig 2e we also populated the geological model fig 1b with ss values estimated from single hole tests shown as fig 2f for visual comparisons of ss values obtained from different approaches black lines in fig 2 indicate the true layer boundaries delineated in the photograph of the sandbox aquifer fig 1a we see from figs 2a f and table s2 that the estimated k values of the calibrated geological model ranged from a low k value of 9 69 10 3 cm s in layer 6 to a high k value of 4 55 10 1 cm s in layer 1 while the estimated ss values ranged from a low ss value of 6 46 10 6 cm in layer 1 to a high ss value of 2 56 10 4 cm in layer 15 specifically the estimated k values generally increased with increasing grain sizes d50 in table 1 plotted as fig 2g showing a low value range of 1 06 10 2 cm s to 2 46 10 2 cm s for layers 3 10 14 and 17 with fine sands d50 0 151 0 204 mm a middle range of 4 25 10 2 cm s to 1 99 10 1 cm s for layers 2 4 7 8 9 11 and 15 with medium sands d50 0 355 0 578 mm and a high value range of 2 93 10 1 cm s to 4 55 10 1 cm s for layers 1 13 12 and 18 with coarse sands d50 0 750 0 872 mm this is reasonable since that coarse sand is more permeable than the fine sand on the other hand such a trend had not been obviously identified when comparing the estimated ss values in table s2 with grain size parameter d50 in table 1 and comparing fig 2b with fig 2g however clear structural features have been captured for the ss tomogram in fig 2b which had not been previously identified by luo et al 2017 the improved structural distinctions in fig 2b could be attributed to the inclusion of increased number of early time response data points at and around the time t0 into the model calibration procedure for the current study by definition ss is the volume of water released from storage of a unit volume of aquifer due to the expansion of the water and compression of the aquifer skeleton under a unit change in average head which has been mathematically expressed as ss ρg α nβ where ρ is water density m l3 g is acceleration of gravity l t2 n is matrix porosity α and β are compressibility of aquifer skeleton and water lt2 m respectively although the estimated ss values in the calibrated geological model table s2 showed no clear correlation with d50 values of different sands table 1 in our sandbox study we can still see that the estimated ss values for layers with the same sand type generally showed a decreasing trend with increasing depth specifically for sand type 20 30 in layers 1 13 and 18 the estimated ss value is 1 13 10 04 cm for the top layer 18 9 45 10 05 cm for layer 13 in the center and 6 46 10 06 cm for layer 1 at the bottom of the sandbox similar trends were also shown for sand types f 85 in layers 3 and 17 and 20 40 in layers 4 9 and 15 this trend was also evident in single hole test ss values table 1 and fig 2f although ss estimates from single hole tests ss 1 75 10 04 3 38 10 03 cm were nearly one order of magnitude larger than those from the calibrated geological model ss 6 46 10 06 2 56 10 04 cm note that the color scale in fig 2f was changed to better show the distribution pattern of data this decreasing trend of ss with depth can be physically plausible as sands in the upper part of the sandbox were less compressed by overlying materials than deeper sands e g liu et al 2007 brauchler et al 2013 paradis et al 2016 given the fact that uncertainty in the ss estimate is substantial for different characterization approaches rau et al 2018 kuang et al 2020 rigorous derivations of ss values based on measurable physical properties like α n and β from laboratory consolidation tests would certainly provide useful insights to examine our estimates from the interpretation of pumping tests and single hole tests data yet a detailed study of quantifying spatial ss heterogeneity through sampling and laboratory testing has never been performed for both laboratory and field hydraulic tomography analyses this is partly due to the fact that results obtained from disturbed samples were deemed to be questionable in representing in situ conditions e g smith et al 2013 moreover subjecting the miniature samples from this sandbox for consolidation tests was also not possible instead single hole tests were conducted to obtain local estimates of ss by illman et al 2010 therefore we further justify our k and ss tomograms in the following sections through predictions of 16 independent pumping tests not used in model calibration efforts in particular accurate predictions of early to intermediate time drawdowns most sensitive to ss should logically lead to the conclusion that ss estimates are more reliable than when the predictions are poor the estimated k tomograms from tht fig 2c and ssht fig 2e analyses showed distribution patterns similar to fig 2a although the high and low k layer boundaries and connectivities were not as consistent as those of the calibrated geological model when being compared to the black lines compared to the ss tomogram estimated through the calibration of the geological model fig 2b the ss tomogram obtained from tht analysis fig 2d was still smooth and nearly same to the results in luo et al 2017 both showing an obviously low value zone at the bottom of the aquifer results of figs 2b and d suggested that impacts of using an increased number of early time data on revealing ss heterogeneity could be different for different modeling approaches thus using a simple geological model instead of a geostatistical model as a first cut approach is likely to be more favourable in capturing structural features of ss fields if a geological model could be reliably constructed these results suggested that information other than early time response data e g geological and geophysical information local ss data from slug and or single hole tests information on aquifer aquitard compressibility might have to be jointly considered for the geostatistical inversion approach in order to yield improved ss estimates meanwhile when comparing figs 2b and d with fig 2f we found that ss distributions of the calibrated geological model and the tht analysis were quite different from the geological model populated with single hole test ss values 3 3 2 reliability of k and ss estimates for drawdown predictions in order to further evaluate the reliability of estimated k and ss values we systematically compared the drawdown prediction performance of 16 independent pumping tests by six groundwater models using combinations of k and ss fields obtained from different characterization approaches the effective parameter model the geological model populated with single hole test data the calibrated geological model and the geostatistical models these six models were named as 1 case 1a homo using estimated keff and sseff values from the effective parameter modeling approach 2 case 1b ssht ss eff using the high resolution k field from ssht and sseff value from the effective parameter modeling approach 3 case 1c ssht ss sgh using k field from ssht and ss field of the geological model populated with ss values from single hole tests 4 case 1d ssht ss geo using k field from ssht and ss field from the calibrated geological model 5 case 1e geomodel using both k and ss fields from the calibrated geological model and 6 case 1f tht using both k and ss fields from tht by comparing the results of these models we could examine the performance and benefits of conceptualizing the heterogeneous k and ss fields of groundwater models to varying resolutions the simulated versus observed drawdowns at several time points 0 25 0 5 1 2 5 and 15 s from the drawdown curves of 16 pumping tests were selected and shown as fig 3 the linear fit results were also included in each subfigure in particular the simulated drawdown curves for cases 1a 1b 1d and 1f were plotted for all 16 pumping tests at 15 selected observation ports to compare with the observed drawdowns fig 4 and figs s11 s25 in the supplementary information comparing fig 3a with fig 3b the coefficient of determination r2 value increased from 0 83 for case 1a to 0 95 for case 1b from fig 4 we see that the homogeneous model in case 1a poorly predicted the drawdown curves for early intermediate and late time for most of the selected observation ports while using the heterogeneous k field of high resolution in case 1b accurately simulated the late time drawdowns since ss heterogeneities were ignored in both cases these results suggested that k heterogeneity have to be considered in order to accurately predict steady state groundwater flow fields comparisons among figs 3b d revealed that 1 drawdown predictions were improved when treating the ss values as a geologically distributed field fig 3d instead of as a homogeneous field fig 3b and the improvements originated from the more accurate predictions of the transient drawdowns at some observation ports e g ports 13 25 30 37 39 42 as shown in fig 4 and figs s11 s25 2 drawdown predictions were significantly biased in fig 3c for case 1c indicating that ss values estimated through single hole tests should be used with caution for groundwater flow models when conceptualizing the sandbox aquifer as perfect geological and geostatistical models drawdown predictions of both models were satisfactory and similar figs 3e and f although the latter had a slightly higher r2 value and a less scattered fit than the former these findings on one hand revealed that reliable ss estimates can be obtained through the calibration of an accurate geological model if such a model can be obtained and on the other hand suggested that the ss field of the sandbox aquifer was not very heterogeneous 3 3 3 impacts of ignoring ss heterogeneity in tht although the k and ss tomograms of the geostatistical inversion approach had predicted drawdowns of 16 pumping tests most accurately the estimated ss tomogram from tht was smooth fig 2d and the heterogeneity of ss in this laboratory sandbox aquifer was milder in comparison to that of the k based on these results another tht analysis case 2 was performed to investigate whether ss heterogeneity of the synthetic sandbox aquifer could be ignored for the inverse modeling procedure that is the k field was treated as heterogeneous to be estimated by the geostatistical inversion approach implemented in simsle while the ss field was treated to be homogeneous by fixing the value equalling sseff all other initial inputs e g σ 2 lnk λ and data points selected for model calibration were kept the same as in case 1f fig 5 showed the estimated k tomogram for case 2 and validation scatterplots for 16 pumping tests were presented as fig 6 compared to case 1f fig 2c which treated both k and ss fields as spatially heterogeneous fig 5 showed similar distribution patterns of high and low k value zones in the tomogram however some noticeable differences can be found between figs 2c and 5 in terms of geometries of high k value zones around the boundaries of the modeling domain and connectivities of high k zones in the central layers layers 7 9 13 and 15 of the sandbox meanwhile drawdown predictions of 16 pumping tests of case 2 were slightly deteriorated in terms of r2 values revealing a larger scatter when comparing fig 6 with fig 3f through cross correlation analysis wu et al 2005 and others mao et al 2013a sun et al 2013 found that the observed head was only correlated with s or ss within a narrow region between the pumping and observation wells during the early stage of pumping tests while the observed head was correlated with t or k through early intermediate and late times in the cone of depression giving the fact that the number of unknown parameters was far more than the number of observation locations in our sandbox study the necessary conditions mao et al 2013b yeh et al 2015 enabling the inverse problem to be well defined were not met for such ill posed estimation problems of tht the geostatistical inversion scheme implemented in simsle xiang et al 2009 seeks the most likely conditional effective k and ss fields honouring the head measurements at sampling locations the estimated k and ss fields were then iteratively updated by the estimator based on the differences between the simulated and observed heads relying on cross correlation coefficients between the heads and parameters to be estimated in case 2 when ss heterogeneity was intentionally ignored the head differences caused by k and ss heterogeneity were attributed solely to the k field leading to noticeable differences that can be found between figs 2c and 5 tables 2 and 3 summarized the geometric means kg ssg variances σ2 lnk σ2 lnss and correlation lengths λx λz fitted to the exponential model for the resulting k and ss tomograms of the geological model ssht and tht cases generally the values of kg and ssg were very close among different cases and also close to the k 8 81 10 2 cm s and ss 9 37 10 5 cm values estimated by the effective parameter model suggesting that reliable mean values could be obtained by different model approaches for the sandbox on the other hand there were some noticeable differences in the estimated variances and correlation lengths when the same transient dataset was used for inversions the estimated σ2 lnk of the geological model was nearly twice the value of the tht case 1f and the difference between estimated σ2 lnss for both modeling cases was smaller this finding implied that an accurate geological model might be more favourable over the highly parameterized geostatistical model to reveal the interlayer heterogeneity pattern benefiting from the stratigraphy information for the full simulation domain while the latter had to rely solely on the hydraulic response data to reconstruct it however this is based on the premise that an accurate geological model could be obtained when only using the steady state data for model calibration the ssht case obtained kg σ2 lnk λx and λz values that were similar to the geological modeling approach while the estimated σ2 lnk was twice the value of the tht case 1f table 2 the large differences in σ2 lnk values of ssht and tht case 1f could be attributed to the fact that the former captured more low k zones than the latter this result suggested that ssht analyses might be a better choice to estimate k tomograms when steady state pumping test data are available since the number of unknowns to be inversely estimated by ssht is only half of that of the tht case when incorrectly treating the heterogeneous ss field to be homogeneous the σ2 lnk of the estimated k field for tht case 2 was higher than that of the tht case 1f table 2 confirming our computational analysis that the head differences caused by k and ss heterogeneity were solely reflected in the k field the influence of ss heterogeneity on model calibrations and validations were quantitatively evaluated through comparing average l1 and l2 values obtained for different pumping tests l1 and l2 values of model calibrations were summarized in fig s10 presented in the supplementary information for the effective parameter model case 1a homo the perfect geological model case 1e geomodel and the geostatistics based inversion models case 1f tht case 2 tht with fixed ss 9 37 10 5 cm note that l1 and l2 values of the ssht analysis case are not listed since it used a different number of pressure head data for model calibration i e only steady state we also calculated the l1 and l2 norms for the drawdown predictions of each of the 16 pumping tests in cases 1a 1f and case 2 based on fig s10 and fig 7 we can see that influences of the ss heterogeneity on pressure head simulations are noticeable in our sandbox study for model calibration results in fig s10 comparing case 2 to case 1f average l1 and l2 values increase by 24 4 and by 92 9 respectively for model validation results in the fig 7 comparing case 2 to case 1f average l1 and l2 values increase by 19 8 and by 41 8 respectively the large differences in l1 and l2 values for model calibration can be attributed to our data sampling strategy in which more early time data are used than data from the intermediate and late time examinations of l1 and l2 norms in fig 7 of observed versus simulated drawdowns for each of the 16 pumping tests showed that 1 case 1d performed the best and case 1f based on tht came a close second 2 case 2 performed worse than cases 1d and 1f which treated both k and ss as heterogeneous in terms of l1 and l2 norm ranks 3 case 2 performed even worse than case 1b which used k field from ssht and sseff value from the effective parameter modeling approach these results collectively suggested that it is important to consider ss heterogeneity for groundwater flow models when transient drawdown data are inverted to recover the subsurface heterogeneity even for a mildly heterogeneous aquifer otherwise utilizing steady state data based on ssht analysis instead of ignoring ss heterogeneity for tht analysis could estimate k distribution more reasonably and quickly as well as predicting pumping tests more accurately comparing results of case 1b to case 1d and case 1f to case 2 in fig 7 we can see that considering the ss heterogeneity for the sandbox aquifer model generally leads to improved model validation performances when the k field from ssht was used treating ss values as a geologically distributed field instead of using an uniform sseff value yielded decreases in average l1 and l2 values by 15 8 and 30 4 respectively for tht inversion cases after considering ss heterogeneity the average l1 and l2 values for 16 pumping tests decreased by 16 5 and 29 5 respectively we should also note that l1 and l2 values for some tests e g port 8 port 16 increased slightly when comparing case 1d to case 1b suggesting the need for further improvement of the heterogeneous ss field fig 2b overall our laboratory sandbox study indicated that ss heterogeneity should be considered in addition to k for the tht analysis even when the estimated ss field is smooth however for a mildly heterogeneous aquifer ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of ss would not significantly bias the drawdown predictions when the k field estimated from ssht is used for groundwater flow modeling purposes as clearly shown in figs 3 4 and 7 4 synthetic experiments 4 1 experimental design in the previous sections the true fields of k and ss of the sandbox aquifer were unknown and it is not possible to directly evaluate the accuracy of k and ss estimates from different approaches additionally the sandbox in fig 1 was built with sand of various sizes lacking of less permeable clay layers which were frequently encountered during field investigations therefore a synthetic numerical model which contained both high and low permeable materials was constructed to systematically investigate the issue of obtaining ss estimates at finer resolutions for geostatistics based tht analyses the synthetic aquifer had a groundwater flow model setting identical to the sandbox aquifer as described in the section 2 except that sand types k and ss values for each of 18 layers were assumed to be known and the degree of heterogeneity to be much higher than the actual sandbox the k values for the synthetic aquifer as shown in fig 8 a were generated through 1 constructing a layered mean ln k field using values listed in the table s3 2 generating a set of normally distributed random numbers with a mean of zero and a variance of 0 10 representing variations of ln k and 3 variations of ln k were added to the mean ln k field and then back transformed yielding a k field with both interlayer and intralayer variability the ss field was created following the same procedure and plotted as fig 9 a the mean values of ln k and ln ss listed in table s3 were based on k estimates for sediments typical at the ncrs site on the university of waterloo campus from alexander et al 2011 and on ranges of ss values suggested for porous media in batu 1998 through this approach we built a synthetic numerical aquifer with geological information as in the laboratory sandbox constructed by illman et al 2010 while the hydraulic parameters for each of 18 layers similar to the values estimated for the highly heterogeneous ncrs berg and illman 2011b after generating the true fields for k and ss pumping tests were simulated at eight ports ports 2 5 14 17 32 35 44 and 47 with a constant withdrawal rate of 10 ml min for 200 min to ensure that steady state conditions were reached during each pumping test head data were collected at the other 47 observation ports not used for pumping these pumping and observation locations were the same as fig 1a five data points were extracted from each drawdown curve for model calibration and the same data sampling strategy as described in section 2 2 was utilized in total 1880 data points were selected from eight pumping tests to calibrate the effective parameter model the geological model and the geostatistical inversion model the effective parameter model was calibrated to yield effective hydraulic parameters keff and sseff that were used as the initial guesses of hydraulic parameters for other models for the geostatistical inversion model the other prior information σ 2 lnk σ2 lnss λx λy and λz were assumed to be the same as those values given in the section 3 1 3 to meet our study objectives five inverse modeling scenarios cases 3a 3b 3c 3d and 3e were designed and their performances in recovering the true k and ss fields were compared in case 3a we assumed that the stratification of the geological model was perfectly known for the entire simulation domain in case 3b the geostatistical inversion started with homogeneous mean fields of keff and sseff in case 3c the estimated k values from model calibration of case 3a and the sseff values from case 3b were used as initial parameter fields in case 3d the estimated ss values from model calibration of case 3a and the keff values from case 3b were used as the initial parameter fields in case 3e both k and ss values from case 3a were used as the initial mean fields the usefulness of initial k and or ss distributions for geostatistical inversion approach can be evaluated through comparing results from cases 3b 3c 3d and 3e 4 2 results of the synthetic experiments to facilitate visual comparisons k and ss estimates for cases 3a 3b 3c 3d and 3e were plotted in figs 8b f and 9b f respectively meanwhile the estimated hydraulic parameters were quantitatively compared to true fields in figs 10 a e and 11 a e respectively comparing fig 8b with fig 8a the calibrated geological model of case 3a revealed the heterogeneity pattern of k quite accurately which could be attributed to the facts that accurate knowledge of stratigraphy information was assumed to be available and a large amount of pumping test data were used for model calibration the linear fitting results in fig 10a also showed that r2 reached 0 95 suggesting a very good match of estimated k with the true values on the other hand the estimated ss field in fig 9b captured the main heterogeneity pattern in fig 9a while losing details in the two high ss value zones near the upper boundary and overestimating the low value areas fig 11a these results emphasize that ss heterogeneity is more difficult to be accurately estimated than k wu et al 2005 liu et al 2007 zha et al 2019 for the geostatistical inversion case 3b we see that fig 8c showed the five low k zones located in the central part with some details missing from areas around the left and right boundaries the estimated ss tomogram in fig 9c showed the featured high value zones in fig 9a however the low values were also overestimated in fig 9c for case 3c after using k values of the calibrated geological model fig 8b as the initial mean k field for the geostatistical inversion approach the estimated k tomogram in fig 8d showed significant improvements over fig 8c of the case 3b however the estimated ss field of the case 3c showed less details than figs 9b case 3a and c case 3b with worse results in terms of the linear model fit in fig 11c than those in figs 11a and b when using ss values in fig 9b as the initial mean ss field for case 3d the geostatistical inversion approach yielded the best ss estimates among cases 3a 3b 3c and 3d with a higher r2 value of 0 54 in fig 11d than those in figs 11a r2 0 39 b r2 0 33 and c r2 0 22 however the k estimates of case 3c fig 10d were generally the same as those of case 3b fig 10b for case 3e both k and ss fields figs 8f and 9f were improved compared to those of case 3b with increased r2 values and lowered l1 and l2 norms when comparing figs 10e and 11e to figs 10b and 11b these results suggested that using only k or ss values from the calibrated geological model as the initial mean field for the geostatistical inversion approach did not necessarily benefit the accurate estimation of the other parameter ss or k field the summarized statistical parameters of the true case and cases 3a 3e tables s4 and s5 also suggested similar findings that 1 geometric means of ss fields were generally overestimated in cases 3a 3e 2 using geologically distributed k or ss values for the geostatistical inversion approach was helpful for the estimation of corresponding k or ss tomograms therefore in order to capture both interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of k and ss values for the tht analysis reliable prior information have to be included 5 summary and conclusions in this study we investigated whether the spatial heterogeneity of ss should be considered during the interpretation of transient hydraulic tomography tht data to reliably characterize the heterogeneity of a laboratory sandbox aquifer we selected three modeling approaches of different complexities and parameterization schemes to map the k and ss heterogeneity of the laboratory sandbox aquifer at varying resolutions including 1 the effective parameter model 2 the perfect geological model and 3 the geostatistics based inversion models in addition we examined the value of geologically distributed k and ss values for the tht analysis by using them as prior distributions for the geostatistical inversion approach with a synthetic case study our work resulted in the following major findings and conclusions 1 the estimated k values from the calibration of the perfect geological model corresponded well with the grain size information of the laboratory sandbox aquifer when the inversion started with homogeneous parameter estimates the geostatistics based tht and ssht analyses yielded k tomograms with high and low k zones that resembled the geological model but lacked in consistency in terms of layer boundaries on the other hand with the inclusion of increased number of early time response data at and around the time t0 as suggested by sun et al 2013 into the calibration procedure the geological model revealed clearer structural features for the ss field of the laboratory aquifer while the ss tomogram obtained from tht analysis was still smooth and revealed no distinctive geological features therefore to reconstruct the ss field more reliably the combined use of both geological information and pumping tests data seems more favourable for tht analyses 2 the effective parameter approach that treats both k and ss fields as homogeneous poorly predicted the drawdown curves at early intermediate and late times for 16 independent pumping tests used for model validation when the high resolution k field estimated from ssht was used for the groundwater flow model ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of ss could still predict late time drawdowns accurately further conceptualizing the ss values as a geologically distributed field obtained from model calibration was reliable and led to improved drawdown predictions at sites with complex geological structures groundwater models based on the composite media concept winter and tartakovsky 2000 clark et al 2020 or the general statistical framework suggested by zha et al 2017 that account for both boundary geometry variability and intralayer heterogeneity should be more routinely adopted for estimating both k and ss fields ss values estimated from single hole tests should be used with caution in groundwater flow models since they could lead to significantly biased drawdown predictions 3 although ss heterogeneity in this laboratory sandbox aquifer was milder in comparison to that of k and the estimated ss tomogram from tht was found to be smooth ss heterogeneity should still be considered in order to accurately estimate k values from the inverse analysis of transient pumping test data this agrees with the conclusions by castagna et al 2011 the variance of ss field for the sandbox is smaller σ2 lnss 0 6 0 8 than that of the synthetic experiment σ2 lnss 3 3 while in the former we evaluated the reliability of ss estimates through validation pumping tests and in the latter we directly compared the estimates to the true ss values results from both experiments suggested that ss may be reliably estimated or recovered through model calibration efforts if proper parameterization schemes and modeling approaches were used 4 finally we conclude that the inclusion of reliable geological information of k and ss are helpful for tht analyses to better characterize the inherent heterogeneous hydraulic parameter fields at fine resolutions meanwhile in order to map the ss field reliably it is important to use sufficient non redundant information regarding aquifer heterogeneity and a reasonable data sampling strategy for tht analyses sun et al 2013 wen et al 2020 in this regard methods involving analyses of slug test data sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves etc may be jointly used for future research to provide valuable in situ estimates of ss kuang et al 2020 furthermore we believe the results of this sandbox study could help to guide the interpretation of tht under field conditions in order to help map both k and ss distributions more accurately credit authorship contribution statement zhanfeng zhao conceptualization

4943,changes in the hydrologic cycle have far reaching impacts on agricultural productivity water resources availability riverine ecosystems and our ability to manage environmental assets bushfire risk and flood hazard for example declining rainfall in the southeast of australia has led to a prolonged period of drought with serious impacts on agriculture the environment and water supply to urban and rural towns here using the continental wide australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l we evaluate historical trends from 1960 to 2017 in rainfall soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff to explain changing drought and flooding northern parts of australia have experienced increasing annual rainfall totals resulting in increased water availability in the tropics with increased soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff particularly during the hot wet monsoon season in contrast the southwest and southeast coast of australia have experienced declines in rainfall particularly in the colder months corresponding with decreasing evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff trends in flooding are aligned with runoff trends and closely follow trends in rainfall with changes in soil moisture of secondary influence streamflow droughts measured by the standardised runoff index are increasing across large parts of australia with these increases more widespread than changes in rainfall alone increases in rainfall in the tropics of northern australia appear to be related to decreasing drought occurrence and extent but this trend is not universal suggesting changes in rainfall alone are not an indicator of changing drought conditions keywords rainfall runoff soil moisture drought flood climate change 1 introduction 1 1 changes in the global hydrological cycle one of the most important questions in hydrology is how the hydrologic cycle is being impacted by climate change huntington 2006 koutsoyiannis 2020 water in the landscape and rivers is essential for agriculture town and industrial water supply the environment cultural values recreation hydropower and more hence changes to when and where water is available has far reaching impacts in terms of hydrologic extremes flood and droughts are among the costliest natural disasters in the world causing risk to life food security and in the case of drought increased bushfire risk globally precipitation has increased as per energy constraints allan et al 2020 allen and ingram 2002 at approximately 2 4 mm decade becker et al 2013 hartmann et al 2013 in line with climate model projections of a 2 increase in precipitation per degree increase in global mean temperature kharin et al 2013 most of the increases in precipitation have occurred over tropical areas with decreases elsewhere beck et al 2019 while precipitation extremes such as annual maxima of daily rainfall have increased universally at a rate close to 7 per degree increase in global mean temperature sun et al 2020 westra et al 2013 there is evidence that consistent with changes in rainfall soil moisture has experienced wetting trends in the tropics and drying trends in the extra tropics feng and zhang 2015 liu et al 2019 but trends differ depending on the data set used albergel et al 2013 compared to changes in annual average conditions changes in hydrological extremes are more challenging to quantify and understand increasing temperatures have increased the likelihood of drought conditions in many regions of the world hartmann et al 2013 liu et al 2019 though again results differ depending on the index used asadi zarch et al 2015 despite many studies pointing to increases in extreme precipitation donat et al 2013 groisman et al 2005 martinez villalobos and neelin 2018 sun et al 2020 westra et al 2013 there is a very mixed trend in flood response sharma et al 2018 with more sites globally showing decreases in flooding than increases do et al 2017 despite this variability trends in high flows follow average annual flow trends both globally gudmundsson et al 2019 and across australia zhang et al 2016 in regions free of snow melt it has been postulated that changes in flooding are due to changing antecedent soil moisture conditions ivancic and shaw 2015 sharma et al 2018 wasko et al 2019 however few studies have studied trends in antecedent conditions explicitly tramblay et al 2019 wasko and nathan 2019a 1 2 hydrological trends in australia australia forms a valuable test case for investigating the impacts of climate change on the hydrologic cycle it straddles the tropics and extratropics experiencing a wide range of climates and is largely free of snowmelt in addition trends in australian precipitation and temperature reflect global patterns alexander et al 2007 although streamflow exhibits extremely high variability compared to the rest of the world chiew and mcmahon 2002 mcmahon et al 2007 peel et al 2004 mean annual rainfall has increased in the tropical north of australia and decreased in the south dey et al 2019 particularly along the south east and south west coasts due to changed cutoffs and frontal systems risbey et al 2013 consistent with a tropical expansion grise et al 2018 staten et al 2018 for example south western australia has undergone decreased cool season rainfall in april to october with sharp decreases in may july rainfall since 1970 there has been a similar decline of rainfall over south eastern australia in april to october rainfall since the late 1990s meanwhile in northern australia there has been an observed rainfall increase since the 1970s especially in the northwest csiro bom 2018 since the 1950s increasing streamflow in the northern tropics and decreasing streamflow over southern australia has been observed zhang et al 2016 across australia studies of trends in evapotranspiration show mixed trends temporally and spatially prior to 1999 decreasing trends in observed pan evaporation across australia were linked to declining wind speeds johnson and sharma 2010 but since then many sites have shown increased pan evaporation possibly due to an increased vapor pressure deficit stephens et al 2018 despite increases in global estimates of terrestrial evapotranspiration zeng et al 2018 evapotranspiration estimates derived from remote sensing and flux towers show a decrease in evapotranspiration between 1998 and 2008 attributed to moisture limitations jung et al 2010 there is a large discrepancy in trends calculated between different soil moisture products but in general datasets point to more severe droughts in arid and semi arid regions liu et al 2019 using data obtained from the european space agency soil moisture was found to be decreasing across australia between 1979 and 2013 with the exception of the tropical north feng and zhang 2015 however another study for 1988 2010 using multiple reanalysis and satellite derived data sets indicated largely conflicting results between data sets particularly at the regional scale albergel et al 2013 this may be because reanalysis data sets particularly era interim have large rainfall biases andersson et al 2015 weedon et al 2014 while remote sensed data sets measure soil moisture at different depths holgate et al 2016 the magnitude of extreme hourly and daily rainfall across a range of exceedance thresholds has increased over the last half a century across australia alexander and arblaster 2017 guerreiro et al 2018 with shifts to a greater frequency of longer duration events in the tropics and shorter duration events in extra tropics dey et al 2020 despite more evidence for increasing rainfall extremes compared to decreases more streamflow gauging sites show decreases in annual maxima than increases ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 decreased flooding has been attributed to decreased antecedent soil moisture prior to the onset of the storm events across southern parts of australia wasko and nathan 2019a a better understanding of the drivers of changes on streamflow and flooding that is rainfall evapotranspiration and soil moisture and how they interact is required to better predict the likely impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle and subsequently economic activity the environment communities and ecosystems berghuijs et al 2019 2 research gap in understanding drivers of concurrent hydrological trends due to the greater number of rainfall gauging stations and observations compared to streamflow studies often infer impacts to flooding from changes in rainfall however this approach may lead to apparent contradictions such as increasing rainfall extremes which are not associated with increased flooding sharma et al 2018 few studies examine hydroclimatic variables in unison exceptions include johnson et al 2016 wasko et al 2020 wasko and nathan 2019a and of those that do most focus on instrumented catchments and the millennium drought 2001 2009 in the south east of australia fowler et al 2016 king et al 2020 kirono et al 2017 potter et al 2010 saft et al 2016 2015 van dijk et al 2013 as such a holistic understanding of concurrent changes in hydroclimatic variables across australia does not currently exist here we use a high resolution continental water balance model to study trends in simulated streamflow across the australian continent along with drought and high flow flood indices according to their key drivers rainfall evapotranspiration and soil moisture we test the model s ability to reproduce hydrological trends then use the model as a tool to quantify historical trends across the water balance 3 methodology the approach used for this study is as follows 1 the australian water resource assessment landscape model awra l model is assessed in terms of simulated runoff reproduction of streamflow trends at a set of high quality catchments with catchment trend assessment grouped according to climatologically similar regions 2 spatial trends in simulated runoff aggregated to streamflow are compared to trends in rainfall potential evaporation pet actual evapotranspiration aet and soil moisture 3 trends in catchment scale runoff extremes drought and flood indices are compared to trends in related hydrologic and climate indices i e mean rainfall and soil moisture trends and trends in extreme rainfall 3 1 awra l model awra l is a daily gridded one dimensional semi distributed continental scale landscape water balance model developed by the csiro and the australian bureau of meteorology bom frost et al 2018 van dijk 2010 viney et al 2015 for water resource assessment and monitoring it is currently run operationally to provide near real time hydrological data at a resolution of 0 05 0 05 approximately 5 km 5 km from 1911 to the present across australia see www bom gov au water landscape fig 1 presents the climate inputs hydrological outputs and simulated processes in awra l the model forcing inputs are daily solar radiation minimum and maximum temperature 2 m wind speed and precipitation other static inputs describe the spatial variability of soil and geological properties and land use in its operational use awra l uses daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures obtained from the australian water availability product awap jones et al 2009 remotely sensed solar radiation grant et al 2008 and an interpolated field of station based observations of wind speed mcvicar et al 2008 daily varying climatologies of solar radiation and wind speed are used prior to 1990 and 1975 respectively prior to the relevant observational datasets becoming available the key hydrologic processes modelled include 1 portioning of rainfall between interception and water contributing to the water balance 2 infiltration or saturation excess surface runoff dependent on groundwater saturation 3 interflow drainage and evaporation from the soil layers and 4 baseflow and evapotranspiration from the groundwater store potential evaporation is modelled using the penman equation penman 1948 which uses wind and temperature as inputs along with solar radiation to calculate the terrestrial energy balance following donohue et al 2010 the soil is modelled in three layers 0 0 1 m 0 1 1 m and 1 6 m depth with differing model parameters between layers shallow rooted vegetation has access to soil moisture in the upper two layers while deep rooted vegetation also has access to the bottom most layer key output fluxes are runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the three soil layers and deep drainage to the groundwater store similar to other semi distributed models the total runoff from a grid cell is a summation of the surface and subsurface runoff fluxes awra l contains 49 parameters of which 28 are fixed according to previous parameter sensitivity experiments and prior knowledge and 21 are optimised to maximise an objective function that considers performance against observed streamflow covering the period 1981 2011 remotely sensed evapotranspiration and remotely sensed surface soil moisture at a set of 295 unimpaired catchments zhang et al 2011 the reader is referred to viney et al 2015 and frost et al 2018 for further details verification is undertaken firstly to the calibration data at independent sites streamflow and remotely sensed estimates of catchment average soil moisture and evapotranspiration over a separate set of 291 unimpaired catchments along with in situ measurements of soil moisture flux tower estimates of evapotranspiration and estimates of groundwater recharge nationally see frost and wright 2018a frost and wright 2018b awra l performs well compared to other available continental scale models for streamflow predominantly due to streamflow data being used in calibration and similarly to locally calibrated nearest neighbour regionalised conceptual rainfall runoff models giving confidence that awra l can be considered a fit for purpose continental scale hydrological model for water resource and agricultural applications similarly awra l compares well to continental scale models when assessed against in situ root zone 0 90 cm soil moisture observations and shows comparable if not better correlation to in situ and remotely sensed data holgate et al 2016 with soil moisture variability representative of catchment dynamics peterson et al 2020 awra l shows comparable performance over other continental scale models for evapotranspiration but currently shows slightly poorer performance according to annual correlation of deep drainage frost and wright 2018a 2018b as a result of this performance across the water balance awra l forms an integral part of the australian bureau of meteorology s national water accounting water monitoring elmahdi et al 2016 hafeez et al 2015 and estimation of antecedent conditions for event based flood forecasting it has been used in retrospective studies for national flood design guidelines ball et al 2019 to understand the impact of changes in soil moisture on flood magnitude wasko and nathan 2019a and flood timing wasko et al 2020 and for the identification of flash drought using the evaporative stress index nguyen et al 2019 3 2 analysis 3 2 1 regional grouping broadly australia s climate varies from tropical in the north to temperate in the south with an arid climate inland the north generally receives monsoon driven rainfall in warmer months november to april with little to no rainfall in the colder months may to october with rainfall becoming more seasonally uniform moving south the exception is the south east which experiences a dry austral summer and wet colder months a small mountain range that runs along the east coast of australia demarcates regions with less rainfall inland and more rainfall towards the coast recognising these differences in climate we regionally aggregate and discuss results based on clusters of natural resource management nrm regions for consistency with the other work in australia csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 the nrm regions are defined by catchments and bioregions of similar climatic conditions fig 2 we note that the murray basin region presented here forms the lower part of the larger murray darling basin one of the most significant agricultural regions in australia 3 2 2 evaluation of simulated streamflow trends although awra l has been extensively validated the ability of awra l to capture observed hydrological trends has not been previously tested observed historical trends in potential evapotranspiration pet actual evapotranspiration aet and soil moisture sm are traditionally inconsistent and data source dependent see section 1 2 for this reason and because streamflow is an integration of the above fluxes and stores we focus on evaluating trends in catchment aggregated awra l runoff representing streamflow it is reasonable to assume that the unrouted simulated runoff can be aggregated to represent streamflow in smaller catchments where streambed losses are smaller and routing impacts less simulated trends in catchment aggregated awra l runoff are evaluated against trends in observed monthly streamflow at a set of high quality observational hydrologic reference stations zhang et al 2016 these stations represent relatively unaltered catchments low urbanisation irrigation forestry effects in total 160 stations of varying length are used most stations have recordings beginning in the 1970s with the longest length of record 37 years shortest 19 years and a median record length of 35 years station locations are presented in fig 2 with the reader referred to zhang et al 2016 for further details of this data set 3 2 3 trends in simulated hydroclimatic variables and indicators of flood and drought trends in observed streamflow rainfall awap and simulated pet aet soil moisture and runoff are calculated as the slope of a linear regression of the seasonal or annual means of the respective variable results focus on the period 1960 2017 coinciding with the increase in temperature identified post 1960 due to anthropogenic climate change fawcett et al 2012 here we analyse root zone soil moisture 0 100 cm soil depth as it is most correlated with catchment flood response hill et al 2016 hill and thomson 2019 modulating streamflow at various levels of event severity wasko et al 2020 wasko and nathan 2019a trends in high flood and low drought flow indicators were also examined and compared to trends in rainfall and evapotranspiration and runoff here we use the 90th percentile q90 of annual daily flow and 5 day 5 day annual maxima for high flows floods the standardised runoff index sri is used to characterise drought shukla and wood 2008 the sri is defined by fitting a probability distribution to the runoff time series in this case either gamma log normal or normal based on the best fit and converting the fitted cumulative distribution to a standard normal deviate here the sri 12 based on a 12 month calendar year aggregate is used the definitions or classifications of drought mckee et al 1993 according to sri 12 are presented in table 1 as an indicator of drought extent for each nrm region the trend in the proportion of grid cells experiencing drought as defined by the sri 12 categories presented in table 1 is also calculated 4 results the results are presented as follows first awra l streamflow trends are evaluated against observed trends next the continental scale trends in seasonal and annual means of awap observed rainfall and simulated pet aet soil moisture and runoff are presented trends in indicators of flood drought are also evaluated finally results are regionally aggregated across nrm regions trends are presented as scatter plots between variables to understand how trends interact at catchment scale whether there are differences in the interaction regionally and how these interactions compare to interactions at the continental scale 4 1 catchment streamflow trend verification the observed streamflow trend underlain by simulated awra l runoff for 1960 to 2017 is presented in fig 3 circles with white outline indicate that the direction of observed and modelled trends matches whereas black circles indicate the direction of trends does not match although awra l runoff on a grid cell basis is not directly comparable to streamflow which is a catchment outflow regional coherence of observed and modelled trends is promising on an annual basis awra l runoff and observed streamflow in the south west and south east of the continent show strong decreasing trends in the central north of the continent there are increasing trends both in observations and simulations but simulations of the north east coast display some divergence from observations there appears to be localised decreases in observed streamflow along the north east coast and at the very far south west tip of the continent which are not captured by awra l in the north of the continent rainfall and streamflow is warm month dominant djf the local variations in streamflow appear to be better captured in the north east of the country which is promising as these are the months of largest trend in the south of the country where the trends are now small there is localised increasing runoff modelled matching the observed trends for some locations in the south of the continent rainfall and streamflow is winter jja dominant and the strong decreasing trends are simulated well for tasmania the island off the south east coast of australia the strong gradient in observed trends between the east and west coast is captured although being slightly displaced for the northern winter jja there is little trend and the modelled runoff likewise shows little trend the general small but decreasing trend for winter runoff along the east coast moving north is captured seasonal and annual linear trends in simulated awra l aggregated runoff streamflow are compared with observed streamflow on a catchment by catchment basis in fig 4 for each catchment the modelled streamflow is a summation of the runoff for all the grid cells within the catchment section 3 2 2 performance is compared on the basis of the nrm regions presented in fig 2 noting that we assume the catchments are representative of the climatic conditions in that region the coefficient of determination r2 and the hit rates annually and for each season are presented in table 2 the hit rate corresponds to when the direction is correctly modelled that is the observed and simulated trends are both in the top right positive positive or bottom left negative negative quadrants in fig 4 simulated annual flow direction trend matches that observed at 122 of the 160 76 sites with an overall coefficient of determination of 0 38 table 2 in particular the direction of simulated trend matches the observed for all sites in the murray basin and good correspondence is found for the southern slopes with 76 of the sites matching in simulated and modeled trend direction for the monsoonal north despite 82 sites matching in trend direction the coefficient of determination is low due to a large scatter in the observed and modelled trends fig 4 the overall annual results can mask the results for the dominant streamflow season table 1 for summer djf the r2 between trends is 0 06 and 0 54 for the monsoonal north and wet tropics respectively however 11 of 11 sites 100 in the monsoonal north and 14 out of 17 sites 82 in the wet tropics model the observed trend direction suggesting better correspondence in the summer wet months than when streamflow is aggregated for the year good correspondence is observed for the east coast and central slopes in the winter jja where awra l simulates the observed trend direction at 35 of 36 sites similarly for the murray basin all sites have the correct modelled trend direction in the winter the dominant streamflow season in comparison in the summer where there is the least flow 41 out of 53 murray basin sites correctly model the observed trend direction 77 streamflow is winter dominant in the southern slopes here 28 out of 33 85 sites model the correct trend direction with an r2 of 0 59 at the catchment scale the southern and south western flatlands exhibit the lowest skill with the correct direction modelled at only 4 out of the 9 sites in the winter possibly due to very differing local geology overall the modelled and observed trends compare well fig 3 at a majority of observational sites streamflow trends are reproduced by awra l giving confidence in using simulated water balance variables to support our interpretations of the observed trends the direction of the streamflow trend is well reproduced particularly for the dominant streamflow season but the magnitude of the trend is not necessarily represented well in parts of the tropics best correspondence is found in the south east of the country murray basin and southern slopes regions evaluation was also performed for the 90th percentile of streamflow with results largely similar to those presented here 4 2 continental scale trends in hydroclimatological variables having established the verification of awra l trends in the simulated hydrologic variables are now evaluated fig 5 presents the trend in observed rainfall derived from the gridded interpolated climate observations as well as simulated potential and actual evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff for the period 1960 to 2017 two key points are noticeable for the annual rainfall trends a positive trend for the summer dominated tropical monsoonal north and a negative trend for the autumn winter frontal system dominated south tropical rainfall in northern australia is summer djf dominant and has been increasing over the last half a century with little rain occurring in the winter jja in these areas the trend observed in winter is negligible and the annual trend is dominated by changes in summer rainfall in general summer rainfall has been increasing across australia but this trend is less clear in the east for example isolated coastal areas on the east coast exhibit decreases in summer rainfall the annual trend in rainfall for the south west is strongly influenced by decreasing winter rainfall in the south east of australia a similar trend is observed there is a decline in winter rainfall though the largest observed decrease is for autumn rainfall resulting in decreased mean annual rainfalls although trends are presented for all of australia we note that the rainfall gauging network in the arid center of australia is limited with high uncertainty in these areas hence the interpretation of results is limited to coastal more populous and streamflow producing regions notionally trends in pet could be expected to be proportional to changes in temperature or inversely proportional to rainfall due to increased cloud cover but as discussed in the introduction there are many confounding factors and interdependencies affecting pet trends fig 5 presents for the period 1960 2017 decreases in pet across the western half of australia in summer and increases across the eastern half of australia there is a slight decrease in pet for the winter months in southern australia and an increase in pet in northern australia but overall the annual trend from east to west appears dominated by the trend in summer pet there is little evidence for a spatial correlation of these trends with changes in rainfall or the increase in temperature observed across australia over the past half a century however it should be noted that the driving radiation and wind variables for the pet simulated here are based on climatologies pre 1990 and 1975 respectively the modelled aet displays very similar trends to the rainfall confirming that with the exception of some coastal areas primarily the south east cost evapotranspiration across most of australia is water and not energy limited in the summer months there is an increase in evapotranspiration across the tropical north with decreases elsewhere in the winter there is a strong spatially coherent signal in the evapotranspiration with decreases in the south west corresponding to decreases in availability of moisture due to declines in rainfall the result is an annual trend in aet and rainfall of similar magnitude between 10 and 50 mm decade in the central northern tropics with decreases of a similar magnitude in the south west of australia for consistency the units of the soil moisture trends are the same as soil moisture trends are presented for the top 1 m of soil the magnitude of the trend may be less despite its large modulating effect on flood response wasko and nathan 2019a soil moisture tends towards wetting in the summer in the north and west of australia with a drying trend only present in the south west and south east in the winter there is almost universal drying across the south of australia resulting in an annual trend pattern similar to rainfall and aet trends there are increases in soil moisture in the north of australia and decreases in the south consistent with trends in rainfall and water availability however arguably the changes in soil moisture are more spatially consistent an indicator of the longer residence time of water in the soil for example the drying trend across the east coast in soil moisture is much more extensive compared to the aet trend comprised of a mixture of increasing and decreasing trends the observed changes trends in rainfall and soil moisture translate to large changes in runoff across australia in the central tropics there is an increase in runoff in the summer of over 50 mm decade while along the south east coast there is a small drying trend of approximately 5 10 mm decade in winter the south east and south west coasts exhibit large decreasing trends in the order of 20 mm decade in the north winter is the dry season and there are no significant trends the high spatial resolution of awra l results in regional differences being modelled for example for tasmania the island off the south east coast of australia a decreasing trend is modelled on the east coast and increasing trend on the west coast commensurate with the orographic divide that runs north south similarly across the south east coast of australia greater decreasing trends in runoff are observed on the coastal side of the dividing mountain range that runs along the east coast there is little trend in runoff elsewhere with most trends in runoff across australia contained to the coastal areas of higher rainfall 4 3 trends in high flow indices the continental pattern across australia for the 90th percentile q90 of daily runoff on an annual basis and the 5 day maxima from 1960 to 2017 are presented in fig 6 the trends in the 90th percentile runoff top row reflect the mean runoff trends presented in fig 5 suggesting a uniform directional shift in the flow distribution similar to global studies gudmundsson et al 2019 there are decreases for q90 in the summer months djf for the tropical north and parts of the south east coast although rainfall and runoff are summer dominant along the north east coast the trends are mixed and there is little trend elsewhere due to low summer rainfall for winter months jja there are large reductions in q90 across the southern coast of australia with little trend elsewhere coinciding with the lack of rainfall and runoff across the northern parts of australia in the winter on a continental scale the annual trend reflects the summation of the seasonal patterns the 5 day annual maxima bottom row is more extreme than the 90th percentile and hence the trends exhibit greater variability than the trends for q90 compared to the trend in q90 there are now more increases in the extreme runoff on the south east coast reflecting how the more extreme the rainfall the more likely we are to see increases particular in the winter months when rainfall seasonality is dominant across south west australia the annual trends form a different composite of the results presented for the 90th percentile in the summer months the trend in the 5 day annual maxima remains similar to q90 but for winter the trends exhibit more variability with more wetting trends exhibited on the south east coast of australia the 5 day maxima for eastern inland areas of australia is influenced more by trends in the summer and not winter months while the northern part of australia is influenced by the summer trends despite increases in extreme rainfall across australia guerreiro et al 2018 there remain large parts of the country with observed decreases in q90 and the 5 day annual runoff maxima this indicates that events at this level of severity are controlled by other processes than simply changes in extreme rainfall for example changing rainfall persistence characteristics and changing soil moisture e g wasko and nathan 2019a the mean runoff drying trend fig 5 is strongest in the south west of australia and this continues to be reflected with the q90 and 5 day annual maxima decreasing uniformly on the south west coast fig 6 4 4 trends in low flow indices drought or low flow trends are quantified using the sri 12 fig 7 sri drought is relative to the variability at the individual pixel hence by definition large parts of australia will experience drought although they may not necessarily experience small mean rainfall this is a limitation of using the sri to characterise drought particularly in regions of low flow such as the arid interior of australia correspondingly we focus our analysis on the northern and coastal regions the sri 12 is trending towards drier conditions around and inland of the southern half of the continent fig 7a consistent with decreased runoff streamflow fig 5 across the southern slopes and southern and south western flatlands there is a consistent negative trend in the sri 12 indicating a shift to drier conditions and more frequent drought conditions there is no single indicator of drought kiem et al 2016 hence these results should be interpreted with respect to the trends in hydroclimatic variables presented in fig 5 what is starkly different from the previous results is that not just the south west and south east of australia are trending towards drier conditions but most of southern australia is experiencing drier conditions this points to how multiple indicators of drying conditions in the context of internal variability need to be considered e g nathan et al 2019 as an indicator of changes in drought extent the change in the percentage of grid cells experiencing drought in each year in each of the nrm regions was calculated fig 7b a 1 per decade increase represents an increase in the percentage of grid cells in an nrm observing drought e g from 25 to 26 the decreasing number of cells in the monsoonal north rangelands and wet tropics suggests a smaller extent of drought with climate change consistent with the increases in mean rainfall presented in fig 5 but we note that there were localised regions trending to lower sri 12 i e drought in the wet tropics fig 7a the greatest increase in the number of cells experiencing drought occurs in the southern slopes murray basin and southern and south western flatlands the large increasing extent of drought and decreasing mean annual rainfall in the murray basin is concerning as this is a significant agricultural region for australia 4 5 catchment scale interaction of hydroclimatological variables section 4 2 presented a continental scale analysis of changes in the drivers of streamflow across australia however trends and interactions of hydroclimatological variables at the catchment scale are likely to differ from those at the continental scale saft et al 2015 whitfield 2012 focusing on streamflow fig 8 presents simulated streamflow trends against trends in observed rainfall and simulated pet aet and soil moisture we note that simulated streamflow is a summation of the awra l runoff section 3 2 2 there is a strong correspondence between rainfall and simulated streamflow trends both seasonally and annually with an r2 of 0 74 at the annual timescale it is very evident that the strongest positive trends in streamflow and rainfall occur in the wet tropics and monsoonal north and largely in the wet season austral summer months djf conversely the decrease in streamflow in the southern and south western flatlands is largely a result of winter jja rainfall declines this confirms the findings presented in the gridded results in fig 5 but it is now also clear which was not evident previously that the southern slopes and murray basin regions although adjacent have markedly different behavior as a result of an orographic divide although mean annual rainfall and streamflow are reducing across both regions at the annual scale summer rainfall and streamflow are increasing in the murray basin in the winter the southern slopes have increasing rainfall and streamflow similar to the continental trends there is little correspondence between pet and runoff at catchment scale this is because firstly the trend in pet is only realised as a trend in either aet soil moisture or runoff if there is sufficient moisture available and it will appear in aet and soil moisture before runoff which is an integration of the above fluxes secondly the trends in pet are small compared to rainfall despite strong continental coherence in aet and runoff trends fig 5 regional scale trends between aet and runoff generally have very low coefficients of determination table s1 with the exception of the wet tropics monsoonal north and southern and south western flatlands this suggests for these regions greater runoff is correlated with greater evapotranspiration probably due to greater water availability through greater precipitation the wet tropics monsoonal north and southern and south western flatlands are wetter coastal regions and therefore are possibly not moisture limited but energy limited however regions like the southern slopes and east coast are also coastal and do not have a strong relationship between aet and runoff annually implying not all coastal regions are energy limited it does not appear that aet is driving changes in streamflow as the strong positive relationship between aet and runoff for the southern and south western flatlands is counter to the fact that runoff is decreasing in this region reducing water availability soil moisture is more strongly linked to streamflow r2 of 0 23 annually than aet r2 of 0 01 or pet r2 of 0 09 suggesting wet soils are contributing to runoff and vice versa the strength of these relationships does not necessarily correspond to the seasonality of streamflow for example there is a strong relationship in the summer months in the murray basin between runoff and soil moisture r2 of 0 40 and similarly for the southern and south western flatlands r2 of 0 49 but these are the months of the lowest streamflow for winter streamflow the relationship between soil moisture and streamflow is more random suggesting that streamflow depends more on rainfall in wetter months whereas in drier months the relationship between streamflow and rainfall is modulated by soil moisture the lack of relationships in trend between soil moisture and runoff in the winter months for the murray basin and southern and south western flatlands is reflected in the annual relationship where little correspondence exists between soil moisture and runoff trends with r2 values less than 0 1 table s1 the east coast and central slopes show strong positive annual associations between streamflow and soil moisture of 0 34 and 0 57 respectively suggesting the east coast of australia has a strong relationship with soil moisture and runoff which was not present for the other variables although we can conclude that rainfall changes are the dominant driver of changes in streamflow soil moisture is a secondary driver with the strength of the interaction between soil moisture and runoff varying strongly with season 4 6 catchment scale interaction of hydroclimatological variables for high flows fig 9 presents trends in the 90th percentile of annual catchment streamflow q90 against the trends in the 90th percentile of rainfall p90 trends in soil moisture and trends in mean rainfall from 1960 to 2017 due to the small correlations of runoff trend to trends in pet and aet and the shorter time scale of high flows trends in pet and aet are omitted here at an annual aggregation the association between q90 and p90 trends 0 38 is poorer than that of q90 with the mean rainfall 0 68 for each nrm region the coefficient of determination is greater than 0 5 between q90 and mean rainfall table s2 there exists variability between regions for the relationship between trends in q90 and p90 but in general the strongest relationships exist between q90 and the mean rainfall compared to p90 or soil moisture seasonally a strong relationship exists between trends in q90 and p90 across most regions the relationship between the trends in q90 and p90 appears weaker than the correlation between the trends for mean rainfall and mean streamflow presented in fig 8 this could be expected due to greater variability in the more extreme flows and rainfalls compared to mean flows and rainfalls there is a weak relationship between q90 and p90 trends in summer djf for the southern and south western flatlands and southern slopes 0 1 possibly due to the fact that this is not the dominant streamflow season and streamflow is baseflow dominated resulting in higher associations with soil moisture table s2 up to 0 65 for the southern and south western flatlands there are quite large positive and negative trends in the wet tropics q90 runoff with a strong association to p90 up to 0 73 in the wet tropics for the summer season in the monsoonal north q90 is generally increasing with increasing p90 r2 of 0 78 this is consistent with significant infiltration excess dominated high flows during the monsoonal wet djf season for winter jja the strongest positive trends in q90 are observed in the southern slopes and the strongest negative trends in the southern and south western flatlands with an r2 with the p90 trends of 0 67 and 0 55 respectively the contrast to the summer trends in this region being dominated by soil moisture changes demonstrates how changing high q90 runoff as compared to mean runoff is more linked to seasonality changes and changes in seasonal extremes may not necessarily translate to change in the annual mean for example for the murray basin and southern and south western flatlands the summer association with soil moisture is greater than that with p90 comparing an r2 of 0 65 for the south and south western flatlands between q90 and soil moisture with an r2 of 0 09 for q90 and p90 demonstrates two points first high flows in seasons of low rainfall are more related to soil moisture changes than extreme rainfall changes second seasonal changes in high flows out of sync with the maximum seasonality of flow are dominant in this region to summarise for the murray basin and southern and south western flatlands soil moisture and the mean climate state have a greater impact on changing high flows than changes in extreme rainfall overall the greatest association for trends in q90 is with trends in mean annual rainfall table s2 this doesn t necessarily imply that mean rainfall changes are driving high flow changes but as extreme rainfall changes constitute a large part of the volume of mean rainfall we know that mean rainfall changes are highly dependent on changes in extreme rainfall moreover mean rainfall changes are a larger driver of changes in soil moisture hence the trends in p90 rainfall and soil moisture are integrated into changes in the mean rainfall and the association between q90 and mean rainfall trends fig 9 is similar to the association between mean runoff and mean rainfall fig 8 trends in q90 are similar to trends in mean runoff confirming that the direction positive or negative of trend in the entire runoff distribution is the same 5 discussions and conclusions we presented the first high resolution evaluation of trends in key hydroclimatic variables across the terrestrial water balance for the australian continent compared to the gauging network of daily rainfall observations other hydrological variables such as evaporation soil moisture and streamflow not affected by human interaction management are much more sparsely measured meaning most studies of hydroclimatic trends are limited to rainfall and infer impacts to other parts of the water cycle from the rainfall trends e g gallant et al 2007 however inferring trends in streamflow from rainfall alone can be problematic due to the complex interactions present at catchment scale e g sharma et al 2018 because of this to quantify and understand changes in the hydrologic cycle both on the continental scale and in ungauged catchments modelling is required here we used the australian water resource assessment model awra l to study trends in rainfall evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff as well as indicators of flooding and drought across the continent 5 1 evaluation of awra l awra l has been extensively evaluated for its performance in simulating soil moisture and runoff indicating its suitability for national water balance studies we additionally evaluated the performance of awra l to simulate trends in catchment aggregated runoff that is the streamflow simulated annual flow direction matched observations at 76 of the catchments with a coefficient of determination 0 38 indicating good performance across the continent localised discrepancies with observed streamflow along the north east coast and at the very far south west tip of the continent may be due to the fact that there is one set of parameters applied nationally with local behaviour modulated according to input static grids of landscape characteristics this approach inevitably leads to areas where performance and behaviour does not follow observed data due to input uncertainties and errors along with poor local parameterisation however as the performance of awra l in ungauged basins approaches that of locally calibrated models for streamflow this gives confidence in the use of awra l nationally frost and wright 2018a 2018b overall good correspondence with observed trends was found in the south east of australia in particular in the murray basin and southern slopes nrm regions where observed drying trends are the largest reasonable correspondence between modelled and observed trends in streamflow was found in the northern parts of australia for the warmer months when streamflow is greatest but on an annual basis the coefficient of determination was less than 0 1 in the tropics the large variability in the magnitude of the modelled trend in the tropics may be in part due to drainage currently being overly dependent on saturated conductivity and insufficient rainfall variability in the gridded rainfall driving the model 5 2 trends in hydroclimatic variables across australia linear trends show that consistent with the tropics expanding poleward grise et al 2018 staten et al 2018 there has been increasing precipitation in the tropics and decreasing precipitation in the sub tropics with trends to wetter conditions in the monsoon dominated summer months in the north and drier conditions in the south in the winter months as changes in rainfall corresponds to the dominant rainfall seasonality for australia on a continental scale there is correspondence between the trends in rainfall aet soil moisture and runoff since 1960 there is little correspondence between pet and aet trends with the primary only exception some limited regions on the south east coast the divergence of pet and aet trends fits with the fact that australia as a whole is a moisture limited environment anabalón and sharma 2017 consistent with extreme rainfalls by volume contributing most to the mean rainfall distribution taschetto and england 2009 wasko and nathan 2019b and the entire flow distribution trending in the same direction with climate change gudmundsson et al 2019 trends in the 90th percentile of runoff are largely related to changes in mean rainfall decreases in high flows an indicator of flooding are the greatest in the south west and south east coastal regions of australia but more severe flow extremes such as the 5 day annual maxima flow exhibit less negative trends suggesting the more extreme the flow event the more likely it is to be increasing wasko and nathan 2019a indicators of drought suggest a shift to more frequent occurrences and more widespread drought across large parts of australia although shifts to more frequent drought conditions are largely contained to the southern slopes south and south western flatlands and murray basin there is evidence that parts of the tropics will also experience increasing drought despite increases in rainfall although the eastern half of the southern and south western flatlands did not exhibit strong trends in decreasing runoff there was a large decrease in the sri 12 indicating a shift to more drought conditions this is consistent with increasing variability in rainfall rajah et al 2014 rather than changes in total mean rainfall causing greater restrictions to seasonal water supply nguyen et al 2020 despite strong visual correlation between trends in rainfall soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff at the continental scale annual streamflow trends at the regional scale show the greatest association to rainfall trends with an r2 of 0 74 this suggests rainfall changes are driving changes in streamflow and soil moisture is a secondary driver r2 of 0 23 annually in the dry summer months the associations of runoff and soil moisture r2 of 0 40 for the murray basin are similar to that between runoff and rainfall r2 of 0 49 this presents that soil moisture changes are a secondary driver of streamflow trends except in dry months when soil moisture is equally a primary driver for the 90th percentile of streamflow trends were more closely aligned to mean rainfall changes r2 of 0 68 rather than the 90th percentile of rainfall r2 of 0 38 as extreme rainfall changes constitute a large part of the volume of mean rainfall change the 90th percentile of rainfall and soil moisture are integrated into changes in mean rainfall this suggests that trends in high flows are modulated by both rainfall and soil moisture changes indeed for the dry summer months in the murray basin and southern and south western flatlands the association with soil moisture is greater than that with p90 indicating how high flows in seasons of low rainfall are more related to changes in soil moisture than extreme rainfall changes with the converse true for the high rainfall season 5 3 implications and future work here we successfully performed a trend analysis of key hydrologic variables from 1960 to 2017 using a continental scale water balance model awra l we found trends towards greater rainfalls and water availability in the tropics with declines in rainfall and water availability in the south of the continent while there is evidence of increasing extreme rainfalls across australia annual maxima flooding has decreased across large parts of the county declining rainfalls and streamflow in southeast australia have resulted in increasing droughts affecting agriculture and water supply and if these trends are to continue we can expect consequences to be further exacerbated future work will focus on better understanding the impacts of climate change on water supply across australia and the impact of changes in seasonality on drought and flooding localised projections of the impacts of changing hydrologic conditions on water supply exist for australia henley et al 2019 nguyen et al 2020 but we envisage that projections of awra l will enable the development of more extensive studies that lead to greater understanding and a more holistic picture of the impacts of climate change on flooding and water supply across australia credit authorship contribution statement conrad

4943,changes in the hydrologic cycle have far reaching impacts on agricultural productivity water resources availability riverine ecosystems and our ability to manage environmental assets bushfire risk and flood hazard for example declining rainfall in the southeast of australia has led to a prolonged period of drought with serious impacts on agriculture the environment and water supply to urban and rural towns here using the continental wide australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l we evaluate historical trends from 1960 to 2017 in rainfall soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff to explain changing drought and flooding northern parts of australia have experienced increasing annual rainfall totals resulting in increased water availability in the tropics with increased soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff particularly during the hot wet monsoon season in contrast the southwest and southeast coast of australia have experienced declines in rainfall particularly in the colder months corresponding with decreasing evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff trends in flooding are aligned with runoff trends and closely follow trends in rainfall with changes in soil moisture of secondary influence streamflow droughts measured by the standardised runoff index are increasing across large parts of australia with these increases more widespread than changes in rainfall alone increases in rainfall in the tropics of northern australia appear to be related to decreasing drought occurrence and extent but this trend is not universal suggesting changes in rainfall alone are not an indicator of changing drought conditions keywords rainfall runoff soil moisture drought flood climate change 1 introduction 1 1 changes in the global hydrological cycle one of the most important questions in hydrology is how the hydrologic cycle is being impacted by climate change huntington 2006 koutsoyiannis 2020 water in the landscape and rivers is essential for agriculture town and industrial water supply the environment cultural values recreation hydropower and more hence changes to when and where water is available has far reaching impacts in terms of hydrologic extremes flood and droughts are among the costliest natural disasters in the world causing risk to life food security and in the case of drought increased bushfire risk globally precipitation has increased as per energy constraints allan et al 2020 allen and ingram 2002 at approximately 2 4 mm decade becker et al 2013 hartmann et al 2013 in line with climate model projections of a 2 increase in precipitation per degree increase in global mean temperature kharin et al 2013 most of the increases in precipitation have occurred over tropical areas with decreases elsewhere beck et al 2019 while precipitation extremes such as annual maxima of daily rainfall have increased universally at a rate close to 7 per degree increase in global mean temperature sun et al 2020 westra et al 2013 there is evidence that consistent with changes in rainfall soil moisture has experienced wetting trends in the tropics and drying trends in the extra tropics feng and zhang 2015 liu et al 2019 but trends differ depending on the data set used albergel et al 2013 compared to changes in annual average conditions changes in hydrological extremes are more challenging to quantify and understand increasing temperatures have increased the likelihood of drought conditions in many regions of the world hartmann et al 2013 liu et al 2019 though again results differ depending on the index used asadi zarch et al 2015 despite many studies pointing to increases in extreme precipitation donat et al 2013 groisman et al 2005 martinez villalobos and neelin 2018 sun et al 2020 westra et al 2013 there is a very mixed trend in flood response sharma et al 2018 with more sites globally showing decreases in flooding than increases do et al 2017 despite this variability trends in high flows follow average annual flow trends both globally gudmundsson et al 2019 and across australia zhang et al 2016 in regions free of snow melt it has been postulated that changes in flooding are due to changing antecedent soil moisture conditions ivancic and shaw 2015 sharma et al 2018 wasko et al 2019 however few studies have studied trends in antecedent conditions explicitly tramblay et al 2019 wasko and nathan 2019a 1 2 hydrological trends in australia australia forms a valuable test case for investigating the impacts of climate change on the hydrologic cycle it straddles the tropics and extratropics experiencing a wide range of climates and is largely free of snowmelt in addition trends in australian precipitation and temperature reflect global patterns alexander et al 2007 although streamflow exhibits extremely high variability compared to the rest of the world chiew and mcmahon 2002 mcmahon et al 2007 peel et al 2004 mean annual rainfall has increased in the tropical north of australia and decreased in the south dey et al 2019 particularly along the south east and south west coasts due to changed cutoffs and frontal systems risbey et al 2013 consistent with a tropical expansion grise et al 2018 staten et al 2018 for example south western australia has undergone decreased cool season rainfall in april to october with sharp decreases in may july rainfall since 1970 there has been a similar decline of rainfall over south eastern australia in april to october rainfall since the late 1990s meanwhile in northern australia there has been an observed rainfall increase since the 1970s especially in the northwest csiro bom 2018 since the 1950s increasing streamflow in the northern tropics and decreasing streamflow over southern australia has been observed zhang et al 2016 across australia studies of trends in evapotranspiration show mixed trends temporally and spatially prior to 1999 decreasing trends in observed pan evaporation across australia were linked to declining wind speeds johnson and sharma 2010 but since then many sites have shown increased pan evaporation possibly due to an increased vapor pressure deficit stephens et al 2018 despite increases in global estimates of terrestrial evapotranspiration zeng et al 2018 evapotranspiration estimates derived from remote sensing and flux towers show a decrease in evapotranspiration between 1998 and 2008 attributed to moisture limitations jung et al 2010 there is a large discrepancy in trends calculated between different soil moisture products but in general datasets point to more severe droughts in arid and semi arid regions liu et al 2019 using data obtained from the european space agency soil moisture was found to be decreasing across australia between 1979 and 2013 with the exception of the tropical north feng and zhang 2015 however another study for 1988 2010 using multiple reanalysis and satellite derived data sets indicated largely conflicting results between data sets particularly at the regional scale albergel et al 2013 this may be because reanalysis data sets particularly era interim have large rainfall biases andersson et al 2015 weedon et al 2014 while remote sensed data sets measure soil moisture at different depths holgate et al 2016 the magnitude of extreme hourly and daily rainfall across a range of exceedance thresholds has increased over the last half a century across australia alexander and arblaster 2017 guerreiro et al 2018 with shifts to a greater frequency of longer duration events in the tropics and shorter duration events in extra tropics dey et al 2020 despite more evidence for increasing rainfall extremes compared to decreases more streamflow gauging sites show decreases in annual maxima than increases ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 decreased flooding has been attributed to decreased antecedent soil moisture prior to the onset of the storm events across southern parts of australia wasko and nathan 2019a a better understanding of the drivers of changes on streamflow and flooding that is rainfall evapotranspiration and soil moisture and how they interact is required to better predict the likely impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle and subsequently economic activity the environment communities and ecosystems berghuijs et al 2019 2 research gap in understanding drivers of concurrent hydrological trends due to the greater number of rainfall gauging stations and observations compared to streamflow studies often infer impacts to flooding from changes in rainfall however this approach may lead to apparent contradictions such as increasing rainfall extremes which are not associated with increased flooding sharma et al 2018 few studies examine hydroclimatic variables in unison exceptions include johnson et al 2016 wasko et al 2020 wasko and nathan 2019a and of those that do most focus on instrumented catchments and the millennium drought 2001 2009 in the south east of australia fowler et al 2016 king et al 2020 kirono et al 2017 potter et al 2010 saft et al 2016 2015 van dijk et al 2013 as such a holistic understanding of concurrent changes in hydroclimatic variables across australia does not currently exist here we use a high resolution continental water balance model to study trends in simulated streamflow across the australian continent along with drought and high flow flood indices according to their key drivers rainfall evapotranspiration and soil moisture we test the model s ability to reproduce hydrological trends then use the model as a tool to quantify historical trends across the water balance 3 methodology the approach used for this study is as follows 1 the australian water resource assessment landscape model awra l model is assessed in terms of simulated runoff reproduction of streamflow trends at a set of high quality catchments with catchment trend assessment grouped according to climatologically similar regions 2 spatial trends in simulated runoff aggregated to streamflow are compared to trends in rainfall potential evaporation pet actual evapotranspiration aet and soil moisture 3 trends in catchment scale runoff extremes drought and flood indices are compared to trends in related hydrologic and climate indices i e mean rainfall and soil moisture trends and trends in extreme rainfall 3 1 awra l model awra l is a daily gridded one dimensional semi distributed continental scale landscape water balance model developed by the csiro and the australian bureau of meteorology bom frost et al 2018 van dijk 2010 viney et al 2015 for water resource assessment and monitoring it is currently run operationally to provide near real time hydrological data at a resolution of 0 05 0 05 approximately 5 km 5 km from 1911 to the present across australia see www bom gov au water landscape fig 1 presents the climate inputs hydrological outputs and simulated processes in awra l the model forcing inputs are daily solar radiation minimum and maximum temperature 2 m wind speed and precipitation other static inputs describe the spatial variability of soil and geological properties and land use in its operational use awra l uses daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures obtained from the australian water availability product awap jones et al 2009 remotely sensed solar radiation grant et al 2008 and an interpolated field of station based observations of wind speed mcvicar et al 2008 daily varying climatologies of solar radiation and wind speed are used prior to 1990 and 1975 respectively prior to the relevant observational datasets becoming available the key hydrologic processes modelled include 1 portioning of rainfall between interception and water contributing to the water balance 2 infiltration or saturation excess surface runoff dependent on groundwater saturation 3 interflow drainage and evaporation from the soil layers and 4 baseflow and evapotranspiration from the groundwater store potential evaporation is modelled using the penman equation penman 1948 which uses wind and temperature as inputs along with solar radiation to calculate the terrestrial energy balance following donohue et al 2010 the soil is modelled in three layers 0 0 1 m 0 1 1 m and 1 6 m depth with differing model parameters between layers shallow rooted vegetation has access to soil moisture in the upper two layers while deep rooted vegetation also has access to the bottom most layer key output fluxes are runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the three soil layers and deep drainage to the groundwater store similar to other semi distributed models the total runoff from a grid cell is a summation of the surface and subsurface runoff fluxes awra l contains 49 parameters of which 28 are fixed according to previous parameter sensitivity experiments and prior knowledge and 21 are optimised to maximise an objective function that considers performance against observed streamflow covering the period 1981 2011 remotely sensed evapotranspiration and remotely sensed surface soil moisture at a set of 295 unimpaired catchments zhang et al 2011 the reader is referred to viney et al 2015 and frost et al 2018 for further details verification is undertaken firstly to the calibration data at independent sites streamflow and remotely sensed estimates of catchment average soil moisture and evapotranspiration over a separate set of 291 unimpaired catchments along with in situ measurements of soil moisture flux tower estimates of evapotranspiration and estimates of groundwater recharge nationally see frost and wright 2018a frost and wright 2018b awra l performs well compared to other available continental scale models for streamflow predominantly due to streamflow data being used in calibration and similarly to locally calibrated nearest neighbour regionalised conceptual rainfall runoff models giving confidence that awra l can be considered a fit for purpose continental scale hydrological model for water resource and agricultural applications similarly awra l compares well to continental scale models when assessed against in situ root zone 0 90 cm soil moisture observations and shows comparable if not better correlation to in situ and remotely sensed data holgate et al 2016 with soil moisture variability representative of catchment dynamics peterson et al 2020 awra l shows comparable performance over other continental scale models for evapotranspiration but currently shows slightly poorer performance according to annual correlation of deep drainage frost and wright 2018a 2018b as a result of this performance across the water balance awra l forms an integral part of the australian bureau of meteorology s national water accounting water monitoring elmahdi et al 2016 hafeez et al 2015 and estimation of antecedent conditions for event based flood forecasting it has been used in retrospective studies for national flood design guidelines ball et al 2019 to understand the impact of changes in soil moisture on flood magnitude wasko and nathan 2019a and flood timing wasko et al 2020 and for the identification of flash drought using the evaporative stress index nguyen et al 2019 3 2 analysis 3 2 1 regional grouping broadly australia s climate varies from tropical in the north to temperate in the south with an arid climate inland the north generally receives monsoon driven rainfall in warmer months november to april with little to no rainfall in the colder months may to october with rainfall becoming more seasonally uniform moving south the exception is the south east which experiences a dry austral summer and wet colder months a small mountain range that runs along the east coast of australia demarcates regions with less rainfall inland and more rainfall towards the coast recognising these differences in climate we regionally aggregate and discuss results based on clusters of natural resource management nrm regions for consistency with the other work in australia csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 the nrm regions are defined by catchments and bioregions of similar climatic conditions fig 2 we note that the murray basin region presented here forms the lower part of the larger murray darling basin one of the most significant agricultural regions in australia 3 2 2 evaluation of simulated streamflow trends although awra l has been extensively validated the ability of awra l to capture observed hydrological trends has not been previously tested observed historical trends in potential evapotranspiration pet actual evapotranspiration aet and soil moisture sm are traditionally inconsistent and data source dependent see section 1 2 for this reason and because streamflow is an integration of the above fluxes and stores we focus on evaluating trends in catchment aggregated awra l runoff representing streamflow it is reasonable to assume that the unrouted simulated runoff can be aggregated to represent streamflow in smaller catchments where streambed losses are smaller and routing impacts less simulated trends in catchment aggregated awra l runoff are evaluated against trends in observed monthly streamflow at a set of high quality observational hydrologic reference stations zhang et al 2016 these stations represent relatively unaltered catchments low urbanisation irrigation forestry effects in total 160 stations of varying length are used most stations have recordings beginning in the 1970s with the longest length of record 37 years shortest 19 years and a median record length of 35 years station locations are presented in fig 2 with the reader referred to zhang et al 2016 for further details of this data set 3 2 3 trends in simulated hydroclimatic variables and indicators of flood and drought trends in observed streamflow rainfall awap and simulated pet aet soil moisture and runoff are calculated as the slope of a linear regression of the seasonal or annual means of the respective variable results focus on the period 1960 2017 coinciding with the increase in temperature identified post 1960 due to anthropogenic climate change fawcett et al 2012 here we analyse root zone soil moisture 0 100 cm soil depth as it is most correlated with catchment flood response hill et al 2016 hill and thomson 2019 modulating streamflow at various levels of event severity wasko et al 2020 wasko and nathan 2019a trends in high flood and low drought flow indicators were also examined and compared to trends in rainfall and evapotranspiration and runoff here we use the 90th percentile q90 of annual daily flow and 5 day 5 day annual maxima for high flows floods the standardised runoff index sri is used to characterise drought shukla and wood 2008 the sri is defined by fitting a probability distribution to the runoff time series in this case either gamma log normal or normal based on the best fit and converting the fitted cumulative distribution to a standard normal deviate here the sri 12 based on a 12 month calendar year aggregate is used the definitions or classifications of drought mckee et al 1993 according to sri 12 are presented in table 1 as an indicator of drought extent for each nrm region the trend in the proportion of grid cells experiencing drought as defined by the sri 12 categories presented in table 1 is also calculated 4 results the results are presented as follows first awra l streamflow trends are evaluated against observed trends next the continental scale trends in seasonal and annual means of awap observed rainfall and simulated pet aet soil moisture and runoff are presented trends in indicators of flood drought are also evaluated finally results are regionally aggregated across nrm regions trends are presented as scatter plots between variables to understand how trends interact at catchment scale whether there are differences in the interaction regionally and how these interactions compare to interactions at the continental scale 4 1 catchment streamflow trend verification the observed streamflow trend underlain by simulated awra l runoff for 1960 to 2017 is presented in fig 3 circles with white outline indicate that the direction of observed and modelled trends matches whereas black circles indicate the direction of trends does not match although awra l runoff on a grid cell basis is not directly comparable to streamflow which is a catchment outflow regional coherence of observed and modelled trends is promising on an annual basis awra l runoff and observed streamflow in the south west and south east of the continent show strong decreasing trends in the central north of the continent there are increasing trends both in observations and simulations but simulations of the north east coast display some divergence from observations there appears to be localised decreases in observed streamflow along the north east coast and at the very far south west tip of the continent which are not captured by awra l in the north of the continent rainfall and streamflow is warm month dominant djf the local variations in streamflow appear to be better captured in the north east of the country which is promising as these are the months of largest trend in the south of the country where the trends are now small there is localised increasing runoff modelled matching the observed trends for some locations in the south of the continent rainfall and streamflow is winter jja dominant and the strong decreasing trends are simulated well for tasmania the island off the south east coast of australia the strong gradient in observed trends between the east and west coast is captured although being slightly displaced for the northern winter jja there is little trend and the modelled runoff likewise shows little trend the general small but decreasing trend for winter runoff along the east coast moving north is captured seasonal and annual linear trends in simulated awra l aggregated runoff streamflow are compared with observed streamflow on a catchment by catchment basis in fig 4 for each catchment the modelled streamflow is a summation of the runoff for all the grid cells within the catchment section 3 2 2 performance is compared on the basis of the nrm regions presented in fig 2 noting that we assume the catchments are representative of the climatic conditions in that region the coefficient of determination r2 and the hit rates annually and for each season are presented in table 2 the hit rate corresponds to when the direction is correctly modelled that is the observed and simulated trends are both in the top right positive positive or bottom left negative negative quadrants in fig 4 simulated annual flow direction trend matches that observed at 122 of the 160 76 sites with an overall coefficient of determination of 0 38 table 2 in particular the direction of simulated trend matches the observed for all sites in the murray basin and good correspondence is found for the southern slopes with 76 of the sites matching in simulated and modeled trend direction for the monsoonal north despite 82 sites matching in trend direction the coefficient of determination is low due to a large scatter in the observed and modelled trends fig 4 the overall annual results can mask the results for the dominant streamflow season table 1 for summer djf the r2 between trends is 0 06 and 0 54 for the monsoonal north and wet tropics respectively however 11 of 11 sites 100 in the monsoonal north and 14 out of 17 sites 82 in the wet tropics model the observed trend direction suggesting better correspondence in the summer wet months than when streamflow is aggregated for the year good correspondence is observed for the east coast and central slopes in the winter jja where awra l simulates the observed trend direction at 35 of 36 sites similarly for the murray basin all sites have the correct modelled trend direction in the winter the dominant streamflow season in comparison in the summer where there is the least flow 41 out of 53 murray basin sites correctly model the observed trend direction 77 streamflow is winter dominant in the southern slopes here 28 out of 33 85 sites model the correct trend direction with an r2 of 0 59 at the catchment scale the southern and south western flatlands exhibit the lowest skill with the correct direction modelled at only 4 out of the 9 sites in the winter possibly due to very differing local geology overall the modelled and observed trends compare well fig 3 at a majority of observational sites streamflow trends are reproduced by awra l giving confidence in using simulated water balance variables to support our interpretations of the observed trends the direction of the streamflow trend is well reproduced particularly for the dominant streamflow season but the magnitude of the trend is not necessarily represented well in parts of the tropics best correspondence is found in the south east of the country murray basin and southern slopes regions evaluation was also performed for the 90th percentile of streamflow with results largely similar to those presented here 4 2 continental scale trends in hydroclimatological variables having established the verification of awra l trends in the simulated hydrologic variables are now evaluated fig 5 presents the trend in observed rainfall derived from the gridded interpolated climate observations as well as simulated potential and actual evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff for the period 1960 to 2017 two key points are noticeable for the annual rainfall trends a positive trend for the summer dominated tropical monsoonal north and a negative trend for the autumn winter frontal system dominated south tropical rainfall in northern australia is summer djf dominant and has been increasing over the last half a century with little rain occurring in the winter jja in these areas the trend observed in winter is negligible and the annual trend is dominated by changes in summer rainfall in general summer rainfall has been increasing across australia but this trend is less clear in the east for example isolated coastal areas on the east coast exhibit decreases in summer rainfall the annual trend in rainfall for the south west is strongly influenced by decreasing winter rainfall in the south east of australia a similar trend is observed there is a decline in winter rainfall though the largest observed decrease is for autumn rainfall resulting in decreased mean annual rainfalls although trends are presented for all of australia we note that the rainfall gauging network in the arid center of australia is limited with high uncertainty in these areas hence the interpretation of results is limited to coastal more populous and streamflow producing regions notionally trends in pet could be expected to be proportional to changes in temperature or inversely proportional to rainfall due to increased cloud cover but as discussed in the introduction there are many confounding factors and interdependencies affecting pet trends fig 5 presents for the period 1960 2017 decreases in pet across the western half of australia in summer and increases across the eastern half of australia there is a slight decrease in pet for the winter months in southern australia and an increase in pet in northern australia but overall the annual trend from east to west appears dominated by the trend in summer pet there is little evidence for a spatial correlation of these trends with changes in rainfall or the increase in temperature observed across australia over the past half a century however it should be noted that the driving radiation and wind variables for the pet simulated here are based on climatologies pre 1990 and 1975 respectively the modelled aet displays very similar trends to the rainfall confirming that with the exception of some coastal areas primarily the south east cost evapotranspiration across most of australia is water and not energy limited in the summer months there is an increase in evapotranspiration across the tropical north with decreases elsewhere in the winter there is a strong spatially coherent signal in the evapotranspiration with decreases in the south west corresponding to decreases in availability of moisture due to declines in rainfall the result is an annual trend in aet and rainfall of similar magnitude between 10 and 50 mm decade in the central northern tropics with decreases of a similar magnitude in the south west of australia for consistency the units of the soil moisture trends are the same as soil moisture trends are presented for the top 1 m of soil the magnitude of the trend may be less despite its large modulating effect on flood response wasko and nathan 2019a soil moisture tends towards wetting in the summer in the north and west of australia with a drying trend only present in the south west and south east in the winter there is almost universal drying across the south of australia resulting in an annual trend pattern similar to rainfall and aet trends there are increases in soil moisture in the north of australia and decreases in the south consistent with trends in rainfall and water availability however arguably the changes in soil moisture are more spatially consistent an indicator of the longer residence time of water in the soil for example the drying trend across the east coast in soil moisture is much more extensive compared to the aet trend comprised of a mixture of increasing and decreasing trends the observed changes trends in rainfall and soil moisture translate to large changes in runoff across australia in the central tropics there is an increase in runoff in the summer of over 50 mm decade while along the south east coast there is a small drying trend of approximately 5 10 mm decade in winter the south east and south west coasts exhibit large decreasing trends in the order of 20 mm decade in the north winter is the dry season and there are no significant trends the high spatial resolution of awra l results in regional differences being modelled for example for tasmania the island off the south east coast of australia a decreasing trend is modelled on the east coast and increasing trend on the west coast commensurate with the orographic divide that runs north south similarly across the south east coast of australia greater decreasing trends in runoff are observed on the coastal side of the dividing mountain range that runs along the east coast there is little trend in runoff elsewhere with most trends in runoff across australia contained to the coastal areas of higher rainfall 4 3 trends in high flow indices the continental pattern across australia for the 90th percentile q90 of daily runoff on an annual basis and the 5 day maxima from 1960 to 2017 are presented in fig 6 the trends in the 90th percentile runoff top row reflect the mean runoff trends presented in fig 5 suggesting a uniform directional shift in the flow distribution similar to global studies gudmundsson et al 2019 there are decreases for q90 in the summer months djf for the tropical north and parts of the south east coast although rainfall and runoff are summer dominant along the north east coast the trends are mixed and there is little trend elsewhere due to low summer rainfall for winter months jja there are large reductions in q90 across the southern coast of australia with little trend elsewhere coinciding with the lack of rainfall and runoff across the northern parts of australia in the winter on a continental scale the annual trend reflects the summation of the seasonal patterns the 5 day annual maxima bottom row is more extreme than the 90th percentile and hence the trends exhibit greater variability than the trends for q90 compared to the trend in q90 there are now more increases in the extreme runoff on the south east coast reflecting how the more extreme the rainfall the more likely we are to see increases particular in the winter months when rainfall seasonality is dominant across south west australia the annual trends form a different composite of the results presented for the 90th percentile in the summer months the trend in the 5 day annual maxima remains similar to q90 but for winter the trends exhibit more variability with more wetting trends exhibited on the south east coast of australia the 5 day maxima for eastern inland areas of australia is influenced more by trends in the summer and not winter months while the northern part of australia is influenced by the summer trends despite increases in extreme rainfall across australia guerreiro et al 2018 there remain large parts of the country with observed decreases in q90 and the 5 day annual runoff maxima this indicates that events at this level of severity are controlled by other processes than simply changes in extreme rainfall for example changing rainfall persistence characteristics and changing soil moisture e g wasko and nathan 2019a the mean runoff drying trend fig 5 is strongest in the south west of australia and this continues to be reflected with the q90 and 5 day annual maxima decreasing uniformly on the south west coast fig 6 4 4 trends in low flow indices drought or low flow trends are quantified using the sri 12 fig 7 sri drought is relative to the variability at the individual pixel hence by definition large parts of australia will experience drought although they may not necessarily experience small mean rainfall this is a limitation of using the sri to characterise drought particularly in regions of low flow such as the arid interior of australia correspondingly we focus our analysis on the northern and coastal regions the sri 12 is trending towards drier conditions around and inland of the southern half of the continent fig 7a consistent with decreased runoff streamflow fig 5 across the southern slopes and southern and south western flatlands there is a consistent negative trend in the sri 12 indicating a shift to drier conditions and more frequent drought conditions there is no single indicator of drought kiem et al 2016 hence these results should be interpreted with respect to the trends in hydroclimatic variables presented in fig 5 what is starkly different from the previous results is that not just the south west and south east of australia are trending towards drier conditions but most of southern australia is experiencing drier conditions this points to how multiple indicators of drying conditions in the context of internal variability need to be considered e g nathan et al 2019 as an indicator of changes in drought extent the change in the percentage of grid cells experiencing drought in each year in each of the nrm regions was calculated fig 7b a 1 per decade increase represents an increase in the percentage of grid cells in an nrm observing drought e g from 25 to 26 the decreasing number of cells in the monsoonal north rangelands and wet tropics suggests a smaller extent of drought with climate change consistent with the increases in mean rainfall presented in fig 5 but we note that there were localised regions trending to lower sri 12 i e drought in the wet tropics fig 7a the greatest increase in the number of cells experiencing drought occurs in the southern slopes murray basin and southern and south western flatlands the large increasing extent of drought and decreasing mean annual rainfall in the murray basin is concerning as this is a significant agricultural region for australia 4 5 catchment scale interaction of hydroclimatological variables section 4 2 presented a continental scale analysis of changes in the drivers of streamflow across australia however trends and interactions of hydroclimatological variables at the catchment scale are likely to differ from those at the continental scale saft et al 2015 whitfield 2012 focusing on streamflow fig 8 presents simulated streamflow trends against trends in observed rainfall and simulated pet aet and soil moisture we note that simulated streamflow is a summation of the awra l runoff section 3 2 2 there is a strong correspondence between rainfall and simulated streamflow trends both seasonally and annually with an r2 of 0 74 at the annual timescale it is very evident that the strongest positive trends in streamflow and rainfall occur in the wet tropics and monsoonal north and largely in the wet season austral summer months djf conversely the decrease in streamflow in the southern and south western flatlands is largely a result of winter jja rainfall declines this confirms the findings presented in the gridded results in fig 5 but it is now also clear which was not evident previously that the southern slopes and murray basin regions although adjacent have markedly different behavior as a result of an orographic divide although mean annual rainfall and streamflow are reducing across both regions at the annual scale summer rainfall and streamflow are increasing in the murray basin in the winter the southern slopes have increasing rainfall and streamflow similar to the continental trends there is little correspondence between pet and runoff at catchment scale this is because firstly the trend in pet is only realised as a trend in either aet soil moisture or runoff if there is sufficient moisture available and it will appear in aet and soil moisture before runoff which is an integration of the above fluxes secondly the trends in pet are small compared to rainfall despite strong continental coherence in aet and runoff trends fig 5 regional scale trends between aet and runoff generally have very low coefficients of determination table s1 with the exception of the wet tropics monsoonal north and southern and south western flatlands this suggests for these regions greater runoff is correlated with greater evapotranspiration probably due to greater water availability through greater precipitation the wet tropics monsoonal north and southern and south western flatlands are wetter coastal regions and therefore are possibly not moisture limited but energy limited however regions like the southern slopes and east coast are also coastal and do not have a strong relationship between aet and runoff annually implying not all coastal regions are energy limited it does not appear that aet is driving changes in streamflow as the strong positive relationship between aet and runoff for the southern and south western flatlands is counter to the fact that runoff is decreasing in this region reducing water availability soil moisture is more strongly linked to streamflow r2 of 0 23 annually than aet r2 of 0 01 or pet r2 of 0 09 suggesting wet soils are contributing to runoff and vice versa the strength of these relationships does not necessarily correspond to the seasonality of streamflow for example there is a strong relationship in the summer months in the murray basin between runoff and soil moisture r2 of 0 40 and similarly for the southern and south western flatlands r2 of 0 49 but these are the months of the lowest streamflow for winter streamflow the relationship between soil moisture and streamflow is more random suggesting that streamflow depends more on rainfall in wetter months whereas in drier months the relationship between streamflow and rainfall is modulated by soil moisture the lack of relationships in trend between soil moisture and runoff in the winter months for the murray basin and southern and south western flatlands is reflected in the annual relationship where little correspondence exists between soil moisture and runoff trends with r2 values less than 0 1 table s1 the east coast and central slopes show strong positive annual associations between streamflow and soil moisture of 0 34 and 0 57 respectively suggesting the east coast of australia has a strong relationship with soil moisture and runoff which was not present for the other variables although we can conclude that rainfall changes are the dominant driver of changes in streamflow soil moisture is a secondary driver with the strength of the interaction between soil moisture and runoff varying strongly with season 4 6 catchment scale interaction of hydroclimatological variables for high flows fig 9 presents trends in the 90th percentile of annual catchment streamflow q90 against the trends in the 90th percentile of rainfall p90 trends in soil moisture and trends in mean rainfall from 1960 to 2017 due to the small correlations of runoff trend to trends in pet and aet and the shorter time scale of high flows trends in pet and aet are omitted here at an annual aggregation the association between q90 and p90 trends 0 38 is poorer than that of q90 with the mean rainfall 0 68 for each nrm region the coefficient of determination is greater than 0 5 between q90 and mean rainfall table s2 there exists variability between regions for the relationship between trends in q90 and p90 but in general the strongest relationships exist between q90 and the mean rainfall compared to p90 or soil moisture seasonally a strong relationship exists between trends in q90 and p90 across most regions the relationship between the trends in q90 and p90 appears weaker than the correlation between the trends for mean rainfall and mean streamflow presented in fig 8 this could be expected due to greater variability in the more extreme flows and rainfalls compared to mean flows and rainfalls there is a weak relationship between q90 and p90 trends in summer djf for the southern and south western flatlands and southern slopes 0 1 possibly due to the fact that this is not the dominant streamflow season and streamflow is baseflow dominated resulting in higher associations with soil moisture table s2 up to 0 65 for the southern and south western flatlands there are quite large positive and negative trends in the wet tropics q90 runoff with a strong association to p90 up to 0 73 in the wet tropics for the summer season in the monsoonal north q90 is generally increasing with increasing p90 r2 of 0 78 this is consistent with significant infiltration excess dominated high flows during the monsoonal wet djf season for winter jja the strongest positive trends in q90 are observed in the southern slopes and the strongest negative trends in the southern and south western flatlands with an r2 with the p90 trends of 0 67 and 0 55 respectively the contrast to the summer trends in this region being dominated by soil moisture changes demonstrates how changing high q90 runoff as compared to mean runoff is more linked to seasonality changes and changes in seasonal extremes may not necessarily translate to change in the annual mean for example for the murray basin and southern and south western flatlands the summer association with soil moisture is greater than that with p90 comparing an r2 of 0 65 for the south and south western flatlands between q90 and soil moisture with an r2 of 0 09 for q90 and p90 demonstrates two points first high flows in seasons of low rainfall are more related to soil moisture changes than extreme rainfall changes second seasonal changes in high flows out of sync with the maximum seasonality of flow are dominant in this region to summarise for the murray basin and southern and south western flatlands soil moisture and the mean climate state have a greater impact on changing high flows than changes in extreme rainfall overall the greatest association for trends in q90 is with trends in mean annual rainfall table s2 this doesn t necessarily imply that mean rainfall changes are driving high flow changes but as extreme rainfall changes constitute a large part of the volume of mean rainfall we know that mean rainfall changes are highly dependent on changes in extreme rainfall moreover mean rainfall changes are a larger driver of changes in soil moisture hence the trends in p90 rainfall and soil moisture are integrated into changes in the mean rainfall and the association between q90 and mean rainfall trends fig 9 is similar to the association between mean runoff and mean rainfall fig 8 trends in q90 are similar to trends in mean runoff confirming that the direction positive or negative of trend in the entire runoff distribution is the same 5 discussions and conclusions we presented the first high resolution evaluation of trends in key hydroclimatic variables across the terrestrial water balance for the australian continent compared to the gauging network of daily rainfall observations other hydrological variables such as evaporation soil moisture and streamflow not affected by human interaction management are much more sparsely measured meaning most studies of hydroclimatic trends are limited to rainfall and infer impacts to other parts of the water cycle from the rainfall trends e g gallant et al 2007 however inferring trends in streamflow from rainfall alone can be problematic due to the complex interactions present at catchment scale e g sharma et al 2018 because of this to quantify and understand changes in the hydrologic cycle both on the continental scale and in ungauged catchments modelling is required here we used the australian water resource assessment model awra l to study trends in rainfall evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff as well as indicators of flooding and drought across the continent 5 1 evaluation of awra l awra l has been extensively evaluated for its performance in simulating soil moisture and runoff indicating its suitability for national water balance studies we additionally evaluated the performance of awra l to simulate trends in catchment aggregated runoff that is the streamflow simulated annual flow direction matched observations at 76 of the catchments with a coefficient of determination 0 38 indicating good performance across the continent localised discrepancies with observed streamflow along the north east coast and at the very far south west tip of the continent may be due to the fact that there is one set of parameters applied nationally with local behaviour modulated according to input static grids of landscape characteristics this approach inevitably leads to areas where performance and behaviour does not follow observed data due to input uncertainties and errors along with poor local parameterisation however as the performance of awra l in ungauged basins approaches that of locally calibrated models for streamflow this gives confidence in the use of awra l nationally frost and wright 2018a 2018b overall good correspondence with observed trends was found in the south east of australia in particular in the murray basin and southern slopes nrm regions where observed drying trends are the largest reasonable correspondence between modelled and observed trends in streamflow was found in the northern parts of australia for the warmer months when streamflow is greatest but on an annual basis the coefficient of determination was less than 0 1 in the tropics the large variability in the magnitude of the modelled trend in the tropics may be in part due to drainage currently being overly dependent on saturated conductivity and insufficient rainfall variability in the gridded rainfall driving the model 5 2 trends in hydroclimatic variables across australia linear trends show that consistent with the tropics expanding poleward grise et al 2018 staten et al 2018 there has been increasing precipitation in the tropics and decreasing precipitation in the sub tropics with trends to wetter conditions in the monsoon dominated summer months in the north and drier conditions in the south in the winter months as changes in rainfall corresponds to the dominant rainfall seasonality for australia on a continental scale there is correspondence between the trends in rainfall aet soil moisture and runoff since 1960 there is little correspondence between pet and aet trends with the primary only exception some limited regions on the south east coast the divergence of pet and aet trends fits with the fact that australia as a whole is a moisture limited environment anabalón and sharma 2017 consistent with extreme rainfalls by volume contributing most to the mean rainfall distribution taschetto and england 2009 wasko and nathan 2019b and the entire flow distribution trending in the same direction with climate change gudmundsson et al 2019 trends in the 90th percentile of runoff are largely related to changes in mean rainfall decreases in high flows an indicator of flooding are the greatest in the south west and south east coastal regions of australia but more severe flow extremes such as the 5 day annual maxima flow exhibit less negative trends suggesting the more extreme the flow event the more likely it is to be increasing wasko and nathan 2019a indicators of drought suggest a shift to more frequent occurrences and more widespread drought across large parts of australia although shifts to more frequent drought conditions are largely contained to the southern slopes south and south western flatlands and murray basin there is evidence that parts of the tropics will also experience increasing drought despite increases in rainfall although the eastern half of the southern and south western flatlands did not exhibit strong trends in decreasing runoff there was a large decrease in the sri 12 indicating a shift to more drought conditions this is consistent with increasing variability in rainfall rajah et al 2014 rather than changes in total mean rainfall causing greater restrictions to seasonal water supply nguyen et al 2020 despite strong visual correlation between trends in rainfall soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff at the continental scale annual streamflow trends at the regional scale show the greatest association to rainfall trends with an r2 of 0 74 this suggests rainfall changes are driving changes in streamflow and soil moisture is a secondary driver r2 of 0 23 annually in the dry summer months the associations of runoff and soil moisture r2 of 0 40 for the murray basin are similar to that between runoff and rainfall r2 of 0 49 this presents that soil moisture changes are a secondary driver of streamflow trends except in dry months when soil moisture is equally a primary driver for the 90th percentile of streamflow trends were more closely aligned to mean rainfall changes r2 of 0 68 rather than the 90th percentile of rainfall r2 of 0 38 as extreme rainfall changes constitute a large part of the volume of mean rainfall change the 90th percentile of rainfall and soil moisture are integrated into changes in mean rainfall this suggests that trends in high flows are modulated by both rainfall and soil moisture changes indeed for the dry summer months in the murray basin and southern and south western flatlands the association with soil moisture is greater than that with p90 indicating how high flows in seasons of low rainfall are more related to changes in soil moisture than extreme rainfall changes with the converse true for the high rainfall season 5 3 implications and future work here we successfully performed a trend analysis of key hydrologic variables from 1960 to 2017 using a continental scale water balance model awra l we found trends towards greater rainfalls and water availability in the tropics with declines in rainfall and water availability in the south of the continent while there is evidence of increasing extreme rainfalls across australia annual maxima flooding has decreased across large parts of the county declining rainfalls and streamflow in southeast australia have resulted in increasing droughts affecting agriculture and water supply and if these trends are to continue we can expect consequences to be further exacerbated future work will focus on better understanding the impacts of climate change on water supply across australia and the impact of changes in seasonality on drought and flooding localised projections of the impacts of changing hydrologic conditions on water supply exist for australia henley et al 2019 nguyen et al 2020 but we envisage that projections of awra l will enable the development of more extensive studies that lead to greater understanding and a more holistic picture of the impacts of climate change on flooding and water supply across australia credit authorship contribution statement conrad

4944,this study provides the example of golgotha cave in the south west of western australia where previous long term hydrological geochemical and climate monitoring resulted in a theoretical hydrological model of the karst critical zone we test this model by presenting the results of a 1 5 year monitoring program above the cave using time lapse electric resistivity tomography tl ert between may 2016 and january 2018 several lines up to 200 m long were monitored using a 100 multi electrode lipmann 4point light instrument various wenner and dipole dipole arrays provided information of electric resistivity changes at certain points of the year laboratory studies measuring volumetric water content versus electric resistivity of various rocks and soils resulted in three different ert hydrogeological zones besides the annual infiltration patterns tl ert also identified previously unknown permanent water storages as well as several areas acting as fast hydrological flow pathways most likely caused by pipe structures in the aeolianite specific aspects of the tl ert study could be correlated with the long term drip water monitoring and thus confirmed and extended the hydrogeological model of the area a resulting conceptual model of the flow pathways derived from ert surveys and cave water monitoring results is presented to visualise water flux from the surface to the ceiling of golgotha cave this includes annual recharge to 40 m depth in less than one hydrological year preferential flow paths to a persistent store of water and a time lag between soil moisture saturation and seasonal connection of karst stores that indicates a narrower window for seasonal recharge than indicated by soil moisture data keywords electric resistivity tomography ert cave monitoring karst hydrology karst critical zone ert hydrogeological zone 1 introduction 1 1 background in general karst features are highly heterogeneous fractured and complex geomorphic structures with varying degrees of permeability and hydrological flow pathways bradley et al 2010 carrière et al 2013 chalikakis et al 2011 determining the subsurface hydrology and structure of karst is often difficult due to the uniqueness and complexity of each karst system chalikakis et al 2011 gautam et al 2000 point and diffuse infiltration and subsequent ca solution leads to the formation of karst that can contain three categories of porosity such as solid to porous rocks joints and fractures and fluid conduits carrière et al 2013 ford williams 2007 the climate sensitive chemical signatures captured in individual stalagmites are particularly sensitive to the high level of variability in soil and rock characteristics hydrological flow pathways infiltration trajectory and cave morphology in an underlying karst region baker et al 2015 2000 chalikakis et al 2011 thus assessing and understanding the complex karst morphology as well as the associated hydrological flow patterns are essential for the interpretation of climate related chemical signals stored in stalagmites different methods are used to understand water movement in karst systems tracer experiments are frequently and successfully applied in various studies around the world benischke et al 2007 goldscheider 2015 goldscheider et al 2008 they provide a reliable way in understanding transit time and pathways of water from source to sampling point chemically stable and radioisotope tracers are commonly employed to track subsurface water movement these have the advantage of having a chemically distinct and unambiguous signal but require continuous follow up with high resolution monitoring and prior knowledge of the site in order to determine where to introduce the tracer to minimise potential dilution dispersion and chemical adsorption additionally tracers work best when soil is removed on the surface and the fluids are directly injected into the karst system goldscheider 2015 which is difficult to employ in ecologically sensitive areas especially in national parks dating dripwaters is another possibility to gain understanding of karst hydrology and flow paths usually radiometric isotopes are used for dating water however tritium for example is often too low in concentration and precise age estimates require measurement of the daughter isotope 3he which provides a challenge in cave environments owing to the potential for re equilibration between drip and cave air yamada et al 2008 furthermore radiocarbon 14c age measurements of water are challenging in limestone karst systems owing to dilution of the 14c 12c ratio by radioactively dead c from the limestone fohlmeister et al 2011 these methods also provide information on the transit time only and not necessarily the bigger hydrological picture overlaying the cave systems i e trajectory of water movement zones of water storage and hydrological connectivity throughout the system subsurface geophysics in particular 2d time lapse electrical resistivity tomography tl ert is considered a suitable method to investigate key hydrological and geological features from the wide application in contemporary karst studies campbell et al 2017 cardarelli et al 2006 carrière et al 2013 valois et al 2010 watlet et al 2018 ert is a minimum invasive advanced geophysical method used to measure the electrical resistivity of the targeted soil rock volume brunet et al 2010 loke 2014 samouëlian et al 2005 spatial and temporal variations in the electrical resistivity of subsurface matter can be utilised to distinguish the subsurface heterogeneities such as changes in sediment mineralogy and texture lithology water content temperature and salinity binley et al 1995 leopold et al 2013 park et al 2014 in the context of cavity studies variations in the electrical resistivity over time are often considered dependent to fluctuations in the water content due to the long term stability of the subsurface the strong contrast of resistivity values between water stores and air filled caves ensures ert is a suitable technique to map karst subsurface features carrière et al 2013 daily et al 1992 keshavarzi et al 2017 robert et al 2011 zhou et al 2002 studies have combined other geophysical methods such as ground penetrating radar gpr or electromagnetics em however gpr surveys in karst environments are often limited in exploration depth because residual clays attenuate the electromagnetic signal close to the surface anchuela et al 2009 additionally karst environments often include bare rough rock surfaces which contribute to poor contact with gpr antennae leading to subsequent post processing challenges 2d ert has been successfully used to monitor the variability of electrical resistivity to image subsurface hydrological features over time al hagrey 2007 binley et al 1995 brunet et al 2010 samouëlian et al 2005 vanderborght et al 2005 watlet et al 2018 changes of electrical resistivity over time can be also used as a tool to infer flow trajectory and water storage mixing pakzad et al 2008 for example al hagrey et al 1999 were able to document the large scale distribution and movement of infiltrating rainfall throughout the subsurface using time lapse ert similarly previous studies have tracked the migration of water in the subsurface from irrigation barker moore 1998 michot et al 2003 although 2d ert successfully detects the movement of large scale infiltration and flow there are few studies that aim to detect small scale flow pathways such as fractures and preferential flow pathways al hagrey et al 1999 chalikakis et al 2011 studies have also applied ert to delineate soil horizon and subsurface lithology from variations in electrical resistivity values michot et al 2003 zenone et al 2008 variations in the subsurface soil horizons and bedrock lithology are detected from the changes in electrical resistivity values due to the different permeability and water content of each material resistivity values tend to increase in karst features with a dense dry rock while they tend to decrease in regions with a more porous moist and partly saturated limestone chalikakis et al 2011 1 2 objectives this study applies 2d ert to investigate and monitor the subsurface hydrological and geological characteristics above a limestone cave in western australia 2d ert was conducted in a time lapse mode and combined with additional soil sedimentological and hydrological tests to understand the bigger picture of water flux from the surface to the ceiling of golgotha cave thus the objective of this study was to visualise water storage wetting fronts and potential preferential flow paths and document seasonal as well as year to year changes furthermore the tl ert was set to document the transit time and potential lag time to areas of the cave which are currently actively dripping vs dry ceiling areas results will help to conceptualise a model of the flow pathways derived from ert surveys and cave water monitoring results 2 material and methods golgotha cave 34 05 s 115 03 e fig 1 located 20 km south from margaret river in western australia was formed in the spearwood system hall marnham 2002 of the coastal dune aeolianite that was formed during the late quaternary lipar webb 2014 tapsell et al 2003 grimes 2006 the dune limestone contains a high matrix porosity that supports primary permeability in the karst layers bastian 1996 lipar webb 2014 grimes 2006 vacher mylroie 2002 karstification of this limestone is occurring syngenetically with the cementation of the limestone itself jennings 1968 augering of the shallow sands above the limestone at the cave site indicate an unconsolidated surface cover between 0 3 to at least 3 m thick the maximum length of the auger treble et al 2013 consisting predominantly of fine to coarse sand sized particles with a high permeability solution pipes of variable diameters and depths are a common phenomenon in the aeolianites of western australia in general and they are specifically documented in the nearby giants cave and caldardup cave at up to 40 m depth these pipes may act as vertical pathways with extremely high hydrological conductivity potentially concentrating water flow to deeper parts of the karst fig 2 this study site is located in a mediterranean type climate which is associated with wet and cool winters and dry and warm summers the nearest bureau of meteorology station is at forest grove station id 9547 approximately five km northeast of golgotha cave for which the 30 year climatological mean annual rainfall amount is 1136 mm of rainfall although 77 of annual rainfall is experienced in the cooler months between may and september bureau of meteorology 2020 modelled climate parameters for the cave location from the australian water availability project awap and the australian water resource assessment landscape model awra l datasets raupach et al 2011 viney and vaze 2015 are precipitation 1106 mm and precipitation minus actual evapotranspiration 877 mm calculated for the period 1961 1990 golgotha cave is located in the boranup forest which is a mixed wet eucalypt forest of karri and marri eucalyptus diversicolor and corymbia calophylla syn eucalyptus calophylla of 20 40 m canopy height tree roots are visible in the ceiling of golgotha cave at one location that is approximately 40 m deep golgotha cave lies above the regional groundwater table which can be expressed as standing water in caves at lower elevation in the region the forest surface above golgotha cave forms part of a south facing hillslope that intercepts rain bearing frontal systems from the southwest thick organic soil layers together with highly permeable sandy soils facilitate efficient drainage supported by observations of little surface runoff despite the up to 20 land surface slope at some parts soil water tension time series have been collected for this soil at multiple depths to 3 m at daily interval with some data gaps from 2006 with data from 2006 to 2012 presented in treble et al 2013 these soil moisture data indicate an annual pulse of water movement through the 3 m soil profile every austral winter with differences in timing due to antecedent climate conditions golgotha cave is accessed via a single doline type entrance at the base of a cliff that is roughly 20 m high the cave extends approximately 200 m into the hillside and consists of two main chambers fig 1 the chambers house the longitudinal cave monitoring study that began in 2005 treble et al 2013 2015 2016 two arrays of automated drip loggers were also installed in 2012 in each chamber mahmud et al 2016 2018 mahmud et al 2018 showed that four drip types could be classified the dominant drip discharge characteristic is a very slow continuous drip discharge indicating the importance of matrix porosity in the thick limestone formation drip sites where fracture flow was inferred generally had higher and more variable drip rates and exhibited a delayed threshold response of drip rate to the wet winter of 2013 in chamber 1 there was a greater spatial homogeneity of drip discharge with clusters of similarly classified drips compared to chamber 2 there a greater heterogeneity of flow paths were inferred morphological classification of stalactites using lidar based imagery was conducted to classify flow types as either matrix fracture or a combination of matrix fracture and conduit flow mahmud et al 2015 2016 using the mean drip discharge for each stalactite classification type mahmud et al 2016 calculated a mean water flux into the ceiling of the cave in chamber 1 this was 840 mm yr 1 per m2 and in in chamber 2 it was 1170 mm yr 1 per m2 with a greater proportion of active stalagmites in chamber 2 attributed to its lower relative elevation and the influence of hydraulic gradient on water movement in this area water balance considerations suggest that infiltration was focussed to specific areas of the cave ceiling and that the cave had a capillary fringe effect with less recharge entering the cave compared to the overlying surface infiltration the period of ert data overlap with data collected as part of the long term cave monitoring program conducted at golgotha cave these data are presented here as updated measurements coinciding with the ert surveys multiple ert survey lines line a to d compare fig 1 were established in order to determine both temporal and spatial information on water movement above and near the cave specific parameters of each line are given in tables 1 and 2 note line a and d are running along the same direction with line d providing a 100 m long high resolution 1 m electrode separation segment of line a 2 m electrode separation table 3 time lapse surveys line a f and line b table 2 were conducted over the long term monitoring locations above the cave chambers 1 and 2 respectively chamber 1 is the principle location that speleothem records are being developed for paleoclimate reconstruction line a and f also intersect the location of long term monitoring of soil moisture data treble et al 2013 the dc electric resistivity meter 4 point light hp from lippmann geophysical instruments lippmann 2008 was used in combination with 100 active electrodes electrodes consisted of 8 mm thick and 30 cm long stainless steel poles which remained in the ground for the time lapse survey during the study winter and spring surveys were conducted during sunny days in early afternoon and summer and autumn surveys took place during overcast days with cloud cover in the mornings in order to compensate surface temperature differences during the seasons as much as possible each measurement point of the combined wenner and dipole dipole arrays was repeated three times and values were recorded if they showed a difference below 1 resulting in 2779 data points for a 100 electrode section in case higher differences were observed points were repeated at least five times and subsequently averaged measurement points above 5 difference were subsequently deleted with less than 0 2 of all points removed geotest 2 50 geotest 2019 was used as acquisition software which also automatically regulated the conducted current usually between 1 ma and 50 ma with a measurement frequency of 4 16 hz resulting apparent resistivity values were exported to res2dinv from geotomo software loke 2014 where individual pseudo sections were inverted using a least mean square approach usually 4 7 iterations were conducted until the convergence limit of 2 was reached iterations initially started with a damping factor of 0 15 and finally with a minimum of 0 03 resulting in absolute differences of 2 8 between measured and calculated apparent resistivity values for time lapse analysis specific electric resistivity values were exported to ms excel for further calculations we used values of the driest condition as a reference to display changes between time series using equation 1 1 δ p logpo logpi 100 p0 highest observed resistivity value for each model cell pi resistivity value of comparing time step displaying results using the logarithm of resistivity values provides better visualisation of gradual spatial variation as suggested by watlet et al 2018 negative values indicate that the area experienced a decrease of resistivity between time steps which is consistent with increase of moisture during different seasons and vice versa additionally two rocks aeolianite 10 10 8 cm with different porosities from the cave s entrance cliff and a sample from the sandy surface soil were collected and tested for their electric resistivities in the laboratory under controlled temperature conditions 15 c stainless steel nails with a spacing of 1 5 cm were mounted on rock samples in 0 5 cm deep drill holes and used as electrodes to measure resistivity using a wenner array sediments and rocks were saturated with deionised water for 24 h and placed on a laboratory scale to measure weight loss due to evaporation over time electric resistivity values and weight loss were recorded hourly until weight losses neared zero volumetric moisture contents θ cm3 cm3 vs electric resistivity values were plotted for the three different rock soil types and fitted to a power law trendline since our intention was a relative comparison we avoided fitting the data to a petrophysical model such as archie s law archie 1942 by assuming 1 ro is uniform and displayed a simple power law relationship 3 results a sandy soil and two rock samples collected at the study site showed a strong power law correlation between volumetric water content θ and electric resistivity ωm with r2 values 0 9 compare fig 3 this is important information as it strengthens the interpretation of the time lapse study in a way that observed changes in resistivity will be caused by different volumetric water contents other factors influencing resistivity such as temperature were neglected for our study because thick vegetation and loose topsoil buffer heat fluxes and the variability of near surface temperatures was limited during the individual surveys compare table 2 treble et al 2015 also document a very stable cave temperature throughout the year further supporting the validity of this assumption additionally the electric conductivity of the water is assumed to be very constant during the year as drip water collection shows a low standard deviation for certain elements especially na which is linked to potential salt input via rainfall throughout the year treble et al 2016 differences in the materials and their porosities lead to different volumetric water contents for similar electric resistivity values in this case attempts to directly translate resistivity changes into water contents are difficult without precise geologic and stratigraphic knowledge of the survey line which we don t have at our site however additional rock samples from the cave ceilings showed similar porosities of 0 3 thus results of fig 3 are an important interpretation guide as we can expect sandy soils and porous rocks or zones with abundant cracks and pipe conduits will provide a large range of electric resistivity values over a season compared to dense rocks with a low porosity zones with constant resistivity values above 3000 ωm only experience a maximum of 1 change in volumetric water content over the year soils and porous rocks can be expected to display anything from 200 to 3000 ωm depending on the season and thus volumetric water contents θ between 0 02 and 0 25 cm3 cm3 compare fig 3 overall the following ert hydrogeological zones were identified z1 is a zone where large differences in electric resistivity were observed from as low as 100 ωm during the winter to more than 5000 ωm during the summer across the whole range of resistivity values identified in fig 3a c these values reflect the wetting and drying of near surface soils and porous rocks in accordance with the annual change in precipitation and temperature values are in accordance with similar sandy soils from western australia compare lowe et al 2017 z2 is a zone that reflects low resistivity values of less than 800 ωm and it is located below z1 the low values are more constant during the year and thus less connected to the timing of annual rainfall they reflect the steeper parts of the curves in fig 3a b however the resistivity values tend to decrease slightly during the summer indicating a lag time between infiltration and percolation of the winter rain at deeper parts of the survey lines z3 is a zone where electric resistivity values were above 3000 ωm throughout the year it reflects the flat parts of the curve in fig 3c and is interpreted as solid rock which allows limited water infiltration and percolation fig 4 displays the specific electric resistivity sections for different seasons between 2016 and 2017 for line a which runs from west to east for 198 m values ranged from 100 to 6000 ωm reflecting different materials and moisture regimes of the vadose zone compare fig 2 the ceiling of chamber 1 is located near the middle of the line at 30 m depth compare mahmud et al 2016 however no change of resistivity is registered at this depth and location putiška et al 2012 described similar difficulties in detecting caves using ert and linked it to highly conductive thin layers caused by moisture and clay accumulation around the caves in golgotha cave a palaeosol enriched in clay minerals and moisture is visible at the ceiling of chamber 1 treble et al 2016 which might cause a deformation of the equipotential lines and force the current flow around the cavity preventing the cave to appear in the ert sections mahmud et al 2016 calculated a water balance which indicates that about 20 of the water may be flowing around the cave with the cave ceiling acting as a capillary barrier providing a further explanation why the cave is not detected in the ert sections additionally by using ert the overall model sensitivity decreases with depth the western and eastern sides of the survey in fig 4 each display a zone of high resistivity la z3 in fig 4 starting at 6 to 8 m depth and extending through the surveyed depth for which the resistivity values are consistent throughout the year we interpret this zone as a more cemented rock below the soil zone similar to the description by lipar webb 2015 in contrast the upper 0 to 6 m as well as the central parts of the sections substantially change in electric resistivity over the year between 100 and 5000 ωm la z1 in fig 4 in general the la z1 showed low resistivity values during winter but increased towards summer which is consistent with earlier soil moisture time series treble et al 2013 from roughly 15 m depth in the central parts and 10 m depth in the eastern parts we observe resistivity values between 100 and 800 ωm la z2 in fig 4 la z2 is interpreted as a persistent store of water rather than a zone with higher clay contents since clay in the tamala limestone is associated with palaeosols that are restricted to 1 m thickness lipar webb 2014 however it is possible that either a palaeosol or older caprock layer is assisting the perched appearance of this feature the spatial extent and resistivity values of la z2 also varies intra and inter annually further supporting that this zone is depicting water storage hence la z2 is interpreted as aeolianite with relatively higher porosity and permeability which function as water storage and flow pathways throughout the year during the summer these low resistivity sections decrease in their electric resistivity value with greater depth indicating fluids moving through the vadose zone towards the cave to deeper sections at that time of the year in the centre of the line close to the cave la z2 extends to the depth of the cave ceiling this indicates permanent moist conditions particularly on the eastern side of the cave resistivity is relatively lower deeper in the profile beneath this store in february 2017 indicating increased water movement to lower depths approximately 6 months following infiltration this store of water becomes connected to seasonally infiltrating water evident during the winter in the august 2016 and august 2017 surveys this connection appears to be via a localised area of inflow from the surface around 120 m along the line it also appears to be connected to the shallow low resistivity section interpreted as water store on the eastern edge of the line which overlies an area of permanently high resistivity lines b and c are two additional 198 m long ert lines north of line a fig 5 these additional lines were set up to determine the extent of the identified water storage la z2 in line a and to further discuss if the observed water movement is mainly vertical and interflow downhill can be excluded line b runs approximately 25 m north of line a directly above chamber 2 of the cave which again could not be identified in the image similar to line a the 2d tomography allows the identification of three distinct zones separated by their specific resistivity values lb z3 is characterised by values larger than 3500 ωm during spring and summer and is interpreted as solid rocks that restrict water infiltration lb z1 which expands across the whole line down to about 6 8 m represents the zone of annual saturation during the winter and drying during the summer lb z2 represent areas that are permanently wet regardless of the season they are connected to the surface infiltration during the winter months and act as water storages for the cave however similar to line a the location of lb z2 is further to the east of the cave and appears to be hydrologically connected to the eastern but not the western part of the cave line c crosses the cave at the very northern end of chamber 2 and was set up to identify potential interflow along the hill into the permanently saturated zone of lb z2 the central part of the survey line is characterised by higher resistivity values lc z3 characteristically for more solid rocks the low resistivity zone z2 which was identified in line a and b is only vaguely present to the east of the cave but an additional more prominent z2 was identified at a deeper level to the west in line c the latter is likely to be located too far to the west of the cave to be hydrologically connected to chamber 2 comparing lines a c a common feature is a hydrologically connected and persistent water store to the eastern side of the cave z2 during august 2016 the homogenous infiltration down to 6 8 m is visible fig 6 central parts as well as areas to the west and mainly east have their driest condition during this time because the new rain has not yet percolated to these depths during november 2016 the near surface infiltration zone is less pronounced and spatially more heterogeneous with drier conditions on the surface in general deeper parts of the surveyed line show largely negative values with a very prominent near vertical area at around 160 m this zone is directly besides the area that was further above identified as near solid dry limestone it could be an important large preferential flow path into deeper parts of the karst in february 2017 near surface δ log resistivity values tend to zero indicating that hardly any moisture remains at 6 m depth fig 6 deeper down the profile small negative values indicate that most areas receive additional water this includes the rather dry parts of the west and east side interpreted as solid rocks with only small cracks however most noteworthy is that z2 areas that are already moist throughout the year receive additional moisture during summer when the water that infiltrated during the previous winter finally arrives at 40 m depth this pattern is largely repeated again in aug 2017 when the near surface wets up again and large areas further down remain moist with some additional water gain in general a continuous supply of water to the cave ceiling is documented and the survey confirms a lag of approximately up to 12 months after infiltration for the water to reach the cave ceiling however on the eastern side it looks as if preferential flow is established where water might be perched by the rather dense rock and directed towards the preferential flow area located at 160 m where it then infiltrates quickly into deeper parts of the karst to the east of the cave trees such as the karri endemic to the south west of western australia are known for their ability to create or aid the development of pipes in limestones grimes 2006 active living roots of these trees were observed in golgotha cave and in other caves in the region at depths of up to 40 m our measurement lines located several features throughout different times of the year where we expect vertical preferential flow paths most likely caused by sub surface pipes fig 7 depiction of such features was between 0 and 5 m depth where the resolution of the ert section is highest but they could not be detected at greater depth in general features associated with pipes are located more towards the east of the cave probably providing a fast hydrologic pathway to the more persistent subsurface water storage in this area as introduced above la z2 and lb z2 it must be noted that these features may be a combination of pipes and doline formations since some of the features seen in fig 6 are up to 2 m wide 4 discussion the time lapse ert survey reveals changes of electric resistivity values that can be linked to seasonal water movement consisting of a wetting front during each wet winter season it develops to a depth of up to 10 m ert hydrogeological zone z1 in lines a d during the following dry summer z1 mostly dries up reflecting a mediterranean type climate typical for the area charles et al 2010 vegetation with shallow roots does not have access to year round moisture especially in the upper 1 2 m and often dies or goes dormant during the summer parts of the annual recharge percolate to deeper depths during the months following winter and the tl ert surveys indicate downward water movement to the depth of the cave ceiling in less than one hydrological year we observed a reduction in resistivity values starting in november 2016 and continuing to february 2017 between 20 and 40 m depth in selected spatially variable areas ert hydrogeological zone z2 this resistivity reduction likely displays percolation of water in deeper karst stores mahmud et al 2016 observed a threshold response in drip rates from stalactites dominated by hydrological fracture pathways with a lag of 3 6 months after infiltration which is consistent with our observations of piston flow response to the percolation of water to deeper stores the water movement in deeper sections near the cave 40 m can continue during the following dry season but is decoupled from the surface infiltration as indicated during august 2017 fig 6c ert hydrogeological zone z2 near cave our automated drip loggers indicate that the net percolation at depth via fracture pathways depends on the amount of rainfall during the previous season mahmud et al 2016 see also fig 8 this is corroborated here in our tl ert study in the two years preceeding our ert survey 2014 and 2015 total annual rainfall for the cave site was relatively low 982 mm and 829 mm respectively 2015 was below the 5th percentile of the climatological mean drip rates from our drip loggers indicate that stored water feeding the cave system was declining during these dry years fig 8 our ert surveys began in 2016 a relatively wet year 1148 mm during which drip rates responded to this higher rainfall increasing from about november 2016 indicating enhanced recharge of karst stores in response to the 2016 wet season fig 8 this is evident in the ert images figs 4 and 6 in august 2016 the infiltration from this relatively wet winter season is still in the shallow zone la z1 fig 6a the subsequent percolation of this water is seen in fig 6b d comparing fig 6d with 6a shows that infiltration from the 2016 wet season has resulted in greater recharge saturation and spatial extent of saturation in zone la z2 and below this zone fig 6d compared with the previous hydrological year fig 6a the difference in drip rates associated with either fracture or conduit flow for fast dripping sites versus flow through the matrix for slow dripping sites was already described by mahmud et al 2015 2016 the spatial resolution of ert effectively displays both percolation types at a coarser resolution with slow matrix flow in soils and porous rocks and areas of focussed recharge that likely relate to water movement into and leakage from tubes and solutionally widened fractures ert was also able to display several large vertical features that most likely represent pipes described by grimes 2006 however the features displayed in figs 6 and 7 are between 1 and 2 m wide tests using resistivity modelling software res2dmod showed features with diameters smaller than 1 m fig 2 or cracks are below the horizontal resolution limit of the applied arrays and electrode spacing loke 2014 although features smaller than 1 m are known from other caves in the vicinity we assume that a cluster of smaller tubes as shown in fig 2b will lead to a zone with reduced specific electric resistivity values when filled with wet sediments time lapse ert at different locations shows there is a persistent store of water that is hydrologically connected to the eastern margin of the cave ert hydrogeological zone 2 in line a c it is supplying the eastern flanks of chambers 1 and 2 with greater water movement compared to the relatively drier areas of the western side of the cave this divided moisture regime with greater water flux and storage along the eastern flank of the cave is consistent with the general increase in drip rates towards the eastern wall mahmud et al 2016 2018 and our field observations of the density of cave calcite decorations as an indicator of flow paths fig 9 this large store is likely to consist of numerous interconnected stores fracture networks and zones of high porosity and permeability this is supported by our drip logger data that indicate individual flow paths indicated by different drip discharge characteristics such as base flow peak discharge and response to recharge in this area of the cave fig 8 mahmud et al 2016 2018 heterogeneity between drip data increases towards the stored water mapped in this study in contrast to greater spatial homogeneity in drip data elsewhere in the cave that are dominated by matrix flow mahmud et al 2018 comparing the proximity of this zone to the cave in lines a to c suggests that this large store of water is closer to the cave wall in chamber 2 lines b c fig 5 vs chamber 1 line a fig 4 this is also supported by the more extensive calcite decoration on the eastern wall and the typically higher drip rates of chamber 2 versus chamber 1 soil moisture data from 0 1 to 3 m depth were presented previously in treble et al 2013 fig 10 shows that the soil is saturated to a depth of 3 m each may 1 month which is in agreement with our ert data fig 4a however the deeper profile viewed in the tl ert data indicate that ert hydrogeological zone 2 does not connect to surface infiltration until several months after this suggests that the stored water is connected to surface infiltration for a shorter period than that suggested by the soil moisture data time series this is consistent with field and modelling studies that have demonstrated that the epikarst can be considered as a temporary water store williams 1983 that stores water for up to several months aquilina et al 2006 hartmann et al 2013 resulting in a lag between soil moisture saturation and peak recharge thus we suggest here that theautumn and early winter rain saturates thesoil zone upper epikarst permitting rain later in winter to contribute most volumetrically to recharge into the cave via preferential flow paths this has been simulated in lumped parameter modelling of cave drip water recharge in the european mediterranean karst with a modelled winter recharge bias explaining observed cave drip water δ18o values baker et al 2019 5 conclusions hydro chemical data derived via drip water collection and stalagmite analyses provide a powerful tool for cave monitoring and climate reconstruction however it is increasingly recognised from these data that the heterogeneity of karst hydrological systems can lead to spatial heterogeneity of hydro chemical data down to the scale of an individual percolating drip water site mixing of water through the interconnected karst voids is typically hard to constrain in cave studies and lateral input though interflow parallel to the surface can significantly blur signals from individual drip points in a cave knowledge about infiltration pathways and percolation times are therefore extremely important to understand the karst hydrology of infiltration waters to a cave system and evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of water movement and improve the interpretative power of potential climate and hydrological proxies such as δ18o and sr ca and mg ca elemental ratios at golgotha cave tl ert identified an annual wetting front in combination with several vertical preferential flow pathways via pipes in combination with the highly porous surface sand and the low slope angle makes lateral water movement via interflow unlikely tl ert data displaying variations in flow regime embellishes long term monitoring data for the cave which identified heterogeneities in water movement at the scale of cave chambers as well as individual drips but not the processes for this variability and improves confidence in our understanding of paleoclimate records contained within stalagmites from the cave this is the focus of our current research from our tl ert research at golgotha cave and long term monitoring at the cave and elsewhere we can now propose a toolkit for cave monitoring this includes surface weather station data

4944,this study provides the example of golgotha cave in the south west of western australia where previous long term hydrological geochemical and climate monitoring resulted in a theoretical hydrological model of the karst critical zone we test this model by presenting the results of a 1 5 year monitoring program above the cave using time lapse electric resistivity tomography tl ert between may 2016 and january 2018 several lines up to 200 m long were monitored using a 100 multi electrode lipmann 4point light instrument various wenner and dipole dipole arrays provided information of electric resistivity changes at certain points of the year laboratory studies measuring volumetric water content versus electric resistivity of various rocks and soils resulted in three different ert hydrogeological zones besides the annual infiltration patterns tl ert also identified previously unknown permanent water storages as well as several areas acting as fast hydrological flow pathways most likely caused by pipe structures in the aeolianite specific aspects of the tl ert study could be correlated with the long term drip water monitoring and thus confirmed and extended the hydrogeological model of the area a resulting conceptual model of the flow pathways derived from ert surveys and cave water monitoring results is presented to visualise water flux from the surface to the ceiling of golgotha cave this includes annual recharge to 40 m depth in less than one hydrological year preferential flow paths to a persistent store of water and a time lag between soil moisture saturation and seasonal connection of karst stores that indicates a narrower window for seasonal recharge than indicated by soil moisture data keywords electric resistivity tomography ert cave monitoring karst hydrology karst critical zone ert hydrogeological zone 1 introduction 1 1 background in general karst features are highly heterogeneous fractured and complex geomorphic structures with varying degrees of permeability and hydrological flow pathways bradley et al 2010 carrière et al 2013 chalikakis et al 2011 determining the subsurface hydrology and structure of karst is often difficult due to the uniqueness and complexity of each karst system chalikakis et al 2011 gautam et al 2000 point and diffuse infiltration and subsequent ca solution leads to the formation of karst that can contain three categories of porosity such as solid to porous rocks joints and fractures and fluid conduits carrière et al 2013 ford williams 2007 the climate sensitive chemical signatures captured in individual stalagmites are particularly sensitive to the high level of variability in soil and rock characteristics hydrological flow pathways infiltration trajectory and cave morphology in an underlying karst region baker et al 2015 2000 chalikakis et al 2011 thus assessing and understanding the complex karst morphology as well as the associated hydrological flow patterns are essential for the interpretation of climate related chemical signals stored in stalagmites different methods are used to understand water movement in karst systems tracer experiments are frequently and successfully applied in various studies around the world benischke et al 2007 goldscheider 2015 goldscheider et al 2008 they provide a reliable way in understanding transit time and pathways of water from source to sampling point chemically stable and radioisotope tracers are commonly employed to track subsurface water movement these have the advantage of having a chemically distinct and unambiguous signal but require continuous follow up with high resolution monitoring and prior knowledge of the site in order to determine where to introduce the tracer to minimise potential dilution dispersion and chemical adsorption additionally tracers work best when soil is removed on the surface and the fluids are directly injected into the karst system goldscheider 2015 which is difficult to employ in ecologically sensitive areas especially in national parks dating dripwaters is another possibility to gain understanding of karst hydrology and flow paths usually radiometric isotopes are used for dating water however tritium for example is often too low in concentration and precise age estimates require measurement of the daughter isotope 3he which provides a challenge in cave environments owing to the potential for re equilibration between drip and cave air yamada et al 2008 furthermore radiocarbon 14c age measurements of water are challenging in limestone karst systems owing to dilution of the 14c 12c ratio by radioactively dead c from the limestone fohlmeister et al 2011 these methods also provide information on the transit time only and not necessarily the bigger hydrological picture overlaying the cave systems i e trajectory of water movement zones of water storage and hydrological connectivity throughout the system subsurface geophysics in particular 2d time lapse electrical resistivity tomography tl ert is considered a suitable method to investigate key hydrological and geological features from the wide application in contemporary karst studies campbell et al 2017 cardarelli et al 2006 carrière et al 2013 valois et al 2010 watlet et al 2018 ert is a minimum invasive advanced geophysical method used to measure the electrical resistivity of the targeted soil rock volume brunet et al 2010 loke 2014 samouëlian et al 2005 spatial and temporal variations in the electrical resistivity of subsurface matter can be utilised to distinguish the subsurface heterogeneities such as changes in sediment mineralogy and texture lithology water content temperature and salinity binley et al 1995 leopold et al 2013 park et al 2014 in the context of cavity studies variations in the electrical resistivity over time are often considered dependent to fluctuations in the water content due to the long term stability of the subsurface the strong contrast of resistivity values between water stores and air filled caves ensures ert is a suitable technique to map karst subsurface features carrière et al 2013 daily et al 1992 keshavarzi et al 2017 robert et al 2011 zhou et al 2002 studies have combined other geophysical methods such as ground penetrating radar gpr or electromagnetics em however gpr surveys in karst environments are often limited in exploration depth because residual clays attenuate the electromagnetic signal close to the surface anchuela et al 2009 additionally karst environments often include bare rough rock surfaces which contribute to poor contact with gpr antennae leading to subsequent post processing challenges 2d ert has been successfully used to monitor the variability of electrical resistivity to image subsurface hydrological features over time al hagrey 2007 binley et al 1995 brunet et al 2010 samouëlian et al 2005 vanderborght et al 2005 watlet et al 2018 changes of electrical resistivity over time can be also used as a tool to infer flow trajectory and water storage mixing pakzad et al 2008 for example al hagrey et al 1999 were able to document the large scale distribution and movement of infiltrating rainfall throughout the subsurface using time lapse ert similarly previous studies have tracked the migration of water in the subsurface from irrigation barker moore 1998 michot et al 2003 although 2d ert successfully detects the movement of large scale infiltration and flow there are few studies that aim to detect small scale flow pathways such as fractures and preferential flow pathways al hagrey et al 1999 chalikakis et al 2011 studies have also applied ert to delineate soil horizon and subsurface lithology from variations in electrical resistivity values michot et al 2003 zenone et al 2008 variations in the subsurface soil horizons and bedrock lithology are detected from the changes in electrical resistivity values due to the different permeability and water content of each material resistivity values tend to increase in karst features with a dense dry rock while they tend to decrease in regions with a more porous moist and partly saturated limestone chalikakis et al 2011 1 2 objectives this study applies 2d ert to investigate and monitor the subsurface hydrological and geological characteristics above a limestone cave in western australia 2d ert was conducted in a time lapse mode and combined with additional soil sedimentological and hydrological tests to understand the bigger picture of water flux from the surface to the ceiling of golgotha cave thus the objective of this study was to visualise water storage wetting fronts and potential preferential flow paths and document seasonal as well as year to year changes furthermore the tl ert was set to document the transit time and potential lag time to areas of the cave which are currently actively dripping vs dry ceiling areas results will help to conceptualise a model of the flow pathways derived from ert surveys and cave water monitoring results 2 material and methods golgotha cave 34 05 s 115 03 e fig 1 located 20 km south from margaret river in western australia was formed in the spearwood system hall marnham 2002 of the coastal dune aeolianite that was formed during the late quaternary lipar webb 2014 tapsell et al 2003 grimes 2006 the dune limestone contains a high matrix porosity that supports primary permeability in the karst layers bastian 1996 lipar webb 2014 grimes 2006 vacher mylroie 2002 karstification of this limestone is occurring syngenetically with the cementation of the limestone itself jennings 1968 augering of the shallow sands above the limestone at the cave site indicate an unconsolidated surface cover between 0 3 to at least 3 m thick the maximum length of the auger treble et al 2013 consisting predominantly of fine to coarse sand sized particles with a high permeability solution pipes of variable diameters and depths are a common phenomenon in the aeolianites of western australia in general and they are specifically documented in the nearby giants cave and caldardup cave at up to 40 m depth these pipes may act as vertical pathways with extremely high hydrological conductivity potentially concentrating water flow to deeper parts of the karst fig 2 this study site is located in a mediterranean type climate which is associated with wet and cool winters and dry and warm summers the nearest bureau of meteorology station is at forest grove station id 9547 approximately five km northeast of golgotha cave for which the 30 year climatological mean annual rainfall amount is 1136 mm of rainfall although 77 of annual rainfall is experienced in the cooler months between may and september bureau of meteorology 2020 modelled climate parameters for the cave location from the australian water availability project awap and the australian water resource assessment landscape model awra l datasets raupach et al 2011 viney and vaze 2015 are precipitation 1106 mm and precipitation minus actual evapotranspiration 877 mm calculated for the period 1961 1990 golgotha cave is located in the boranup forest which is a mixed wet eucalypt forest of karri and marri eucalyptus diversicolor and corymbia calophylla syn eucalyptus calophylla of 20 40 m canopy height tree roots are visible in the ceiling of golgotha cave at one location that is approximately 40 m deep golgotha cave lies above the regional groundwater table which can be expressed as standing water in caves at lower elevation in the region the forest surface above golgotha cave forms part of a south facing hillslope that intercepts rain bearing frontal systems from the southwest thick organic soil layers together with highly permeable sandy soils facilitate efficient drainage supported by observations of little surface runoff despite the up to 20 land surface slope at some parts soil water tension time series have been collected for this soil at multiple depths to 3 m at daily interval with some data gaps from 2006 with data from 2006 to 2012 presented in treble et al 2013 these soil moisture data indicate an annual pulse of water movement through the 3 m soil profile every austral winter with differences in timing due to antecedent climate conditions golgotha cave is accessed via a single doline type entrance at the base of a cliff that is roughly 20 m high the cave extends approximately 200 m into the hillside and consists of two main chambers fig 1 the chambers house the longitudinal cave monitoring study that began in 2005 treble et al 2013 2015 2016 two arrays of automated drip loggers were also installed in 2012 in each chamber mahmud et al 2016 2018 mahmud et al 2018 showed that four drip types could be classified the dominant drip discharge characteristic is a very slow continuous drip discharge indicating the importance of matrix porosity in the thick limestone formation drip sites where fracture flow was inferred generally had higher and more variable drip rates and exhibited a delayed threshold response of drip rate to the wet winter of 2013 in chamber 1 there was a greater spatial homogeneity of drip discharge with clusters of similarly classified drips compared to chamber 2 there a greater heterogeneity of flow paths were inferred morphological classification of stalactites using lidar based imagery was conducted to classify flow types as either matrix fracture or a combination of matrix fracture and conduit flow mahmud et al 2015 2016 using the mean drip discharge for each stalactite classification type mahmud et al 2016 calculated a mean water flux into the ceiling of the cave in chamber 1 this was 840 mm yr 1 per m2 and in in chamber 2 it was 1170 mm yr 1 per m2 with a greater proportion of active stalagmites in chamber 2 attributed to its lower relative elevation and the influence of hydraulic gradient on water movement in this area water balance considerations suggest that infiltration was focussed to specific areas of the cave ceiling and that the cave had a capillary fringe effect with less recharge entering the cave compared to the overlying surface infiltration the period of ert data overlap with data collected as part of the long term cave monitoring program conducted at golgotha cave these data are presented here as updated measurements coinciding with the ert surveys multiple ert survey lines line a to d compare fig 1 were established in order to determine both temporal and spatial information on water movement above and near the cave specific parameters of each line are given in tables 1 and 2 note line a and d are running along the same direction with line d providing a 100 m long high resolution 1 m electrode separation segment of line a 2 m electrode separation table 3 time lapse surveys line a f and line b table 2 were conducted over the long term monitoring locations above the cave chambers 1 and 2 respectively chamber 1 is the principle location that speleothem records are being developed for paleoclimate reconstruction line a and f also intersect the location of long term monitoring of soil moisture data treble et al 2013 the dc electric resistivity meter 4 point light hp from lippmann geophysical instruments lippmann 2008 was used in combination with 100 active electrodes electrodes consisted of 8 mm thick and 30 cm long stainless steel poles which remained in the ground for the time lapse survey during the study winter and spring surveys were conducted during sunny days in early afternoon and summer and autumn surveys took place during overcast days with cloud cover in the mornings in order to compensate surface temperature differences during the seasons as much as possible each measurement point of the combined wenner and dipole dipole arrays was repeated three times and values were recorded if they showed a difference below 1 resulting in 2779 data points for a 100 electrode section in case higher differences were observed points were repeated at least five times and subsequently averaged measurement points above 5 difference were subsequently deleted with less than 0 2 of all points removed geotest 2 50 geotest 2019 was used as acquisition software which also automatically regulated the conducted current usually between 1 ma and 50 ma with a measurement frequency of 4 16 hz resulting apparent resistivity values were exported to res2dinv from geotomo software loke 2014 where individual pseudo sections were inverted using a least mean square approach usually 4 7 iterations were conducted until the convergence limit of 2 was reached iterations initially started with a damping factor of 0 15 and finally with a minimum of 0 03 resulting in absolute differences of 2 8 between measured and calculated apparent resistivity values for time lapse analysis specific electric resistivity values were exported to ms excel for further calculations we used values of the driest condition as a reference to display changes between time series using equation 1 1 δ p logpo logpi 100 p0 highest observed resistivity value for each model cell pi resistivity value of comparing time step displaying results using the logarithm of resistivity values provides better visualisation of gradual spatial variation as suggested by watlet et al 2018 negative values indicate that the area experienced a decrease of resistivity between time steps which is consistent with increase of moisture during different seasons and vice versa additionally two rocks aeolianite 10 10 8 cm with different porosities from the cave s entrance cliff and a sample from the sandy surface soil were collected and tested for their electric resistivities in the laboratory under controlled temperature conditions 15 c stainless steel nails with a spacing of 1 5 cm were mounted on rock samples in 0 5 cm deep drill holes and used as electrodes to measure resistivity using a wenner array sediments and rocks were saturated with deionised water for 24 h and placed on a laboratory scale to measure weight loss due to evaporation over time electric resistivity values and weight loss were recorded hourly until weight losses neared zero volumetric moisture contents θ cm3 cm3 vs electric resistivity values were plotted for the three different rock soil types and fitted to a power law trendline since our intention was a relative comparison we avoided fitting the data to a petrophysical model such as archie s law archie 1942 by assuming 1 ro is uniform and displayed a simple power law relationship 3 results a sandy soil and two rock samples collected at the study site showed a strong power law correlation between volumetric water content θ and electric resistivity ωm with r2 values 0 9 compare fig 3 this is important information as it strengthens the interpretation of the time lapse study in a way that observed changes in resistivity will be caused by different volumetric water contents other factors influencing resistivity such as temperature were neglected for our study because thick vegetation and loose topsoil buffer heat fluxes and the variability of near surface temperatures was limited during the individual surveys compare table 2 treble et al 2015 also document a very stable cave temperature throughout the year further supporting the validity of this assumption additionally the electric conductivity of the water is assumed to be very constant during the year as drip water collection shows a low standard deviation for certain elements especially na which is linked to potential salt input via rainfall throughout the year treble et al 2016 differences in the materials and their porosities lead to different volumetric water contents for similar electric resistivity values in this case attempts to directly translate resistivity changes into water contents are difficult without precise geologic and stratigraphic knowledge of the survey line which we don t have at our site however additional rock samples from the cave ceilings showed similar porosities of 0 3 thus results of fig 3 are an important interpretation guide as we can expect sandy soils and porous rocks or zones with abundant cracks and pipe conduits will provide a large range of electric resistivity values over a season compared to dense rocks with a low porosity zones with constant resistivity values above 3000 ωm only experience a maximum of 1 change in volumetric water content over the year soils and porous rocks can be expected to display anything from 200 to 3000 ωm depending on the season and thus volumetric water contents θ between 0 02 and 0 25 cm3 cm3 compare fig 3 overall the following ert hydrogeological zones were identified z1 is a zone where large differences in electric resistivity were observed from as low as 100 ωm during the winter to more than 5000 ωm during the summer across the whole range of resistivity values identified in fig 3a c these values reflect the wetting and drying of near surface soils and porous rocks in accordance with the annual change in precipitation and temperature values are in accordance with similar sandy soils from western australia compare lowe et al 2017 z2 is a zone that reflects low resistivity values of less than 800 ωm and it is located below z1 the low values are more constant during the year and thus less connected to the timing of annual rainfall they reflect the steeper parts of the curves in fig 3a b however the resistivity values tend to decrease slightly during the summer indicating a lag time between infiltration and percolation of the winter rain at deeper parts of the survey lines z3 is a zone where electric resistivity values were above 3000 ωm throughout the year it reflects the flat parts of the curve in fig 3c and is interpreted as solid rock which allows limited water infiltration and percolation fig 4 displays the specific electric resistivity sections for different seasons between 2016 and 2017 for line a which runs from west to east for 198 m values ranged from 100 to 6000 ωm reflecting different materials and moisture regimes of the vadose zone compare fig 2 the ceiling of chamber 1 is located near the middle of the line at 30 m depth compare mahmud et al 2016 however no change of resistivity is registered at this depth and location putiška et al 2012 described similar difficulties in detecting caves using ert and linked it to highly conductive thin layers caused by moisture and clay accumulation around the caves in golgotha cave a palaeosol enriched in clay minerals and moisture is visible at the ceiling of chamber 1 treble et al 2016 which might cause a deformation of the equipotential lines and force the current flow around the cavity preventing the cave to appear in the ert sections mahmud et al 2016 calculated a water balance which indicates that about 20 of the water may be flowing around the cave with the cave ceiling acting as a capillary barrier providing a further explanation why the cave is not detected in the ert sections additionally by using ert the overall model sensitivity decreases with depth the western and eastern sides of the survey in fig 4 each display a zone of high resistivity la z3 in fig 4 starting at 6 to 8 m depth and extending through the surveyed depth for which the resistivity values are consistent throughout the year we interpret this zone as a more cemented rock below the soil zone similar to the description by lipar webb 2015 in contrast the upper 0 to 6 m as well as the central parts of the sections substantially change in electric resistivity over the year between 100 and 5000 ωm la z1 in fig 4 in general the la z1 showed low resistivity values during winter but increased towards summer which is consistent with earlier soil moisture time series treble et al 2013 from roughly 15 m depth in the central parts and 10 m depth in the eastern parts we observe resistivity values between 100 and 800 ωm la z2 in fig 4 la z2 is interpreted as a persistent store of water rather than a zone with higher clay contents since clay in the tamala limestone is associated with palaeosols that are restricted to 1 m thickness lipar webb 2014 however it is possible that either a palaeosol or older caprock layer is assisting the perched appearance of this feature the spatial extent and resistivity values of la z2 also varies intra and inter annually further supporting that this zone is depicting water storage hence la z2 is interpreted as aeolianite with relatively higher porosity and permeability which function as water storage and flow pathways throughout the year during the summer these low resistivity sections decrease in their electric resistivity value with greater depth indicating fluids moving through the vadose zone towards the cave to deeper sections at that time of the year in the centre of the line close to the cave la z2 extends to the depth of the cave ceiling this indicates permanent moist conditions particularly on the eastern side of the cave resistivity is relatively lower deeper in the profile beneath this store in february 2017 indicating increased water movement to lower depths approximately 6 months following infiltration this store of water becomes connected to seasonally infiltrating water evident during the winter in the august 2016 and august 2017 surveys this connection appears to be via a localised area of inflow from the surface around 120 m along the line it also appears to be connected to the shallow low resistivity section interpreted as water store on the eastern edge of the line which overlies an area of permanently high resistivity lines b and c are two additional 198 m long ert lines north of line a fig 5 these additional lines were set up to determine the extent of the identified water storage la z2 in line a and to further discuss if the observed water movement is mainly vertical and interflow downhill can be excluded line b runs approximately 25 m north of line a directly above chamber 2 of the cave which again could not be identified in the image similar to line a the 2d tomography allows the identification of three distinct zones separated by their specific resistivity values lb z3 is characterised by values larger than 3500 ωm during spring and summer and is interpreted as solid rocks that restrict water infiltration lb z1 which expands across the whole line down to about 6 8 m represents the zone of annual saturation during the winter and drying during the summer lb z2 represent areas that are permanently wet regardless of the season they are connected to the surface infiltration during the winter months and act as water storages for the cave however similar to line a the location of lb z2 is further to the east of the cave and appears to be hydrologically connected to the eastern but not the western part of the cave line c crosses the cave at the very northern end of chamber 2 and was set up to identify potential interflow along the hill into the permanently saturated zone of lb z2 the central part of the survey line is characterised by higher resistivity values lc z3 characteristically for more solid rocks the low resistivity zone z2 which was identified in line a and b is only vaguely present to the east of the cave but an additional more prominent z2 was identified at a deeper level to the west in line c the latter is likely to be located too far to the west of the cave to be hydrologically connected to chamber 2 comparing lines a c a common feature is a hydrologically connected and persistent water store to the eastern side of the cave z2 during august 2016 the homogenous infiltration down to 6 8 m is visible fig 6 central parts as well as areas to the west and mainly east have their driest condition during this time because the new rain has not yet percolated to these depths during november 2016 the near surface infiltration zone is less pronounced and spatially more heterogeneous with drier conditions on the surface in general deeper parts of the surveyed line show largely negative values with a very prominent near vertical area at around 160 m this zone is directly besides the area that was further above identified as near solid dry limestone it could be an important large preferential flow path into deeper parts of the karst in february 2017 near surface δ log resistivity values tend to zero indicating that hardly any moisture remains at 6 m depth fig 6 deeper down the profile small negative values indicate that most areas receive additional water this includes the rather dry parts of the west and east side interpreted as solid rocks with only small cracks however most noteworthy is that z2 areas that are already moist throughout the year receive additional moisture during summer when the water that infiltrated during the previous winter finally arrives at 40 m depth this pattern is largely repeated again in aug 2017 when the near surface wets up again and large areas further down remain moist with some additional water gain in general a continuous supply of water to the cave ceiling is documented and the survey confirms a lag of approximately up to 12 months after infiltration for the water to reach the cave ceiling however on the eastern side it looks as if preferential flow is established where water might be perched by the rather dense rock and directed towards the preferential flow area located at 160 m where it then infiltrates quickly into deeper parts of the karst to the east of the cave trees such as the karri endemic to the south west of western australia are known for their ability to create or aid the development of pipes in limestones grimes 2006 active living roots of these trees were observed in golgotha cave and in other caves in the region at depths of up to 40 m our measurement lines located several features throughout different times of the year where we expect vertical preferential flow paths most likely caused by sub surface pipes fig 7 depiction of such features was between 0 and 5 m depth where the resolution of the ert section is highest but they could not be detected at greater depth in general features associated with pipes are located more towards the east of the cave probably providing a fast hydrologic pathway to the more persistent subsurface water storage in this area as introduced above la z2 and lb z2 it must be noted that these features may be a combination of pipes and doline formations since some of the features seen in fig 6 are up to 2 m wide 4 discussion the time lapse ert survey reveals changes of electric resistivity values that can be linked to seasonal water movement consisting of a wetting front during each wet winter season it develops to a depth of up to 10 m ert hydrogeological zone z1 in lines a d during the following dry summer z1 mostly dries up reflecting a mediterranean type climate typical for the area charles et al 2010 vegetation with shallow roots does not have access to year round moisture especially in the upper 1 2 m and often dies or goes dormant during the summer parts of the annual recharge percolate to deeper depths during the months following winter and the tl ert surveys indicate downward water movement to the depth of the cave ceiling in less than one hydrological year we observed a reduction in resistivity values starting in november 2016 and continuing to february 2017 between 20 and 40 m depth in selected spatially variable areas ert hydrogeological zone z2 this resistivity reduction likely displays percolation of water in deeper karst stores mahmud et al 2016 observed a threshold response in drip rates from stalactites dominated by hydrological fracture pathways with a lag of 3 6 months after infiltration which is consistent with our observations of piston flow response to the percolation of water to deeper stores the water movement in deeper sections near the cave 40 m can continue during the following dry season but is decoupled from the surface infiltration as indicated during august 2017 fig 6c ert hydrogeological zone z2 near cave our automated drip loggers indicate that the net percolation at depth via fracture pathways depends on the amount of rainfall during the previous season mahmud et al 2016 see also fig 8 this is corroborated here in our tl ert study in the two years preceeding our ert survey 2014 and 2015 total annual rainfall for the cave site was relatively low 982 mm and 829 mm respectively 2015 was below the 5th percentile of the climatological mean drip rates from our drip loggers indicate that stored water feeding the cave system was declining during these dry years fig 8 our ert surveys began in 2016 a relatively wet year 1148 mm during which drip rates responded to this higher rainfall increasing from about november 2016 indicating enhanced recharge of karst stores in response to the 2016 wet season fig 8 this is evident in the ert images figs 4 and 6 in august 2016 the infiltration from this relatively wet winter season is still in the shallow zone la z1 fig 6a the subsequent percolation of this water is seen in fig 6b d comparing fig 6d with 6a shows that infiltration from the 2016 wet season has resulted in greater recharge saturation and spatial extent of saturation in zone la z2 and below this zone fig 6d compared with the previous hydrological year fig 6a the difference in drip rates associated with either fracture or conduit flow for fast dripping sites versus flow through the matrix for slow dripping sites was already described by mahmud et al 2015 2016 the spatial resolution of ert effectively displays both percolation types at a coarser resolution with slow matrix flow in soils and porous rocks and areas of focussed recharge that likely relate to water movement into and leakage from tubes and solutionally widened fractures ert was also able to display several large vertical features that most likely represent pipes described by grimes 2006 however the features displayed in figs 6 and 7 are between 1 and 2 m wide tests using resistivity modelling software res2dmod showed features with diameters smaller than 1 m fig 2 or cracks are below the horizontal resolution limit of the applied arrays and electrode spacing loke 2014 although features smaller than 1 m are known from other caves in the vicinity we assume that a cluster of smaller tubes as shown in fig 2b will lead to a zone with reduced specific electric resistivity values when filled with wet sediments time lapse ert at different locations shows there is a persistent store of water that is hydrologically connected to the eastern margin of the cave ert hydrogeological zone 2 in line a c it is supplying the eastern flanks of chambers 1 and 2 with greater water movement compared to the relatively drier areas of the western side of the cave this divided moisture regime with greater water flux and storage along the eastern flank of the cave is consistent with the general increase in drip rates towards the eastern wall mahmud et al 2016 2018 and our field observations of the density of cave calcite decorations as an indicator of flow paths fig 9 this large store is likely to consist of numerous interconnected stores fracture networks and zones of high porosity and permeability this is supported by our drip logger data that indicate individual flow paths indicated by different drip discharge characteristics such as base flow peak discharge and response to recharge in this area of the cave fig 8 mahmud et al 2016 2018 heterogeneity between drip data increases towards the stored water mapped in this study in contrast to greater spatial homogeneity in drip data elsewhere in the cave that are dominated by matrix flow mahmud et al 2018 comparing the proximity of this zone to the cave in lines a to c suggests that this large store of water is closer to the cave wall in chamber 2 lines b c fig 5 vs chamber 1 line a fig 4 this is also supported by the more extensive calcite decoration on the eastern wall and the typically higher drip rates of chamber 2 versus chamber 1 soil moisture data from 0 1 to 3 m depth were presented previously in treble et al 2013 fig 10 shows that the soil is saturated to a depth of 3 m each may 1 month which is in agreement with our ert data fig 4a however the deeper profile viewed in the tl ert data indicate that ert hydrogeological zone 2 does not connect to surface infiltration until several months after this suggests that the stored water is connected to surface infiltration for a shorter period than that suggested by the soil moisture data time series this is consistent with field and modelling studies that have demonstrated that the epikarst can be considered as a temporary water store williams 1983 that stores water for up to several months aquilina et al 2006 hartmann et al 2013 resulting in a lag between soil moisture saturation and peak recharge thus we suggest here that theautumn and early winter rain saturates thesoil zone upper epikarst permitting rain later in winter to contribute most volumetrically to recharge into the cave via preferential flow paths this has been simulated in lumped parameter modelling of cave drip water recharge in the european mediterranean karst with a modelled winter recharge bias explaining observed cave drip water δ18o values baker et al 2019 5 conclusions hydro chemical data derived via drip water collection and stalagmite analyses provide a powerful tool for cave monitoring and climate reconstruction however it is increasingly recognised from these data that the heterogeneity of karst hydrological systems can lead to spatial heterogeneity of hydro chemical data down to the scale of an individual percolating drip water site mixing of water through the interconnected karst voids is typically hard to constrain in cave studies and lateral input though interflow parallel to the surface can significantly blur signals from individual drip points in a cave knowledge about infiltration pathways and percolation times are therefore extremely important to understand the karst hydrology of infiltration waters to a cave system and evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of water movement and improve the interpretative power of potential climate and hydrological proxies such as δ18o and sr ca and mg ca elemental ratios at golgotha cave tl ert identified an annual wetting front in combination with several vertical preferential flow pathways via pipes in combination with the highly porous surface sand and the low slope angle makes lateral water movement via interflow unlikely tl ert data displaying variations in flow regime embellishes long term monitoring data for the cave which identified heterogeneities in water movement at the scale of cave chambers as well as individual drips but not the processes for this variability and improves confidence in our understanding of paleoclimate records contained within stalagmites from the cave this is the focus of our current research from our tl ert research at golgotha cave and long term monitoring at the cave and elsewhere we can now propose a toolkit for cave monitoring this includes surface weather station data
