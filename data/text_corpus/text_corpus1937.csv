9685,many algorithms for surface energy balance seb based on remote sensing rs have been advanced to determine evapotranspiration et these algorithms were developed for specific conditions e g sensors land use and crop management in which functions and empirical parameters within its algorithms concur with those conditions therefore this study aims to develop a seb rs algorithm for retrieving et adjusted to in situ observations the study was conducted in two experimental fields in brazil with the crops jatropha curcas maize soybean and sugarcane we used multispectral images from the orbital sensors operational land imager oli and thermal infrared sensor tirs coupled in landsat 8 satellite and from the terrestrial sensor altum on board of an unmanned aerial vehicle the proposed algorithm termed as ground truthed surface energy balance gt seb is based on physical formulation of seb rs algorithms where two extra computational processes using in situ et observations were proposed for originating the new algorithm the first additional process for optimizing the automatic anchor pixels selection and another for algorithm parameters optimization thus both processes aim to reduce the difference between the observed et and estimated by gt seb being assessed for both orbital oli tirs and suborbital altum sensors the gt seb yielded excellent results root mean square error rmse 0 48 mm and modified kling gupta efficiency kge 0 92 in addition to gt seb being an optimized algorithm it uses a classic parameterization of seb rs algorithms providing efficiency and scalability for other remote sensors climates and surfaces keywords irrigation geoprocessing data driven precision agriculture 1 introduction it has been established that around 70 of all the water used for human activities goes for agricultural irrigation food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2021 irrigation is fundamental for agricultural production as the escalating demand for food will require expanding agriculture to areas receiving low and irregular rainfall in terms of the correct way to plan and manage an irrigation systems one of the urgent needs is to well estimate the crop water consumption evapotranspiration et is the quantity of water released to the atmosphere via the processes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration which represents the water used by crops allen et al 1998 the et estimation can be achieved through a variety of methods such as class a evaporation pan bosman 1987 lysimeters paul et al 2013 bowen ratio bowen 1926 eddy covariance swinbank 1951 and by physical mathematical models such as penman monteith allen et al 1998 and thornthwaite thornthwaite and mather 1955 however these methods give spatial punctual estimates according to the data received from the measurement devices although these punctual estimates can be spatially interpolated a thorough understanding of the factors like treatments and crop growth stages are required to provide increased accuracy al zayed 2016 indeed it is not easy to evaluate these factors in widespread areas which support high crop diversity allen et al 2011 toward the orbital remote sensors used for estimating et we can highlight the sensors of the landsat satellites by the wide employment bastiaanssen et al 2005 teixeira et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 al zayed 2016 bhattarai et al 2017 jaafar and ahmad 2020 currently the most modern sensors in the landsat program are the operational land imager oli and the thermal infrared sensor tirs on board the landsat 8 satellite also the landsat 9 satellite was launched on 27 september 2021 having the oli 2 and tirs 2 sensors on board in spite of being important for et mapping the sensors oli tirs have a spatial i e 30 m and temporal i e 16 day resolution coarser than the recommended for irrigation management including et mapping and precision agriculture xia et al 2016 friedl 2018 suborbital remote sensing allowed by unmanned aerial vehicles uav and multispectral sensors have been used to provide the needed spatial and temporal frequency for prescribing the water consumption of the crops for irrigation assessments gago et al 2015 radoglou grammatikis et al 2020 chávez et al 2020 for instance the altum sensor micasense seattle usa showed interesting features with high resolution multispectral bands in the visible near infrared and thermal i e the bands required for employment of surface energy balance seb based on remote sensing rs algorithms several seb rs algorithms are available for estimating et such as two source energy balance model tseb norman et al 1995 surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 simplified surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop senay et al 2015 most of these algorithms require the user to select anchor pixels with extreme temperature and vegetation conditions for instance a cold pixel should be selected in a healthy fully vegetated and well watered field as well as a hot pixel in a dry bare soil field to calibrate the model internally manual selection of pixels can cause bias in et estimates and there is always the probability that more than one pair of anchor pixels satisfy the boundary conditions in one image moreover generating et times series is almost impracticable due to the time consuming process of manually searching and selecting the anchor pixels jaafar and ahmad 2020 in the last decade seb rs algorithms have been employed to different types of sensors climates and surfaces paul et al 2013 hoffmann et al 2016 quebrajo et al 2017 costa et al 2019 blatchford et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however the applicability of these algorithms are restricted to the sensors climates and surfaces in which they were formulated a seb rs algorithm optimized by in situ observations of et may provide a general functionality applicable to a variety of cropping systems thus this work intends to i propose a new seb rs algorithm in situ optimized by et observations and ii evaluate it for the state of the art orbital and suborbital remote sensors oli tirs and altum respectively the article is structured as follows first section 2 presents the study area datasets and methodology employed to formulate and evaluate the new algorithm termed ground truthed surface energy balance gt seb next section 3 presents the

intervals and published in real time on the internet at the guia clima website http www cpao embrapa br clima http www cpao embrapa br clima the in situ observations of et for jatropha curcas sugarcane and maize crops were obtained by the ratio between the mass variation determined by the lysimeters weighing system and their surface areas due to the weather station standard broad grassy surface modern and calibrated sensors we assumed that the reference evapotranspiration et0 estimates ascertained by the penman monteith model allen et al 1998 as being in situ observations as for soybean crop the in situ observations of et were obtained by the bowen ratio as follows 1 β γ δ t δ e 2 e t r n g λ 1 β where β is the bowen ratio dimensionless γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1

were taken from landsat 8 satellite available at the united states geological survey usgs at https espa cr usgs gov https espa cr usgs gov the landsat 8 images used were taken from the oli and tirs sensors which represent the spectral bands of the visible and infrared and thermal bands respectively roy et al 2014 the oli sensor data were obtained from the landsat level 2 product and express the surface reflectance also considering the landsat level 2 product the tirs sensor data were provided as at satellite brightness temperature vermote et al 2016 the spatial and temporal resolution of the landsat 8 sensors used here are 30 m and 16 day respectively the overpass time of landsat 8 is approximately at 10 00 and 10 30 gmt 3 for piracicaba and dourados respectively a digital elevation model

weather data and the landsat 8 spectral bands were processed from the year 2014 until 2020 and therefore incorporated into the proposed algorithm table 1 highlights the time series of the images employed in the processing the geographic information system gis grass 7 8 2 grass development team 2020 was used as work environment according to the suborbital remote data an unmanned aerial vehicle uav model matrice 600 pro dà jiãang innovations science and technology dji shenzhen china was used it is a six rotor flying platform comprising six batteries with a capacity of 4500 mah voltage of 22 2 v integrating the aircraft control the remote controller operates at 2 4 ghz with a maximum signal transmission range of 5 km moreover this uav has a flight control system termed dji a3 pro the a3 pro includes a flight controller ground position system gps compass pro and a power management unit pmu with two additional inertial measurement unit imu pro and gps compass pro modules the a3 pro provides triple modular redundancy improving the system s anti risk performance the altum camera micasense seattle usa was used on board of the uav for multispectral and thermal data acquisition the multispectral sensors comprise five bands blue 475 nm center 20 nm bandwidth green 560 nm center 20 nm bandwidth red 668 nm center 10 nm bandwidth red edge 717 nm center 10 nm bandwidth and near infrared 840 nm center 40 nm bandwidth the sensors resolution are 2064 1544 3 2 m pixels per band the field of view fov is 48 x 37 and the ground sample distance gsd per pixel is 5 26 cm at 120 m above ground level agl being radiometrically calibrated the altum s thermal data is retrieved by the sensor lepton 3 forward looking infrared flir wilsonville usa working on wavelength range of 8000 14 000 nm this sensor has a resolution of 160 120 pixels fov is 57 x 44 and gsd of 81 cm per pixel at 120 m agl apart from the altum camera micasense offers a downwelling light sensor dls 2 that is designed to capture the downwelling irradiance per band for each image dls 2 sensor measures light incident on a diffuser providing more accurate radiometric and sun angle measurements fig 2 highlights the uav platform used before takeoff and after landing a capture of calibrated reflectance panel for creating reflectance compensated outputs was performed we set camera settings to a fixed exposure with automatic trigger in overlap mode the waypoint routes are generated to obtain 75 overlap both between photos forward overlap and between flight lines lateral overlap in which the highest accuracy in mosaicking elaboration step is achieved the images were recorded at 120 m agl during homogeneous and stable radiation conditions within two and a half hours of local solar noon covering an area of 14 ha in 16 min approximately the automatic flight route was set at dji pilot app the weather conditions of the flight campaigns and the fight recurrence are highlighted in table 2 previously to the orthomosaics build a radiometric calibration with multi panels integration was performed two captures of the calibration panel were done during the flight campaigns one at beginning image date time immediately before takeoff and another at ending image date time immediately after landing since every image metadata stores the captured moment date time and irradiance the reflectance factor i e ratio between panel reflectance and panel radiance to calibrate the images and to convert radiance into reflectance was determined for all images via linear interpolation the images were subsequently processed in the agisoft metashape professional edition 1 5 4 software agisoft st petersburg russia resulting in the final digital elevation models and orthomosaics 2 2 ground truted surface energy balance algorithm gt seb on the temporal and spatial scales the proposed algorithm termed ground truted surface energy balance gt seb estimates et by employing a residual approach to the surface energy balance like most surface energy balance algorithms via remote sensing gt seb uses the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal as core bastiaanssen et al 1998 two extra processes which use in situ observations of et were added to sebal giving rise to the new algorithm initially the gt seb processing is performed only for the pixels of interest i e the areas where in situ observations of et are taken e g lysimeter and bowen ratio tower after this preprocessing the algorithm is validated and calibrated by maximizing the performance and employed throughout the image subsequently the net energy from the sun and atmosphere as long and short wave radiations is transformed and used to enable i soil heating ground heat flux ii air heating sensible heat flux to the atmosphere and iii water evaporation latent heat flux on the surfaces thus the energy utilized in the soil plant environment system can be assessed by the energy balance equation 3 r n g h λ e t where r n is the net radiation w m 2 g is the ground heat flux w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux to the atmosphere w m 2 and λet is the latent heat flux w m 2 therefore by rearranging the energy balance equation et is estimated considering λet as the residual energy such as 4 λ e t r n g h we describe each of the energy balance components in the following sections 2 2 1 net radiation the net radiation r n gives the radiation balance of the incoming and outgoing fluxes crucial to the heating of the atmosphere and the soil 5 r n r s α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where r s is the incident solar radiation w m 2 α is the surface albedo dimensionless r l is the thermal radiation emitted by the atmosphere w m 2 r l is the thermal radiation emitted by the surface w m 2 and ε 0 is the emissivity of the surface dimensionless the term αr s represents the short wave radiation solar radiation reflected by the surface while the term 1 ε 0 r l refers to the long wave radiation thermal radiation reflected by the surface the net short wave radiation present on the earth s surface is dependent upon the incident short wave radiation and surface albedo the surface albedo is calculated from the spectral radiance for each band in the visible and infrared ranges followed by mathematical expressions for spectral integration and atmospheric corrections silva et al 2016 for the oli orbital sensor data the surface albedo was obtained by the grass gis function i albedo as for the altum suborbital sensor data a weighting function for integration of band reflectances within the short wave spectrum was employed the albedo function weights were determined by using the radiometric measurements obtained from image captured of the calibration panel immediately before the flights as follows 6 e s u n λ π l λ p a n e l ρ λ p a n e l 7 w λ e s u n λ e s u n λ 8 α w λ ρ λ where esun λ is the solar spectral irradiance w m 2 nm 1 l λ panel is the mean radiance detected by altum sensors on panel region w m 2 nm 1 sr 1 ρ λ panel is the known reflectance values given by micasense for our specific panel dimensionless w λ is the band weight dimensionless and ρ λ is the band reflectance dimensionless for the bands blue green red red edge and near infrared the ρ λ panel values are 0 54 0 54 0 54 0 54 and 0 53 respectively the r s was calculated using the expressions mentioned in fao 56 crop evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 as given 9 r s g s c cos 90 θ s e d e s τ s w where g sc is the solar constant 1367 w m 2 θ se is the solar elevation angle in degrees and available in the mtl file of the landsat 8 images regarding the altum images as 90 θ se is the solar incident or zenith angle z and considering horizontal flat surfaces the term cos z was obtained by following duffie and beckman 2013 expression 10 cos z cos ϕ cos δ cos ω sin ϕ sin δ where ϕ is the local latitude δ is the solar declination and ω is the hour angle in the local solar time continuing on eq 9 the term d es is the relative earth sun distance expressed in astronomical units and available in the mtl file of the landsat 8 images for the altum images d es was determined according to duffie and beckman 2013 11 d e s 1 0 033 cos d j 2 π 365 where d j is the julian day ending r s equation description the term τ sw is the broad band atmospheric transmissivity dimensionless this variable is computed by following allen et al 1998 12 τ s w 0 75 2 1 0 5 z where z is the terrain elevation m retrieved from dem of the processing area the surface long wave radiation emissions are computed according to the stefan boltzmann equation boltzmann 1884 the equation relates a theoretical quantity of radiation emitted by the surface i e ε 0 with the surface temperature t s in the fourth power as follows 13 r l σ ε 0 t s 4 where t s k and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 as the images obtained from tirs sensor provide at satellite brightness temperature the split window algorithm li and jiang 2018 was used to estimate t s grass gis was used for this processing by the function i landsat8 swlst the altum sensor thermal band already provides the t s radiometrically calibrated with no extra processing necessary the surface emissivity was estimated according to the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 as given by van de griend and owe 1993 14 ε 0 1 009 0 047 ln ndvi where ndvi dimensionless like r l the long wave radiation incident on the surface is estimated by the stefan boltzmann equation boltzmann 1884 it is linked to the empirical emissivity of the atmosphere ε a and the fourth power of the air temperature near to the surface t a such as 15 r l σ ε a t a 4 where ε a dimensionless and t a k the empirical equation proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 was used for computing the ε a 16 ε a β 1 ln τ s w β 2 where β 1 and β 2 are empirical parameters with default values equal to 0 85 and 0 09 like in allen et al 2007 thus replacing eq 33 in eq 34 r l equation became 17 r l σ β 1 ln τ s w β 2 t a 4 finally computed the incoming and outgoing radiation fluxes of the soil plant atmosphere system the r n is estimated by eq 5 2 2 2 ground heat flux using the energy balance the second term to be calculated is the ground heat flux calculated as a function of r n t s α and ndvi 18 g r n t s 273 15 α β 3 α β 4 α 2 1 0 98 ndvi 4 where parameters β 3 and β 4 have standard values defined by bastiaanssen 2000 equal to 0 0038 and 0 0074 respectively for water surfaces where the ndvi value is negative the g r n ratio is set at 0 5 2 2 3 sensible heat flux the sensible heat flux is estimated from the temperature gradient close to the surface according to the aerodynamic function 19 h ρ c p a b t s r a h where ρ is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of the air at constant pressure 1004 j kg 1 k 1 r ah is the aerodynamic resistance for heat transfer s m 1 between two points near to the surface z 1 and z 2 usually 0 1 and 2 m and a and b are empirical coefficients determined through the internal calibration for each image the term a bt s represents the aerodynamic dt temperature gradient between z 1 and z 2 the determination of r ah is affected by the dynamics within the boundary layer directed by h as r ah and h are not known in each pixel of the image an iterative solution is needed to make atmospheric stability corrections applying the monin obukhov length l bastiaanssen 2000 koloskov et al 2007 in the first iteration r ah is computed on the assumption that the atmosphere remains under conditions of neutral stability as follows 20 r a h ln z 2 z 1 u k where u is the wind friction speed m s 1 and k is the von karman s constant 0 41 in the first iteration the friction speed is calculated by the logarithmic wind speed profile for conditions of neutral atmosphere stability as follows 21 u k u 200 100 ln 200 100 z 0 m where z 0m is the surface roughness length that controls the momentum transfer m and u 200 100 is the wind speed at 200 m and 100 m in height for oli tirs and altum images respectively m s 1 i e geostrophic wind speed in which the surface roughness exerts no effect thus the wind speed at 200 m or 100 m above the weather station is determined as 22 u 200 100 u 2 ln 200 100 z 0 m ln 2 z 0 m where u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m above the ground i e measured at the weather station m s 1 and z 0m is the surface roughness length at the weather station m determined by the equation proposed by brutsaert 1982 i e z 0m 0 123 h where h is the grass height being considered equal to 0 15 m therefore as estimated in all the pixels of the image the variable z 0m follows the empirical equation of bastiaanssen 2000 23 z 0 m exp β 5 β 6 ndvi where β 5 and β 6 are empirical parameters with standard values equal to 5 5 and 5 8 respectively after estimating the r ah in the first iteration for all the pixels of the image the following iterations are done to predict two extreme evapotranspiration conditions one for h equals zero termed as cold pixel and the other for λet equal to zero termed a hot pixel these pixels are known as anchor pixels the cold pixel is selected on a well irrigated crop area in which instance the maximum energy available is being utilized during the evapotranspiration process the hot pixel is selected in an open field area that lacks both vegetation and irrigation where evapotranspiration is assumed to be zero λet 0 and h r n g in this algorithm step we propose a new processing for automating the anchor pixels selection based on in situ observation of et first the cold pixel is chosen in an area where the ndvi values are approximately 0 8 i e healthy vegetation the values of α are between 0 05 and 0 25 and the absolute difference of surface temperature observed in the candidate area and the air temperature measured at the weather station is approximately 1 k subsequently we selected the candidate hot pixels for ndvi values between 0 01 and 0 16 i e bare soil conditions and α greater than 0 25 as the altum sensor has a high spatial resolution which can lead to numerous candidate hot pixels and consequently a high computational demand we sampled a maximum of 1000 hot pixels in the images for this sensor thus instead of choosing a pair of anchor pixels as in sebal or metric we obtain a maximum of 1000 pairs of possible choices fig 3 illustrates an example of the chosen pixels for the altum sensor from the selection of the candidate pixels the processing is performed for the pixels where the et is in situ observed e g lysimeter or bowen ratio tower and for the anchor pixels location once the cold and hot pixels are selected in the image the a and b parameters of eq 19 are determined and thus h is calculated subsequently l is used to define the conditions of atmospheric stability in the iterative process koloskov et al 2007 thus according to the atmospheric conditions the stability correction values for the transport of momentum ψ m and heat ψ h are applied following the formulations of paulson 1970 and webb 1970 finally for each successive iteration eqs 21 and 20 are updated to correct u and r ah as given 24 u k u 200 100 ln 200 100 z 0 m ψ m a n d 25 r a h ln z 2 z 1 ψ h z 2 ψ h z 1 u k the iterative process is completed when the dt and r ah values in the hot pixel achieve stability and thus the final corrected value of h is determined 2 2 4 evapotranspiration once the energy balance equation components are estimated instantaneous evapotranspiration et i at the overpass satellite or uav flight time is calculated by the following equation 26 et i 3600 λ e t λ where et i mm h 1 3600 is the number of seconds in an hour and λ is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 which can be estimated by allen et al 2007 as 27 λ 2 501 0 00236 t s 273 15 1 0 6 later the daily et0 and hourly et0i reference evapotranspiration are obtained by using the weather station data and penman monteith model allen et al 1998 since the et i values obtained by gt seb and et0i are established the ratio between these quantities provides a coefficient termed the reference et fraction et0f when it is determined on surfaces managed by well irrigated crops this coefficient bears similarity to the crop coefficient k c allen et al 1998 assuming that the et0f is relatively constant during the day as demonstrated by allen et al 2007 the daily evapotranspiration is calculated as 28 et et 0 f et 0 where et refers to the daily evapotranspiration mm day 1 et0f dimensionless and et0 mm day 1 2 2 5 additional processes anchor pixels selection and optimization of the algorithm parameters since for each combination of anchor pixels et is estimated over the area where it is in situ observed e g lysimeter area the pixels cold and hot are selected when the absolute difference between the estimated and the observed et is minimal being this process termed as additional process 1 add 1 thereafter the empirical parameters β n are calibrated by optimizing an objective function which minimizes the sum of squares of the residuals between the observed and estimated et 29 min β 1 β 6 i 1 n et gt seb β 1 β 6 et i n s i t u 2 where etgt seb is the et estimated by gt seb mm d 1 and et in situ is the et in situ observed mm d 1 this process is named here as additional process 2 add 2 to avoid the problems of convergence of the functions the optimization was performed in a valid parameter search space and in accordance with earlier studies bastiaanssen et al 1998 teixeira et al 2009 paul et al 2013 besides the initial iteration values were the standard sebal metric parameters defined by bastiaanssen 2000 and allen et al 2007 the numerical method employed to minimize the objective function was the method quasi newton proposed by byrd et al 1995 this method is employed for solving large nonlinear optimization problems with simple bounds using a limited amount of computer memory byrd et al 1995 proposed a efficient way for approximating to the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithm broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 thus by restricting the lower and upper limits of the parameters sample space this optimization method received the initials l and b starting to be called l bfgs b in table 3 the functions used and their respective parameters are listed as well as the thresholds of variation within their sample space i e the minimum and maximum thresholds after selecting the anchor pixels and optimizing the parameters gt seb is processed again for the entire image resulting in the maps of the energy fluxes and et fig 4 resumes through a flowchart the gt seb processing 2 3 algorithm evaluation the two additional processes proposed in this study were evaluated based on the following goodness of fit measures i modified kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge kling et al 2012 ii percentage bias pbias and iii root mean square error rmse as follows respectively 30 kge 1 ρ 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where ρ is the pearson correlation β is the error ratio 31 β μ e μ o and γ is the variability ratio 32 γ c v e c v o σ e μ o μ e σ o μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of et both for the values assessed e by gt seb and for the values in situ observed o of et cv refers to the coefficient of variation 33 pbias i 1 n e i o i 100 i 1 n o i 34 rmse i 1 n e i o i 2 n finally the degree of agreement was analyzed graphically between the estimated and observed et data a scatter plot as well as a linear regression was performed to assess the agreement with a 1 1 line perfect fit the software r statistical 3 6 2 r core team 2019 and the grass geographic information system 7 8 2 grass development team 2020 were used to develop the methodology of this study 3 results and discussion the algorithm proposed in this study termed gt seb is a variant of the classical sebal metric bastiaanssen 2000 allen et al 2007 and so all the physical base of these algorithms remains in the gt seb being the difference attributed to the addition of two processes in which use in situ observations of et fig 5 highlights the evaluation of add 1 for the remote sensors altum and oli tirs we observed good agreements for both sensors percentage bias pbias root mean square error rmse and modified kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge respectively reached the values of 3 6 1 01 mm d 1 and 0 80 for altum and 10 4 0 75 mm d 1 and 0 82 for oli tirs both regression line slopes are indicating by the values lower than 1 a general underestimation resulting 0 77 and 0 72 for altum and oli tirs respectively despite yielding a general underestimation we observed some overestimates points for the altum sensor fig 5 a regarding the oli tirs sensors fig 5 b the underestimations were evidenced for those days with the highest et for jatropha curcas on 2014 12 16 and 2016 03 08 for maize on 2015 05 05 and 2015 06 06 and for soybean on 2020 01 15 aiming to reduce the subjectivity and difficulty of yielding et space time series via manual selection of the anchor pixels the algorithms sebal and its successor metric already present in their recent versions the automation of the anchor pixels selection olmedo et al 2017 jaafar and ahmad 2020 automated or not these algorithms do not optimize the anchor pixels selection by the in situ observations of et as done by gt seb therefore for specific surfaces or crop managements poor results may be yielded requesting new algorithms standardization for instance paul et al 2013 evaluated at suborbital sensor level the classic sebal algorithm and the standardized version with the excess resistance parameter kb 1 su 2002 by selecting the anchor pixels manually the authors observed an improvement in the sebal performance when kb 1 was employed also laipelt et al 2020 tested the allen et al 2013 method for automatic anchor pixels selection in a forest savanna flooding ecosystem resulting in a high overestimate for the latent heat flux using images from the landsat 5 7 satellites as well as the sebal and metric algorithms bhattarai et al 2017 defined a procedure for a complete automation of the anchor pixels selection based on an exhaustive search algorithm the results showed that the automated choice of anchor pixels yielded similar estimates compared to manual ones rmse 0 35 mm d 1 in addition when evaluated by in situ observations of et at eddy covariance flux towers the automatic process of bhattarai et al 2017 reached slight improvements in contrast to those of the automatic process of allen et al 2013 i e rmse 0 82 mm d 1 against rmse 0 91 mm d 1 respectively many seb rs algorithms designed for suborbital sensors do not process the anchor selection hoffmann et al 2016 quebrajo et al 2017 methodologically this can be an advantage however it makes the et retrieval process deterministic and only one solution is possible on the other hand the possibility for selecting different pairs of anchor pixels in an image makes the process stochastic which for each pair there will be an et estimated allowing to optimize the selection and consequently improving the performance however as observed here for some days the process to automate and optimize the anchor pixels selection may not be enough to reach an optimum residual minimization i e errors equal to zero therefore add 2 is performed by optimizing the algorithm parameters allowing a wider use range i e use for particular sensors management crops surfaces and climates and improving the performance for the additional process 2 of gt seb fig 6 illustrates the results obtained regarding the oli tirs sensors for the whole period and surfaces studied the et estimated by gt seb and the et in situ observed yielded identical values by maximizing the goodness of fit measures unlike for the altum sensor we observed some points in which the algorithm did not reach the best goodness of fit resulting pbias rmse and kge values equal to 1 4 0 45 mm d 1 and 0 93 respectively moreover the value equal to 0 9 of the regression line slope highlights an underestimate driven by the et retrieved on the grass surface once the et in situ observed over the grassy area of the weather station is et0 itself obtained by penman monteith allen et al 1998 model pm we deduce that et0 presents a positive bias and are not representing a confidence observation an unexpected drought period from 2020 09 12 to 2020 11 09 was observed in the respective wet hot season leading the grassy area of the weather station to a water stress condition thus the et0 predictions by pm are not suitable presenting different characteristics than the reference crop defined by allen et al 1998 this result exposes the importance of vegetation indices to determine whether the plant is stressed or healthy and how this drives the et process simultaneously with the weather condition thus remote sensing algorithms for et retrieving are able to infer about plant physiological conditions via vegetation indices being a complement against the physical approaches as pm which is parameterized for a crop reference condition and only weather variable dependent studying coffee coffea arabica crop in a tropical climate region costa et al 2019 found that the oli tirs sensors and sebal provided a high potential to estimate et for adult trees in different growth stages however for young coffee plants the index of agreement willmott 1981 between sebal and the observed et resulted values less than 0 44 indicating low performance the authors suggest that the contamination by the soil reflectance sub pixels led to poor vegetation sensing and consequently poor sebal performance according to glenn et al 2010 the lower performance is ascribed to the heterogeneity within the pixel thus pixels from cultivated areas that reveal larger soil surface exposure may have overestimated et values mostly in the irrigated regions due to higher soil evaporation levels because of the moisture being always near its maximum retention capacity among the herein studied crops jatropha curcas plants exhibit the distinctive features of well defined leaf senescence and the decrease in the plant canopy increases the exposed soil surface sensed although presenting this particular aspect gt seb maximized the performance due to in situ optimization the accuracy and uncertainties anticipated in obtaining et through remote sensing are explained in the literature this is evident in karimi and bastiaanssen 2015 which compiled 33 research papers to investigate the error related to the et estimation according to the remote sensing done on an annual or seasonal scale they showed that the absolute error of et ranged from 1 up to 20 with an average percentage error of 5 4 and a standard deviation of 5 0 the average percentage error showed slight increase when the error of the et estimates alone in the cultivated areas were considered with 60 of the studies achieving 5 error however frequently these performances were related to algorithms that were developed and tested in sites where it was possible to perform local parameterization and calibration yilma 2017 reported the average differences between the et estimated by sebal and that measured in a lysimeter for the onion and potato crops were 9 3 and 15 4 respectively table 4 highlights the results of the parameters optimization the altum sensor mean values of 0 94 for β 1 and 0 11 for β 2 as well as the oli tirs sensors mean values of 0 92 for β 1 and 0 09 for β 2 differ from those obtained by allen et al 2007 for idaho β 1 0 85 and β 2 0 09 and by bastiaanssen 1995 for egypt β 1 1 08 and β 2 0 27 reviewing sebal parameters in other brazilian region teixeira et al 2009 reached similar values for β 1 and β 2 being 0 94 and 0 10 respectively although substantiating our results the parameters optimization performed by teixeira et al 2009 was methodologically different from the one here applied teixeira et al 2009 optimized the parameters by using multi in situ observations e g solar radiation and surface temperature for minimizing the sebal sub models residuals here we optimized the parameters of the all gt seb processes at once by using the et in situ observed and minimizing the algorithm residuals itself therefore the methodology proposed here is more parsimonious and scalable according to the parameters related to the ground heat flux β 3 and β 4 the respective mean values of 0 0035 and 0 0072 for the altum sensor and 0 0038 and 0 0071 for the oli tirs sensors are similar to the default ones bastiaanssen 1995 however these values differ from those found by paul et al 2013 β 3 0 0012 and β 4 0 0042 and from teixeira et al 2009 β 3 0 53 and β 4 1 98 this last study employed a different parameterization of the ground heat flux equation and concluded that the wide difference compared to the default values is explained by the conditions of daily irrigation and greater lai of irrigated fruit crops the last couple of parameters are related to roughness length for momentum β 5 and β 6 for the altum sensor the mean values are 5 51 and 5 80 while for the oli tirs sensors the mean values are 5 56 and 5 75 these results are in accordance with paul et al 2013 in which found values ranging from 5 77 to 5 07 for β 5 and from 4 38 to 7 30 for β 6 the et and et0f mapping from the altum sensor are highlighted in fig 7 for day 2020 12 18 the et mapping from remote sensing algorithms has relevant usefulness for precision irrigation however there are uncertainties regarding the algorithms structure input data radiometric and meteorological and predictions temporal upscaling of et laipelt et al 2020 assimilating in situ observations into these algorithms as performed by gt seb the uncertainties are minimized and the algorithm performance improved jin et al 2018 regarding the methods to temporal upscaling of instantaneous et the evaporative fraction λ λet r n g employed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 assumes that λ is self preserved over the diurnal cycle and can be used to upscale instantaneous et to daily values this assumption causes 5 10 underestimation of the daily et brutsaert and sugita 1992 therefore the reference et fraction et0f et i et0i as presented by allen et al 2007 and validated over a lysimeter area evidences strong assumptions about its constant behavior during the diurnal cycle providing a theoretical framework for temporal upscaling decoupling factor ω quantifies the degree that actual et deviates from the equilibrium et defined by the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 it is estimated from the available energy as well as aerodynamic and canopy resistance as the equilibrium canopy resistance depends on vapor pressure deficit vpd the temporal upscaling scheme then involves not only available energy but also vpd tang and li 2017 revisiting the relation among ω et0 and k c i e et0f for crop surfaces marin et al 2019 highlights how ω can drive the water consumption by tropical crops mainly for high evaporating conditions et0 4 mm d 1 next updates of gt seb should include and study ω for temporal upscaling of instantaneous et 4 conclusion in this study we proposed a new seb rs algorithm termed gt seb aiming to optimize et estimates through observations in situ the gt seb was assessed for modern sensors at the orbital oli tirs and suborbital altum levels we emphasized that its applicability is not restricted to these sensors as well as its formulation is not standardized for specific crops or surface because its main differential is the residual minimization between observations and estimates a limitation of gt seb would be the requirement of an et in situ observation due to the cost of implementing maintaining and handling meteorological instrumentation to obtain the et measurements e g lysimeter bowen ratio eddy covariance and scintillometer however indirect and less costly measures may be obtained for estimating et in situ for instance via soil moisture sensors soil matric water potential sensors or even so by applying the crop coefficient k c allen et al 1998 aiming an exploratory analysis for irrigation practitioners future research should be conducted by applying indirect methods for obtaining et in situ assessing the gt seb usefulness and performance it is important to highlight the exponential growth of digitalization in agricultural and rural areas by allowing the employment of disruptive technologies such as internet of things big data data assimilation and artificial intelligence making easier the meteorological monitoring boursianis et al 2020 moreover the procedures added to the classical formulation of seb rs algorithms may be extended for the contextural et models or conductance based et models chen and liu 2020 the algorithm proposed in this study allows the employment of precision irrigation in an optimized way since it aims to link the point precision of et in situ observed to spatial and remotely sensed et estimated thus making all agricultural production more profitable and sustainable i e producing more assertive management of water consumption with less reducing water and energy costs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9685,many algorithms for surface energy balance seb based on remote sensing rs have been advanced to determine evapotranspiration et these algorithms were developed for specific conditions e g sensors land use and crop management in which functions and empirical parameters within its algorithms concur with those conditions therefore this study aims to develop a seb rs algorithm for retrieving et adjusted to in situ observations the study was conducted in two experimental fields in brazil with the crops jatropha curcas maize soybean and sugarcane we used multispectral images from the orbital sensors operational land imager oli and thermal infrared sensor tirs coupled in landsat 8 satellite and from the terrestrial sensor altum on board of an unmanned aerial vehicle the proposed algorithm termed as ground truthed surface energy balance gt seb is based on physical formulation of seb rs algorithms where two extra computational processes using in situ et observations were proposed for originating the new algorithm the first additional process for optimizing the automatic anchor pixels selection and another for algorithm parameters optimization thus both processes aim to reduce the difference between the observed et and estimated by gt seb being assessed for both orbital oli tirs and suborbital altum sensors the gt seb yielded excellent results root mean square error rmse 0 48 mm and modified kling gupta efficiency kge 0 92 in addition to gt seb being an optimized algorithm it uses a classic parameterization of seb rs algorithms providing efficiency and scalability for other remote sensors climates and surfaces keywords irrigation geoprocessing data driven precision agriculture 1 introduction it has been established that around 70 of all the water used for human activities goes for agricultural irrigation food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2021 irrigation is fundamental for agricultural production as the escalating demand for food will require expanding agriculture to areas receiving low and irregular rainfall in terms of the correct way to plan and manage an irrigation systems one of the urgent needs is to well estimate the crop water consumption evapotranspiration et is the quantity of water released to the atmosphere via the processes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration which represents the water used by crops allen et al 1998 the et estimation can be achieved through a variety of methods such as class a evaporation pan bosman 1987 lysimeters paul et al 2013 bowen ratio bowen 1926 eddy covariance swinbank 1951 and by physical mathematical models such as penman monteith allen et al 1998 and thornthwaite thornthwaite and mather 1955 however these methods give spatial punctual estimates according to the data received from the measurement devices although these punctual estimates can be spatially interpolated a thorough understanding of the factors like treatments and crop growth stages are required to provide increased accuracy al zayed 2016 indeed it is not easy to evaluate these factors in widespread areas which support high crop diversity allen et al 2011 toward the orbital remote sensors used for estimating et we can highlight the sensors of the landsat satellites by the wide employment bastiaanssen et al 2005 teixeira et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 al zayed 2016 bhattarai et al 2017 jaafar and ahmad 2020 currently the most modern sensors in the landsat program are the operational land imager oli and the thermal infrared sensor tirs on board the landsat 8 satellite also the landsat 9 satellite was launched on 27 september 2021 having the oli 2 and tirs 2 sensors on board in spite of being important for et mapping the sensors oli tirs have a spatial i e 30 m and temporal i e 16 day resolution coarser than the recommended for irrigation management including et mapping and precision agriculture xia et al 2016 friedl 2018 suborbital remote sensing allowed by unmanned aerial vehicles uav and multispectral sensors have been used to provide the needed spatial and temporal frequency for prescribing the water consumption of the crops for irrigation assessments gago et al 2015 radoglou grammatikis et al 2020 chávez et al 2020 for instance the altum sensor micasense seattle usa showed interesting features with high resolution multispectral bands in the visible near infrared and thermal i e the bands required for employment of surface energy balance seb based on remote sensing rs algorithms several seb rs algorithms are available for estimating et such as two source energy balance model tseb norman et al 1995 surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 simplified surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop senay et al 2015 most of these algorithms require the user to select anchor pixels with extreme temperature and vegetation conditions for instance a cold pixel should be selected in a healthy fully vegetated and well watered field as well as a hot pixel in a dry bare soil field to calibrate the model internally manual selection of pixels can cause bias in et estimates and there is always the probability that more than one pair of anchor pixels satisfy the boundary conditions in one image moreover generating et times series is almost impracticable due to the time consuming process of manually searching and selecting the anchor pixels jaafar and ahmad 2020 in the last decade seb rs algorithms have been employed to different types of sensors climates and surfaces paul et al 2013 hoffmann et al 2016 quebrajo et al 2017 costa et al 2019 blatchford et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however the applicability of these algorithms are restricted to the sensors climates and surfaces in which they were formulated a seb rs algorithm optimized by in situ observations of et may provide a general functionality applicable to a variety of cropping systems thus this work intends to i propose a new seb rs algorithm in situ optimized by et observations and ii evaluate it for the state of the art orbital and suborbital remote sensors oli tirs and altum respectively the article is structured as follows first section 2 presents the study area datasets and methodology employed to formulate and evaluate the new algorithm termed ground truthed surface energy balance gt seb next section 3 presents the results and key findings finally section 4 concludes the study and highlights the recommendations and outlooks for future research 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas and data acquisition the study was conducted in two regions in brazil fig 1 a one situated in the interior regions of the state of são paulo in the city of piracicaba and the other in the south of the state of mato grasso do sul in the city of dourados the climate in piracicaba typically is of the humid subtropical type with dry winters and hot summers and has an average annual rainfall of 1419 mm and average annual temperature

surface fig 1 b in dourados the study area was located at the experimental farm of embrapa western agriculture fig 1 c a weighing lysimeter from the embrapa western agriculture placed in an area grown by maize zea mays and with a fixed sprinkler irrigation system was used to measure et in situ the rectangular shaped lysimeter has a 7 2 m2 surface area 3 6 2 m inside the lysimeter the useful soil

experimental farm at embrapa western agriculture has a weather station located at about 300 m from the lysimeter in a 1 4 ha area covered by grass data is automatically collected at 15 minute intervals and published in real time on the internet at the guia clima website http www cpao embrapa br clima http www cpao embrapa br clima the in situ observations of et for jatropha curcas sugarcane and maize crops were obtained by the ratio between the mass variation determined by the lysimeters weighing system and their surface areas due to the weather station standard broad grassy surface modern and calibrated sensors we assumed that the reference evapotranspiration et0 estimates ascertained by the penman monteith model allen et al 1998 as being in situ observations as for soybean crop the in situ observations of et were obtained by the bowen ratio as follows 1 β γ δ t δ e 2 e t r n g λ 1 β where β is the bowen ratio dimensionless γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1

were taken from landsat 8 satellite available at the united states geological survey usgs at https espa cr usgs gov https espa cr usgs gov the landsat 8 images used were taken from the oli and tirs sensors which represent the spectral bands of the visible and infrared and thermal bands respectively roy et al 2014 the oli sensor data were obtained from the landsat level 2 product and express the surface reflectance also considering the landsat level 2 product the tirs sensor data were provided as at satellite brightness temperature vermote et al 2016 the spatial and temporal resolution of the landsat 8 sensors used here are 30 m and 16 day respectively the overpass time of landsat 8 is approximately at 10 00 and 10 30 gmt 3 for piracicaba and dourados respectively a digital elevation model

weather data and the landsat 8 spectral bands were processed from the year 2014 until 2020 and therefore incorporated into the proposed algorithm table 1 highlights the time series of the images employed in the processing the geographic information system gis grass 7 8 2 grass development team 2020 was used as work environment according to the suborbital remote data an unmanned aerial vehicle uav model matrice 600 pro dà jiãang innovations science and technology dji shenzhen china was used it is a six rotor flying platform comprising six batteries with a capacity of 4500 mah voltage of 22 2 v integrating the aircraft control the remote controller operates at 2 4 ghz with a maximum signal transmission range of 5 km moreover this uav has a flight control system termed dji a3 pro the a3 pro includes a flight controller ground position system gps compass pro and a power management unit pmu with two additional inertial measurement unit imu pro and gps compass pro modules the a3 pro provides triple modular redundancy improving the system s anti risk performance the altum camera micasense seattle usa was used on board of the uav for multispectral and thermal data acquisition the multispectral sensors comprise five bands blue 475 nm center 20 nm bandwidth green 560 nm center 20 nm bandwidth red 668 nm center 10 nm bandwidth red edge 717 nm center 10 nm bandwidth and near

above ground level agl being radiometrically calibrated the altum s thermal data is retrieved by the sensor lepton 3 forward looking infrared flir wilsonville usa working on wavelength range of 8000 14 000 nm this sensor has a resolution of 160 120 pixels fov is 57 x 44 and gsd of 81 cm per pixel at 120 m agl apart from the altum camera micasense offers a downwelling light sensor dls 2 that is designed to capture the downwelling irradiance per band for each image dls 2 sensor measures light incident on a diffuser providing more accurate radiometric and sun angle measurements fig 2 highlights the uav platform used before takeoff and after landing a capture of calibrated reflectance panel for creating reflectance compensated outputs was performed we set camera settings to a fixed exposure with automatic trigger in overlap mode the waypoint routes are generated to obtain 75 overlap both between photos forward overlap and between flight lines lateral overlap in which the highest accuracy in mosaicking elaboration step is achieved the images were recorded at 120 m agl during homogeneous and stable radiation conditions within two and a half hours of local solar noon covering an area of 14 ha in 16 min approximately the automatic flight route was set at dji pilot app the weather conditions of the flight campaigns and the fight recurrence are highlighted in table 2 previously to the orthomosaics build a radiometric calibration with multi panels integration was performed two captures of the calibration panel were done during the flight campaigns one at beginning image date time immediately before takeoff and another at ending image date time immediately after landing since every image metadata stores the captured moment date time and irradiance the reflectance factor i e ratio between panel reflectance and panel radiance to calibrate the images and to convert radiance into reflectance was determined for all images via linear interpolation the images were subsequently processed in the agisoft metashape professional edition 1 5 4 software agisoft st petersburg russia resulting in the final digital elevation models and orthomosaics 2 2 ground truted surface energy balance algorithm gt seb on the temporal and spatial scales the proposed algorithm termed ground truted surface energy balance gt seb estimates et by employing a residual approach to the surface energy balance like most surface energy balance algorithms via remote sensing gt seb uses the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal as core bastiaanssen et al 1998 two extra processes which use in situ observations of et were added to sebal giving rise to the new algorithm initially the gt seb processing is performed only for the pixels of interest i e the areas where in situ observations of et are taken e g lysimeter and bowen ratio tower after this preprocessing the algorithm is validated and calibrated by maximizing the performance and employed throughout the image subsequently the net energy from the sun and atmosphere as long and short wave radiations is transformed and used to enable i soil heating ground heat flux ii air heating sensible heat flux to the atmosphere and iii water evaporation latent heat flux on the surfaces thus the energy utilized in the soil plant environment system can be assessed by the energy balance equation 3 r n g h λ e t where r n is the net radiation w m 2 g is the ground heat flux w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux to the atmosphere w m 2 and λet is the latent heat flux w m 2 therefore by rearranging the energy balance equation et is estimated considering λet as the residual energy such as 4 λ e t r n g h we describe each of the energy balance components in the following sections 2 2 1 net radiation the net radiation r n gives the radiation balance of the incoming and outgoing fluxes crucial to the heating of the atmosphere and the soil 5 r n r s α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where r s is the incident solar radiation w m 2 α is the surface albedo dimensionless r l is the thermal radiation emitted by the atmosphere w m 2 r l is the thermal radiation emitted by the surface w m 2 and ε 0 is the emissivity of the surface dimensionless the term αr s represents the short wave radiation solar radiation reflected by the surface while the term 1 ε 0 r l refers to the long wave radiation thermal radiation reflected by the surface the net short wave radiation present on the earth s surface is dependent upon the incident short wave radiation and surface albedo the surface albedo is calculated from the spectral radiance for each band in the visible and infrared ranges followed by mathematical expressions for spectral integration and atmospheric corrections silva et al 2016 for the oli orbital sensor data the surface albedo was obtained by the grass gis function i albedo as for the altum suborbital sensor data a weighting function for integration of band reflectances within the short wave spectrum was employed the albedo function weights were determined by using the radiometric measurements obtained from image captured of the calibration panel immediately before the flights as follows 6 e s u n λ π l λ p a n e l ρ λ p a n e l 7 w λ e s u n λ e s u n λ 8 α w λ ρ λ where esun λ is the solar spectral irradiance w m 2 nm 1 l λ panel is the mean radiance detected by altum sensors on panel region w m 2 nm 1 sr 1 ρ λ panel is the known reflectance values given by micasense for our specific panel dimensionless w λ is the band weight dimensionless and ρ λ is the band reflectance dimensionless for the bands blue green red red edge and near infrared the ρ λ panel values are 0 54 0 54 0 54 0 54 and 0 53 respectively the r s was calculated using the expressions mentioned in fao 56 crop evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 as given 9 r s g s c cos 90 θ s e d e s τ s w where g sc is the solar constant 1367 w m 2 θ se is the solar elevation angle in degrees and available in the mtl file of the landsat 8 images regarding the altum images as 90 θ se is the solar incident or zenith angle z and considering horizontal flat surfaces the term cos z was obtained by following duffie and beckman 2013 expression 10 cos z cos ϕ cos δ cos ω sin ϕ sin δ where ϕ is the local latitude δ is the solar declination and ω is the hour angle in the local solar time continuing on eq 9 the term d es is the relative earth sun distance expressed in astronomical units and available in the mtl file of the landsat 8 images for the altum images d es was determined according to duffie and beckman 2013 11 d e s 1 0 033 cos d j 2 π 365 where d j is the julian day ending r s equation description the term τ sw is the broad band atmospheric transmissivity dimensionless this variable is computed by following allen et al 1998 12 τ s w 0 75 2 1 0 5 z where z is the terrain elevation m retrieved from dem of the processing area the surface long wave radiation emissions are computed according to the stefan boltzmann equation boltzmann 1884 the equation relates a theoretical quantity of radiation emitted by the surface i e ε 0 with the surface temperature t s in the fourth power as follows 13 r l σ ε 0 t s 4 where t s k and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 as the images obtained from tirs sensor provide at satellite brightness temperature the split window algorithm li and jiang 2018 was used to estimate t s grass gis was used for this processing by the function i landsat8 swlst the altum sensor thermal band already provides the t s radiometrically calibrated with no extra processing necessary the surface emissivity was estimated according to the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 as given by van de griend and owe 1993 14 ε 0 1 009 0 047 ln ndvi where ndvi dimensionless like r l the long wave radiation incident on the surface is estimated by the stefan boltzmann equation boltzmann 1884 it is linked to the empirical emissivity of the atmosphere ε a and the fourth power of the air temperature near to the surface t a such as 15 r l σ ε a t a 4 where ε a dimensionless and t a k the empirical equation proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 was used for computing the ε a 16 ε a β 1 ln τ s w β 2 where β 1 and β 2 are empirical parameters with default values equal to 0 85 and 0 09 like in allen et al 2007 thus replacing eq 33 in eq 34 r l equation became 17 r l σ β 1 ln τ s w β 2 t a 4 finally computed the incoming and outgoing radiation fluxes of the soil plant atmosphere system the r n is estimated by eq 5 2 2 2 ground heat flux using the energy balance the second term to be calculated is the ground heat flux calculated as a function of r n t s α and ndvi 18 g r n t s 273 15 α β 3 α β 4 α 2 1 0 98 ndvi 4 where parameters β 3 and β 4 have standard values defined by bastiaanssen 2000 equal to 0 0038 and 0 0074 respectively for water surfaces where the ndvi value is negative the g r n ratio is set at 0 5 2 2 3 sensible heat flux the sensible heat flux is estimated from the temperature gradient close to the surface according to the aerodynamic function 19 h ρ c p a b t s r a h where ρ is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of the air at constant pressure 1004 j kg 1 k 1 r ah is the aerodynamic resistance for heat transfer s m 1 between two points near to the surface z 1 and z 2 usually 0 1 and 2 m and a and b are empirical coefficients determined through the internal calibration for each image the term a bt s represents the aerodynamic dt temperature gradient between z 1 and z 2 the determination of r ah is affected by the dynamics within the boundary layer directed by h as r ah and h are not known in each pixel of the image an iterative solution is needed to make atmospheric stability corrections applying the monin obukhov length l bastiaanssen 2000 koloskov et al 2007 in the first iteration r ah is computed on the assumption that the atmosphere remains under conditions of neutral stability as follows 20 r a h ln z 2 z 1 u k where u is the wind friction speed m s 1 and k is the von karman s constant 0 41 in the first iteration the friction speed is calculated by the logarithmic wind speed profile for conditions of neutral atmosphere stability as follows 21 u k u 200 100 ln 200 100 z 0 m where z 0m is the surface roughness length that controls the momentum transfer m and u 200 100 is the wind speed at 200 m and 100 m in height for oli tirs and altum images respectively m s 1 i e geostrophic wind speed in which the surface roughness exerts no effect thus the wind speed at 200 m or 100 m above the weather station is determined as 22 u 200 100 u 2 ln 200 100 z 0 m ln 2 z 0 m where u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m above the ground i e measured at the weather station m s 1 and z 0m is the surface roughness length at the weather station m determined by the equation proposed by brutsaert 1982 i e z 0m 0 123 h where h is the grass height being considered equal to 0 15 m therefore as estimated in all the pixels of the image the variable z 0m follows the empirical equation of bastiaanssen 2000 23 z 0 m exp β 5 β 6 ndvi where β 5 and β 6 are empirical parameters with standard values equal to 5 5 and 5 8 respectively after estimating the r ah in the first iteration for all the pixels of the image the following iterations are done to predict two extreme evapotranspiration conditions one for h equals zero termed as cold pixel and the other for λet equal to zero termed a hot pixel these pixels are known as anchor pixels the cold pixel is selected on a well irrigated crop area in which instance the maximum energy available is being utilized during the evapotranspiration process the hot pixel is selected in an open field area that lacks both vegetation and irrigation where evapotranspiration is assumed to be zero λet 0 and h r n g in this algorithm step we propose a new processing for automating the anchor pixels selection based on in situ observation of et first the cold pixel is chosen in an area where the ndvi values are approximately 0 8 i e healthy vegetation the values of α are between 0 05 and 0 25 and the absolute difference of surface temperature observed in the candidate area and the air temperature measured at the weather station is approximately 1 k subsequently we selected the candidate hot pixels for ndvi values between 0 01 and 0 16 i e bare soil conditions and α greater than 0 25 as the altum sensor has a high spatial resolution which can lead to numerous candidate hot pixels and consequently a high computational demand we sampled a maximum of 1000 hot pixels in the images for this sensor thus instead of choosing a pair of anchor pixels as in sebal or metric we obtain a maximum of 1000 pairs of possible choices fig 3 illustrates an example of the chosen pixels for the altum sensor from the selection of the candidate pixels the processing is performed for the pixels where the et is in situ observed e g lysimeter or bowen ratio tower and for the anchor pixels location once the cold and hot pixels are selected in the image the a and b parameters of eq 19 are determined and thus h is calculated subsequently l is used to define the conditions of atmospheric stability in the iterative process koloskov et al 2007 thus according to the atmospheric conditions the stability correction values for the transport of momentum ψ m and heat ψ h are applied following the formulations of paulson 1970 and webb 1970 finally for each successive iteration eqs 21 and 20 are updated to correct u and r ah as given 24 u k u 200 100 ln 200 100 z 0 m ψ m a n d 25 r a h ln z 2 z 1 ψ h z 2 ψ h z 1 u k the iterative process is completed when the dt and r ah values in the hot pixel achieve stability and thus the final corrected value of h is determined 2 2 4 evapotranspiration once the energy balance equation components are estimated instantaneous evapotranspiration et i at the overpass satellite or uav flight time is calculated by the following equation 26 et i 3600 λ e t λ where et i mm h 1 3600 is the number of seconds in an hour and λ is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 which can be estimated by allen et al 2007 as 27 λ 2 501 0 00236 t s 273 15 1 0 6 later the daily et0 and hourly et0i reference evapotranspiration are obtained by using the weather station data and penman monteith model allen et al 1998 since the et i values obtained by gt seb and et0i are established the ratio between these quantities provides a coefficient termed the reference et fraction et0f when it is determined on surfaces managed by well irrigated crops this coefficient bears similarity to the crop coefficient k c allen et al 1998 assuming that the et0f is relatively constant during the day as demonstrated by allen et al 2007 the daily evapotranspiration is calculated as 28 et et 0 f et 0 where et refers to the daily evapotranspiration mm day 1 et0f dimensionless and et0 mm day 1 2 2 5 additional processes anchor pixels selection and optimization of the algorithm parameters since for each combination of anchor pixels et is estimated over the area where it is in situ observed e g lysimeter area the pixels cold and hot are selected when the absolute difference between the estimated and the observed et is minimal being this process termed as additional process 1 add 1 thereafter the empirical parameters β n are calibrated by optimizing an objective function which minimizes the sum of squares of the residuals between the observed and estimated et 29 min β 1 β 6 i 1 n et gt seb β 1 β 6 et i n s i t u 2 where etgt seb is the et estimated by gt seb mm d 1 and et in situ is the et in situ observed mm d 1 this process is named here as additional process 2 add 2 to avoid the problems of convergence of the functions the optimization was performed in a valid parameter search space and in accordance with earlier studies bastiaanssen et al 1998 teixeira et al 2009 paul et al 2013 besides the initial iteration values were the standard sebal metric parameters defined by bastiaanssen 2000 and allen et al 2007 the numerical method employed to minimize the objective function was the method quasi newton proposed by byrd et al 1995 this method is employed for solving large nonlinear optimization problems with simple bounds using a limited amount of computer memory byrd et al 1995 proposed a efficient way for approximating to the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithm broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 thus by restricting the lower and upper limits of the parameters sample space this optimization method received the initials l and b starting to be called l bfgs b in table 3 the functions used and their respective parameters are listed as well as the thresholds of variation within their sample space i e the minimum and maximum thresholds after selecting the anchor pixels and optimizing the parameters gt seb is processed again for the entire image resulting in the maps of the energy fluxes and et fig 4 resumes through a flowchart the gt seb processing 2 3 algorithm evaluation the two additional processes proposed in this study were evaluated based on the following goodness of fit measures i modified kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge kling et al 2012 ii percentage bias pbias and iii root mean square error rmse as follows respectively 30 kge 1 ρ 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where ρ is the pearson correlation β is the error ratio 31 β μ e μ o and γ is the variability ratio 32 γ c v e c v o σ e μ o μ e σ o μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of et both for the values assessed e by gt seb and for the values in situ observed o of et cv refers to the coefficient of variation 33 pbias i 1 n e i o i 100 i 1 n o i 34 rmse i 1 n e i o i 2 n finally the degree of agreement was analyzed graphically between the estimated and observed et data a scatter plot as well as a linear regression was performed to assess the agreement with a 1 1 line perfect fit the software r statistical 3 6 2 r core team 2019 and the grass geographic information system 7 8 2 grass development team 2020 were used to develop the methodology of this study 3 results and discussion the algorithm proposed in this study termed gt seb is a variant of the classical sebal metric bastiaanssen 2000 allen et al 2007 and so all the physical base of these algorithms remains in the gt seb being the difference attributed to the addition of two processes in which use in situ observations of et fig 5 highlights the evaluation of add 1 for the remote sensors altum and oli tirs we observed good agreements for both sensors percentage bias pbias root mean square error rmse and modified kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge respectively reached the values of 3 6 1 01 mm d 1 and 0 80 for altum and 10 4 0 75 mm d 1 and 0 82 for oli tirs both regression line slopes are indicating by the values lower than 1 a general underestimation resulting 0 77 and 0 72 for altum and oli tirs respectively despite yielding a general underestimation we observed some overestimates points for the altum sensor fig 5 a regarding the oli tirs sensors fig 5 b the underestimations were evidenced for those days with the highest et for jatropha curcas on 2014 12 16 and 2016 03 08 for maize on 2015 05 05 and 2015 06 06 and for soybean on 2020 01 15 aiming to reduce the subjectivity and difficulty of yielding et space time series via manual selection of the anchor pixels the algorithms sebal and its successor metric already present in their recent versions the automation of the anchor pixels selection olmedo et al 2017 jaafar and ahmad 2020 automated or not these algorithms do not optimize the anchor pixels selection by the in situ observations of et as done by gt seb therefore for specific surfaces or crop managements poor results may be yielded requesting new algorithms standardization for instance paul et al 2013 evaluated at suborbital sensor level the classic sebal algorithm and the standardized version with the excess resistance parameter kb 1 su 2002 by selecting the anchor pixels manually the authors observed an improvement in the sebal performance when kb 1 was employed also laipelt et al 2020 tested the allen et al 2013 method for automatic anchor pixels selection in a forest savanna flooding ecosystem resulting in a high overestimate for the latent heat flux using images from the landsat 5 7 satellites as well as the sebal and metric algorithms bhattarai et al 2017 defined a procedure for a complete automation of the anchor pixels selection based on an exhaustive search algorithm the results showed that the automated choice of anchor pixels yielded similar estimates compared to manual ones rmse 0 35 mm d 1 in addition when evaluated by in situ observations of et at eddy covariance flux towers the automatic process of bhattarai et al 2017 reached slight improvements in contrast to those of the automatic process of allen et al 2013 i e rmse 0 82 mm d 1 against rmse 0 91 mm d 1 respectively many seb rs algorithms designed for suborbital sensors do not process the anchor selection hoffmann et al 2016 quebrajo et al 2017 methodologically this can be an advantage however it makes the et retrieval process deterministic and only one solution is possible on the other hand the possibility for selecting different pairs of anchor pixels in an image makes the process stochastic which for each pair there will be an et estimated allowing to optimize the selection and consequently improving the performance however as observed here for some days the process to automate and optimize the anchor pixels selection may not be enough to reach an optimum residual minimization i e errors equal to zero therefore add 2 is performed by optimizing the algorithm parameters allowing a wider use range i e use for particular sensors management crops surfaces and climates and improving the performance for the additional process 2 of gt seb fig 6 illustrates the results obtained regarding the oli tirs sensors for the whole period and surfaces studied the et estimated by gt seb and the et in situ observed yielded identical values by maximizing the goodness of fit measures unlike for the altum sensor we observed some points in which the algorithm did not reach the best goodness of fit resulting pbias rmse and kge values equal to 1 4 0 45 mm d 1 and 0 93 respectively moreover the value equal to 0 9 of the regression line slope highlights an underestimate driven by the et retrieved on the grass surface once the et in situ observed over the grassy area of the weather station is et0 itself obtained by penman monteith allen et al 1998 model pm we deduce that et0 presents a positive bias and are not representing a confidence observation an unexpected drought period from 2020 09 12 to 2020 11 09 was observed in the respective wet hot season leading the grassy area of the weather station to a water stress condition thus the et0 predictions by pm are not suitable presenting different characteristics than the reference crop defined by allen et al 1998 this result exposes the importance of vegetation indices to determine whether the plant is stressed or healthy and how this drives the et process simultaneously with the weather condition thus remote sensing algorithms for et retrieving are able to infer about plant physiological conditions via vegetation indices being a complement against the physical approaches as pm which is parameterized for a crop reference condition and only weather variable dependent studying coffee coffea arabica crop in a tropical climate region costa et al 2019 found that the oli tirs sensors and sebal provided a high potential to estimate et for adult trees in different growth stages however for young coffee plants the index of agreement willmott 1981 between sebal and the observed et resulted values less than 0 44 indicating low performance the authors suggest that the contamination by the soil reflectance sub pixels led to poor vegetation sensing and consequently poor sebal performance according to glenn et al 2010 the lower performance is ascribed to the heterogeneity within the pixel thus pixels from cultivated areas that reveal larger soil surface exposure may have overestimated et values mostly in the irrigated regions due to higher soil evaporation levels because of the moisture being always near its maximum retention capacity among the herein studied crops jatropha curcas plants exhibit the distinctive features of well defined leaf senescence and the decrease in the plant canopy increases the exposed soil surface sensed although presenting this particular aspect gt seb maximized the performance due to in situ optimization the accuracy and uncertainties anticipated in obtaining et through remote sensing are explained in the literature this is evident in karimi and bastiaanssen 2015 which compiled 33 research papers to investigate the error related to the et estimation according to the remote sensing done on an annual or seasonal scale they showed that the absolute error of et ranged from 1 up to 20 with an average percentage error of 5 4 and a standard deviation of 5 0 the average percentage error showed slight increase when the error of the et estimates alone in the cultivated areas were considered with 60 of the studies achieving 5 error however frequently these performances were related to algorithms that were developed and tested in sites where it was possible to perform local parameterization and calibration yilma 2017 reported the average differences between the et estimated by sebal and that measured in a lysimeter for the onion and potato crops were 9 3 and 15 4 respectively table 4 highlights the results of the parameters optimization the altum sensor mean values of 0 94 for β 1 and 0 11 for β 2 as well as the oli tirs sensors mean values of 0 92 for β 1 and 0 09 for β 2 differ from those obtained by allen et al 2007 for idaho β 1 0 85 and β 2 0 09 and by bastiaanssen 1995 for egypt β 1 1 08 and β 2 0 27 reviewing sebal parameters in other brazilian region teixeira et al 2009 reached similar values for β 1 and β 2 being 0 94 and 0 10 respectively although substantiating our results the parameters optimization performed by teixeira et al 2009 was methodologically different from the one here applied teixeira et al 2009 optimized the parameters by using multi in situ observations e g solar radiation and surface temperature for minimizing the sebal sub models residuals here we optimized the parameters of the all gt seb processes at once by using the et in situ observed and minimizing the algorithm residuals itself therefore the methodology proposed here is more parsimonious and scalable according to the parameters related to the ground heat flux β 3 and β 4 the respective mean values of 0 0035 and 0 0072 for the altum sensor and 0 0038 and 0 0071 for the oli tirs sensors are similar to the default ones bastiaanssen 1995 however these values differ from those found by paul et al 2013 β 3 0 0012 and β 4 0 0042 and from teixeira et al 2009 β 3 0 53 and β 4 1 98 this last study employed a different parameterization of the ground heat flux equation and concluded that the wide difference compared to the default values is explained by the conditions of daily irrigation and greater lai of irrigated fruit crops the last couple of parameters are related to roughness length for momentum β 5 and β 6 for the altum sensor the mean values are 5 51 and 5 80 while for the oli tirs sensors the mean values are 5 56 and 5 75 these results are in accordance with paul et al 2013 in which found values ranging from 5 77 to 5 07 for β 5 and from 4 38 to 7 30 for β 6 the et and et0f mapping from the altum sensor are highlighted in fig 7 for day 2020 12 18 the et mapping from remote sensing algorithms has relevant usefulness for precision irrigation however there are uncertainties regarding the algorithms structure input data radiometric and meteorological and predictions temporal upscaling of et laipelt et al 2020 assimilating in situ observations into these algorithms as performed by gt seb the uncertainties are minimized and the algorithm performance improved jin et al 2018 regarding the methods to temporal upscaling of instantaneous et the evaporative fraction λ λet r n g employed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 assumes that λ is self preserved over the diurnal cycle and can be used to upscale instantaneous et to daily values this assumption causes 5 10 underestimation of the daily et brutsaert and sugita 1992 therefore the reference et fraction et0f et i et0i as presented by allen et al 2007 and validated over a lysimeter area evidences strong assumptions about its constant behavior during the diurnal cycle providing a theoretical framework for temporal upscaling decoupling factor ω quantifies the degree that actual et deviates from the equilibrium et defined by the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 it is estimated from the available energy as well as aerodynamic and canopy resistance as the equilibrium canopy resistance depends on vapor pressure deficit vpd the temporal upscaling scheme then involves not only available energy but also vpd tang and li 2017 revisiting the relation among ω et0 and k c i e et0f for crop surfaces marin et al 2019 highlights how ω can drive the water consumption by tropical crops mainly for high evaporating conditions et0 4 mm d 1 next updates of gt seb should include and study ω for temporal upscaling of instantaneous et 4 conclusion in this study we proposed a new seb rs algorithm termed gt seb aiming to optimize et estimates through observations in situ the gt seb was assessed for modern sensors at the orbital oli tirs and suborbital altum levels we emphasized that its applicability is not restricted to these sensors as well as its formulation is not standardized for specific crops or surface because its main differential is the residual minimization between observations and estimates a limitation of gt seb would be the requirement of an et in situ observation due to the cost of implementing maintaining and handling meteorological instrumentation to obtain the et measurements e g lysimeter bowen ratio eddy covariance and scintillometer however indirect and less costly measures may be obtained for estimating et in situ for instance via soil moisture sensors soil matric water potential sensors or even so by applying the crop coefficient k c allen et al 1998 aiming an exploratory analysis for irrigation practitioners future research should be conducted by applying indirect methods for obtaining et in situ assessing the gt seb usefulness and performance it is important to highlight the exponential growth of digitalization in agricultural and rural areas by allowing the employment of disruptive technologies such as internet of things big data data assimilation and artificial intelligence making easier the meteorological monitoring boursianis et al 2020 moreover the procedures added to the classical formulation of seb rs algorithms may be extended for the contextural et models or conductance based et models chen and liu 2020 the algorithm proposed in this study allows the employment of precision irrigation in an optimized way since it aims to link the point precision of et in situ observed to spatial and remotely sensed et estimated thus making all agricultural production more

9686,whole ground plastic film mulching with thin soil mulching above the film pms and no mulching nm are the two dominant planting patterns for winter wheat in the semiarid rain fed region mean annual precipitation 450 mm of northwest china in this study differences in water consumption and production performance between pms and nm were analyzed as well as reasons for differences in wheat

ha 1 across all 24 experiments in pms yield stability also improved under different environments yield differences between planting patterns and among environments primarily depended on differences in spike number ha 1 average consumption of pre sowing stored water in soil from 0 to 200 cm in pms and nm accounted for 38 and 35 respectively of total evapotranspiration et in early sowing jointing middle jointing flowering and late flowering maturity phases average water consumption in pms was 36 4 39 3 and 24 3 respectively in the middle phase pms increased water consumption by 29 mm and the proportion of water consumption relative to total et by 5 6 compared with nm in early and late phases water consumption was similar in pms and nm increased water consumption in the middle phase could increase vegetative growth and sink capacity grain yield ha 1 et yield and vegetative growth were highly positively correlated with one another compared with nm pms significantly increased yield and crop water productivity by maximizing transpiration increasing water consumption in the middle phase and improving use of pre sowing stored water in conclusion pms is suitable to cultivate wheat for improving water productivity and economic benefits in the semiarid rain fed agricultural region of northwest china keywords evapotranspiration yield components vegetative growth growth phase yield formation water consumption 1 introduction water deficits are the main factor limiting crop production in rain fed regions ibrahim et al 2020 yang et al 2018a wheat triticum aestivum l is the main crop cultivated in the rain fed agricultural region of northern china with a planting area of approximately 4 5 million hectares zhao et al 2019 the semiarid rain fed agricultural region of the loess plateau in northwest china has the highest concentration of dryland wheat fields and represents a major zone for potential future increases in production lu and fan 2013 wu et al 2020 plastic film mulching and no mulching are the two main planting practices in this region the region has a strong inland climat and rainfall is not only limited 400 mm but is also unevenly distributed between seasons which results in prominent seasonal drought gao et al 2017 he et al 2016 sun et al 2010 the most severe droughts are typically in january april and are primarily responsible for low and unstable wheat yields in the region therefore to increase productivity of rain fed farming it is essential to adopt water management measures and improve crop water productivity fernández et al 2020 qin et al 2015a rockström et al 2006 xiao and wang 2003 plastic film mulching is an adaptive water management measure because it can reduce ineffective soil water evaporation and increase the water availability to crops for compensating transpiration and improving water productivity kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 kader et al 2017 kodzwa et al 2020 ma et al 2018 in northern china plastic film mulching is widely used in dryland farming of crops with low seeding density such as corn zea mays l and potato solanum tuberosum l gao et al 2019 li et al 2020 in wheat several plastic film mulching techniques have been proposed and applied since 1993 chen et al 2015 yang et al 2015 zhang and guo 2000 whole ground plastic film mulching combined with hole sowing and thin soil mulching above the plastic film pms is an improved new technique that effectively solves the problem of seedling emergence in wheat with high seeding density since its development pms has become a dominant form of plastic film mulching for wheat in northern china leading to a rapid increase in the planting area of wheat with plastic film mulching in recent years effects of plastic film mulching on yield and field water consumption i e evapotranspiration et vary greatly with environmental conditions planting methods and crop types cook et al 2006 kader et al 2017 ma et al 2018 palm et al 2014 wang et al 2015 compared with no mulching plastic film mulching significantly increases wheat yields ali et al 2018 balwinder singh et al 2016 kasirajan et al 2012 luo et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and et liu et al 2018 xie et al 2005 in some environments e g in some cool drought prone regions but decreases yields li et al 2001 qin et al 2015b yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 2013a and et chakraborty et al 2010 gupta et al 2016 kang et al 2018 in others e g in some temperate humid or semi humid zones in the semiarid rain fed environment of northwest china wang et al 2013 reported that water consumption of spring wheat from jointing to flowering stages was higher by 49 mm with plastic film mulching than with no mulching however sun et al 2020 found that plastic mulch had no significant effect on et in areas with annual rainfall 400 mm although water productivity increased with plastic film mulching in such regions in other studies soil surface mulching improved soil moisture content during the early growth period compared with no mulching but did not affect or even reduce moisture during middle and late growth phases liu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 yang and li 2006 zhang et al 2020 zribi et al 2015 it is reasonable to assume that the effect of mulching on crop yield and water productivity is not only related to soil water content and et but also more importantly to water consumption characteristics however there is a lack of systematic research on the effects of plastic film mulching on water consumption characteristics of wheat investigation of water consumption characteristics of winter wheat will reveal the basis for differences in yield and water productivity between plastic film mulching and no mulching cropping methods and also provide important information to further improve wheat yields and water productivity by optimizing water management measures water consumption characteristics of a crop must be investigated in close association with crop yield and growth notably the structural components of wheat yield i e spike number ha 1 grain number per spike and grain weight are formed sequentially in different growth phases however the demand for and consumption of water and the response to water deficit in wheat also vary greatly among different growth phases allen et al 1998 wang et al 2019 additionally grain yield formation is closely related to vegetative growth and the harvest index thus to determine water consumption characteristics of wheat in dryland farming systems it is important to understand the following components of et and their ratios to et including evaporation e transpiration t amounts of water consumed in different growth phases contribution of precipitation during the entire growth period and contribution of pre sowing stored water the few studies conducted to date on water consumption of wheat in dryland farming systems mainly focused on comparisons of et between mulching and no mulching as well as on the t e ratio in no mulching chakraborty et al 2010 gao et al 2019 kader et al 2017 kang et al 2018 li 2007 changes in environmental conditions can greatly affect crop water consumption characteristics kang et al 2007 2018 sun et al 2004 under different environments the e et ratio of wheat with no mulching generally ranges from 30 to 40 amir et al 1991 french and schultz 1984 gregory et al 1992 kang et al 2018 siddique et al 1990 yunusa et al 1993 zhang et al 2013b 2014 but values as high as 50 60 have also been reported cooper et al 1983 hamblin et al 2010 xie et al 2005 water consumption of winter wheat in different growth phases has also been reported in northwest china wang et al 2016a used the simdualkc model to estimate that the e et ratio of winter wheat ranged from 23 7 to 29 6 during the entire growth period however e et ratios calculated separately by growth phase varied greatly reaching 80 in the initial growth phase but only 2 3 in middle and late growth phases under subhumid warm conditions in northern china mean annual rainfall 573 mm mean annual temperature 14 c kang et al 2018 reported that irrespective of the water availability status of winter wheat plastic film mulching significantly increased water consumption in the middle phase jointing heading by 2 2 5 2 compared with no mulching but significantly decreased water consumption in the late phase heading maturity the semiarid rain fed agricultural region in northwest china has lower annual precipitation 450 mm higher aridity 3 0 more severe seasonal drought and lower mean annual temperature than a subhumid rain fed agricultural region annual precipitation 450 600 mm aridity 2 5 li 2007 however in this specific semiarid rain fed environment only a few studies have compared water consumption characteristics and production performances of winter wheat between plastic film mulching and no mulching treatments in this study 24 field experiments with winter wheat were conducted over 10 growing seasons 2008 2019 at three sites in the semiarid rain fed region of northwest china to achieve the following objectives 1 to compare differences in water consumption characteristics between plastic film mulching and no mulching 2 to determine correlations between grain yield and water consumption characteristics and 3 t0 explore water management measures to further improve wheat yield and crop water productivity under the two mulching practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description to fully test the production performances and relative differences of the two planting patterns under variable cultivation conditions table 1 24 field experiments with winter wheat were conducted from 2008 to 2019 in the semiarid rain fed region of northwest china at three different locations shanghe pinxiang and anding soil physicochemical properties 0 20 cm were measured at the initiation of experiments at the three sites geographic information and soil properties of the three sites are listed in table 2 in each year and at all three sites winter wheat seeds were sown between september 15 and 25 and plants were harvested between july 1 and 20 precipitation during the growth period accounted for 54 68 of the annual precipitation from 2008 2019 2 2 experimental design each experiment consisted of two mulching treatments fig 1 whole field plastic film mulching with hole sowing and thin layer soil mulching above the plastic film pms and no mulching nm in the pms treatment the whole planting area was mulched with plastic film 0 008 0 01 mm thickness 120 cm width with no ridges and a thin 0 5 cm loose soil layer on top of the plastic film to prevent the film from moving during sowing and seedling emergence hole sowing i e bunch planting was conducted by mechanically punching holes ø 5 cm into the plastic film seeds were sown in the bottom of holes at approximately 4 cm below the film the number of seeds sown per hole was determined by the sowing rate ha 1 and the grain weight row to row spacing and hole to hole spacing in pms were 20 cm and 12 cm respectively plastic film mulching sowing and addition of the thin soil layer above the plastic film were all completed simultaneously by special working machinery in the nm treatment seeds were sown in rows on flat ground using a drilling machine with row to row spacing of 20 cm a randomized block design with three replicates was used in all 24 experiments throughout the study 2008 2019 plot size varied among the three sites 36 m2 3 6 m 10 0 m at anding 2008 2010 and 50 240 m2 6 0 12 0 m width 8 4 20 0 m length at shanghe and pinxiang 2011 2019 winter wheat cultivars adapted to local conditions were tested at the three sites table 1 in each experiment sowing rate and fertilizer application rate ha 1 previous crop pre sowing tillage method field management practices for disease pest and weed control during the growth period and cultivars tested were the same for both pms and nm all chemical fertilizers were applied before sowing diseases pests and weeds caused no significant harm to wheat plants in pms and nm in any experiment growth conditions including test sites years rainfall over the entire growth season or in different growth stages tillage methods previous crops fertilizer application rates and sowing rates varied among the 24 field experiments table 1 these differences in production conditions fully represented the variation in farmland conditions of winter wheat production in the semiarid rain fed regions of northwest china thus the study was a comprehensive analysis of the production performances or the effects of pms and nm in variable environments 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water storage soil gravimetric water content swc was measured at eight growth stages of winter wheat sowing overwintering regreening jointing booting flowering milking and maturity at each growth stage swc was determined in eight soil layers 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 90 90 120 120 150 150 180 and 180 200 cm using an oven method yan et al 2018 in each plot soil samples were collected from the area between two rows using a steel core auger 5 cm diameter soils were dried at 105 c for 48 h until a constant weight was achieved mean swc was calculated as the weighted average of the eight soil layers soil water storage sw mm at 0 200 cm was calculated using eq 1 zhang et al 2017 1 sw i n h i ρ i ω i 10 where h i is the soil depth mm ρ i represents the soil bulk density g cm 3 ω i is the swc n is the number of soil layers and i represents the soil layer 0 20 20 40 40 60 180 200 cm at the start of the experiments at each site soil bulk density of the eight soil layers was measured by the cutting ring method cylindrical cores 250 cm3 8 cm in diameter 5 cm in height were used to collect undisturbed soil samples samples were oven dried for 48 h at 105 c to determine soil bulk density ρ i 2 3 2 field water consumption field water consumption also known as evapotranspiration et mm was calculated using eq 2 li et al 2004 2 et p w where p represents the total rainfall over the entire growth period of winter wheat and w mm represents the change or difference in sw in the 0 200 cm layer between sowing and maturity stages w is also referred to as the consumption of pre sowing stored soil water cps by winter wheat across the entire growth period field experiments were conducted under rain fed conditions supplementation by the upward flow of groundwater into the root zone and loss of rainwater due to surface runoff and leaching into the soil below 200 cm were excluded from the above water balance equation wei et al 2018 for the following reasons first at the three sites the water table was too deep 100 m below the surface to enable upward flow of water into the root zone balwinder singh et al 2011a thus supplementation by groundwater was considered negligible second the experimental field at each site was in a dryland where the local rainfall was generally low and only a few rainstorms or waterlogging events were reported during the winter wheat growing season moreover there were many sowing and seepage holes above the plastic film in pms plots where rainfall could penetrate into soil therefore surface runoff and seepage into the soil below 200 cm were also considered negligible in pms and nm treatments with almost all rainfall retained in the 0 200 cm soil layer 2 3 3 crop water productivity crop water productivity cwp is defined as the ratio between the marketable yield produced by a crop and crop et fernández et al 2020 two types of cwp kg ha 1 mm 1 or kg m 3 cwpg based on grain yield and cwpb based on biomass of grains straw spike axes glumes and other plant parts were calculated using eq 3 and eq 4 respectively 3 cwpg g et 4 cwpb b et where et represents the total evapotranspiration mm or m 3 from sowing to maturation g is the grain yield kg ha 1 and b is the biomass kg ha 1 cwpb is also known as crop water use efficiency fernández et al 2020 2 3 4 soil temperature soil temperature was measured at seven growth stages overwintering regreening jointing booting flowering milking and maturity in each growth stage mercury in glass geothermometers with bent stems were inserted into the soil between two rows of winter wheat plants at 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm in each plot at a fixed position soil temperature was recorded at 0700 1400 and 1900 on a sunny day daily average soil temperature was calculated as the average of three readings obtained in one day in a given growth stage soil temperature and moisture were measured on the same day 2 3 5 agronomic parameters all plants were harvested from each plot and grain yield was recorded at maturity three sample points of 1 m2 were randomly selected within each plot to survey spike number ha 1 therefore the accumulative area surveyed was 3 m2 per plot because each treatment had three replicate plots the total area surveyed was 9 m2 to measure various agronomic parameters such as grain number per spike thousand grain weight and plant biomass 20 30 plants were randomly sampled from each plot water content and dry weight of grains and straw samples were determined by oven drying samples at 105 c for 30 min and then at 85 c for 48 h until a constant weight was achieved then grain yield straw yield including stem leaf ear axis and thousand grain weight were adjusted to 13 water content harvest index hi was calculated from grain yield g and biomass b using eq 5 5 hi g b 100 2 3 6 economic benefit analysis economic benefit analysis was based on a survey of current prices of winter wheat at the local market and agricultural material outlets net income cny ha 1 was calculated by subtracting the input cost from the output value the output value was calculated according to 2 4 kg 1 of winter wheat grains determined over years inputs in nm included seed cost 540 ha 1 fertilizer cost 885 ha 1 pesticide cost 75 ha 1 and the total cost of labor tillage and harvest 2250 ha 1 the total input cost in nm was 3750 ha 1 the input costs in pms were the same as those in nm however pms included 1425 ha 1 as the input cost for purchasing plastic film and related operations i e mulching film before sowing and removing residual film from field after harvest as a result the total input cost of pms was 5175 ha 1 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analysis of data was performed using the spss 22 0 software spss inc chicago il usa average values from different treatments were examined by one way anova followed by least signiﬁcant difference lsd test p 0 05 because the main goal of this study was to compare relative differences between pms and nm under the same conditions in each experiment the effects of other factors e g year site cultivar fertilizer application rate planting density soil tillage method previous crop and interactions between factors in different experiments were not analyzed the coefficient of variation cv can be used to test the response or sensitivity of agronomic parameters to environmental changes 3 results 3 1 grain yield and crop water productivity generally grain yield was higher in pms than in nm across all 24 experiments table 3 and fig 2 average grain yield in pms was 4490 kg ha 1 range 2405 to 6037 kg ha 1 whereas that in nm was 3645 kg ha 1 range 1268 to 5473 kg ha 1 compared with nm average yield in pms increased 23 2 range 13 7 to 89 7 or 845 kg ha 1 range 644 to 1627 kg ha 1 however in some years yield was significantly lower in pms than in nm crop water productivity was also significantly higher in pms than in nm table 3 and fig 2 average grain yield based water productivity cwpg in pms was 11 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 range 6 4 14 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 whereas that in nm was 9 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 range 3 4 12 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 average cwpg was 25 6 higher in pms than in nm average biomass based water productivity cwpb was also significantly higher in pms than in nm with an increase of 27 9 in pms table 3 3 2 evapotranspiration et and water consumption characteristics in addition to grain yield water consumption was also higher in pms than in nm compared with total et average et in pms was 404 mm range 300 503 mm and that in nm was 386 mm range 241 493 mm across all 24 experiments table 3 and fig 2 thus average et was 18 mm higher in pms than in nm regardless of mulching treatment water consumption of winter wheat in the drylands primarily depended on rainfall during growth period of winter wheat average rainfall during the entire growth period was 250 mm range 176 342 mm which accounted for approximately 61 9 64 8 of total et in the entire growth period because precipitation over the entire growth period was the same in pms and nm treatments the consumption of pre sowing stored soil water had to increase in pms average consumption of pre sowing stored soil water over the 24 experiments was 154 mm range 48 267 mm in pms and 136 mm range 13 248 mm in nm which accounted for 38 1 and 35 2 of total et respectively therefore pms promoted use of pre sowing stored soil water in an analysis of water consumed during different growth phases across 17 experiments fig 2 pms significantly increased average water consumption in the middle growth phase by 29 mm compared with that in nm table 3 in early sowing jointing middle jointing flowering and late flowering maturity growth phases average water consumption was 141 152 and 94 mm respectively in pms and 151 123 and 92 mm respectively in nm although water consumption was similar in pms and nm in early and late phases water consumption in the middle phase increased significantly by 5 6 in pms water consumption decreased in the early phase by 4 8 in pms compared with nm water consumption in pms in early middle and late phases was 36 4 39 3 and 24 3 respectively whereas that in nm was 41 2 33 7 and 25 1 respectively in the late phase whether amount or proportion of water consumption the difference between pms and nm was minimal the middle phase in wheat is both the phase of vigorous vegetative growth and the key phase to maximize spikes ha 1 and grains per spike the pms treatment increased water consumption in the middle phase which might explain the significantly higher grain yield and water productivity cwpg in pms than in nm 3 3 yield components and vegetative growth grain yield can be expressed as the product of spikes ha 1 grains per spike and grain weight or as the product of total sink capacity spikes ha 1 grains per spike and grain weight the increase in grain yield in pms was primarily due to a significant increase in effective spikes ha 1 compared with nm pms increased average spikes ha 1 by 15 9 grains per spike by 4 7 thousand grain weight by 3 4 and total sink capacity grains ha 1 by 21 5 table 3 and fig 2 thousand grain weight was the most stable yield component grain yield is also defined as the product of biomass ha 1 and the harvest index in this definition the increase in grain yield in pms was primarily due to a significant increase in vegetative growth compared with nm pms increased average biomass by 26 7 and straw yield by 29 5 but slightly decreased the harvest index by 2 9 table 3 and fig 2 3 4 soil temperature soil temperatures at 5 15 20 and 25 cm across different growth stages revealed that pms increased the average temperature of the 0 25 cm soil layer by 0 3 c compared with nm table 3 and fig 2 although the effect of pms on soil temperature varied greatly across the different growth stages it had the dual effect of warming in the early stages and cooling in the late stages the temperature of the 0 25 cm soil layer from overwintering to jointing stages was 0 5 1 5 c higher in pms than in nm however at flowering and milking stages the soil temperature was 0 2 1 2 c lower in pms than in nm at maturity soil temperature was similar in pms and nm 3 5 effects of environmental fluctuations on major agronomic parameters and water use indicators the coefficient of variation cv of grain yield across different experiments was significantly lower in pms 21 than in nm 27 table 3 and fig 2 therefore compared with nm pms not only had higher grain yield but also greater grain yield stability under different environments among the indicators both cps cv 40 48 and water consumption in the early phase sowing jointing cv 40 38 were more sensitive to environmental changes than other indicators whereas soil temperature was the most stable cv 5 6 among the three yield components spikes ha 1 was the most sensitive to environmental changes cv 23 24 followed by grains per spike cv 13 19 and thousand grain weight was the most stable cv 12 13 the sensitivity of biomass cv 20 27 and straw yield cv 22 30 was much higher than that of the harvest index cv 8 11 the cv of most indicators was lower in pms than in nm indicating that pms could maintain stable production performance under varying environments 3 6 mechanisms to explain differences in grain yield in the combined correlation analysis n 48 of the two planting patterns fig 3 grain yield was significantly positively correlated with spikes ha 1 grains per spike thousand grain weight total sink capacity biomass straw yield cwpg cwpb et rainfall during the entire growth period cps and water consumption in the early and middle phases r 0 25 0 95 spikes ha 1 was the most important yield component affecting differences in grain yield between different planting patterns and among different environments among the three yield components or structure factors spikes ha 1 was the most closely correlated with grain yield r 0 66 p 0 01 and was also the primary factor determining the sink capacity r 0 81 p 0 01 high yield of dryland wheat was also highly dependent on good vegetative growth and grain yield was strongly positively correlated with straw yield r 0 86 p 0 01 and biomass r 0 95 p 0 01 evapotranspiration grain yield and straw yield were highly positively correlated with one another those correlations indicated that high grain yield and increased vegetative growth of dryland wheat depended on increases in water consumption grain yield was significantly positively correlated with et r 0 59 p 0 01 rainfall during the entire growth period tr and the consumption of pre sowing stored soil water cps furthermore grain yield was most highly positively correlated with water consumption in the middle growth phase cm r 0 79 p 0 01 n 34 followed by water consumption in the early growth phase ce r 0 40 p 0 05 n 34 however the correlation between grain yield and water consumption in the late phase cl was not significant straw yield is a direct measure of vegetative growth straw yield spikes and grains ha 1 form between emergence and flowering stages straw yield was significantly positively correlated p 0 01 with cm r 0 71 n 34 ce r 0 56 n 34 spikes ha 1 r 0 75 grains ha 1 r 0 81 and grain yield r 0 86 straw yield spikes ha 1 sink capacity grains ha 1 and grain yield were not only highly positively correlated with one another r 0 66 0 88 p 0 01 but also with et cps ce cm tr and cl however correlations of straw yield p 0 01 with et r 0 68 cps r 0 45 ce r 0 56 n 34 and tr r 0 45 were stronger than those of grain yield p 0 01 with et r 0 59 cps r 0 44 ce r 0 40 p 0 05 n 34 and tr r 0 32 p 0 05 by contrast the correlation between straw yield and cm r 0 71 was weaker than that between grain yield and cm r 0 79 p 0 01 n 34 thus increases in water consumption of the early growth phase promoted vegetative growth whereas increases in water consumption of the middle growth phase improved grain yield when correlation analyses were performed separately for pms and nm correlation trends of most indicators were similar between treatments nevertheless correlations of grain yield with et cps cm and tr were stronger in nm r 0 48 0 85 than in pms r 0 29 0 68 these results indicated that grain yield was affected by water consumption and restricted by water stress to a greater extent in nm than in pms 3 7 economic benefits the average output value of nm was 8747 ha 1 the total input cost was 3750 ha 1 and therefore the net income of nm was 4997 ha 1 compared with nm pms increased average grain yield by 845 kg ha 1 output value by 2028 ha 1 and net income by 603 ha 1 however the average input cost in pms was 1425 ha 1 higher than that in nm and thus the grain yield increase of 594 kg ha 1 over that in nm was a critical threshold in pms to offset the extra input cost 4 discussion 4 1 correlations between water consumption characteristics and yield components among the three yield components spikes ha 1 showed the greatest increase in pms compared with nm as well as the highest coefficient of variation and the strongest correlation with yield therefore spikes ha 1 was the primary yield component that determined the yield difference between pms and nm treatments as well as the primary factor affecting sink capacity this conclusion is consistent with that of previous studies in which increases in grain yield under mulching were primarily attributed to an increase in effective spikes ha 1 liu et al 2018 mcmaster et al 1994 zhao et al 2019 and grains per spike liu et al 2018 thompson and chase 1992 increases in water consumption of the middle growth phase from jointing to flowering benefit the formation of high yield in addition to the formation of effective spikes and grains the middle growth phase also has the most vigorous vegetative growth highest water requirement and highest sensitivity to water deficit hence it is critical to ensure an adequate water supply during the middle phase in order to achieve high yields in this study water consumption characteristics in pms promoted high yields compared with nm pms significantly increased straw yield and water consumption of the middle growth phase and straw yield was also significantly positively correlated with water consumption of the middle growth phase spikes ha 1 grains ha 1 and grain yield therefore in pms an increase in water consumption of the middle growth phase significantly promoted vegetative growth and the increase in vegetative growth likely increased the supply of photosynthetic products to increase numbers of spikes ha 1 and sink capacity previous studies reached a similar conclusion parmar and sharma 1998 stagnari et al 2014 yan et al 2019 yin et al 2016 4 2 high crop water productivity in pms in this study evapotranspiration et grain yield biomass and crop water productivity were higher in pms than in nm fig 2 and table 3 increases in grain yield associated with higher evapotranspiration have been reported previously chang et al 2019 liu et al 2018 sang et al 2016 sun et al 2006a 2006b wang et al 2013 xie et al 2005 although an increase in evapotranspiration could improve yields the increase in the transpiration ratio t et was the main reason why the yield in pms was higher than that in nm for the reasons described below plastic mulching is a type of whole ground mulching in this study the area of sowing holes accounted for only 5 of the total mulched area and the sowing holes were almost completely covered by plants before and after overwintering therefore evapotranspiration was approximately equal to transpiration in pms the evapotranspiration in pms was only 18 mm greater than that in nm according to the water productivity cwpg in pms 11 3 ha 1 mm 1 table 3 pms should have only increased yield by 203 kg ha 1 or 5 6 compared with that in nm 3645 kg ha 1 however pms increased yield by 845 kg ha 1 or 23 2 compared with that in nm this result suggested that the main reason for the yield increase in pms was that most of evapotranspiration was used for transpiration which benefited production yang et al 2012 and wang et al 2016b also suggest that soil evaporation in pms can be ignored due to the heavy workload of using lysimeter to determine evaporation in the field people try to find a method to estimate soil evaporation indirectly for example li et al 2013a found that the soil evaporation in nm with maize can be calculated accurately on the basis of a regression equation between biomass and the transpiration in pms although most of the evapotranspiration in pms may be used for transpiration there may still be a bias or discrepancy in estimating the evaporation in pms or the evaporation in nm by pms song et al 2016 wang et al 2018 2019 for the following reasons first although the sowing holes were small in pms the evaporation might be enhanced or underestimated due to the edge effect of water diffusion by the sowing holes moreover the thin soil layer above plastic film might intercept some rainfall more or less thus the rainfall intercepted by this thin soil layer can be regarded as the evaporation in pms second the proportion of stomatal and non stomatal transpiration might be different between pms and nm balwinder singh et al 2011b blum 2009 rawson and clarke 1988 zhang et al 1987 third transpiration efficiency might vary under different planting conditions or environments sinclair et al 2010 stewart and lal 2012 in addition some studies showed that mulching primarily reduces the evaporation in early and middle growth phases whereas plant shading is gradually more significant in reducing evaporation with increasing canopy size balwinder singh et al 2011b gong et al 2015 todd 1991 yang and li 2006 furthermore transpiration represents the main route of water loss in the late growth phase and the transpiration of wheat after flowering accounts for more than 90 of evapotranspiration wang et al 2016a therefore pms had little effect on inhibiting soil evaporation in the late growth phase however it is crucial to reduce the evaporation before flowering in wheat by mulching or soil tillage 4 3 differences in soil moisture and temperature conditions between the two planting patterns in this study the effects of pms on soil moisture and temperature varied greatly in different growth stages soil depths and years soil moisture and temperature were generally significantly higher in pms than in nm before the jointing stage and lower or similar after jointing the method of covering soil on plastic film in pms can reduce the absorption of solar heat by the soil so its effect on soil temperature may be different from that of the typical transparent film mulching because of article length limitation the spatiotemporal differences in soil moisture and temperature between pms and nm will be reported in detail in a future paper after the jointing stage the reduction in soil moisture in pms compared with nm was primarily related to greater water consumption whereas the cooling effect might be related to shade provided by larger canopies balwinder singh et al 2011b todd et al 1991 the effects of pms on reductions in soil moisture and temperature were most obvious and common especially after the flowering stage these results are consistent with those of previous studies on other crop species and demonstrate that mulching has dual effects of increasing and decreasing soil moisture and temperature at different growth stages compared with no mulching deng et al 2019 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2013 yang and li 2006 zhang et al 2020 zribi et al 2015 during the overwintering period the warming effect benefits crops because it reduces plant mortality and helps sustain root growth chen et al 2010 tahir et al 2008 in addition in the early growth phase when the air temperature is low i e regreening jointing the warming effect of mulching can promote plant growth li et al 2013b tolk et al 1999 yu et al 2018 by contrast in warm weather with high air temperatures the cooling effect of mulching helps reduce the intensity of evapotranspiration and protects plants from damage by high temperatures chakraborty et al 2010 liu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 therefore the dual warming and cooling effects of mulching provide a suitable hydrothermal environment to promote plant growth and yield chakraborty et al 2008 mo et al 2018 tahir et al 2008 yang et al 2018b yu et al 2018 4 4 evapotranspiration and soil moisture status in this study compared with nm pms increased evapotranspiration by 18 mm and average soil water storage by 9 mm during the entire growth period in theory the average soil water storage in pms should be lower than that in nm this discrepancy between expected and observed results may be related to the sample estimation error theoretically the average soil moisture content during the entire growth period is expected to be an average of the population the expected average should be calculated from data measured continuously over the entire growing period however in the current study soil moisture was measured at only eight growth stages and the time intervals between two consecutive measurements were not equal therefore a discrepancy between the estimated sample average and the expected average was inevitable in fact as mentioned above soil moisture content in pms was often significantly lower than that in nm after flowering therefore the conclusion that pms can maintain a sufficient soil water supply over the entire growth period of winter wheat should be considered with caution 4 5 contributions of water consumption of pre sowing stored water and rainfall to evapotranspiration during the entire growth period in this study water consumption of pre sowing stored water cps and rainfall during the entire growth period accounted for approximately 40 and 60 respectively of total evapotranspiration the three sites are at high altitude 1500 m a s l on the loess plateau in northwest china the area cropped with wheat in this region accounts for 48 53 of the total area used for wheat cultivation in northwest china because of the relatively low temperatures at high altitude the growth period of winter wheat can be as long as 280 310 days thus the proportion of rainfall received during the winter wheat growth period relative to the annual rainfall in this region is higher than that received in other rain fed agricultural areas in north china however in this region the amount of rainfall during the winter wheat growth period varied among years sometimes by more than twofold in the semiarid and high altitude region of the loess plateau in northwest china there is little rainfall from november to april the mean precipitation during this period accounts for only 31 range 20 45 of the annual rainfall but the length of this period accounts for 58 63 of the entire wheat growth period as a result there is often severe seasonal drought therefore water consumption from the emergence stage to the booting stage of winter wheat primarily depends on the pre sowing stored soil water the stored water is primarily from rainfall during the fallow period and residual water after the previous crop thus to alleviate the effects of spring drought it is very important to increase pre sowing soil water storage as much as possible to further increase its contribution to evapotranspiration and meet water consumption demand during early and middle growth phases of winter wheat 4 6 approaches to further increase yield and grain yield based water productivity under different planting patterns based on the experimental results and the above discussion the following are proposed to increase grain yield and grain yield based water productivity cwpg of winter wheat first to increase pre sowing soil water storage plastic film mulching should be applied as early as possible during the fallow period before sowing second compared with nm pms increased straw yield or vegetative growth 29 5 more than grain yield 23 2 which led to a higher biomass based water productivity cwpb than cwpg therefore plastic film mulching has great potential to further improve yields and cwpg by decreasing redundant vegetative growth improving the transfer efficiency from pre anthesis photosynthate to grain increasing the contribution of photosynthates to grains after anthesis and using cultivars with relatively high harvest index and grain weight third in both nm and pms deep plowing 25 30 cm or deep loosing tillage 35 cm before sowing could be necessary to break down the plow pan and increase rainwater storage in soil yu et al 2021 fourth soil surface tillage should be conducted in nm during the early growth phase of winter wheat i e before the jointing stage to reduce soil evaporation 4 7 economic benefits of pms and alternative planting patterns compared with nm in most years and environments pms significantly increased grain yield and net income thus pms is suitable for the semiarid rain fed agricultural region of northwest china however in certain years such as those with severe drought or abundant rainfall pms either increased yield without an increase in net income or simultaneously reduced both yield and net income however importantly in the semiarid rain fed regions of northwest china annual rainfall 400 mm uneven rainfall distribution and severe seasonal drought often leads to no winter wheat production in nm in such scenarios plastic film mulching can be used to stabilize yield and avoid input risk which is the first factor considered by farmers in growing wheat liu et al 2018 in addition to reduce investment plastic film mulching is generally applied for two growing seasons and no tillage planting is adopted in the second growing season to promote the application of pms it is important to develop more advanced techniques that can reduce the cost of pms and control the pollution caused by residual polyethylene films hu et al 2020 sun et al 2020 for example by using low cost biodegradable film to replace plastic film 5 conclusions whole ground plastic film mulching combined with hole sowing and thin soil mulching above the film pms is an improved new cropping methods this study focused on comparing the differences in water consumption characteristics and production performances between pms and the conventional no mulching with wheat sown in rows nm in the semiarid rain fed region of northwest china and on analyzing the mechanisms of the difference in grain yield and water productivity between pms and nm compared with nm pms greatly improved the grain yield water productivity and net income grain yield differences between pms and nm mainly depended on the differences in spikes ha 1 by increasing the water consumption in the middle growth phase jointing flowering improving the ability of plants to use pre sowing water stored in soil at 0 200 cm and maximizing the transpiration water consumption ratio pms promoted vegetative growth and increased sink capacity grains ha 1 it was the optimized water utilization ways or water consumption structures mentioned above that were the water support mechanisms for pms to improve water productivity and yield it is concluded that pms is suitable for winter wheat production in the semiarid rain fed region there has been a lack of systematic research on the effects of plastic film mulching on water consumption characteristics of wheat based on the results of this study to further improve the water productivity of pms it is suggested to apply pms as early as possible during the fallow period before sowing to increase rainwater storage in soil by deep plowing or deep loosing tillage before sowing and to reduce redundant vegetative growth by selecting suitable cultivars and field management measures in addition it is also very important to reduce the cost of pms by improving the technology and control the residual polyethylene pollution by using low cost biodegradable films in the future declaration of competing

9686,whole ground plastic film mulching with thin soil mulching above the film pms and no mulching nm are the two dominant planting patterns for winter wheat in the semiarid rain fed region mean annual precipitation 450 mm of northwest china in this study differences in water consumption and production performance between pms and nm were analyzed as well as reasons for differences in wheat yield in 24 field experiments conducted from 2008 to 2019 at three sites compared with nm pms had higher average grain yield 23 2 crop water productivity based on grain yield 25 6 and net income 603 ha 1 across all 24 experiments in pms yield stability also improved under different environments yield differences between planting patterns and among environments primarily depended on differences in spike number ha 1 average consumption of pre sowing stored water in soil from 0 to 200 cm in pms and nm accounted for 38 and 35 respectively of total evapotranspiration et in early sowing jointing middle jointing flowering and late flowering maturity phases average water consumption in pms was 36 4 39 3 and 24 3 respectively in the middle phase pms increased water consumption by 29 mm and the proportion of water consumption relative to total et by 5 6 compared with nm in early and late phases water consumption was similar in pms and nm increased water consumption in the middle phase could increase vegetative growth and sink capacity grain yield ha 1 et yield and vegetative growth were highly positively correlated with one another compared with nm pms significantly increased yield and crop water productivity by maximizing transpiration increasing water consumption in the middle phase and improving use of pre sowing stored water in conclusion pms is suitable to cultivate wheat for improving water productivity and economic benefits in the semiarid rain fed agricultural region of northwest china keywords evapotranspiration yield components vegetative growth growth phase yield formation water consumption 1 introduction water deficits are the main factor limiting crop production in rain fed regions ibrahim et al 2020 yang et al 2018a wheat triticum aestivum l is the main crop cultivated in the rain fed agricultural region of northern china with a planting area of approximately 4 5 million hectares zhao et al 2019 the semiarid rain fed agricultural region of the loess plateau in northwest china has the highest concentration of dryland wheat fields and represents a major zone for potential future increases in production lu and fan 2013 wu et al 2020 plastic film mulching and no mulching are the two main planting practices in this region the region has a strong inland climat and rainfall is not only limited 400 mm but is also unevenly distributed between seasons which results in prominent seasonal drought gao et al 2017 he et al 2016 sun et al 2010 the most severe droughts are typically in january april and are primarily responsible for low and unstable wheat yields in the region therefore to increase productivity of rain fed farming it is essential to adopt water management measures and improve crop water productivity fernández et al 2020 qin et al 2015a rockström et al 2006 xiao and wang 2003 plastic film mulching is an adaptive water management measure because it can reduce ineffective soil water evaporation and increase the water availability to crops for compensating transpiration and improving water productivity kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 kader et al 2017 kodzwa et al 2020 ma et al 2018 in northern china plastic film mulching is widely used in dryland farming of crops with low seeding density such as corn zea mays l and potato solanum tuberosum l gao et al 2019 li et al 2020 in wheat several plastic film mulching techniques have been proposed and applied since 1993 chen et al 2015 yang et al 2015 zhang and guo 2000 whole ground plastic film mulching combined with hole sowing and thin soil mulching above the plastic film pms is an improved new technique that effectively solves the problem of seedling emergence in wheat with high seeding density since its development pms has become a dominant form of plastic film mulching for wheat in northern china leading to a rapid increase in the planting area of wheat with plastic film mulching in recent years effects of plastic film mulching on yield and field water consumption i e evapotranspiration et vary greatly with environmental conditions planting methods and crop types cook et al 2006 kader et al 2017 ma et al 2018 palm et al 2014 wang et al 2015 compared with no mulching plastic film mulching significantly increases wheat yields ali et al 2018 balwinder singh et al 2016 kasirajan et al 2012 luo et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and et liu et al 2018 xie et al 2005 in some environments e g in some cool drought prone regions but decreases yields li et al 2001 qin et al 2015b yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 2013a and et chakraborty et al 2010 gupta et al 2016 kang et al 2018 in others e g in some temperate humid or semi humid zones in the semiarid rain fed environment of northwest china wang et al 2013 reported that water consumption of spring wheat from jointing to flowering stages was higher by 49 mm with plastic film mulching than with no mulching however sun et al 2020 found that plastic mulch had no significant effect on et in areas with annual rainfall 400 mm although water productivity increased with plastic film mulching in such regions in other studies soil surface mulching improved soil moisture content during the early growth period compared with no mulching but did not affect or even reduce moisture during middle and late growth phases liu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 yang and li 2006 zhang et al 2020 zribi et al 2015 it is reasonable to assume that the effect of mulching on crop yield and water productivity is not only related to soil water content and et but also more importantly to water consumption characteristics however there is a lack of systematic research on the effects of plastic film mulching on water consumption characteristics of wheat investigation of water consumption characteristics of winter wheat will reveal the basis for differences in yield and water productivity between plastic film mulching and no mulching cropping methods and also provide important information to further improve wheat yields and water productivity by optimizing water management measures water consumption characteristics of a crop must be investigated in close association with crop yield and growth notably the structural components of wheat yield i e spike number ha 1 grain number per spike and grain weight are formed sequentially in different growth phases however the demand for and consumption of water and the response to water deficit in wheat also vary greatly among different growth phases allen et al 1998 wang et al 2019 additionally grain yield formation is closely related to vegetative growth and the harvest index thus to determine water consumption characteristics of wheat in dryland farming systems it is important to understand the following components of et and their ratios to et including evaporation e transpiration t amounts of water consumed in different growth phases contribution of precipitation during the entire growth period and contribution of pre sowing stored water the few studies conducted to date on water consumption of wheat in dryland farming systems mainly focused on comparisons of et between mulching and no mulching as well as on the t e ratio in no mulching chakraborty et al 2010 gao et al 2019 kader et al 2017 kang et al 2018 li 2007 changes in environmental conditions can greatly affect crop water consumption characteristics kang et al 2007 2018 sun et al 2004 under different environments the e et ratio of wheat with no mulching generally ranges from 30 to 40 amir et al 1991 french and schultz 1984 gregory et al 1992 kang et al 2018 siddique et al 1990 yunusa et al 1993 zhang et al 2013b 2014 but values as high as 50 60 have also been reported cooper et al 1983 hamblin et al 2010 xie et al 2005 water consumption of winter wheat in different growth phases has also been reported in northwest china wang et al 2016a used the simdualkc model to estimate that the e et ratio of winter wheat ranged from 23 7 to 29 6 during the entire growth period however e et ratios calculated separately by growth phase varied greatly reaching 80 in the initial growth phase but only 2 3 in middle and late growth phases under subhumid warm conditions in northern china mean annual rainfall 573 mm mean annual temperature 14 c kang et al 2018 reported that irrespective of the water availability status of winter wheat plastic film mulching significantly increased water consumption in the middle phase jointing heading by 2 2 5 2 compared with no mulching but significantly decreased water consumption in the late phase heading maturity the semiarid rain fed agricultural region in northwest china has lower annual precipitation 450 mm higher aridity 3 0 more severe seasonal drought and lower mean annual temperature than a subhumid rain fed agricultural region annual precipitation 450 600 mm aridity 2 5 li 2007 however in this specific semiarid rain fed environment only a few studies have compared water consumption characteristics and production performances of winter wheat between plastic film mulching and no mulching treatments in this study 24 field experiments with winter wheat were conducted over 10 growing seasons 2008 2019 at three sites in the semiarid rain fed region of northwest china to achieve the following objectives 1 to compare differences in water consumption characteristics between plastic film mulching and no mulching 2 to determine correlations between grain yield and water consumption characteristics and 3 t0 explore water management measures to further improve wheat yield and crop water productivity under the two mulching practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description to fully test the production performances and relative differences of the two planting patterns under variable cultivation conditions table 1 24 field experiments with winter wheat were conducted from 2008 to 2019 in the semiarid rain fed region of northwest china at three different locations shanghe pinxiang and anding soil physicochemical properties 0 20 cm were measured at the initiation of experiments at the three sites geographic information and soil properties of the three sites are listed in table 2 in each year and at all three sites winter wheat seeds were sown between september 15 and 25 and plants were harvested between july 1 and 20 precipitation during the growth period accounted for 54 68 of the annual precipitation from 2008 2019 2 2 experimental design each experiment consisted of two mulching treatments fig 1 whole field plastic film mulching with hole sowing and thin layer soil mulching above the plastic film pms and no mulching nm in the pms treatment the whole planting area was mulched with plastic film 0 008 0 01 mm thickness 120 cm width with no ridges and a thin 0 5 cm loose soil layer on top of the plastic film to prevent the film from moving during sowing and seedling emergence hole sowing i e bunch planting was conducted by mechanically punching holes ø 5 cm into the plastic film seeds were sown in the bottom of holes at approximately 4 cm below the film the number of seeds sown per hole was determined by the sowing rate ha 1 and the grain weight row to row spacing and hole to hole spacing in pms were 20 cm and 12 cm respectively plastic film mulching sowing and addition of the thin soil layer above the plastic film were all completed simultaneously by special working machinery in the nm treatment seeds were sown in rows on flat ground using a drilling machine with row to row spacing of 20 cm a randomized block design with three replicates was used in all 24 experiments throughout the study 2008 2019 plot size varied among the three sites 36 m2 3 6 m 10 0 m at anding 2008 2010 and 50 240 m2 6 0 12 0 m width 8 4 20 0 m length at shanghe and pinxiang 2011 2019 winter wheat cultivars adapted to local conditions were tested at the three sites table 1 in each experiment sowing rate and fertilizer application rate ha 1 previous crop pre sowing tillage method field management practices for disease pest and weed control during the growth period and cultivars tested were the same for both pms and nm all chemical fertilizers were applied before sowing diseases pests and weeds caused no significant harm to wheat plants in pms and nm in any experiment growth conditions including test sites years rainfall over the entire growth season or in different growth stages tillage methods previous crops fertilizer application rates and sowing rates varied among the 24 field experiments table 1 these differences in production conditions fully represented the variation in farmland conditions of winter wheat production in the semiarid rain fed regions of northwest china thus the study was a comprehensive analysis of the production performances or the effects of pms and nm in variable environments 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water storage soil gravimetric water content swc was measured at eight growth stages of winter wheat sowing overwintering regreening jointing booting flowering milking and maturity at each growth stage swc was determined in eight soil layers 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 90 90 120 120 150 150 180 and 180 200 cm using an oven method yan et al 2018 in each plot soil samples were collected from the area between two rows using a steel core auger 5 cm diameter soils were dried at 105 c for 48 h until a constant weight was achieved mean swc was calculated as the weighted average of the eight soil layers soil water storage sw mm at 0 200 cm was calculated using eq 1 zhang et al 2017 1 sw i n h i ρ i ω i 10 where h i is the soil depth mm ρ i represents the soil bulk density g cm 3 ω i is the swc n is the number of soil layers and i represents the soil layer 0 20 20 40 40 60 180 200 cm at the start of the experiments at each site soil bulk density of the eight soil layers was measured by the cutting ring method cylindrical cores 250 cm3 8 cm in diameter 5 cm in height were used to collect undisturbed soil samples samples were oven dried for 48 h at 105 c to determine soil bulk density ρ i 2 3 2 field water consumption field water consumption also known as evapotranspiration et mm was calculated using eq 2 li et al 2004 2 et p w where p represents the total rainfall over the entire growth period of winter wheat and w mm represents the change or difference in sw in the 0 200 cm layer between sowing and maturity stages w is also referred to as the consumption of pre sowing stored soil water cps by winter wheat across the entire growth period field experiments were conducted under rain fed conditions supplementation by the upward flow of groundwater into the root zone and loss of rainwater due to surface runoff and leaching into the soil below 200 cm were excluded from the above water balance equation wei et al 2018 for the following reasons first at the three sites the water table was too deep 100 m below the surface to enable upward flow of water into the root zone balwinder singh et al 2011a thus supplementation by groundwater was considered negligible second the experimental field at each site was in a dryland where the local rainfall was generally low and only a few rainstorms or waterlogging events were reported during the winter wheat growing season moreover there were many sowing and seepage holes above the plastic film in pms plots where rainfall could penetrate into soil therefore surface runoff and seepage into the soil below 200 cm were also considered negligible in pms and nm treatments with almost all rainfall retained in the 0 200 cm soil layer 2 3 3 crop water productivity crop water productivity cwp is defined as the ratio between the marketable yield produced by a crop and crop et fernández et al 2020 two types of cwp kg ha 1 mm 1 or kg m 3 cwpg based on grain yield and cwpb based on biomass of grains straw spike axes glumes and other plant parts were calculated using eq 3 and eq 4 respectively 3 cwpg g et 4 cwpb b et where et represents the total evapotranspiration mm or m 3 from sowing to maturation g is the grain yield kg ha 1 and b is the biomass kg ha 1 cwpb is also known as crop water use efficiency fernández et al 2020 2 3 4 soil temperature soil temperature was measured at seven growth stages overwintering regreening jointing booting flowering milking and maturity in each growth stage mercury in glass geothermometers with bent stems were inserted into the soil between two rows of winter wheat plants at 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm in each plot at a fixed position soil temperature was recorded at 0700 1400 and 1900 on a sunny day daily average soil temperature was calculated as the average of three readings obtained in one day in a given growth stage soil temperature and moisture were measured on the same day 2 3 5 agronomic parameters all plants were harvested from each plot and grain yield was recorded at maturity three sample points of 1 m2 were randomly selected within each plot to survey spike number ha 1 therefore the accumulative area surveyed was 3 m2 per plot because each treatment had three replicate plots the total area surveyed was 9 m2 to measure various agronomic parameters such as grain number per spike thousand grain weight and plant biomass 20 30 plants were randomly sampled from each plot water content and dry weight of grains and straw samples were determined by oven drying samples at 105 c for 30 min and then at 85 c for 48 h until a constant weight was achieved then grain yield straw yield including stem leaf ear axis and thousand grain weight were adjusted to 13 water content harvest index hi was calculated from grain yield g and biomass b using eq 5 5 hi g b 100 2 3 6 economic benefit analysis economic benefit analysis was based on a survey of current prices of winter wheat at the local market and agricultural material outlets net income cny ha 1 was calculated by subtracting the input cost from the output value the output value was calculated according to 2 4 kg 1 of winter wheat grains determined over years inputs in nm included seed cost 540 ha 1 fertilizer cost 885 ha 1 pesticide cost 75 ha 1 and the total cost of labor tillage and harvest 2250 ha 1 the total input cost in nm was 3750 ha 1 the input costs in pms were the same as those in nm however pms included 1425 ha 1 as the input cost for purchasing plastic film and related operations i e mulching film before sowing and removing residual film from field after harvest as a result the total input cost of pms was 5175 ha 1 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analysis of data was performed using the spss 22 0 software spss inc chicago il usa average values from different treatments were examined by one way anova followed by least signiﬁcant difference lsd test p 0 05 because the main goal of this study was to compare relative differences between pms and nm under the same conditions in each experiment the effects of other factors e g year site cultivar fertilizer application rate planting density soil tillage method previous crop and interactions between factors in different experiments were not analyzed the coefficient of variation cv can be used to test the response or sensitivity of agronomic parameters to environmental changes 3 results 3 1 grain yield and crop water productivity generally grain yield was higher in pms than in nm across all 24 experiments table 3 and fig 2 average grain yield in pms was 4490 kg ha 1 range 2405 to 6037 kg ha 1 whereas that in nm was 3645 kg ha 1 range 1268 to 5473 kg ha 1 compared with nm average yield in pms increased 23 2 range 13 7 to 89 7 or 845 kg ha 1 range 644 to 1627 kg ha 1 however in some years yield was significantly lower in pms than in nm crop water productivity was also significantly higher in pms than in nm table 3 and fig 2 average grain yield based water productivity cwpg in pms was 11 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 range 6 4 14 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 whereas that in nm was 9 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 range 3 4 12 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 average cwpg was 25 6 higher in pms than in nm average biomass based water productivity cwpb was also significantly higher in pms than in nm with an increase of 27 9 in pms table 3 3 2 evapotranspiration et and water consumption characteristics in addition to grain yield water consumption was also higher in pms than in nm compared with total et average et in pms was 404 mm range 300 503 mm and that in nm was 386 mm range 241 493 mm across all 24 experiments table 3 and fig 2 thus average et was 18 mm higher in pms than in nm regardless of mulching treatment water consumption of winter wheat in the drylands primarily depended on rainfall during growth period of winter wheat average rainfall during the entire growth period was 250 mm range 176 342 mm which accounted for approximately 61 9 64 8 of total et in the entire growth period because precipitation over the entire growth period was the same in pms and nm treatments the consumption of pre sowing stored soil water had to increase in pms average consumption of pre sowing stored soil water over the 24 experiments was 154 mm range 48 267 mm in pms and 136 mm range 13 248 mm in nm which accounted for 38 1 and 35 2 of total et respectively therefore pms promoted use of pre sowing stored soil water in an analysis of water consumed during different growth phases across 17 experiments fig 2 pms significantly increased average water consumption in the middle growth phase by 29 mm compared with that in nm table 3 in early sowing jointing middle jointing flowering and late flowering maturity growth phases average water consumption was 141 152 and 94 mm respectively in pms and 151 123 and 92 mm respectively in nm although water consumption was similar in pms and nm in early and late phases water consumption in the middle phase increased significantly by 5 6 in pms water consumption decreased in the early phase by 4 8 in pms compared with nm water consumption in pms in early middle and late phases was 36 4 39 3 and 24 3 respectively whereas that in nm was 41 2 33 7 and 25 1 respectively in the late phase whether amount or proportion of water consumption the difference between pms and nm was minimal the middle phase in wheat is both the phase of vigorous vegetative growth and the key phase to maximize spikes ha 1 and grains per spike the pms treatment increased water consumption in the middle phase which might explain the significantly higher grain yield and water productivity cwpg in pms than in nm 3 3 yield components and vegetative growth grain yield can be expressed as the product of spikes ha 1 grains per spike and grain weight or as the product of total sink capacity spikes ha 1 grains per spike and grain weight the increase in grain yield in pms was primarily due to a significant increase in effective spikes ha 1 compared with nm pms increased average spikes ha 1 by 15 9 grains per spike by 4 7 thousand grain weight by 3 4 and total sink capacity grains ha 1 by 21 5 table 3 and fig 2 thousand grain weight was the most stable yield component grain yield is also defined as the product of biomass ha 1 and the harvest index in this definition the increase in grain yield in pms was primarily due to a significant increase in vegetative growth compared with nm pms increased average biomass by 26 7 and straw yield by 29 5 but slightly decreased the harvest index by 2 9 table 3 and fig 2 3 4 soil temperature soil temperatures at 5 15 20 and 25 cm across different growth stages revealed that pms increased the average temperature of the 0 25 cm soil layer by 0 3 c compared with nm table 3 and fig 2 although the effect of pms on soil temperature varied greatly across the different growth stages it had the dual effect of warming in the early stages and cooling in the late stages the temperature of the 0 25 cm soil layer from overwintering to jointing stages was 0 5 1 5 c higher in pms than in nm however at flowering and milking stages the soil temperature was 0 2 1 2 c lower in pms than in nm at maturity soil temperature was similar in pms and nm 3 5 effects of environmental fluctuations on major agronomic parameters and water use indicators the coefficient of variation cv of grain yield across different experiments was significantly lower in pms 21 than in nm 27 table 3 and fig 2 therefore compared with nm pms not only had higher grain yield but also greater grain yield stability under different environments among the indicators both cps cv 40 48 and water consumption in the early phase sowing jointing cv 40 38 were more sensitive to environmental changes than other indicators whereas soil temperature was the most stable cv 5 6 among the three yield components spikes ha 1 was the most sensitive to environmental changes cv 23 24 followed by grains per spike cv 13 19 and thousand grain weight was the most stable cv 12 13 the sensitivity of biomass cv 20 27 and straw yield cv 22 30 was much higher than that of the harvest index cv 8 11 the cv of most indicators was lower in pms than in nm indicating that pms could maintain stable production performance under varying environments 3 6 mechanisms to explain differences in grain yield in the combined correlation analysis n 48 of the two planting patterns fig 3 grain yield was significantly positively correlated with spikes ha 1 grains per spike thousand grain weight total sink capacity biomass straw yield cwpg cwpb et rainfall during the entire growth period cps and water consumption in the early and middle phases r 0 25 0 95 spikes ha 1 was the most important yield component affecting differences in grain yield between different planting patterns and among different environments among the three yield components or structure factors spikes ha 1 was the most closely correlated with grain yield r 0 66 p 0 01 and was also the primary factor determining the sink capacity r 0 81 p 0 01 high yield of dryland wheat was also highly dependent on good vegetative growth and grain yield was strongly positively correlated with straw yield r 0 86 p 0 01 and biomass r 0 95 p 0 01 evapotranspiration grain yield and straw yield were highly positively correlated with one another those correlations indicated that high grain yield and increased vegetative growth of dryland wheat depended on increases in water consumption grain yield was significantly positively correlated with et r 0 59 p 0 01 rainfall during the entire growth period tr and the consumption of pre sowing stored soil water cps furthermore grain yield was most highly positively correlated with water consumption in the middle growth phase cm r 0 79 p 0 01 n 34 followed by water consumption in the early growth phase ce r 0 40 p 0 05 n 34 however the correlation between grain yield and water consumption in the late phase cl was not significant straw yield is a direct measure of vegetative growth straw yield spikes and grains ha 1 form between emergence and flowering stages straw yield was significantly positively correlated p 0 01 with cm r 0 71 n 34 ce r 0 56 n 34 spikes ha 1 r 0 75 grains ha 1 r 0 81 and grain yield r 0 86 straw yield spikes ha 1 sink capacity grains ha 1 and grain yield were not only highly positively correlated with one another r 0 66 0 88 p 0 01 but also with et cps ce cm tr and cl however correlations of straw yield p 0 01 with et r 0 68 cps r 0 45 ce r 0 56 n 34 and tr r 0 45 were stronger than those of grain yield p 0 01 with et r 0 59 cps r 0 44 ce r 0 40 p 0 05 n 34 and tr r 0 32 p 0 05 by contrast the correlation between straw yield and cm r 0 71 was weaker than that between grain yield and cm r 0 79 p 0 01 n 34 thus increases in water consumption of the early growth phase promoted vegetative growth whereas increases in water consumption of the middle growth phase improved grain yield when correlation analyses were performed separately for pms and nm correlation trends of most indicators were similar between treatments nevertheless correlations of grain yield with et cps cm and tr were stronger in nm r 0 48 0 85 than in pms r 0 29 0 68 these results indicated that grain yield was affected by water consumption and restricted by water stress to a greater extent in nm than in pms 3 7 economic benefits the average output value of nm was 8747 ha 1 the total input cost was 3750 ha 1 and therefore the net income of nm was 4997 ha 1 compared with nm pms increased average grain yield by 845 kg ha 1 output value by 2028 ha 1 and net income by 603 ha 1 however the average input cost in pms was 1425 ha 1 higher than that in nm and thus the grain yield increase of 594 kg ha 1 over that in nm was a critical threshold in pms to offset the extra input cost 4 discussion 4 1 correlations between water consumption characteristics and yield components among the three yield components spikes ha 1 showed the greatest increase in pms compared with nm as well as the highest coefficient of variation and the strongest correlation with yield therefore spikes ha 1 was the primary yield component that determined the yield difference between pms and nm treatments as well as the primary factor affecting sink capacity this conclusion is consistent with that of previous studies in which increases in grain yield under mulching were primarily attributed to an increase in effective spikes ha 1 liu et al 2018 mcmaster et al 1994 zhao et al 2019 and grains per spike liu et al 2018 thompson and chase 1992 increases in water consumption of the middle growth phase from jointing to flowering benefit the formation of high yield in addition to the formation of effective spikes and grains the middle growth phase also has the most vigorous vegetative growth highest water requirement and highest sensitivity to water deficit hence it is critical to ensure an adequate water supply during the middle phase in order to achieve high yields in this study water consumption characteristics in pms promoted high yields compared with nm pms significantly increased straw yield and water consumption of the middle growth phase and straw yield was also significantly positively correlated with water consumption of the middle growth phase spikes ha 1 grains ha 1 and grain yield therefore in pms an increase in water consumption of the middle growth phase significantly promoted vegetative growth and the increase in vegetative growth likely increased the supply of photosynthetic products to increase numbers of spikes ha 1 and sink capacity previous studies reached a similar conclusion parmar and sharma 1998 stagnari et al 2014 yan et al 2019 yin et al 2016 4 2 high crop water productivity in pms in this study evapotranspiration et grain yield biomass and crop water productivity were higher in pms than in nm fig 2 and table 3 increases in grain yield associated with higher evapotranspiration have been reported previously chang et al 2019 liu et al 2018 sang et al 2016 sun et al 2006a 2006b wang et al 2013 xie et al 2005 although an increase in evapotranspiration could improve yields the increase in the transpiration ratio t et was the main reason why the yield in pms was higher than that in nm for the reasons described below plastic mulching is a type of whole ground mulching in this study the area of sowing holes accounted for only 5 of the total mulched area and the sowing holes were almost completely covered by plants before and after overwintering therefore evapotranspiration was approximately equal to transpiration in pms the evapotranspiration in pms was only 18 mm greater than that in nm according to the water productivity cwpg in pms 11 3 ha 1 mm 1 table 3 pms should have only increased yield by 203 kg ha 1 or 5 6 compared with that in nm 3645 kg ha 1 however pms increased yield by 845 kg ha 1 or 23 2 compared with that in nm this result suggested that the main reason for the yield increase in pms was that most of evapotranspiration was used for transpiration which benefited production yang et al 2012 and wang et al 2016b also suggest that soil evaporation in pms can be ignored due to the heavy workload of using lysimeter to determine evaporation in the field people try to find a method to estimate soil evaporation indirectly for example li et al 2013a found that the soil evaporation in nm with maize can be calculated accurately on the basis of a regression equation between biomass and the transpiration in pms although most of the evapotranspiration in pms may be used for transpiration there may still be a bias or discrepancy in estimating the evaporation in pms or the evaporation in nm by pms song et al 2016 wang et al 2018 2019 for the following reasons first although the sowing holes were small in pms the evaporation might be enhanced or underestimated due to the edge effect of water diffusion by the sowing holes moreover the thin soil layer above plastic film might intercept some rainfall more or less thus the rainfall intercepted by this thin soil layer can be regarded as the evaporation in pms second the proportion of stomatal and non stomatal transpiration might be different between pms and nm balwinder singh et al 2011b blum 2009 rawson and clarke 1988 zhang et al 1987 third transpiration efficiency might vary under different planting conditions or environments sinclair et al 2010 stewart and lal 2012 in addition some studies showed that mulching primarily reduces the evaporation in early and middle growth phases whereas plant shading is gradually more significant in reducing evaporation with increasing canopy size balwinder singh et al 2011b gong et al 2015 todd 1991 yang and li 2006 furthermore transpiration represents the main route of water loss in the late growth phase and the transpiration of wheat after flowering accounts for more than 90 of evapotranspiration wang et al 2016a therefore pms had little effect on inhibiting soil evaporation in the late growth phase however it is crucial to reduce the evaporation before flowering in wheat by mulching or soil tillage 4 3 differences in soil moisture and temperature conditions between the two planting patterns in this study the effects of pms on soil moisture and temperature varied greatly in different growth stages soil depths and years soil moisture and temperature were generally significantly higher in pms than in nm before the jointing stage and lower or similar after jointing the method of covering soil on plastic film in pms can reduce the absorption of solar heat by the soil so its effect on soil temperature may be different from that of the typical transparent film mulching because of article length limitation the spatiotemporal differences in soil moisture and temperature between pms and nm will be reported in detail in a future paper after the jointing stage the reduction in soil moisture in pms compared with nm was primarily related to greater water consumption whereas the cooling effect might be related to shade provided by larger canopies balwinder singh et al 2011b todd et al 1991 the effects of pms on reductions in soil moisture and temperature were most obvious and common especially after the flowering stage these results are consistent with those of previous studies on other crop species and demonstrate that mulching has dual effects of increasing and decreasing soil moisture and temperature at different growth stages compared with no mulching deng et al 2019 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2013 yang and li 2006 zhang et al 2020 zribi et al 2015 during the overwintering period the warming effect benefits crops because it reduces plant mortality and helps sustain root growth chen et al 2010 tahir et al 2008 in addition in the early growth phase when the air temperature is low i e regreening jointing the warming effect of mulching can promote plant growth li et al 2013b tolk et al 1999 yu et al 2018 by contrast in warm weather with high air temperatures the cooling effect of mulching helps reduce the intensity of evapotranspiration and protects plants from damage by high temperatures chakraborty et al 2010 liu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 therefore the dual warming and cooling effects of mulching provide a suitable hydrothermal environment to promote plant growth and yield chakraborty et al 2008 mo et al 2018 tahir et al 2008 yang et al 2018b yu et al 2018 4 4 evapotranspiration and soil moisture status in this study compared with nm pms increased evapotranspiration by 18 mm and average soil water storage by 9 mm during the entire growth period in theory the average soil water storage in pms should be lower than that in nm this discrepancy between expected and observed results may be related to the sample estimation error theoretically the average soil moisture content during the entire growth period is expected to be an average of the population the expected average should be calculated from data measured continuously over the entire growing period however in the current study soil moisture was measured at only eight growth stages and the time intervals between two consecutive measurements were not equal therefore a discrepancy between the estimated sample average and the expected average was inevitable in fact as mentioned above soil moisture content in pms was often significantly lower than that in nm after flowering therefore the conclusion that pms can maintain a sufficient soil water supply over the entire growth period of winter wheat should be considered with caution 4 5 contributions of water consumption of pre sowing stored water and rainfall to evapotranspiration during the entire growth period in this study water consumption of pre sowing stored water cps and rainfall during the entire growth period accounted for approximately 40 and 60 respectively of total evapotranspiration the three sites are at high altitude 1500 m a s l on the loess plateau in northwest china the area cropped with wheat in this region accounts for 48 53 of the total area used for wheat cultivation in northwest china because of the relatively low temperatures at high altitude the growth period of winter wheat can be as long as 280 310 days thus the proportion of rainfall received during the winter wheat growth period relative to the annual rainfall in this region is higher than that received in other rain fed agricultural areas in north china however in this region the amount of rainfall during the winter wheat growth period varied among years sometimes by more than twofold in the semiarid and high altitude region of the loess plateau in northwest china there is little rainfall from november to april the mean precipitation during this period accounts for only 31 range 20 45 of the annual rainfall but the length of this period accounts for 58 63 of the entire wheat growth period as a result there is often severe seasonal drought therefore water consumption from the emergence stage to the booting stage of winter wheat primarily depends on the pre sowing stored soil water the stored water is primarily from rainfall during the fallow period and residual water after the previous crop thus to alleviate the effects of spring drought it is very important to increase pre sowing soil water storage as much as possible to further increase its contribution to evapotranspiration and meet water consumption demand during early and middle growth phases of winter wheat 4 6 approaches to further increase yield and grain yield based water productivity under different planting patterns based on the experimental results and the above discussion the following are proposed to increase grain yield and grain yield based water productivity cwpg of winter wheat first to increase pre sowing soil water storage plastic film mulching should be applied as early as possible during the fallow period before sowing second compared with nm pms increased straw yield or vegetative growth 29 5 more than grain yield 23 2 which led to a higher biomass based water productivity cwpb than cwpg therefore plastic film mulching has great potential to further improve yields and cwpg by decreasing redundant vegetative growth improving the transfer efficiency from pre anthesis photosynthate to grain increasing the contribution of photosynthates to grains after anthesis and using cultivars with relatively high harvest index and grain weight third in both nm and pms deep plowing 25 30 cm or deep loosing tillage 35 cm before sowing could be necessary to break down the plow pan and increase rainwater storage in soil yu et al 2021 fourth soil surface tillage should be conducted in nm during the early growth phase of winter wheat i e before the jointing stage to reduce soil evaporation 4 7 economic benefits of pms and alternative planting patterns compared with nm in most years and environments pms significantly increased grain yield and net income thus pms is suitable for the semiarid rain fed agricultural region of northwest china however in certain years such as those with severe drought or abundant rainfall pms either increased yield without an increase in net income or simultaneously reduced both yield and net income however importantly in the semiarid rain fed regions of northwest china annual rainfall 400 mm uneven rainfall distribution and severe seasonal drought often leads to no winter wheat production in nm in such scenarios plastic film mulching can be used to stabilize yield and avoid input risk which is the first factor considered by farmers in growing wheat liu et al 2018 in addition to reduce investment plastic film mulching is generally applied for two growing seasons and no tillage planting is adopted in the second growing season to promote the application of pms it is important to develop more advanced techniques that can reduce the cost of pms and control the pollution caused by residual polyethylene films hu et al 2020 sun et al 2020 for example by using low cost biodegradable film to replace plastic film 5 conclusions whole ground plastic film mulching combined with hole sowing and thin soil mulching above the film pms is an improved new cropping methods this study focused on comparing the differences in water consumption characteristics and production performances between pms and the conventional no mulching with wheat sown in rows nm in the semiarid rain fed region of northwest china and on analyzing the mechanisms of the difference in grain yield and water productivity between pms and nm compared with nm pms greatly improved the grain yield water productivity and net income grain yield differences between pms and nm mainly depended on the differences in spikes ha 1 by increasing the water consumption in the middle growth phase jointing flowering improving the ability of plants to use pre sowing water stored in soil at 0 200 cm and maximizing the transpiration water consumption ratio pms promoted vegetative growth and increased sink capacity grains ha 1 it was the optimized water utilization ways or water consumption structures mentioned above that were the water support mechanisms for pms to improve water productivity and yield it is concluded that pms is suitable for winter wheat production in the semiarid rain fed region there has been a lack of systematic research on the effects of plastic film mulching on water consumption characteristics of wheat based on the results of this study to further improve the water productivity of pms it is suggested to apply pms as early as possible during the fallow period before sowing to increase rainwater storage in soil by deep plowing or deep loosing tillage before sowing and to reduce redundant vegetative growth by selecting suitable cultivars and field management measures in addition it is also very important to reduce the cost of pms by improving the technology and control the residual polyethylene pollution by using low cost biodegradable films in the future declaration of competing

9687,optimal water allocation on a seasonal basis is generally a decision taken with uncertainty regarding seasonal crop needs unknown yield precipitation and other environmental factors decision criteria such as irrigating for the good years of production and applying a little extra water just in case it is needed by the plant are consistent with the rational behaviour of stochastic profit maximization the motivation behind an increase in water allocation acquiring water rights or reserving water for certain crops is that of self protection it is better to maintain an extra allocation of water than to face potential yield losses due to water constraints on production in those years when potential yields exceed average levels the stochastic optimization model presented herein is

yield uncertainty over allocation 1 introduction irrigation accounts for 70 of total global water withdrawals alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 pereira and marques 2017 and is predicted to rise by up to 80 in many river basins and aquifers in arid regions by 2030 the reduction of water withdrawals together with an increase in efficiency in water use constitute a priority in many developed and developing regions with metering and water pricing employed as the principal instruments to achieve the policy goal of sustainable water use world bank oecd 2018 water pricing has featured in the policy agenda of many institutions such as the oecd the world bank and the european union as an economic instrument towards inducing water saving and increasing productivity by inducing reallocation from low to high value uses as well as towards preventing wasteful water practices while simultaneously increasing financial resources for the operation of water services specifically the water framework directive european commission 2000 promotes the use of water pricing and the recovery of all costs nevertheless the effectiveness of water pricing is subject to the implementation of volumetric metering and reliable governance systems and the impact on water saving is related to the elasticity of demand scheierling et al 2006 carried out a meta analysis of price elasticity of agricultural water demand and reported a mean elasticity of 0 48 with higher values for high value crops more recently zuo et al 2015 found demand elasticity for high security entitlements to water rights in australia at approximately 0 57 which lies in the lower range of elasticities reported in australia from 0 52 to 1 9 therefore estimation results show that the effectiveness of water pricing remains very limited especially in the case of high value crops with very inelastic water demands berbel and expósito 2020 low price elasticities of water irrigation demand help to explain over allocation holding water resources for the next campaigns and water over use applying water in excess to crop needs by farmers this research focuses on ex ante over allocation understood as water acquired or reserved to be applied to the crop during the growing stage in the attempt to minimize potential yield losses decision criteria for the over allocation of water such as irrigating for the good years of production and applying a little extra water just in case it is needed by the plant are consistent with the expected behaviour of profit maximization the motivation behind over allocation is that of self protection against yield uncertainty in that it is deemed better to support an excessive water cost than to face potential yield losses due to water constraints on production in those years when potential yields exceed average levels uncertainty constitutes a factor in almost every aspect of irrigation and agricultural activity as driven by unpredictable climate conditions yield variability prices and changing economic and policy conditions mathematical programming applications to consider this uncertainty have seen a significant development in the last decade including stochastic inexact fuzzy and interval based programming archibald and marshall 2018 as argued by linker 2021 stochastic approaches constitute the most adequate instrument to explain risk adverse behaviour in famers decision making and are therefore more likely to be of practical interest nevertheless these techniques have been mostly applied to uncertainty in climate conditions and water availability with the aim to offer optimized irrigation schedules anvari et al 2017 pereira and marques 2017 linker 2021 yan et al 2021 additionally most stochastic water allocation decision support models applied in the literature either come from mathematical programming with mean variance or similar approaches or apply stochastic dynamic programming to irrigation scheduling in order to decide water application according to varying rain temperature crop growing stage etc though not considering yield uncertainty to the best of our knowledge there is not a similar model for water allocation as the one presented in this paper and literature has not yet explored this type of farmer behaviour regarding irrigation water management a greater use of inputs under production uncertainty is compatible with previous analyses of the impact of risk on the demand of agricultural inputs several authors such as sandmo 1971 anderson et al 1977 and just and pope 1979 have documented the impact of uncertainty in input and output prices they indicate that uncertainty in prices and the exact elicitation of the production function reduces input usage following a line of reasoning like that of magnusson 1969 magnusson develops a model for risk aversion behaviour when the production function is subject to uncertainty and concludes that factor demand is defined by the point when expected factor marginal productivity is equal to its price minus a marginal risk deduction and thus input use would be lower than in a certainty context this result assumes that the manager is a risk averter and that the co variance between the output and the input is positive however most of the theoretical models listed above refer to price uncertainty and input productivity while the model presented in this paper assumes risk neutrality the production function is known and the stochastic variable is the maximum achievable yield in summary this paper aims to explore the optimal strategy for allocation of seasonal water quota to an annual crop that maximizes stochastic profit under yield uncertainty our model has a normative nature aiming to maximize stochastic profit and offer a decision support model the hypothesis that farmers use a similar optimizing strategy requires further research which is out of this paper s scope nevertheless we believe that our model may serve as an illustration for policy making regarding impact of yield uncertainty in the potential over allocation of water water allocation is defined in this work as the decision to assign a certain volume of water in either the long term over several years or at seasonal level for the current year specifically this paper explores the microeconomic implications of the potential over allocation of irrigation water based on an agro economic model whereby no assumptions are made regarding the stochastic distribution function of yields and the risk attitude of farmers is taken as neutral for the simplicity of this research the rest of the paper is structured as follows the following section presents the agro economic model in a step by step manner the third section shows the results of the application of the proposed model to a specific case in a water abundant context finally a brief discussion and concluding remarks are provided 2 model our model is based upon the well known food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao model that can be found in steduto et al 2012 this model has shown to illustrate in a very accurately way the crop responses to water and evapotranspiration additionally this model is used in the majority of crop growth models e g aquacrop and there is a wide consensus in the agronomic field about its use in the case of herbaceous crops which is the focus of this paper in the literature we can find some empirical water response functions in quadratic or other functional forms for olives vita serman et al 2021 or almonds moldero et al 2021 but they are mainly used in the case of perennials orchards the proposed model is presented in a step by step manner to facilitate readers comprehension and to introduce factors such as expected yield that represent the actual situation faced by the farmer in the field with water allocation decisions to this end the model considers initially constant irrigation efficiency e 1 though the efficiency will be later defined as a parameter e g e 0 8 as illustrated in section 3 additionally the model considers the water yield response function demand function under alternative stochastic distribution functions thereby analysing the impacts of yield uncertainty on these various alternative function specifications 2 1 the agronomic model with constant irrigation efficiency the response of any crop to water supply has been well established in agronomy science yield response to crop evapotranspiration et may be expressed as defined by doorenbos and kassam 1979 1 1 y y m k y 1 e t e t m where y m and y are the respective maximum and actual yields et m and et are the respective maximum and actual evapotranspiration and k y is a yield response factor representing the effect of a reduction in evapotranspiration on yields a complete review of the present knowledge regarding k y coefficients and crop response to water availability can be found in steduto et al 2012 et can be calculated as 2 et r e w where r is the effective rainfall plus the variations in soil water storage during the crop growing cycle mm w is the applied irrigation mm and e is the irrigation efficiency dimensionless understood as the irrigation water that is stored in the soil ready to be evapotranspired by the crop divided by the applied irrigation when eqs 1 and 2 are combined the result is 3 1 y y m k y 1 e w r w m r where w m is the irrigation requirement for a maximum yield also known as full irrigation this equation gives a response to water with a complex relation specifically we will focus on the production function segment that is close to the maximum yield full irrigation and hence we may assume a constant irrigation efficiency as subsequently discussed the consideration of constant efficiency does not significantly affect the results therefore we have following expressions 4 y ym 1 k y 1 e w r w m r 1 k y k y r w m r k y e w w m r this conducts to 5 y y m 1 k y k y r w m r y m k y e w w m r for the sake of simplicity to derive solutions the first and second terms are substituted with parameters a0 and a1 6 y a 0 a 1 w 7 a 0 y m 1 k y k y r w m r 8 a 1 y m k y e w m r the interpretation of these parameters is shown in fig 1 a 0 rainfed non irrigated yield a 1 marginal physical water productivity these parameters are constant for each crop as they depend on specific crop and location characteristics and are known ex ante by farmers although water is obviously not the only factor related to yield e g fertilizing and other environmental conditions also affect final yield our proposed model focuses on water as production factor thus assuming that other factors are applied at an optimal level this assumption can be realistic in contexts where water is the most limiting production factor since other inputs e g fertilizers are usually available in the market the actual yield may be equal to ym when applied water is equal to or greater than full irrigation wm but it can be lower according to the linear production function when applied water w is lower than the irrigation requirement for a maximum yield wm therefore eq 9 represents our production function 9 y min a 0 a 1 w y m in the case that the farmer moves in a world of certainty then the value of the maximum attainable yield ym is known and defined by eq 10 and represented as a continuous line in fig 1 10 y m a 0 a 1 w m 2 2 water demand model in a certainty context under the assumption of a linear plateau production function as assumed by the standard agronomic model the response is illustrated by fig 1 where the optimization problem implies that the solution to maximum yield is reached exactly when water utilization reaches wm considering that irrigation efficiency equals 1 optimal water use is obtained by maximizing profit π as shown in eq 11 where c is the water cost and p the price of crop 11 π p y w c w one consequence of the linear nature of the crop response is the solution to this equation that gives the optimal irrigation water as zero or wm as stated by eq 12 12 w year j w j y mj a 0 a 1 if p a 1 c 0 otherwise therefore in a certainty context with linear response e 1 when the marginal value of water as given by p a 1 is greater than the cost c the optimal solution implies that farmers apply the exact water dose wj to reach the maximum yield ymj this solution implies perfect knowledge of the production function the net available rain r and yield certainty hypothesis that are unlikely to be present in real decision context nevertheless the proposed ex ante model assumes average values of parameters i e ym ky r p c as the most likely values for the profit function formulation being yield y and w the only variables in the model the linear nature of the production function implies that water beyond optimum will have a null marginal productivity and a negative marginal value defined by c 2 3 the agro economic model under yield uncertainty in the real world maximum potential yield ym j varies from yearly j to year k and from farmer to farmer due to uncontrollable factors linked to the weather such as temperature humidity and radiation pests and decision mistakes among others this is represented in fig 2 by the dotted lines above and below the continuous line that represents our production function where the deterministic maximum yield named ya is now defined by the historical average maximum yield μ m and converted into the stochastic maximum potential yield for year j y mj ˆ as represented in eq 13 13 y mj ˆ μ m ε y m j ˆ stands for the ex post potential maximum yield year j subject to full irrigation for the year decision variable w this potential maximum yield as expected by the farmer for next year can be higher or lower than historical average depending upon the growing conditions when growing conditions are favourable an upper yield level y h may be reached in contrast when growing conditions are adverse a lower yield level y l is reached as shown in fig 2 fig 2 is adapted from the babcock 1992 who modelized nitrogen application under yield uncertainty uniform yield distribution fig 2 aims to represent the yield response under varying water allocation which is the limiting factor in our specific case let us imagine that farmer always expect average yield ya and consequently always allocates average water wa though the real outcome for the current campaign might be either lower yl or higher yh when ex post yield is lower yl the required water dose would be lower too as given by wl thus when farmer applies the historical average dose wa there would be an over allocation of water wa wl and an economic loss as given by the excess in applied water and its cost c wa wl on the contrary when the ex post yield is higher yh and farmer applies the average historical dose wa instead of the required ex post higher dose wh the farmer would face an opportunity cost achieved yield will be ya below the potential yh this result implies a loss of potential profit as represented by p yh ya c wh wa it is worth noting that in the model all parameters are defined and exogenous i crop response to water ky ii irrigation system efficiency e g e 1 and iii rainfed conditions r which are assumed constant in our model our interest focuses on the decision variable w with the aim to maximize expected profit thus with d as the optimal water allocation in year j known ex post and obtained from eq 12 and with w ex ante water allocated by the farmer as the decision variable the equation of expected profit could be obtained the expected profit expression is given by gallego and moon 1993 where the value of production is equal to the minimum of the value of the water used w decision variable or the stochastic value of optimal water use that year d stochastic variable determined by the stochastic yield thus profit can be represented by eq 14 14 π w p a 1 e min w d c w w this decision scenario is like the inventory management decision problem known as newsvendor where there is a shortage penalty case when ex post potential yield for year j y mj requires a larger volume of water than the allocated ex ante by the farmer and therefore there is a loss of profit due to the below optimum supply of water the newsvendor problem constitutes a classic problem in the literature on inventory management arrow et al 1951 regarding eq 14 it is worth noting that it assumes that marginal value of production is positive p dy w dw c implying that irrigation is profitable and greater than zero see eq 12 let f d be the probability density function pdf of d whereby f d prob d w 0 x f d dd is the cumulative distribution function cdf of d it is assumed that f d is continuous in 0 in the following proof therefore 15 e min d w 0 min w d f d dd 0 w df d dd w w f d dw 16 π w p a 1 c w 0 w df d dd w w f d dd c w 0 w w d f d dd to find the maximum of π w a w is

satisfy eq 18 as given by 18 f w p a 1 c w p a 1 the solution in eq 17 is known as the critical fractile for the well known mathematical newsvendor problem formulated by arrow et al 1951 in our specific case this ratio balances the cost of irrigation below optimum lost income versus the costs of excess irrigation water cost 3 results using the software mathematica this section applies the model to a specific case in a water abundant context such as that of irrigated maize in certain regions of spain the following parameters are based official statistics of the spanish ministry of agriculture years 2008 2018 and ky is taken from steduto et al 2012 μ y 10 000 k y 1 25 et max 800 mm r 250 mm w m 550 mm assuming e 0 8 as representative value of sprinkler system efficiency most frequent system for maize cultivation in spain the values of a0 and a1 are a 0 1 406 kg ha a 1 12 50 kg mm ha the proposed model is tested by using various stochastic distributions of the demand

demand function for a water cost in the range 0 p a 1 has been estimated assuming a price of 0 20 eur kg of maize average value in the period 2008 2018 and parameterizing water cost c fig 3 shows the demand function for irrigation under the alternative stochastic distributions compared to the certainty decision based on historical average yield vertical dotted line constant efficiency is assumed e 0 8 which can be realistic when irrigation approaches the maximum yield fig 3 illustrates the impact of various probability distributions on water demand beta triangular and uniform distributions show a similar behaviour meanwhile normality assumption leads to a higher over allocation in this respect there is strong evidence against assuming normality in the yield distribution just and weninger 1999 the cost of irrigation in the regions producing maize in spain usually lies within the range of 0 02 0 05 eur m3 0 20 0 50 eur mm ha mimam 2008 fig 3 shows that water allocation in the normal range of prices for this crop maize between 0 and 1 0 eur m3 will give an optimal stochastic allocation above the certainty decision based on historical average table 1 summarizes the model results compared to certainty conditions table 1 shows that assuming parameters given in fig 3 crop price 0 2 eur m3 average yield 10 000 kg ha water cost 0 5 eur m3 using the beta distribution function as reference and assuming a water cost of 0 05 eur m3 farmer optimal allocation of water will be 757 mm versus the certainty value based upon historical average yield 688 mm this overallocation implies that in 80 of the years probability defined by the critical fractile p a 1 c p a 1 allocated water will be above the required dose expected profit will be 8 over the result when applied water is the average yield dose when water is considered a limiting factor results confirm that farmer s rational behaviour would be to irrigate for the good years as the expected profit would significantly increase thus the model predicts that rational behaviour under yield uncertainty leads to water over allocation the model is designed for ex ante decision support but as the world is uncertain and observed yields are only known ex post real marginal benefit of resource allocation would be only revealed after the season is finished the impact of altering parameters in the model is straightforward an increase in the variance will increase the demand at low water prices compared to the same cdf with a smaller variance the increase in irrigation efficiency to simulate different systems what may illustrate a change of the irrigation method from furrow e 0 60 sprinkler e 0 80 to drip irrigation e 0 95 will lead to an augmentation of the a1 value marginal productivity of water thereby modifying the demand function fig 4 the illustration of the impact of three different irrigation system efficiencies on the water demand function is shown in fig 4 for the case of a triangular stochastic distribution finally it is worthy of note that the drawing of conclusions regarding the price elasticity of demand may prove problematical since the demand function may take any of a variety of functional forms by using alternative stochastic distribution functions this work has aimed to offer the reader a wide analysis of the potential impacts of the selected functional form on the irrigation decision under uncertainty in our example representative of maize in spain elasticity for water prices in the range from 0 02 to 0 05 eur m3 generalized in spain for maize cultivation remains low falling in the range from 0 04 to 0 27 falls inside found by scheierling et al 2006 the advantage of the presented model is that it determines with precision the profit maximizing optimum under yield uncertainty yield uncertainty may act as a proxy to integrate many sources of crop growth uncontrollable factors such as climate variables e g precipitation temperature solar radiation that influences yield and biological factors such as pest and diseases all these variables may act as yield limiting factors including the available soil water r which is also subject to uncertainty and constitutes a critical variable in our model moreover it is the main yield limiting factor in rainfed systems further developments of our model will focus on the integration with other theoretical developments such as the work of adamson and loch 2021 that incorporates uncertainty in irrigation water supply and includes perennials in the formulation or the work of xie and zilberman 2018 that includes supply augmentation and water saving investment to optimize stochastically farm profits 4 brief discussion and concluding remarks the farmer s decision on irrigation water allocation under yield uncertainty presented in this paper does not consider the farmer s utility and assumes risk neutrality our model shows that water demand as a critical production input increases with variance under various stochastic distribution functions especially in the low range of water prices obviously irrigation water allocation planning is a complex system which contains multiple uncertainties that goes beyond yield uncertainty the focus of our model and include irrigation water supply uncertainty soil water r in our model temperature wind solar radiation that influences et commodity price uncertainty and many other production factors that influence final yield by isolating a specific factor such as yield uncertainty as a confluence of many variables mentioned previously we can focus on the influence of this factor in ex ante seasonal water allocation our results show that the impact of yield uncertainty on water demand will lead to an increase in water allocation compared to that required for historical average thus following a behaviour characterized by watering for the good years additionally the example illustrated in table 1 has shown that optimal allocation improves expected profit by 8 over water allocation based upon average historical level this improvement might be considered moderate and following the argument of pannell 2006 it might be argued that optimizing techniques are sometimes of limited practical relevance for decision support nevertheless we believe that water is a critical input for crop production and any optimization attempt is valuable especially in water scarce areas in our opinion the main policy implication is the need not only to implement modern precision technology capable of reducing yield uncertainty but also to enhance input efficiency scott et al 2014 quantitative and qualitative impacts of over irrigation on water resource management depend on the location of the field since water resulting from irrigation applied in excess may return to the catchment thereby reducing the quantitative impact of over irrigation additionally agricultural diffuse pollution should be considered as an undesirable effect that can be prevented by reducing water applied in excess in this respect empirical evidence shows that the implementation of irrigation technologies to enhance water efficiency e g drip irrigation may reduce the pollution load of return flows garcía garizábal and causapé 2010 lecina et al 2010 in any case overallocation represents a challenge for water authorities and water managers as it increases demand and quantitative pressure on the resources that can be illustrated by the recent evolution of water trade prices analysed by loch et al 2021 the limitations of the model presented in this paper include 1 the need to investigate the link between over allocation and potential over irrigation 2 the requirement for a deeper analysis into the functional form of the farmer subjective cdf of yields and 3 an expansion of the theoretical model by removing the assumption of constant irrigation system efficiency and also by including the possibility of applying deficit irrigation 4 the existence of many other sources of uncertainty that affect farmer decision regarding water allocation as we have focused exclusively on yield uncertainty the proposed model focuses on yield uncertainty and is applied to herbaceous crops therefore it does not consider water supply uncertainty either irrigation water or soil water r this represents a shortcoming of our model as illustrated by the recent increases of water price in water rights markets in australia mdb are potentially caused by prudent irrigators trying to prevent potential downside losses as a response to perceptions of future supply shortages loch et al 2021 finally impacts of over allocation as explored in this paper and potentially related over irrigation behaviour should be considered by policy makers in the design of water management plans for river basins and aquifers in order to introduce innovative management instruments such as markets of irrigation rights a new design of the irrigation rights system by including uncertainty and risks and a more effective water pricing policy among others to minimize undesirable impacts on increasingly scarce water resources funding this work was supported by the spanish

policy agenda of many institutions such as the oecd the world bank and the european union as an economic instrument towards inducing water saving and increasing productivity by inducing reallocation from low to high value uses as well as towards preventing wasteful water practices while simultaneously increasing financial resources for the operation of water services specifically the water framework directive european commission 2000 promotes the use of water pricing and the recovery of all costs nevertheless the effectiveness of water pricing is subject to the implementation of volumetric metering and reliable governance systems and the impact on water saving is related to the elasticity of demand scheierling et al 2006 carried out a meta analysis of price elasticity of agricultural water demand and reported a mean elasticity of 0 48 with higher values for high value crops more recently zuo et al 2015 found demand elasticity for high security entitlements to water rights in australia at approximately 0 57 which lies in the lower range of elasticities reported in australia from 0 52 to 1 9 therefore estimation results show that the effectiveness of water pricing remains very limited especially in the case of high value crops with very inelastic water demands berbel and expósito 2020 low price elasticities of water irrigation demand help to explain over allocation holding water resources for the next campaigns and water over use applying water in excess to crop needs by farmers this research focuses on ex ante over allocation understood as water acquired or reserved to be applied to the crop during the growing stage in the attempt to minimize potential yield losses decision criteria for the over allocation of water such as irrigating for the good years of production and applying a little extra water just in case it is needed by the plant are consistent with the expected behaviour of profit maximization the motivation behind over allocation is that of self protection against yield uncertainty in that it is deemed better to support an excessive water cost than to face potential yield losses due to water constraints on production in those years when potential yields exceed average levels uncertainty constitutes a factor in almost every aspect of irrigation and agricultural activity as driven by unpredictable climate conditions yield variability prices and changing economic and policy conditions mathematical programming applications to consider this uncertainty have seen a significant development in the last decade including stochastic inexact fuzzy and interval based programming archibald and marshall 2018 as argued by linker 2021 stochastic approaches constitute the most adequate instrument to explain risk adverse behaviour in famers decision making and are therefore more likely to be of practical interest nevertheless these techniques have been mostly applied to uncertainty in climate conditions and water availability with the aim to offer optimized irrigation schedules anvari et al 2017 pereira and marques 2017 linker 2021 yan et al 2021 additionally most stochastic water allocation decision support models applied in the literature either come from mathematical programming with mean variance or similar approaches or apply stochastic dynamic programming to irrigation scheduling in order to decide water application according to varying rain temperature crop growing stage etc though not considering yield uncertainty to the best of our knowledge there is not a similar model for water allocation as the one presented in this paper and literature has not yet explored this type of farmer behaviour regarding irrigation water management a greater use of inputs under production uncertainty is compatible with previous analyses of the impact of risk on the demand of agricultural inputs several authors such as sandmo 1971 anderson et al 1977 and just and pope 1979 have documented the impact of uncertainty in input and output prices they indicate that uncertainty in prices and the exact elicitation of the production function reduces input usage following a line of reasoning like that of magnusson 1969 magnusson develops a model for risk aversion behaviour when the production function is subject to uncertainty and concludes that factor demand is defined by the point when expected factor marginal productivity is equal to its price minus a marginal risk deduction and thus input use would be lower than in a certainty context this result assumes that the manager is a risk averter and that the co variance between the output and the input is positive however most of the theoretical models listed above refer to price uncertainty and input productivity while the model presented in this paper assumes risk neutrality the production function is known and the stochastic variable is the maximum achievable yield in summary this paper aims to explore the optimal strategy for allocation of seasonal water quota to an annual crop that maximizes stochastic profit under yield uncertainty our model has a normative nature aiming to maximize stochastic profit and offer a decision support model the hypothesis that farmers use a similar optimizing strategy requires further research which is out of this paper s scope nevertheless we believe that our model may serve as an illustration for policy making regarding impact of yield uncertainty in the potential over allocation of water water allocation is defined in this work as the decision to assign a certain volume of water in either the long term over several years or at seasonal level for the current year specifically this paper explores the microeconomic implications of the potential over allocation of irrigation water based on an agro economic model whereby no assumptions are made regarding the stochastic distribution function of yields and the risk attitude of farmers is taken as neutral for the simplicity of this research the rest of the paper is structured as follows the following section presents the agro economic model in a step by step manner the third section shows the results of the application of the proposed model to a specific case in a water abundant context finally a brief discussion and concluding remarks are provided 2 model our model is based upon the well known food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao model that can be found in steduto et al 2012 this model has shown to illustrate in a very accurately way the crop responses to water and evapotranspiration additionally this model is used in the majority of crop growth models e g aquacrop and there is a wide consensus in the agronomic field about its use in the case of herbaceous crops which is the focus of this paper in the literature we can find some empirical water response functions in quadratic or other functional forms for olives vita serman et al 2021 or almonds moldero et al 2021 but they are mainly used in the case of perennials orchards the proposed model is presented in a step by step manner to facilitate readers comprehension and to introduce factors such as expected yield that represent the actual situation faced by the farmer in the field with water allocation decisions to this end the model considers initially constant irrigation efficiency e 1 though the efficiency will be later defined as a parameter e g e 0 8 as illustrated in section 3 additionally the model considers the water yield response function demand function under alternative stochastic distribution functions thereby analysing the impacts of yield uncertainty on these various alternative function specifications 2 1 the agronomic model with constant irrigation efficiency the response of any crop to water supply has been well established in agronomy science yield response to crop evapotranspiration et may be expressed as defined by doorenbos and kassam 1979 1 1 y y m k y 1 e t e t m where y m and y are the respective maximum and actual yields et m and et are the respective maximum and actual evapotranspiration and k y is a yield response factor representing the effect of a reduction in evapotranspiration on yields a complete review of the present knowledge regarding k y coefficients and crop response to water availability can be found in steduto et al 2012 et can be calculated as 2 et r e w where r is the effective rainfall plus the variations in soil water storage during the crop growing cycle mm w is the applied irrigation mm and e is the irrigation efficiency dimensionless understood as the irrigation water that is stored in the soil ready to be evapotranspired by the crop divided by the applied irrigation when eqs 1 and 2 are combined the result is 3 1 y y m k y 1 e w r w m r where w m is the irrigation requirement for a maximum yield also known as full irrigation this equation gives a response to water with a complex relation specifically we will focus on the production function segment that is close to the maximum yield full irrigation and hence we may assume a constant irrigation efficiency as subsequently discussed the consideration of constant efficiency does not significantly affect the results therefore we have following expressions 4 y ym 1 k y 1 e w r w m r 1 k y k y r w m r k y e w w m r this conducts to 5 y y m 1 k y k y r w m r y m k y e w w m r for the sake of simplicity to derive solutions the first and second terms are substituted with parameters a0 and a1 6 y a 0 a 1 w 7 a 0 y m 1 k y k y r w m r 8 a 1 y m k y e w m r the interpretation of these parameters is shown in fig 1 a 0 rainfed non irrigated yield a 1 marginal physical water productivity these parameters are constant for each crop as they depend on specific crop and location characteristics and are known ex ante by farmers although water is obviously not the only factor related to yield e g fertilizing and other environmental conditions also affect final yield our proposed model focuses on water as production factor thus assuming that other factors are applied at an optimal level this assumption can be realistic in contexts where water is the most limiting production factor since other inputs e g fertilizers are usually available in the market the actual yield may be equal to ym when applied water is equal to or greater than full irrigation wm but it can be lower according to the linear production function when applied water w is lower than the irrigation requirement for a maximum yield wm therefore eq 9 represents our production function 9 y min a 0 a 1 w y m in the case that the farmer moves in a world of certainty then the value of the maximum attainable yield ym is known and defined by eq 10 and represented as a continuous line in fig 1 10 y m a 0 a 1 w m 2 2 water demand model in a certainty context under the assumption of a linear plateau production function as assumed by the standard agronomic model the response is illustrated by fig 1 where the optimization problem implies that the solution to maximum yield is reached exactly when water utilization reaches wm considering that irrigation efficiency equals 1 optimal water use is obtained by maximizing profit π as shown in eq 11 where c is the water cost and p the price of crop 11 π p y w c w one consequence of the linear nature of the crop response is the solution to this equation that gives the optimal irrigation water as zero or wm as stated by eq 12 12 w year j w j y mj a 0 a 1 if p a 1 c 0 otherwise therefore in a certainty context with linear response e 1 when the marginal value of water as given by p a 1 is greater than the cost c the optimal solution implies that farmers apply the exact water dose wj to reach the maximum yield ymj this solution implies perfect knowledge of the production function the net available rain r and yield certainty hypothesis that are unlikely to be present in real decision context nevertheless the proposed ex ante model assumes average values of parameters i e ym ky r p c as the most likely values for the profit function formulation being yield y and w the only variables in the model the linear nature of the production function implies that water beyond optimum will have a null marginal productivity and a negative marginal value defined by c 2 3 the agro economic model under yield uncertainty in the real world maximum potential yield ym j varies from yearly j to year k and from farmer to farmer due to uncontrollable factors linked to the weather such as temperature humidity and radiation pests and decision mistakes among others this is represented in fig 2 by the dotted lines above and below the continuous line that represents our production function where the deterministic maximum yield named ya is now defined by the historical average maximum yield μ m and converted into the stochastic maximum potential yield for year j y mj ˆ as represented in eq 13 13 y mj ˆ μ m ε y m j ˆ stands for the ex post potential maximum yield year j subject to full irrigation for the year decision variable w this potential maximum yield as expected by the farmer for next year can be higher or lower than historical average depending upon the growing conditions when growing conditions are favourable an upper yield level y h may be reached in contrast when growing conditions are adverse a lower yield level y l is reached as shown in fig 2 fig 2 is adapted from the babcock 1992 who modelized nitrogen application under yield uncertainty uniform yield distribution fig 2 aims to represent the yield response under varying water allocation which is the limiting factor in our specific case let us imagine that farmer always expect average yield ya and consequently always allocates average water wa though the real outcome for the current campaign might be either lower yl or higher yh when ex post yield is lower yl the required water dose would be lower too as given by wl thus when farmer applies the historical average dose wa there would be an over allocation of water wa wl and an economic loss as given by the excess in applied water and its cost c wa wl on the contrary when the ex post yield is higher yh and farmer applies the average historical dose wa instead of the required ex post higher dose wh the farmer would face an opportunity cost achieved yield will be ya below the potential yh this result implies a loss of potential profit as represented by p yh ya c wh wa it is worth noting that in the model all parameters are defined and exogenous i crop response to water ky ii irrigation system efficiency e g e 1 and iii rainfed conditions r which are assumed constant in our model our interest focuses on the decision variable w with the aim to maximize expected profit thus with d as the optimal water allocation in year j known ex post and obtained from eq 12 and with w ex ante water allocated by the farmer as the decision variable the equation of expected profit could be obtained the expected profit expression is given by gallego and moon 1993 where the value of production is equal to the minimum of the value of the water used w decision variable or the stochastic value of optimal water use that year d stochastic variable determined by the stochastic yield thus profit can be represented by eq 14 14 π w p a 1 e min w d c w w this decision scenario is like the inventory management decision problem known as newsvendor where there is a shortage penalty case when ex post potential yield for year j y mj requires a larger volume of water than the allocated ex ante by the farmer and therefore there is a loss of profit due to the below optimum supply of water the newsvendor problem constitutes a classic problem in the literature on inventory management arrow et al 1951 regarding eq 14 it is worth noting that it assumes that marginal value of production is positive p dy w dw c implying that irrigation is profitable and greater than zero see eq 12 let f d be the probability density function pdf of d whereby f d prob d w 0 x f d dd is the cumulative distribution function cdf of d it is assumed that f d is continuous in 0 in the following proof therefore 15 e min d w 0 min w d f d dd 0 w df d dd w w f d dw 16 π w p a 1 c w 0 w df d dd w w f d dd c w 0 w w d f d dd to find the maximum of π w a w is

satisfy eq 18 as given by 18 f w p a 1 c w p a 1 the solution in eq 17 is known as the critical fractile for the well known mathematical newsvendor problem formulated by arrow et al 1951 in our specific case this ratio balances the cost of irrigation below optimum lost income versus the costs of excess irrigation water cost 3 results using the software mathematica this section applies the model to a specific case in a water abundant context such as that of irrigated maize in certain regions of spain the following parameters are based official statistics of the spanish ministry of agriculture years 2008 2018 and ky is taken from steduto et al 2012 μ y 10 000 k y 1 25 et max 800 mm r 250 mm w m 550 mm assuming e 0 8 as representative value of sprinkler system efficiency most frequent system for maize cultivation in spain the values of a0 and a1 are a 0 1 406 kg ha a 1 12 50 kg mm ha the proposed model is tested by using various stochastic distributions of the demand function to explore the effect of yield variability in optimal irrigation water use uniform yield 9000 11000 triangular 9000 10000 11000 beta α 1 β 0 6 9000 11000 n 10000 1000 additionally the water demand function for a water cost in the range 0 p a 1 has been estimated assuming a price of 0 20 eur kg of maize average value in the period 2008 2018 and parameterizing water cost c fig 3 shows the demand function for irrigation under the alternative stochastic distributions compared to the certainty decision based on historical average yield vertical dotted line constant efficiency is assumed e 0 8 which can be realistic when irrigation approaches the maximum yield fig 3 illustrates the impact of various probability distributions on water demand beta triangular and uniform distributions show a similar behaviour meanwhile normality assumption leads to a higher over allocation in this respect there is strong evidence against assuming normality in the yield distribution just and weninger 1999 the cost of irrigation in the regions producing maize in spain usually lies within the range of 0 02 0 05 eur m3 0 20 0 50 eur mm ha mimam 2008 fig 3 shows that water allocation in the normal range of prices for this crop maize between 0 and 1 0 eur m3 will give an optimal stochastic allocation above the certainty decision based on historical average table 1 summarizes the model results compared to certainty conditions table 1 shows that assuming parameters given in fig 3 crop price 0 2 eur m3 average yield 10 000 kg ha water cost 0 5 eur m3 using the beta distribution function as reference and assuming a water cost of 0 05 eur m3 farmer optimal allocation of water will be 757 mm versus the certainty value based upon historical average yield 688 mm this overallocation implies that in 80 of the years probability defined by the critical fractile p a 1 c p a 1 allocated water will be above the required dose expected profit will be 8 over the result when applied water is the average yield dose when water is considered a limiting factor results confirm that farmer s rational behaviour would be to irrigate for the good years as the expected profit would significantly increase thus the model predicts that rational behaviour under yield uncertainty leads to water over allocation the model is designed for ex ante decision support but as the world is uncertain and observed yields are only known ex post real marginal benefit of resource allocation would be only revealed after the season is finished the impact of altering parameters in the model is straightforward an increase in the variance will increase the demand at low water prices compared to the same cdf with a smaller variance the increase in irrigation efficiency to simulate different systems what may illustrate a change of the irrigation method from furrow e 0 60 sprinkler e 0 80 to drip irrigation e 0 95 will lead to an augmentation of the a1 value marginal productivity of water thereby modifying the demand function fig 4 the illustration of the impact of three different irrigation system efficiencies on the water demand function is shown in fig 4 for the case of a triangular stochastic distribution finally it is worthy of note that the drawing of conclusions regarding the price elasticity of demand may prove problematical since the demand function may take any of a variety of functional forms by using alternative stochastic distribution functions this work has aimed to offer the reader a wide analysis of the potential impacts of the selected functional form on the irrigation decision under uncertainty in our example representative of maize in spain elasticity for water prices in the range from 0 02 to 0 05 eur m3 generalized in spain for maize cultivation remains low falling in the range from 0 04 to 0 27 falls inside found by scheierling et al 2006 the advantage of the presented model is that it determines with precision the profit maximizing optimum under yield uncertainty yield uncertainty may act as a proxy to integrate many sources of crop growth uncontrollable factors such as climate variables e g precipitation temperature solar radiation that influences yield and biological factors such as pest and diseases all these variables may act as yield limiting factors including the available soil water r which is also subject to uncertainty and constitutes a critical variable in our model moreover it is the main yield limiting factor in rainfed systems further developments of our model will focus on the integration with other theoretical developments such as the work of adamson and loch 2021 that incorporates uncertainty in irrigation water supply and includes perennials in the formulation or the work of xie and zilberman 2018 that includes supply augmentation and water saving investment to optimize stochastically farm profits 4 brief discussion and concluding remarks the farmer s decision on irrigation water allocation under yield uncertainty presented in this paper does not consider the farmer s utility and assumes risk neutrality our model shows that water demand as a critical production input increases with variance under various stochastic distribution functions especially in the low range of water prices obviously irrigation water allocation planning is a complex system which contains multiple uncertainties that goes beyond yield uncertainty the focus of our model and include irrigation water supply uncertainty soil water r in our model temperature wind solar radiation that influences et commodity price uncertainty and many other production factors that influence final yield by isolating a specific factor such as yield uncertainty as a confluence of many variables mentioned previously we can focus on the influence of this factor in ex ante seasonal water allocation our results show that the impact of yield uncertainty on water demand will lead to an increase in water allocation compared to that required for historical average thus following a behaviour characterized by watering for the good years additionally the example illustrated in table 1 has shown that optimal allocation improves expected profit by 8 over water allocation based upon average historical level this improvement might be considered moderate and following the argument of pannell 2006 it might be argued that optimizing techniques are sometimes of limited practical relevance for decision support nevertheless we believe that water is a critical input for crop production and any optimization attempt is valuable especially in water scarce areas in our opinion the main policy implication is the need not only to implement modern precision technology capable of reducing yield uncertainty but also to enhance input efficiency scott et al 2014 quantitative and qualitative impacts of over irrigation on water resource management depend on the location of the field since water resulting from irrigation applied in excess may return to the catchment thereby reducing the quantitative impact of over irrigation additionally agricultural diffuse pollution should be considered as an undesirable effect that can be prevented by reducing water applied in excess in this respect empirical evidence shows that the implementation of irrigation technologies to enhance water efficiency e g drip irrigation may reduce the pollution load of return flows garcía garizábal and causapé 2010 lecina et al 2010 in any case overallocation represents a challenge for water authorities and water managers as it increases demand and quantitative pressure on the resources that can be illustrated by the recent evolution of water trade prices analysed by loch et al 2021 the limitations of the model presented in this paper include 1 the need to investigate the link between over allocation and potential over irrigation 2 the requirement for a deeper analysis into the functional form of the farmer subjective cdf of yields and 3 an expansion of the theoretical model by removing the assumption of constant irrigation system efficiency and also by including the possibility of applying deficit irrigation 4 the existence of many other sources of uncertainty that affect farmer decision regarding water allocation as we have focused exclusively on yield uncertainty the proposed model focuses on yield uncertainty and is applied to herbaceous crops therefore it does not consider water supply uncertainty either irrigation water or soil water r this represents a shortcoming of our model as illustrated by the recent increases of water price in water rights markets in australia mdb are potentially caused by prudent irrigators trying to prevent potential downside losses as a response to perceptions of future supply shortages loch et al 2021 finally impacts of over allocation as explored in this paper and potentially related over irrigation behaviour should be considered by policy makers in the design of water management plans for river basins and aquifers in order to introduce innovative management instruments such as markets of irrigation rights a new design of the irrigation rights system by including uncertainty and risks and a more effective water pricing policy among others to minimize undesirable impacts on increasingly scarce water resources funding this work was supported by the spanish

9688,the advantages of subirrigation for water distribution uniformity water saving and other crop performances have been well documented in previous works however in subirrigated crops an accumulation of salts inevitably occurs in the top layer of the growing medium which represents one of the main difficulties to prolong the recirculation of the nutrient solution such an accumulation

resources are under heavy pressure in areas of economic development and particularly around the mediterranean intensive agriculture activities cause soil and water pollution through the excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides eea 2020 the importance of correct water management has recently been put in evidence as a key factor for reducing contamination of water bodies caused by intensive cropping systems incrocci et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 soilless cultivation may mitigate the problem by reducing water and nutrient waste and allowing the use of low fertility or even degraded soils particularly in coastal areas where groundwater resources for irrigation are severely strained by depletion pollution and intrusion of seawater thompson et al 2020 massa et al 2020 soilless culture has gained favour mainly as a drip irrigated open system with free drainage of the water surplus from the root zone that also leads to a constant discharge even when precisely managed of nutrients dissolved in the irrigation water in the environment massa et al 2020 conversely closed loop systems reuse the nutrient solution drained out from the root zone minimizing the outflow of water and fertilizers in the environment massa et al 2020 savvas and gruda 2018 providing a nutrient supply commensurate with plant uptake is a key factor to keep optimal salt concentration in closed loops massa et al 2020 nevertheless it is difficult to maintain this balance with saline irrigation waters containing ballast ions such as na cl or other non nutrient elements which will accumulate in the recirculated nutrient solution rs when saline ions are more than the plant uptake concentration i e the quantity of element absorbed by plants per unit volume of absorbed water sonneveld 2000 massa et al 2020 therefore drip irrigation needs high quality water possibly through rainfall collection or water desalination to fully achieve the environmental and economic advantages of the closed system stanghellini et al 2005 although different strategies have been proposed to efficiently manage closed loop systems irrigated with saline waters they inevitably imply the adoption of discontinuous flushing partial or total of the exhausted nutrient solution massa et al 2010 2020 zero runoff subirrigation with recirculation of the nutrient solution can lead to low environmental impact molitor

are not leached out from the substrate to the rs but accumulate in the topmost layer of the substrate without impairing plant growth because there are not roots raviv et al 2019 consequently the management of subirrigated systems is simpler and safer for growers especially when only poor saline quality water is available for irrigation besides its environmental value zero runoff subirrigation

carried out on fruit vegetables using subirrigation with nutrient solution concentration and irrigation management transposed from the more common drip irrigation system garcía santiago et al 2017 some of them were devoted to soilless vegetable crops grown under mediterranean conditions venezia et al 2001 2003 santamaria et al 2003 rouphael et al 2006 incrocci et al 2006 montesano et al 2010 showed that tomato plants can be grown with saline water in a closed loop subirrigation system by reducing the fertilizer concentration of the solution normally used with the traditional open loop system and by controlling irrigation with tensiometers montesano et al 2015 liu et al 2012 varied the nutrient concentrations of overhead and subirrigated vegetable transplant crops to obtain optimal plant characteristics for the retail sale however lower productions were also reported in eggplants due to excess salt accumulation in the substrate martinetti et al 2008 other studies have previously been focusing on the influence of nutrient solution concentration on subirrigated crops while little attention was paid to interactions of nutrient solution concentration with other irrigation management practices as irrigation frequency and length and frequency of solution renewal garcía santiago et al 2017 2019 to avoid substantial changes in the rs an upward unidirectional flow of ions through the substrate must be ensured so that the amount of refilling can be matched to consumption molitor 1990 upward unidirectional flow depends on the gradient generated by evapotranspiration which should be kept steady by adjusting the frequency and length of irrigations to balance the consumption and providing a nutrient concentration commensurate to plant uptake concentration a solution flow balancing evapotranspiration mass flow minimizes solution alterations as well as the risk of pathogen spread among plants through the solution but if the concentration of the refill solution is different from that absorbed by the pot plant then the formation of diffusion gradients and alteration of the composition will occur tensiometers for adjusting irrigation to evapotranspiration have been tried in subirrigated crops to limit element movement to mass flow but when the concentration of the rs was higher than plant uptake concentration ions accumulated in the root zone and the solution santamaria et al 2005 parente et al 2006 montesano et al 2010 incrocci et al 2006 compared drip irrigation versus gutter subirrigation observing no effect of root zone salinization on

the nutrient solution concentration using i good quality water below 0 3 mm nacl ii substrate with a good capillary rise peat perlite iii low irrigation frequency and low solution refill frequency venezia et al 2006 however little is known about nutrient dynamics in the root zone as a function of different fertigation schedules to relate it to the actual plant uptake this work describes an

solution was supplied at the top end of every gutter with a fixed flow rate of 8 l min 1 fig 1 excess of the solution was collected at the bottom of the gutters slope of 1 and recirculated for irrigation the combinations of irrigation length and frequency amounted to 35 70 105 and 210 min of watering per day as averages over the cropping cycle the mixing tanks were refilled with the new solution to 270 l with high frequency vhigh residual volume of 185 l 68 of 270 l or with low frequency vlow residual volume of 50 l 18 of 270 l and consequently the per plant recirculation volume ranged from 13 5 l to 9 25 l for vhigh and from 13 5 l to 2 5 l for vlow 2 2 root zone and plant analyses the composition of the rs was analyzed every fourteen days taking samples after refilling the

plants for each of the 4 subplots per gutter recording the number and weight of marketable cracked green and rotten fruits the first two fruits of the 3rd truss were analyzed for the following properties fresh weight ph dry matter ec titratable acidity and soluble solids content ph was measured using a metrohm 905 titrando the dry matter was determined gravimetrically by drying tomatoes to a constant weight at 65 c ec was measured with the methrom 856 conductivity module titratable acidity was determined with the metrohm 905 titrando and the analysis was carried out by mixing 10 ml of

equipped with a thermodynamic control system by mettler toledo dry above ground biomass and its mineral composition were determined on two plants per plot which were dried in a forced air oven at 65 c total cl n p and s were determined by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry after dry ashing of subsamples and na k mg ca by ion chromatography of subsamples ashed in a muffle furnace at 550 c and digested with 20 ml 1mhcl in boiling water for 30 min plant uptake was obtained by multiplying the tissue element concentration by the total biomass after harvesting of the uppermost truss on two pots the mineral composition of the aqueous extracts 1 1 5 v v from three layers of the substrate 0 5 5 17 and 17 21 cm from bottom was determined by ion chromatography 2 3 statistics data were analyzed according to a general linear model with the r base environment r development core team 2010 and results displayed with functions of the contributed packages effects fox 2008 and ggplot2 wickham 2008 principal component analysis pca was used to assess relationships among the ion concentrations in the rs and the aqueous extracts of the substrate 3 results 3 1 ec and nutrient variations in the recirculated solution and substrate ec of nslow treatments was relatively stable throughout the crop cycle for shorter irrigation timings while showing a slight fall in the first two months after transplanting that sharpened with increasing daily irrigation length fig 2 by contrast ec in nshigh treatments increased constantly by at least double its initial value toward the end of the crop the high volume in the mixing tank in vhigh treatments reduced the amplitude of ec upswings but did not prevent its rise in the late crop cycle due to the increased irrigation rate ph in the rs showed upward swings between refill events which were more marked with nslow and diverging trends during the cultivation cycle steady decrease from 6 to 4 5 for the nshigh at all irrigation rate and volume at refill combinations increasing stability from 5 5 to 6 5 with increasing frequency and length of irrigation for nslow data not shown the ec values in the substrate layers increased with height from the bottom of the pot from 1 to 2 ds m 1 similarly no significant difference in the eight gutters managed with nslow and from 2 5 to 8 5 ds m 1 in the nshigh treatments fig 3 rs trends were indeed related to ion concentration changes in the bottom middle layer of the substrate where the ec was three times higher for the nshigh showing a 20 increase between the bottom and the middle layer in contrast with a decrease by one third for the nslow fig 3 unabsorbed ions accumulated in the substrate and partly returned to the rs concentrations of na cl and nh4 were low in all the layers of the substrate the top bottom ratio of the water extract concentration with the nslow was between 1 7 and 9 9 for five out of six ions increasing in the rank order no3 h2po4 mg ca so4 table 1 for k the ratio was about 0 5 proving that the concentration in the rs was slightly inadequate through the whole cultivation cycle element concentrations in the water extract from the bottom layer were two five times higher with the nshigh for all nutrient elements and the top bottom ratio was between 2 2 and 7 7 increasing in the rank order k so4 ca h2po4 no3 mg 3 2 crop water and nutrient uptake water uptake in nslow treatments was 28 higher than nshigh table 2 the two trends began to separate with the start of fruit growth after about two months of cultivation irrigation rate exerted little influence on crop water uptake with an average difference between levels 35 105 vs 210 min day 1 equal to about 14 daily peaks of consumption up to 4 7 mm occurred for all treatments at 50 60 days after transplant and later only for the nslow data not shown the water use efficiency per unit biomass was only slightly lower with the nslow vs the nshigh 198 against 193 l kg 1 table 2 ec increase of rs in nshigh treatments was consistent with the rise of nutrient element concentrations k so4 no3 ca h2po4 mg above the uptake concentration values table 1 and figs 2 3 nutrient ions showed instead little change ca mg so4 or a slight decrease k no3 h2po4 during the first two months after transplanting in the rs of nslow treatments when the nutrient supply resulted slightly lower than the actual crop requirements table 1 and figs 2 and 3 because of the similar water use efficiency plants grown with the nslow showed plant uptake concentrations comparable to the nshigh grown plants except for k 35 s 47 and p 15 table 1 the rs plant uptake concentration ratio for the nslow was around 1 for most of the elements and about 2 for ca and s fig 4 five out of six nutrient elements showed a ratio between 2 and 5 for the nshigh in the rank order n p mg s ca signalling that the supplied concentration was on average greater than the uptake concentration for k the ratio was lower than 2 a principal component analysis fig 5 separated fairly well on the first component two groups of nutrient elements for their concentration in the rs no3 so4 h2po4 ca and mg in one group nh4 and k in the other which were correlated with nshigh and nslow a third group of non assimilated and non nutrient elements cl na bicarbonate was instead associated with the second component the different ions determined in the substrate water extract at the end of the cultivation were separated by the principal component analysis in the three layers differently for the two solutions on both components this analysis summarizes the dynamics of ions in a subirrigated pot due to the combined effects of water capillary rise of the substrate plant uptake cation exchange reactions especially for ca and mg and precipitation in the upper layer of ca and mg with hpo4 and so4 the ions were separated on the first component into 4 groups 1 nutrients no3 ca mg h2po4 provided from both solutions with excess flow compared to the absorbed flow and that accumulated in the upper layer but with different concentrations 2 nutrients k and nh4 provided at low concentrations only with nslow so without accumulation in the upper layer 3 non nutritive na and nutritive so4 ions with the same accumulation dynamics in the substrate profile with both solutions 4 micro nutrient ion cl provided at low concentrations and strongly absorbed by plants and almost absent in all layers of the substrate fig 6 3 3 biomass and fruit yield aboveground dry biomass was positively correlated with water uptake r 0 8 ci 95 0 50 0 92 biomass production increased by 26 to 0 93 kg m 2 with the nslow compared with the nshigh but was little affected by variations in the irrigation rate and refill volume table 2 a similar increase was also found for the mineral uptake of n 22 mg 27 ca 26 and cl 33 fruit yield was significantly influenced by nutrient solution concentration table 3 marketable yield was 48 higher in the nslow treatments with a unit area yield of 6 3 kg m 2 the higher yield obtained with the nslow was the result of a higher fruit number in the fourth and fifth truss and of bigger fruit size in all trusses data not shown with the nslow weight per fruit increased with truss position particularly at low irrigation rates i e irdshort x irflow combinations and low refill volume nearly all the fruits up to the third truss were of marketable grade a considerable proportion of unmarketable fruits up to 15 in weight mainly cracked occurred in the fifth truss particularly with the nslow at high refill volume and irrigation rates conditions which wasted up to 10 of fruits also on the fourth truss the nslow showed a slightly lower proportion of marketable yield 94 vs 96 but higher efficiency with 16 less rs consumed per kilogram of marketable fruit yield even if rising total rs consumption nslow slightly reduced fruit quality by lowering dry matter 9 ec 19 titratable acidity 29 and soluble solid content 12 4 discussion in this subirrigation experiment biomass production and fruit yield increased with the nslow but were little affected by variations in the irrigation scheduling i e frequency and duration and refill volume of the mixing tank tables 2 3 the nslow showed a slightly lower proportion of marketable yield 94 vs 96 normal fruit quality but higher efficiency with 16 less rs consumed per kilogram of marketable fruit yield the nslow with a nutrient solution concentration fairly matching plant uptake concentration permitted a sufficient flow of water and ions from rs to the plant in a wide range of daily irrigation rates between 35 and 210 min and per plant recirculation volume from 13 5 to 2 5 l the movement of the ions took place by mass flow and diffusion driven by capillary force and evapotranspiration and was almost exclusively unidirectional upward increasing the irrigation rate and allowing longer solution use through infrequent refill increasingly altered the ion concentration in rs in these conditions the movement of the ions by diffusion between rs and substrate becomes important compared to the upward mass flow and responds to the concentration gradients as reported in an ebb flood cultivation with continuous irrigation otten 1994 therefore increasing irrigation rate resulted in element depletion in the rs of nslow and accumulation in the nshigh mainly manifested as ion imbalances in exchanges with the substrate and plant roots and the flow of water and ions from rs to the substrate was not exclusively unidirectional upward the rs dilution in nslow observed in the first two months of cultivation was due to the concentration of k no3 and h2po4 being lower than plant uptake concentration this tendency was reversed with the decline of the latter after topping the plants at five trusses about two months after transplanting a fall in plant uptake concentration of k ca and mg at a lower growth rate of vegetative organs and the incipient fruiting stage was observed for tomato by voogt 1993 while santamaria and signore 2004 observed a reduced uptake of n p and na the rs in nshigh remained quite stable for two months afterwards the concentration increased for all elements which exceeded plant needs the experiment confirmed that the alteration of ion concentration in rs may be mitigated by irrigating at a low rate the correspondence between rs in nslow and plant uptake concentration apart from a slight depletion for k n and p and minor excesses for ca and s was demonstrated by the absence of ion accumulation in the root zone and by the top bottom ratio of ions in the water extract elements not absorbed by the crop accumulated in the top layer of the substrate so a top bottom ratio of the concentration at the end of cultivation less than or around to 2 indicated a suboptimal supply as observed for k no3 and h2po4 in nslow the high rs volume varying between 13 5 and 2 5 l plant 1 ensured an adequate buffer showing slight and minor ionic depletion plant uptake concentrations differed in the two rs solutions only for k p and s whose concentrations were lower in the nslow treatment montesano et al 2010 have observed suboptimal concentrations for k and no3 i e decreasing concentrations of the aqueous extracts of the substrate passing from the lower layer to the upper layer while we have found suboptimal concentrations only for k using lower k 4 0 vs 6 1 meq l 1 and higher no3 8 0 vs 6 9 meq l 1 concentration with same tomato cv and cultivation system but a different season spring summer vs autumn winter furthermore at the end of the cultivation plants in our experiment showed higher concentrations of k 40 vs 18 g kg 1 dry matter and no3 17 vs 4 g kg 1 dry matter in leaf tissue the k dilution from the bottom to the top of the substrate indicates a suboptimal supply that explains the slightly reduced fruit quality and confirms the results of the above authors for k and no3 and of rouphael and colla 2009 in zucchini squash with gutter subirrigation using 50 of the macronutrient concentrations other authors found excess nutrient flows in subirrigation which have generated the disappearance of the roots in the upper layer and a reduction in the presence and functionality also in the middle layer otten 1994 reported that higher ec irrigation frequency and recirculation duration of the rs increased salts accumulation in all layers of the substrate with a build up factor greater than five between the rs and the topmost layer furthermore lower irrigation frequency increased the variation range of substrate ec in the bottom layer similarly to the amplified oscillations of ec in rs observed with vlow low refill frequency in fig 2 incrocci et al 2006 cultivated tomato in gutter subirrigation with an excess mineral element flow manifested by an increase in the ec and ionic concentration in the rs due to the accumulation of nutrient k and non nutrient na in the lower part of the substrate and even more in the upper layers the negative effects of this accumulation were overcome by increasing by 100 the substrate volume a greater increase in ec level of rs and substrate was observed for tomato grown in subirrigated gutter systems with ec of 4 ds m 1 especially when the nutrient solution was prepared by adding nacl cacl2 kcl and mgcl2 sarkar et al 2008 tomato crop cultivated in an ebb flood system with three level of ec showed salt accumulation in the substrate correlated with the ec of the rs garcía santiago et al 2019 a solution concentration matching plant uptake concentration is preferable even if plant selectivity for mineral elements ensures standard yields in soilless conditions steiner 1980 1984 cabrera et al 1993 siddiqui et al 1998 plants can in fact absorb water and nutrients independently and if possible they take up water from the low ec substrate nutrients from the high ec substrate thanks to root ability to find an osmotic escape sonneveld and voogt 1990 in a subirrigated pot plant roots can differentially absorb water from the bottom layer and nutrients from the bottom and middle layers the topmost layer works as a buffer for elements and this could explain the high stability of the rs composition with a solution flow balancing evapotranspiration mass flow so that the amount of refilling can be matched to consumption the movement of an element from the rs to the plant root is a function of the rs concentration and the plant uptake concentration it is activated by the ascendant water movement coupled with the selective root mineral uptake therefore nutritive elements have a different destiny to non nutritive elements because the movements of the former are mainly driven by plant transpiration and plant uptake while the latter are by evaporation at the substrate surface as shown in this experiment many authors have observed diverging trends for assimilated nutrients e g k and no3 against non nutrients e g na in rs and substrate layers concentration incrocci et al 2006 sarkar et al 2008 montesano et al 2010 treder et al 1999 found a different contribution of nutrient ions to the ec of different substrate layers otten 1994 argued that in the subirrigation condition using the same rs concentration and uptake concentration would help to minimize differences in ion accumulation along the substrate profile but not in the topmost layer while the reduction of evaporation can be useful but not decisive the accumulation in the upper layer of all the ions supplied with a concentration equal to or greater than uptake concentration observed in this work confirms the above finding in the nslow treatment considering the ratio between rs concentration at the end of the crop cycle and plant uptake concentration a sequence of increasing values 0 98 1 10 1 26 1 34 1 82 2 16 for k n p mg ca and s respectively can be obtained which explain how rs matched the actual plant needs table 1 the above sequence showed a significant correlation with data collected in the top bottom ratio of the substrate extracts at the end of the crop cycle 0 5 1 7 2 2 5 2 7 9 9 9 explaining 97 4 of the experimental variability only k supplied throughout the crop cycle at a lower concentration than uptake did not accumulate in the upper layer the above data suggest that even in the presence of evaporation it is possible to minimize ion accumulation in all layers including the topmost by modulating the concentration of the rs over time and adapting it to plant ion absorption a positive difference between the middle and bottom layer concentration in the substrate signals excessive input and element accumulation in the rs and the upper layer of the substrate and a negative difference implies insufficient input and depletion monitoring the difference in concentration between the middle and lower layers of the substrate allows the intervention of the fertigation irrigation frequency and duration frequency of refilling and concentration of the ns modulating it throughout the season following the needs of the plants and avoiding situations of excessive otten 1994 incrocci et al 2006 martinetti et al 2008 sarkar et al 2008 garcía santiago et al 2019 or insufficient input rouphael and colla 2009 montesano et al 2010 but it is very expensive and demanding as far as observed in this experiment monitoring rs appears easier cheaper non destructive and more reliable than other methods and it allows one to optimally modulate over time the concentration of the added solution to find the right nutrient solution composition it could be useful to grow plants in conditions of fertigation predisposed to alter the composition of the rs high irrigation rates infrequent refilling and low volume per plant and monitoring the rs as in this study after the adjusting of the nutrient solution composition for the various seasons and phenological phases then it could return to normal conditions of fertigation and routine monitoring of rs 5 conclusion the main advantage of gutter subirrigation is the high stability of the recirculated solution over a broad range of irrigation rates and refill volume i e volume per plant and even with some elements at concentrations above plant absorption rates this is possible through a the migration of mineral elements in the topmost layer of the substrate and b the root ability to find an osmotic escape the fertigation factors studied herein are all important to find the most suitable strategy to manage water and nutrient supply that meet actual plant needs without generating ion accumulations in the substrate and recirculated solution the most important factor is the concentration of the nutrient solution followed at distance by the other three i e irrigation frequency and duration and mixing tank refill volume recirculated solution monitoring makes it easy and cheap to check how and when to modify fertigation compared with other methods developments requiring further work include investigations during the cold season especially in unheated greenhouse on long cycle crops and the reuse of cultivation substrates funding this

9688,the advantages of subirrigation for water distribution uniformity water saving and other crop performances have been well documented in previous works however in subirrigated crops an accumulation of salts inevitably occurs in the top layer of the growing medium which represents one of the main difficulties to prolong the recirculation of the nutrient solution such an accumulation strongly depends on nutrient and non nutrient e g saline ions concentrations irrigation scheduling and water volumes and fluxes in the system tomato cherry plants solanum lycopersicum l cv shiren were grown soilless in a gutter subirrigation closed loop system during the spring season to evaluate nutrient dynamics and crop response to i the nutrient solution concentration i e standard and 50 reduced concentration ii irrigation frequency i e high or low frequency iii irrigation duration i e long or short time duration and iv tank volume at the refill i e high and low volume the most important factor which influenced the nutrient dynamics and electrical conductivity of the system was the concentration of the nutrient solution followed at distance by the other three the recirculated solution with reduced concentration showed a fairly stable composition ranging from 1 2 to 1 6 ds m 1 of the electrical conductivity in the worst factor combination with the electrical conductivity of water extracts in the upper substrate layers below 2 0 ds m 1 and the ratio between recirculated solution and plant uptake concentration of about 1 for most of the elements marketable fruit yield was 48 higher with the reduced concentration solution and affected by irrigation scheduling and tank volume at refill by adapting the composition of the recirculated nutrient solution to

resources are under heavy pressure in areas of economic development and particularly around the mediterranean intensive agriculture activities cause soil and water pollution through the excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides eea 2020 the importance of correct water management has recently been put in evidence as a key factor for reducing contamination of water bodies caused by intensive cropping systems incrocci et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 soilless cultivation may mitigate the problem by reducing water and nutrient waste and allowing the use of low fertility or even degraded soils particularly in coastal areas where groundwater resources for irrigation are severely strained by depletion pollution and intrusion of seawater thompson et al 2020 massa et al 2020 soilless culture has gained favour mainly as a drip irrigated open system with free drainage of the water surplus from the root zone that also leads to a constant discharge even when precisely managed of nutrients dissolved in the irrigation water in the environment massa et al 2020 conversely closed loop systems reuse the nutrient solution drained out from the root zone minimizing the outflow of water and fertilizers in the environment massa et al 2020 savvas and gruda 2018 providing a nutrient supply commensurate with plant uptake is a key factor to keep optimal salt concentration in closed loops massa et al 2020 nevertheless it is difficult to maintain this balance with saline irrigation waters containing ballast ions such as na cl or other non nutrient elements which will accumulate in the recirculated nutrient solution rs when saline ions are more than the plant uptake concentration i e the quantity of element absorbed by plants per unit volume of absorbed water sonneveld 2000 massa et al 2020 therefore drip irrigation needs high quality water possibly through rainfall collection or water desalination to fully achieve the environmental and economic advantages of the closed system stanghellini et al 2005 although different strategies have been proposed to efficiently manage closed loop systems irrigated with saline waters they inevitably imply the adoption of discontinuous flushing partial or total of the exhausted nutrient solution massa et al 2010 2020 zero runoff subirrigation with recirculation of the nutrient solution can lead to low environmental impact molitor 1990 reed 1996 uva et al 1998 2001 montesano et al 2010 bouchaaba et al 2015 garcía santiago et al 2017 with gutter subirrigation or ebb and flow systems contrary to drip top irrigation excess ions are not leached out from the substrate to the rs but accumulate in the topmost layer of the substrate without impairing plant growth because there are not roots raviv et al 2019 consequently the management of subirrigated systems is simpler and safer for growers especially when only poor saline quality water is available for irrigation besides its environmental value zero runoff subirrigation has shown several beneficial growing conditions such as higher stability of the rs uniform distribution of water and fertilizers lower disease incidence better substrate aeration reduced labour raviv et al 2019 compared with drip irrigation rather diluted solutions have been used in subirrigation studies for ornamentals dole et al 1994 james and van iersel 2001 zheng et al 2004 rouphael et al 2008 cardarelli et al 2010 recommending the use of small storage tanks to increase the frequency of solution renewal and tank sanitation reed 1996 conversely a more limited number of studies have been carried out on fruit vegetables using subirrigation with nutrient solution concentration and irrigation management transposed from the more common drip irrigation system garcía santiago et al 2017 some of them were devoted to soilless vegetable crops grown under mediterranean conditions venezia et al 2001 2003 santamaria et al 2003 rouphael et al 2006 incrocci et al 2006 montesano et al 2010 showed that tomato plants can be grown with saline water in a closed loop subirrigation system by reducing the fertilizer concentration of the solution normally used with the traditional open loop system and by controlling irrigation with tensiometers montesano et al 2015 liu et al 2012 varied the nutrient concentrations of overhead and subirrigated vegetable transplant crops to obtain optimal plant characteristics for the retail sale however lower productions were also reported in eggplants due to excess salt accumulation in the substrate martinetti et al 2008 other studies have previously been focusing on the influence of nutrient solution concentration on subirrigated crops while little attention was paid to interactions of nutrient solution concentration with other irrigation management practices as irrigation frequency and length and frequency of solution renewal garcía santiago et al 2017 2019 to avoid substantial changes in the rs an upward unidirectional flow of ions through the substrate must be ensured so that the amount of refilling can be matched to consumption molitor 1990 upward unidirectional flow depends on the gradient generated by evapotranspiration which should be kept steady by adjusting the frequency and length of irrigations to balance the consumption and providing a nutrient concentration commensurate to plant uptake concentration a solution flow balancing evapotranspiration mass flow minimizes solution alterations as well as the risk of pathogen spread among plants through the solution but if the concentration of the refill solution is different from that absorbed by the pot plant then the formation of diffusion gradients and alteration of the composition will occur tensiometers for adjusting irrigation to evapotranspiration have been tried in subirrigated crops to limit element movement to mass flow but when the concentration of the rs was higher than plant uptake concentration ions accumulated in the root zone and the solution santamaria et al 2005 parente et al 2006 montesano et al 2010 incrocci et al 2006 compared drip irrigation versus gutter subirrigation observing no effect of root zone salinization on subirrigated plant growth and this was related to the doubling of the substrate volume in subirrigation for tomato grown by gutter subirrigation precise control of rs salinity was achieved by varying the nutrient solution concentration using i good quality water below 0 3 mm nacl ii substrate with a good capillary rise peat perlite iii low irrigation frequency and low solution refill frequency venezia et al 2006 however little is known about nutrient dynamics in the root zone as a function of different fertigation schedules to relate it to the actual plant uptake this work describes an

properties fresh weight ph dry matter ec titratable acidity and soluble solids content ph was measured using a metrohm 905 titrando the dry matter was determined gravimetrically by drying tomatoes to a constant weight at 65 c ec was measured with the methrom 856 conductivity module titratable acidity was determined with the metrohm 905 titrando and the analysis was carried out by mixing 10 ml of juice with 50 ml of bidistilled water and titration with 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh to the endpoint ph of 8 1 soluble solids content was measured in brix with a digital portable refractometer equipped with a thermodynamic control system by mettler toledo dry above ground biomass and its mineral composition were determined on two plants per plot which were dried in a forced air oven at 65 c total cl n p and s were determined by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry after dry ashing of subsamples and na k mg ca by ion chromatography of subsamples ashed in a muffle furnace at 550 c and digested with 20 ml 1mhcl in boiling water for 30 min plant uptake was obtained by multiplying the tissue element concentration by the total biomass after harvesting of the uppermost truss on two pots the mineral composition of the aqueous extracts 1 1 5 v v from three layers of the substrate 0 5 5 17 and 17 21 cm from bottom was determined by ion chromatography 2 3 statistics data were analyzed according to a general linear model with the r base environment r development core team 2010 and results displayed with functions of the contributed packages effects fox 2008 and ggplot2 wickham 2008 principal component analysis pca was used to assess relationships among the ion concentrations in the rs and the aqueous extracts of the substrate 3 results 3 1 ec and nutrient variations in the recirculated solution and substrate ec of nslow treatments was relatively stable throughout the crop cycle for shorter irrigation timings while showing a slight fall in the first two months after transplanting that sharpened with increasing daily irrigation length fig 2 by contrast ec in nshigh treatments increased constantly by at least double its initial value toward the end of the crop the high volume in the mixing tank in vhigh treatments reduced the amplitude of ec upswings but did not prevent its rise in the late crop cycle due to the increased irrigation rate ph in the rs showed upward swings between refill events which were more marked with nslow and diverging trends during the cultivation cycle steady decrease from 6 to 4 5 for the nshigh at all irrigation rate and volume at refill combinations increasing stability from 5 5 to 6 5 with increasing frequency and length of irrigation for nslow data not shown the ec values in the substrate layers increased with height from the bottom of the pot from 1 to 2 ds m 1 similarly no significant difference in the eight gutters managed with nslow and from 2 5 to 8 5 ds m 1 in the nshigh treatments fig 3 rs trends were indeed related to ion concentration changes in the bottom middle layer of the substrate where the ec was three times higher for the nshigh showing a 20 increase between the bottom and the middle layer in contrast with a decrease by one third for the nslow fig 3 unabsorbed ions accumulated in the substrate and partly returned to the rs concentrations of na cl and nh4 were low in all the layers of the substrate the top bottom ratio of the water extract concentration with the nslow was between 1 7 and 9 9 for five out of six ions increasing in the rank order no3 h2po4 mg ca so4 table 1 for k the ratio was about 0 5 proving that the concentration in the rs was slightly inadequate through the whole cultivation cycle element concentrations in the water extract from the bottom layer were two five times higher with the nshigh for all nutrient elements and the top bottom ratio was between 2 2 and 7 7 increasing in the rank order k so4 ca h2po4 no3 mg 3 2 crop water and nutrient uptake water uptake in nslow treatments was 28 higher than nshigh table 2 the two trends began to separate with the start of fruit growth after about two months of cultivation irrigation rate exerted little influence on crop water uptake with an average difference between levels 35 105 vs 210 min day 1 equal to about 14 daily peaks of consumption up to 4 7 mm occurred for all treatments at 50 60 days after transplant and later only for the nslow data not shown the water use efficiency per unit biomass was only slightly lower with the nslow vs the nshigh 198 against 193 l kg 1 table 2 ec increase of rs in nshigh treatments was consistent with the rise of nutrient element concentrations k so4 no3 ca h2po4 mg above the uptake concentration values table 1 and figs 2 3 nutrient ions showed instead little change ca mg so4 or a slight decrease k no3 h2po4 during the first two months after transplanting in the rs of nslow treatments when the nutrient supply resulted slightly lower than the actual crop requirements table 1 and figs 2 and 3 because of the similar water use efficiency plants grown with the nslow showed plant uptake concentrations comparable to the nshigh grown plants except for k 35 s 47 and p 15 table 1 the rs plant uptake concentration ratio for the nslow was around 1 for most of the elements and about 2 for ca and s fig 4 five out of six nutrient elements showed a ratio between 2 and 5 for the nshigh in the rank order n p mg s ca signalling that the supplied concentration was on average greater than the uptake concentration for k the ratio was lower than 2 a principal component analysis fig 5 separated fairly well on the first component two groups of nutrient elements for their concentration in the rs no3 so4 h2po4 ca and mg in one group nh4 and k in the other which were correlated with nshigh and nslow a third group of non assimilated and non nutrient elements cl na bicarbonate was instead associated with the second component the different ions determined in the substrate water extract at the end of the cultivation were separated by the principal component analysis in the three layers differently for the two solutions on both components this analysis summarizes the dynamics of ions in a subirrigated pot due to the combined effects of water capillary rise of the substrate plant uptake cation exchange reactions especially for ca and mg and precipitation in the upper layer of ca and mg with hpo4 and so4 the ions were separated on the first component into 4 groups 1 nutrients no3 ca mg h2po4 provided from both solutions with excess flow compared to the absorbed flow and that accumulated in the upper layer but with different concentrations 2 nutrients k and nh4 provided at low concentrations only with nslow so without accumulation in the upper layer 3 non nutritive na and nutritive so4 ions with the same accumulation dynamics in the substrate profile with both solutions 4 micro nutrient ion cl provided at low concentrations and strongly absorbed by plants and almost absent in all layers of the substrate fig 6 3 3 biomass and fruit yield aboveground dry biomass was positively correlated with water uptake r 0 8 ci 95 0 50 0 92 biomass production increased by 26 to 0 93 kg m 2 with the nslow compared with the nshigh but was little affected by variations in the irrigation rate and refill volume table 2 a similar increase was also found for the mineral uptake of n 22 mg 27 ca 26 and cl 33 fruit yield was significantly influenced by nutrient solution concentration table 3 marketable yield was 48 higher in the nslow treatments with a unit area yield of 6 3 kg m 2 the higher yield obtained with the nslow was the result of a higher fruit number in the fourth and fifth truss and of bigger fruit size in all trusses data not shown with the nslow weight per fruit increased with truss position particularly at low irrigation rates i e irdshort x irflow combinations and low refill volume nearly all the fruits up to the third truss were of marketable grade a considerable proportion of unmarketable fruits up to 15 in weight mainly cracked occurred in the fifth truss particularly with the nslow at high refill volume and irrigation rates conditions which wasted up to 10 of fruits also on the fourth truss the nslow showed a slightly lower proportion of marketable yield 94 vs 96 but higher efficiency with 16 less rs consumed per kilogram of marketable fruit yield even if rising total rs consumption nslow slightly reduced fruit quality by lowering dry matter 9 ec 19 titratable acidity 29 and soluble solid content 12 4 discussion in this subirrigation experiment biomass production and fruit yield increased with the nslow but were little affected by variations in the irrigation scheduling i e frequency and duration and refill volume of the mixing tank tables 2 3 the nslow showed a slightly lower proportion of marketable yield 94 vs 96 normal fruit quality but higher efficiency with 16 less rs consumed per kilogram of marketable fruit yield the nslow with a nutrient solution concentration fairly matching plant uptake concentration permitted a sufficient flow of water and ions from rs to the plant in a wide range of daily irrigation rates between 35 and 210 min and per plant recirculation volume from 13 5 to 2 5 l the movement of the ions took place by mass flow and diffusion driven by capillary force and evapotranspiration and was almost exclusively unidirectional upward increasing the irrigation rate and allowing longer solution use through infrequent refill increasingly altered the ion concentration in rs in these conditions the movement of the ions by diffusion between rs and substrate becomes important compared to the upward mass flow and responds to the concentration gradients as reported in an ebb flood cultivation with continuous irrigation otten 1994 therefore increasing irrigation rate resulted in element depletion in the rs of nslow and accumulation in the nshigh mainly manifested as ion imbalances in exchanges with the substrate and plant roots and the flow of water and ions from rs to the substrate was not exclusively unidirectional upward the rs dilution in nslow observed in the first two months of cultivation was due to the concentration of k no3 and h2po4 being lower than plant uptake concentration this tendency was reversed with the decline of the latter after topping the plants at five trusses about two months after transplanting a fall in plant uptake concentration of k ca and mg at a lower growth rate of vegetative organs and the incipient fruiting stage was observed for tomato by voogt 1993 while santamaria and signore 2004 observed a reduced uptake of n p and na the rs in nshigh remained quite stable for two months afterwards the concentration increased for all elements which exceeded plant needs the experiment confirmed that the alteration of ion concentration in rs may be mitigated by irrigating at a low rate the correspondence between rs in nslow and plant uptake concentration apart from a slight depletion for k n and p and minor excesses for ca and s was demonstrated by the absence of ion accumulation in the root zone and by the top bottom ratio of ions in the water extract elements not absorbed by the crop accumulated in the top layer of the substrate so a top bottom ratio of the concentration at the end of cultivation less than or around to 2 indicated a suboptimal supply as observed for k no3 and h2po4 in nslow the high rs volume varying between 13 5 and 2 5 l plant 1 ensured an adequate buffer showing slight and minor ionic depletion plant uptake concentrations differed in the two rs solutions only for k p and s whose concentrations were lower in the nslow treatment montesano et al 2010 have observed suboptimal concentrations for k and no3 i e decreasing concentrations of the aqueous extracts of the substrate passing from the lower layer to the upper layer while we have found suboptimal concentrations only for k using lower k 4 0 vs 6 1 meq l 1 and higher no3 8 0 vs 6 9 meq l 1 concentration with same tomato cv and cultivation system but a different season spring summer vs autumn winter furthermore at the end of the cultivation plants in our experiment showed higher concentrations of k 40 vs 18 g kg 1 dry matter and no3 17 vs 4 g kg 1 dry matter in leaf tissue the k dilution from the bottom to the top of the substrate indicates a suboptimal supply that explains the slightly reduced fruit quality and confirms the results of the above authors for k and no3 and of rouphael and colla 2009 in zucchini squash with gutter subirrigation using 50 of the macronutrient concentrations other authors found excess nutrient flows in subirrigation which have generated the disappearance of the roots in the upper layer and a reduction in the presence and functionality also in the middle layer otten 1994 reported that higher ec irrigation frequency and recirculation duration of the rs increased salts accumulation in all layers of the substrate with a build up factor greater than five between the rs and the topmost layer furthermore lower irrigation frequency increased the variation range of substrate ec in the bottom layer similarly to the amplified oscillations of ec in rs observed with vlow low refill frequency in fig 2 incrocci et al 2006 cultivated tomato in gutter subirrigation with an excess mineral element flow manifested by an increase in the ec and ionic concentration in the rs due to the accumulation of nutrient k and non nutrient na in the lower part of the substrate and even more in the upper layers the negative effects of this accumulation were overcome by increasing by 100 the substrate volume a greater increase in ec level of rs and substrate was observed for tomato grown in subirrigated gutter systems with ec of 4 ds m 1 especially when the nutrient solution was prepared by adding nacl cacl2 kcl and mgcl2 sarkar et al 2008 tomato crop cultivated in an ebb flood system with three level of ec showed salt accumulation in the substrate correlated with the ec of the rs garcía santiago et al 2019 a solution concentration matching plant uptake concentration is preferable even if plant selectivity for mineral elements ensures standard yields in soilless conditions steiner 1980 1984 cabrera et al 1993 siddiqui et al 1998 plants can in fact absorb water and nutrients independently and if possible they take up water from the low ec substrate nutrients from the high ec substrate thanks to root ability to find an osmotic escape sonneveld and voogt 1990 in a subirrigated pot plant roots can differentially absorb water from the bottom layer and nutrients from the bottom and middle layers the topmost layer works as a buffer for elements and this could explain the high stability of the rs composition with a solution flow balancing evapotranspiration mass flow so that the amount of refilling can be matched to consumption the movement of an element from the rs to the plant root is a function of the rs concentration and the plant uptake concentration it is activated by the ascendant water movement coupled with the selective root mineral uptake therefore nutritive elements have a different destiny to non nutritive elements because the movements of the former are mainly driven by plant transpiration and plant uptake while the latter are by evaporation at the substrate surface as shown in this experiment many authors have observed diverging trends for assimilated nutrients e g k and no3 against non nutrients e g na in rs and substrate layers concentration incrocci et al 2006 sarkar et al 2008 montesano et al 2010 treder et al 1999 found a different contribution of nutrient ions to the ec of different substrate layers otten 1994 argued that in the subirrigation condition using the same rs concentration and uptake concentration would help to minimize differences in ion accumulation along the substrate profile but not in the topmost layer while the reduction of evaporation can be useful but not decisive the accumulation in the upper layer of all the ions supplied with a concentration equal to or greater than uptake concentration observed in this work confirms the above finding in the nslow treatment considering the ratio between rs concentration at the end of the crop cycle and plant uptake concentration a sequence of increasing values 0 98 1 10 1 26 1 34 1 82 2 16 for k n p mg ca and s respectively can be obtained which explain how rs matched the actual plant needs table 1 the above sequence showed a significant correlation with data collected in the top bottom ratio of the substrate extracts at the end of the crop cycle 0 5 1 7 2 2 5 2 7 9 9 9 explaining 97 4 of the experimental variability only k supplied throughout the crop cycle at a lower concentration than uptake did not accumulate in the upper layer the above data suggest that even in the presence of evaporation it is possible to minimize ion accumulation in all layers including the topmost by modulating the concentration of the rs over time and adapting it to plant ion absorption a positive difference between the middle and bottom layer concentration in the substrate signals excessive input and element accumulation in the rs and the upper layer of the substrate and a negative difference implies insufficient input and depletion monitoring the difference in concentration between the middle and lower layers of the substrate allows the intervention of the fertigation irrigation frequency and duration frequency of refilling and concentration of the ns modulating it throughout the season following the needs of the plants and avoiding situations of excessive otten 1994 incrocci et al 2006 martinetti et al 2008 sarkar et al 2008 garcía santiago et al 2019 or insufficient input rouphael and colla 2009 montesano et al 2010 but it is very expensive and demanding as far as observed in this experiment monitoring rs appears easier cheaper non destructive and more reliable than other methods and it allows one to optimally modulate over time the concentration of the added solution to find the right nutrient solution composition it could be useful to grow plants in conditions of fertigation predisposed to alter the composition of the rs high irrigation rates infrequent refilling and low volume per plant and monitoring the rs as in this study after the adjusting of the nutrient solution composition for the various seasons and phenological phases then it could return to normal conditions of fertigation and routine monitoring of rs 5 conclusion the main advantage of gutter subirrigation is the high stability of the recirculated solution over a broad range of irrigation rates and refill volume i e volume per plant and even with some elements at concentrations above plant absorption rates this is possible through a the migration of mineral elements in the topmost layer of the substrate and b the root ability to find an osmotic escape the fertigation factors studied herein are all important to find the most suitable strategy to manage water and nutrient supply that meet actual plant needs without generating ion accumulations in the substrate and recirculated solution the most important factor is the concentration of the nutrient solution followed at distance by the other three i e irrigation frequency and duration and mixing tank refill volume recirculated solution monitoring makes it easy and cheap to check how and when to modify fertigation compared with other methods developments requiring further work include investigations during the cold season especially in unheated greenhouse on long cycle crops and the reuse of cultivation substrates funding this

9689,soil surface depressions affect overland flow generation and related hydrological processes overland flow connectivity c of a field increases as more water ponds in and flows through local depressions leading to flow across field boundaries quantifying the development of c during an irrigation or rainfall event is key to predicting the initiation of overland flow a novel method to

demonstrated that the a sw as measured using the acoustic proximal sensing can be related to c using an overland flow model which allows to identify critical value of a sw needed to initiate overland flow our results show that this real time method of monitoring c has a considerable potential in irrigated fields where prediction of overland flow is desirable keywords overland flow connectivity surface water coverage irrigation infiltration 1 introduction smarter irrigation such as variable rate technology evans et al 2013 hedley et al 2014 is one of the many approaches to address increasing pressure on agriculture due to economic availability of suitable land area production target and environmental challenges searchinger 2019 however there are several environmental issues that can arise from irrigation these include increased drainage and salinity skhiri and dechmi 2012 increased leaching of nutrients adversely affecting groundwater and or surface water quality mcdowell et al 2011 rajmohan et al 2021 and wasting applied nutrients and water allaire leung et al 2001 dechmi et al 2003 and excessive abstraction of water for the purposes of irrigation marek et al 2017 while improved irrigation scheduling the amount and the timing of irrigation applied can help control losses via drainage and leaching e g rath et al 2021 the technologies do not address irrigation induced overland flow iof irrigation induced overland flow can arise either when the irrigation intensity is higher than soil s infiltration capacity or when the soil becomes saturated once overland flow is generated there is the potential for the rapid transport of nutrients and microorganisms from the soil towards water bodies causing harm blaustein et al 2015 while any well designed irrigation system will consider infiltration capacity in its initial design the infiltration capacity of the soil surface varies by orders of magnitude in both space and time as a result of management such as the timing of tillage crop management and grazing practices drewry et al 2008 2019 so a suitable irrigation application rate at the time of design and commissioning may well be too high after one or more seasons centre pivot irrigation systems widely used to irrigate large fields can vary application intensity by changing the speed of travel of the irrigation boom or through variable rate technology which enables individual nozzles to be turned on and off thereby varying water application evans et al 2013 hedley et al 2014 variable rate technology is more flexible as it can typically modify the application for different sections along the pivot while adjustments to the traveling speed of the pivot can modify the irrigation applied only in segments of the circular field controlling the return period or use of variable rate irrigation technologies in conjunction with soil water status monitoring has been shown to be effective for handling landscape complexities such as variability of soil profile depth which affects the water holding capacity of the soil and therefore the amount rate of irrigation that should be applied hedley et al 2014 2013 however these approaches cannot overcome issues related to the inevitable spatial and temporal variability in the soil s infiltration capacity therefore there is a need for a method to detect emerging overland flow conditions early enough to prevent substantial overland flow from the field during irrigation on a rough agricultural soil surface the initiation of iof is primarily related to the gradual filling of depressions by irrigation water as water ponding in the depressions increases hydrological connectivity of the field increases and this eventually leads to sufficient overland flow connectivity c that overland flow is initiated antoine et al 2009 the initiation of overland flow generally occurs when an area of the field is connected to the outlet or field boundary defined as connectivity threshold peñuela et al 2015 overland flow connectivity of a field increases as more water ponds in and flows through local depressions leading to flow across field boundaries quantifying the development of c during an irrigation event therefore can be a key to the prevention and management of overland flow we propose a method to continuously monitor the development of c during an irrigation event the method requires two elements the first is a new proximal sensing technique which uses acoustic technology to monitor the proportion of soil surface covered with water a sw m2 m 2 bradley et al 2020 the second element is a ponding and redistribution overland flow model which simulates the flow of water over a rough soil surface and assists by converting a sw into c appels et al 2011 ghimire et al 2021 for these technologies to assist during an irrigation event it is necessary to develop and test a method that will indicate when irrigation inputs should cease or be scaled downwards to prevent iof that methodology is presented here and is the novelty of this contribution 2 theory overland flow is a process varying greatly over both space and time where surface topography significantly controls the initiation of overland flow at the beginning of irrigation water infiltrates the soil stage 1 fig 1a if the irrigation intensity exceeds the soil s infiltration capacity free water will remain on the surface and partly fill depressions stage 2 fig 1a at this stage overland flow is limited because the water cannot reach the outflow boundary if irrigation persists with an intensity higher than the infiltration rate individual depressions will progressively overflow and connect either to adjacent depressions or to the outflow boundary with additional irrigation more and more depressions fill with water and the soil surface area covered with water a sw m2 m 2 also increases this in turn leads to the formation of a network of connected flow paths that eventually leads to sharp increases in the overland flow appearing at the outflow boundary stage 3 fig 1a note that we are concerned with flow of water on the soil surface and do not consider lateral subsurface flow processes several studies have linked overland flow initiation and hydrologic connectivity to the depression storage the cumulative volume in the micro topographic depressions divided by the total area of the soil surface antoine et al 2009 darboux et al 2002 peñuela et al 2016 the use of variable rate irrigation technology in combination with continuous monitoring of changes in depression storage during an irrigation event might present a novel method for the prevention and management of overland flow however quantifying the depression storage in real time is exceedingly difficult acknowledging this difficulty ghimire et al 2021 proposed using a sw which is more readily measured in real time using proximal remote sensing e g acoustic remote sensing bradley et al 2020 as a proxy for overland flow connectivity c fig 1b bradley et al 2020 has shown that the near surface nature of sound reflection is ideal for sensing the presence of free water on the soil surface and quantifying a sw the higher flow resistivity and lack of porosity of water means it is acoustically harder than soil this difference in hardness leads to an increase in acoustic reflectivity of the soil surface as the a sw increases bradley et al 2020 the acoustic instrument used in this study comprised a linear array of speakers that produced an acoustic beam a similar linear array of microphones sensors was used as a receiver the directionality of the arrays gave a well defined footprint or sensing area on the ground between the instruments and the sensor was able to see through standing pasture biomass of up to 3500 kg dm ha bradley et al 2020 the a sw as measured using the above device can be related to c using a soil hydraulic model ghimire et al 2021 the fast areal simulator with topography for runoff hereafter referred to as fastr appels et al 2011 was used to establish a relationship between c and a sw fastr is an instantaneous flow model its output allows for the calculation of depression storage as well as the calculation of a sw moreover the relation between c and a sw allows calculation of the critical value of a sw ghimire et al 2021 fig 1b the critical value of a sw represents the minimum a sw needed to initiate substantial overland flow ghimire et al 2021 fig 1c shows a schematic framework for linking acoustic remote sensing and soil hydraulic modeling to monitor c at fine resolutions in real time 3 testing and evaluation a series of experiments were conducted to continuously monitor overland flow connectivity c after preliminary testing under controlled laboratory conditions the method was then tested in a field settings representative of how irrigation is applied in agriculture the field experiments are described in sections 3 1 the laboratory experiments are presented in the supplementary materials 3 1 experimental set up the measurements were carried out under a centre pivot irrigation system of 450 m length on a dairy farm located in canterbury new zealand 43 691509 s 172 483682 e the soil at the site is classified in the new zealand soil classification as mottled immature pallic soil hewitt 2010 or happlustepts in us soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 three approximately 1 m 1 m field plots henceforth referred to as plots 1 3 were randomly selected towards the end of the centre pivot where irrigation intensities are highest the pasture in each of the three plots was cut to ground level fig 2 to allow the imaging of pooled water during irrigation by a downward facing 3d camera grundy et al 2020 the setup comprised speaker and microphone arrays both mounted at 45 to the vertical on a steel frame approximately 1 m above the plots the set up gave a well defined sensor footprint which was equal to the plot size 1 m 1 m the irrigator moved over the top of the frame at its normal rate of translation across the field therefore the same region of ground was insonified continuously during the observation period as the irrigation was applied the equipment was moved to the next plot once the irrigator had completely passed over the target plot a tipping bucket rain gauge rain collector ii davis instruments usa 0 2 mm per tip was used to measure the amount and intensity of irrigation a sw was measured from the 3d camera images ghimire et al 2021 and compared with the measured acoustic reflectance using acoustic signals of frequency 2 5 2 9 3 3 3 7 4 1 and 4 5 khz bradley et al 2020 fastr was then used to quantify the c as a function of a sw to further investigate the ability of the sensor to see through the pasture cover the experiment was repeated in two uncut approximately 1 m 1 m plots plots 4 and 5 at the same site the biomass dry matter was determined after the experiments by collecting the cut pasture drying and weighing it measurements of a sw using the 3d camera were not possible for these plots because of the pasture cover but the topsoil 0 60 mm moisture content and hence porosity and air content by proxy was monitored at 5 min intervals using a portable time domain reflectometry ml3 theta probe delta t devices 4 results and discussion fig 3 shows the overland connectivity as a function of a sw for all the plots derived using the fastr the critical values of a sw needed to initiate the overland flow varied from about 0 13 plot 2 to 0 46 m2 m 2 plot 1 plot 2 had a mound parallel to the slope see fig 2 and because of this ponding and overland flow started immediately and the plot had a small critical a sw value 0 13 m2 m 2 this is largely due to the development of straight flow paths parallel to the downslope direction cf ghimire et al 2021 plots 1 and 3 had cross slope mounds which created barriers to overland flow and therefore resulted in critical values of a sw 0 46 and 0 38 m2 m 2 both higher than for plot 2 note that irrigation intensity would affect the absolute onset of overland flow and the overall achieving of full connectivity however we have taken out the effect of time by presenting the results dimensionless c and a sw moreover given the small plot size 1 m 1 m it would be reasonable to assume that the soil infiltration capacity does not vary in space to an extent that affects the dimensionless fill rate of the microtopography a sw changes in reflected acoustic intensity with the time since the start of irrigation for the cut pasture surfaces together with the irrigation amount mm and changes in surface water coverage are presented in fig 4 free water started to appear on the soil surface when the cumulative irrigation amounts were 3 plots 2 and 3 to 5 mm plot 1 and occurred at about 10 min after the start of irrigation normalized acoustic reflectance for plots 1 and 2 increased rapidly with the onset of free water on the soil surface the normalized acoustic reflectance for plot 1 increased up to a sw 0 35 m2 m 2 and declined thereafter likewise the reflectance value for plot 2 increased steadily up to a sw 0 25 m2 m 2 plot 2 lacked the data points for a sw 0 25 m2 m 2 as the irrigation duration was not sufficient enough to result in higher a sw the normalized reflectance value plateaued and may have started to decline toward the end of irrigation in plot 2 indicating reflectance may decline with very high values of a sw in the case of plot 3 there was some fluctuation in the normalized reflectance values but the general trend was comparable to that of plot 1 and plot 2 note however that the relationship between normalized acoustic intensity and a sw appears to be non monotonic this means that if the soil has already passed the critical c point at the time that acoustic sensing starts then a simple threshold level of normalized acoustic intensity will not be sufficient instead it will be necessary to also note if normalized acoustic intensity is increasing or decreasing with time given that measurements can be taken at a rate of 44100 sec bradley et al 2020 this is a relatively simple addition to the acoustic method results from the uncut pasture surfaces are presented in fig 5 measurements of surface water coverage were not possible because of the grass cover but the topsoil moisture was monitored continuously note that the soil moisture data for plot 5 are not available because of the logger failure the pasture biomass in plots 4 and 5 were 2850 and 3100 kg ha 1 acoustic reflectance for both plots started to increase when the cumulative irrigation amount was 5 mm this occurred at 10 min plot 4 to 15 min plot 5 after the start of irrigation the topsoil moisture data in plot 4 reached the maximum value of 0 36 m3 m 3 i e close to the value at saturation around 10 min and remained constant for the rest of the irrigation the fact that topsoil moisture reached its maximum value at 10 min after the start of irrigation and the acoustic reflectance also started to increase around the same time suggests that the first appearance of free water on the surface also occurred around that time the normalized acoustic reflectance in plot 5 was very similar to that for plot 4 which leads us to infer that the onset of free water occurred 10 min after the start of irrigation these results suggest that the acoustic sensor can be used to detect the free water and the critical value of a sw on the soil surface beneath the pasture canopy 5 conclusions here we have presented a method to continuously monitor the overland flow connectivity c during an irrigation event the method comprised two elements the first was a new proximal technique which uses acoustic technology to continuously monitor surface water coverage a sw the acoustic technology uses directional acoustic transmitter and receiver arrays to assess the acoustic hardness of the soil surface the results showed that the a sw can be estimated in real time from changes in the amplitude of reflected sound waves the second element is a ponding and redistribution overland flow model which simulates the flow of water over a rough soil surface this model assists by converting a sw into c a series of experiments were carried out to examine the method the results showed that the proposed method of monitoring c has a considerable scope in irrigated fields where prediction of overland flow is desirable declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9689,soil surface depressions affect overland flow generation and related hydrological processes overland flow connectivity c of a field increases as more water ponds in and flows through local depressions leading to flow across field boundaries quantifying the development of c during an irrigation or rainfall event is key to predicting the initiation of overland flow a novel method to continuously monitor the development of c during an irrigation event is proposed the method comprises two elements i a new proximal sensing technique which exploits acoustic technology to continuously monitor the proportion of the soil surface covered in water a sw and ii an overland flow model which simulates the flow of water over a rough soil surface and assists by converting a sw into c a series of experiments were conducted to examine the proposed method directional acoustic transmitter and receiver arrays were used to estimate a sw in real time from changes in reflectance a structured light 3d camera was used to validate a sw estimated using acoustic reflectance the results showed a significant correlation between observed and estimated a sw r 2 0 94 p 0 001 we further demonstrated that the a sw as measured using the acoustic proximal sensing can be related to c using an overland flow model which allows to identify critical value of a sw needed to initiate overland flow our results show that this real time method of monitoring c has a considerable potential in irrigated fields where prediction of overland flow is desirable keywords overland flow connectivity surface water coverage irrigation infiltration 1 introduction smarter irrigation such as variable rate technology evans et al 2013 hedley et al 2014 is one of the many approaches to address increasing pressure on agriculture due to economic availability of suitable land area production target and environmental challenges searchinger 2019 however there are several environmental issues that can arise from irrigation these include increased drainage and salinity skhiri and dechmi 2012 increased leaching of nutrients adversely affecting groundwater and or surface water quality mcdowell et al 2011 rajmohan et al 2021 and wasting applied nutrients and water allaire leung et al 2001 dechmi et al 2003 and excessive abstraction of water for the purposes of irrigation marek et al 2017 while improved irrigation scheduling the amount and the timing of irrigation applied can help control losses via drainage and leaching e g rath et al 2021 the technologies do not address irrigation induced overland flow iof irrigation induced overland flow can arise either when the irrigation intensity is higher than soil s infiltration capacity or when the soil becomes saturated once overland flow is generated there is the potential for the rapid transport of nutrients and microorganisms from the soil towards water bodies causing harm blaustein et al 2015 while any well designed irrigation system will consider infiltration capacity in its initial design the infiltration capacity of the soil surface varies by orders of magnitude in both space and time as a result of management such as the timing of tillage crop management and grazing practices drewry et al 2008 2019 so a suitable irrigation application rate at the time of design and commissioning may well be too high after one or more seasons centre pivot irrigation systems widely used to irrigate large fields can vary application intensity by changing the speed of travel of the irrigation boom or through variable rate technology which enables individual nozzles to be turned on and off thereby varying water application evans et al 2013 hedley et al 2014 variable rate technology is more flexible as it can typically modify the application for different sections along the pivot while adjustments to the traveling speed of the pivot can modify the irrigation applied only in segments of the circular field controlling the return period or use of variable rate irrigation technologies in conjunction with soil water status monitoring has been shown to be effective for handling landscape complexities such as variability of soil profile depth which affects the water holding capacity of the soil and therefore the amount rate of irrigation that should be applied hedley et al 2014 2013 however these approaches cannot overcome issues related to the inevitable spatial and temporal variability in the soil s infiltration capacity therefore there is a need for a method to detect emerging overland flow conditions early enough to prevent substantial overland flow from the field during irrigation on a rough agricultural soil surface the initiation of iof is primarily related to the gradual filling of depressions by irrigation water as water ponding in the depressions increases hydrological connectivity of the field increases and this eventually leads to sufficient overland flow connectivity c that overland flow is initiated antoine et al 2009 the initiation of overland flow generally occurs when an area of the field is connected to the outlet or field boundary defined as connectivity threshold peñuela et al 2015 overland flow connectivity of a field increases as more water ponds in and flows through local depressions leading to flow across field boundaries quantifying the development of c during an irrigation event therefore can be a key to the prevention and management of overland flow we propose a method to continuously monitor the development of c during an irrigation event the method requires two elements the first is a new proximal sensing technique which uses acoustic technology to monitor the proportion of soil surface covered with water a sw m2 m 2 bradley et al 2020 the second element is a ponding and redistribution overland flow model which simulates the flow of water over a rough soil surface and assists by converting a sw into c appels et al 2011 ghimire et al 2021 for these technologies to assist during an irrigation event it is necessary to develop and test a method that will indicate when irrigation inputs should cease or be scaled downwards to prevent iof that methodology is presented here and is the novelty of this contribution 2 theory overland flow is a process varying greatly over both space and time where surface topography significantly controls the initiation of overland flow at the beginning of irrigation water infiltrates the soil stage 1 fig 1a if the irrigation intensity exceeds the soil s infiltration capacity free water will remain on the surface and partly fill depressions stage 2 fig 1a at this stage overland flow is limited because the water cannot reach the outflow boundary if irrigation persists with an intensity higher than the infiltration rate individual depressions will progressively overflow and connect either to adjacent depressions or to the outflow boundary with additional irrigation more and more depressions fill with water and the soil surface area covered with water a sw m2 m 2 also increases this in turn leads to the formation of a network of connected flow paths that eventually leads to sharp increases in the overland flow appearing at the outflow boundary stage 3 fig 1a note that we are concerned with flow of water on the soil surface and do not consider lateral subsurface flow processes several studies have linked overland flow initiation and hydrologic connectivity to the depression storage the cumulative volume in the micro topographic depressions divided by the total area of the soil surface antoine et al 2009 darboux et al 2002 peñuela et al 2016 the use of variable rate irrigation technology in combination with continuous monitoring of changes in depression storage during an irrigation event might present a novel method for the prevention and management of overland flow however quantifying the depression storage in real time is exceedingly difficult acknowledging this difficulty ghimire et al 2021 proposed using a sw which is more readily measured in real time using proximal remote sensing e g acoustic remote sensing bradley et al 2020 as a proxy for overland flow connectivity c fig 1b bradley et al 2020 has shown that the near surface nature of sound reflection is ideal for sensing the presence of free water on the soil surface and quantifying a sw the higher flow resistivity and lack of porosity of water means it is acoustically harder than soil this difference in hardness leads to an increase in acoustic reflectivity of the soil surface as the a sw increases bradley et al 2020 the acoustic instrument used in this study comprised a linear array of speakers that produced an acoustic beam a similar linear array of microphones sensors was used as a receiver the directionality of the arrays gave a well defined footprint or sensing area on the ground between the instruments and the sensor was able to see through standing pasture biomass of up to 3500 kg dm ha bradley et al 2020 the a sw as measured using the above device can be related to c using a soil hydraulic model ghimire et al 2021 the fast areal simulator with topography for runoff hereafter referred to as fastr appels et al 2011 was used to establish a relationship between c and a sw fastr is an instantaneous flow model its output allows for the calculation of depression storage as well as the calculation of a sw moreover the relation between c and a sw allows calculation of the critical value of a sw ghimire et al 2021 fig 1b the critical value of a sw represents the minimum a sw needed to initiate substantial overland flow ghimire et al 2021 fig 1c shows a schematic framework for linking acoustic remote sensing and soil hydraulic modeling to monitor c at fine resolutions in real time 3 testing and evaluation a series of experiments were conducted to continuously monitor overland flow connectivity c after preliminary testing under controlled laboratory conditions the method was then tested in a field settings representative of how irrigation is applied in agriculture the field experiments are described in sections 3 1 the laboratory experiments are presented in the supplementary materials 3 1 experimental set up the measurements were carried out under a centre pivot irrigation system of 450 m length on a dairy farm located in canterbury new zealand 43 691509 s 172 483682 e the soil at the site is classified in the new zealand soil classification as mottled immature pallic soil hewitt 2010 or happlustepts in us soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 three approximately 1 m 1 m field plots henceforth referred to as plots 1 3 were randomly selected towards the end of the centre pivot where irrigation intensities are highest the pasture in each of the three plots was cut to ground level fig 2 to allow the imaging of pooled water during irrigation by a downward facing 3d camera grundy et al 2020 the setup comprised speaker and microphone arrays both mounted at 45 to the vertical on a steel frame approximately 1 m above the plots the set up gave a well defined sensor footprint which was equal to the plot size 1 m 1 m the irrigator moved over the top of the frame at its normal rate of translation across the field therefore the same region of ground was insonified continuously during the observation period as the irrigation was applied the equipment was moved to the next plot once the irrigator had completely passed over the target plot a tipping bucket rain gauge rain collector ii davis instruments usa 0 2 mm per tip was used to measure the amount and intensity of irrigation a sw was measured from the 3d camera images ghimire et al 2021 and compared with the measured acoustic reflectance using acoustic signals of frequency 2 5 2 9 3 3 3 7 4 1 and 4 5 khz bradley et al 2020 fastr was then used to quantify the c as a function of a sw to further investigate the ability of the sensor to see through the pasture cover the experiment was repeated in two uncut approximately 1 m 1 m plots plots 4 and 5 at the same site the biomass dry matter was determined after the experiments by collecting the cut pasture drying and weighing it measurements of a sw using the 3d camera were not possible for these plots because of the pasture cover but the topsoil 0 60 mm moisture content and hence porosity and air content by proxy was monitored at 5 min intervals using a portable time domain reflectometry ml3 theta probe delta t devices 4 results and discussion fig 3 shows the overland connectivity as a function of a sw for all the plots derived using the fastr the critical values of a sw needed to initiate the overland flow varied from about 0 13 plot 2 to 0 46 m2 m 2 plot 1 plot 2 had a mound parallel to the slope see fig 2 and because of this ponding and overland flow started immediately and the plot had a small critical a sw value 0 13 m2 m 2 this is largely due to the development of straight flow paths parallel to the downslope direction cf ghimire et al 2021 plots 1 and 3 had cross slope mounds which created barriers to overland flow and therefore resulted in critical values of a sw 0 46 and 0 38 m2 m 2 both higher than for plot 2 note that irrigation intensity would affect the absolute onset of overland flow and the overall achieving of full connectivity however we have taken out the effect of time by presenting the results dimensionless c and a sw moreover given the small plot size 1 m 1 m it would be reasonable to assume that the soil infiltration capacity does not vary in space to an extent that affects the dimensionless fill rate of the microtopography a sw changes in reflected acoustic intensity with the time since the start of irrigation for the cut pasture surfaces together with the irrigation amount mm and changes in surface water coverage are presented in fig 4 free water started to appear on the soil surface when the cumulative irrigation amounts were 3 plots 2 and 3 to 5 mm plot 1 and occurred at about 10 min after the start of irrigation normalized acoustic reflectance for plots 1 and 2 increased rapidly with the onset of free water on the soil surface the normalized acoustic reflectance for plot 1 increased up to a sw 0 35 m2 m 2 and declined thereafter likewise the reflectance value for plot 2 increased steadily up to a sw 0 25 m2 m 2 plot 2 lacked the data points for a sw 0 25 m2 m 2 as the irrigation duration was not sufficient enough to result in higher a sw the normalized reflectance value plateaued and may have started to decline toward the end of irrigation in plot 2 indicating reflectance may decline with very high values of a sw in the case of plot 3 there was some fluctuation in the normalized reflectance values but the general trend was comparable to that of plot 1 and plot 2 note however that the relationship between normalized acoustic intensity and a sw appears to be non monotonic this means that if the soil has already passed the critical c point at the time that acoustic sensing starts then a simple threshold level of normalized acoustic intensity will not be sufficient instead it will be necessary to also note if normalized acoustic intensity is increasing or decreasing with time given that measurements can be taken at a rate of 44100 sec bradley et al 2020 this is a relatively simple addition to the acoustic method results from the uncut pasture surfaces are presented in fig 5 measurements of surface water coverage were not possible because of the grass cover but the topsoil moisture was monitored continuously note that the soil moisture data for plot 5 are not available because of the logger failure the pasture biomass in plots 4 and 5 were 2850 and 3100 kg ha 1 acoustic reflectance for both plots started to increase when the cumulative irrigation amount was 5 mm this occurred at 10 min plot 4 to 15 min plot 5 after the start of irrigation the topsoil moisture data in plot 4 reached the maximum value of 0 36 m3 m 3 i e close to the value at saturation around 10 min and remained constant for the rest of the irrigation the fact that topsoil moisture reached its maximum value at 10 min after the start of irrigation and the acoustic reflectance also started to increase around the same time suggests that the first appearance of free water on the surface also occurred around that time the normalized acoustic reflectance in plot 5 was very similar to that for plot 4 which leads us to infer that the onset of free water occurred 10 min after the start of irrigation these results suggest that the acoustic sensor can be used to detect the free water and the critical value of a sw on the soil surface beneath the pasture canopy 5 conclusions here we have presented a method to continuously monitor the overland flow connectivity c during an irrigation event the method comprised two elements the first was a new proximal technique which uses acoustic technology to continuously monitor surface water coverage a sw the acoustic technology uses directional acoustic transmitter and receiver arrays to assess the acoustic hardness of the soil surface the results showed that the a sw can be estimated in real time from changes in the amplitude of reflected sound waves the second element is a ponding and redistribution overland flow model which simulates the flow of water over a rough soil surface this model assists by converting a sw into c a series of experiments were carried out to examine the method the results showed that the proposed method of monitoring c has a considerable scope in irrigated fields where prediction of overland flow is desirable declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
