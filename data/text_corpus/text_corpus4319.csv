21595,in wave structure interaction problems the minimization of wave reflection at boundaries is important for achieving accurate results and limiting the disturbances on the air water interface the present study compares a set of existing wave outlet techniques which are commonly applied in free surface simulations using a viscous flow solver these techniques are stretched mesh linear damping source increased viscosity and relaxation schemes the comparisons are performed for test conditions which include propagation of regular incident waves and damping of radiation waves keywords wave propagation wave outlet mesh stretching damping source viscosity outlet relaxation openfoam 1 introduction as computers become more and more powerful computational fluid dynamics cfd tools for solving free surface flows have gain more popularity within the naval and offshore engineering community one common application is the analysis of wave structure interactions typically ocean waves have periods in the range of 6 25 s and they travel long distances with very small energy dissipation for example waves with a wavelength of 73 15 m t 6 84 s will travel 924 km in a day while their height only diminishes by one or two percent because of friction lamb 1945 joseph 2006 for practical reasons the computational domain needs to be truncated to a manageable size the far field condition is replaced by wave outlet boundaries with specific numerical treatment in order to minimize reflection many numerical techniques have been developed to reduce wave reflection at these boundaries the simplest approach is to stretch the mesh toward the outlets which consequently yields varying performance depending on the configuration of the stretched mesh therefore it is attractive to develop more robust and efficient techniques israeli and orszag 1981 showed that damping zone or sponge layer techniques introducing a source term in governing equations can be used to absorb waves effectively israeli and orszag 1981 another technique is to use a combination of linear and quadratic vertical velocity sources in the sponge layer outlet zone park et al 1999 choi and yoon 2009 perić and abdel maksoud 2016 the numerical treatments of wave outlets are complicated by the existence of upstream propagated waves these waves are usually generated by the interaction between waves and structure in the computational domain as a consequence these scattering waves need to be absorbed at both inlet and outlet among the outlet techniques the approach of relaxation schemes appear to be able to satisfy this need mayer et al 1998 fuhrman 2004 engsig karup 2006 seng 2012 vukčević 2016 here the simulated waves are relaxed toward a given target in the sponge layer also called relaxation zone or blending zone the relaxation schemes can be further categorized into implicit and explicit relaxations the implicit relaxation scheme adds equations for the target flow field to the governing equations using a spatially distributed weight function as a result source terms appear in the momentum equations kim et al 2012 vukčević 2016 the explicit relaxation scheme performs the relaxation after solving the governing equations mayer et al 1998 fuhrman 2004 engsig karup 2006 a comparative study of relaxation schemes with dirichlet type boundary inlet outlet and active wave absorption techniques can be found in higuera et al 2013 miquel et al 2018 higuera et al 2013 reported with an active wave absorption technique wave reflection coefficients between 2 and 11 for a series of waves below 3 of wave height over wavelength ratio higuera et al 2013 the sommerfeld radiation condition which can be viewed as a perfect non reflecting boundary condition for regular linearized waves has been applied at the outlet by engquist and majda 1977 it has been shown that the sommerfeld radiation condition can be manipulated by approximation order at boundaries engquist and majda 1977 the higher order sommerfeld boundary conditions have been used by higdon 1987 givoli and neta 2003 to force waves to propagate outside the boundary in their approaches an accurate evaluation of the varying phase velocity at the boundary is essential to minimize reflection duz et al 2013 applied an approximated phase velocity with linearized sommerfeld boundary condition in irregular wave simulation on staggered grids düz et al 2013 later duz 2015 extended the sommerfeld boundary condition up to second order düz 2015 as this condition is applied on the outlet boundary surface the wave reflection obtained is relatively more sensitive to the case than when using relaxation schemes over the volumic domain other methods such as swense spectral wave explicit navier stokes equations can be applied to handle wave reflections in wave structure interaction problems with the swense method the difficulty of propagating incident waves can be avoided a comparative study with a similar solver as the one used in the present study can be found in li et al 2019 the present study aims at comparing existing outlet conditions for propagating waves in openfoam weller et al 1998 jasak 1996 rusche 2002 an open source gpl license library mainly for solving partial differential equations using finite volume method the third party toolbox known as waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 has been used for wave simulations and for the explicit wave relaxation scheme first a parametric study of the solver named foamstar is conducted in order to design a proper numerical setting for wave propagation with a cyclic lateral condition then two 2d test cases are proposed a numerical wave tank nwt with propagating incident waves and a 2d radiation problem results using the explicit relaxation scheme with different target functions mesh stretching techniques linear damping source and increased viscosity in the outlet are compared in the present study parametric studies are conducted for each outlet configuration note that non reflecting conditions based on mathematical formulations applied at the domain boundary such as the sommerfeld condition are not considered in the present study in the present study the 2d cases are only considered to minimize the complexity of computations and the number of parameters to be considered 2 numerical solver the foamstar is an in house code co developed by bureau veritas and ecole centrale de nantes in the openfoam framework for solving wave structure interaction problems it is based on the standard multi phase solver interdymfoam in the openfoam package rusche 2002 damiàn 2013 two special modules are introduced for wave structure interactions the wave generation module is taken from waves2foam and the mechanical solver is devised to solve the dynamics of rigid and flexible floating fixed bodies in waves some examples of 3d wave generation of realistic sea spectrum can be found in choi et al 2018 2 1 governing equations and solution algorithms the fluid is assumed incompressible and the incompressible navier stokes equations are applied to describe flow the governing equations are written as 1 u 0 and 2 ρ u t ρ u u t μ u u t p d g x ρ where u x and g 0 0 g t are the fluid velocity the position vector and gravitational acceleration vector respectively the dynamic pressure p d p ρ g x is introduced rusche 2002 the mixture density ρ and viscosity μ are given as 3 ρ ρ w α ρ a 1 α 4 μ μ w α μ a 1 α where the subscript w and a represent water and air respectively α is the volume of fluid vof for α 1 the control volume cv is totally wet and for α 0 it is totally dry the interface is inside the cell control volume where α 0 1 the transport equation for α is written as 5 α t α u c α u n α 1 α 0 where the third term on the left hand side is the artificial compression to keep the interface sharp u n is the fluid velocity normal to the interface and c α is the compression coefficient the solution algorithm of foamstar is shown in fig 1 in the time loop the weight used to generate and absorb waves in the relaxation zone is updated the governing equations and α transport equation are solved in the pimple loop an implementation of combined simple and piso algorithms supplied with openfoam the body motion is solved in the mechanical solver and the computational mesh is updated according to the displacement of the body surface boundaries after solving the α transport equation the relaxation scheme is applied to impose the target α field in the relaxation zones after solving the fluid velocity and pressure in the piso algorithm the fluid velocity is relaxed toward the prescribed target velocity field in the relaxation zone in the present study no turbulence model is considered when it is required however the turbulence model is solved as the last step in the algorithm details of each step in the solution algorithm are described in monroy et al 2016 2 2 finite volume discretization and definition the collocated second order finite volume discretization is applied to the whole computational domain to solve the governing equations the control volumes are arbitrary polyhedra with an example of the geometrical description of a computational cell with index p shown in fig 2 jasak 1996 the volume is v p each cell face is either a boundary face or an internal face which is connected to a neighbor cell of index n the surface area of an arbitrary face f is represented in terms of a normal vector s f where its magnitude is equal to the surface area the distance from cell p to its neighbor n is denoted as vector d f x n x p 2 3 time integration scheme a time integration scheme in openfoam can be selected among implicit euler euler crank nicolson cn and second order backward differentiation formula bdf2 the supplied multiphase solver of openfoam interdymfoam uses a special module which is called multidimensional universal limiter with explicit solution mules to solve the α transport equation mules employs a method based on predictor and corrector steps to ensure α boundedness as an example when the euler scheme is selected the predictor step is as follows 6 v p n 1 α p v p n α p n δ t f n f α f b 0 where the superscripts and n denote the predictor and time iteration respectively the time step between two successive time iterations is δ t the equation flux is f α f b where the superscript b denotes that the flux is bounded to ensure the boundedness f α f b computed by using a 1st order upwind scheme is used in the predictor step the corrector step introduces a flux limiter λ f such that the correction for the high order flux f α f u does not cause unboundedness the correction is as follows 7 v p n 1 α p n 1 v p n 1 α p δ t f λ f f α f u f α f b 0 the sum of equations 6 and 7 produces the original discretized α transport equation in summary the crank nicolson scheme in mules algorithm is a variation from the classical crank nicolson scheme due to the use of predictor and corrector steps the existence of a flux limiter λ f introduced to maximize the α transportation while keeping the α boundness the mules algorithm with the application of crank nicolson scheme is given in appendix a and a detailed description of the algorithm including mules can be found in damiàn 2013 for the crank nicolson time integration scheme the predictor and the corrector steps are formulated to account for the weight factor γ which exists in the classical formulation of the crank nicolson for γ 0 the scheme is equivalent to the explicit euler integration scheme and for γ 1 the resulting scheme is an implicit euler time integration scheme the classical formulation of the cn scheme requires γ 1 2 in openfoam the implementation allows γ to be selectable within a range of γ 1 2 1 to facilitate this selection an off center coefficient hereafter called the crank nicolson off center coefficient c c n is used instead of γ the relation is 8 c c n 1 γ γ c c n 0 1 where c c n 0 represents the implicit euler integration and c c n 1 represents the classical crank nicolson scheme it is commonly recommended to use c c n 0 9 as a compromise between stability and accuracy greenshields 2019 2 4 remarks on the v scheme in openfoam the treatment of the convection term in the navier stokes equations affects the numerical dissipation and stability one of the commonly used schemes is the second order upwinding scheme in openfoam it is selectable either as linearupwind or linearupwindv the latter is refered to as the v scheme differences exist when the scheme is applied to a vector field the v scheme contains an additional limiter which is applied to all components of the vector field greenshields 2019 the numerical details concerning linearupwind and linearupwindv are outlined in the following the finite volume discretization of the convection term leads 9 v p u f d v f n s f u f f f f n φ f f f where f is a vector field u is the transport velocity f f is the interpolated vector at the face center x f the face vector s f has the magnitude of the face area and the flux is φ f s f u f the index f represents the face index between cell p and n the computation of f f using the second order upwinding scheme is as follows 10 f f f upwind δ f corr where f upwind is determined from the cell value in the upwinding direction using the sign of the flux 11 f upwind f p φ f 0 f n φ f 0 the correction term δ f corr differs when selecting linearupwind or linearupwindv the linearupwind scheme proceeds as follows 12 δ f corr δ f o corr where 13 δ f o corr x f x p f p φ f 0 x f x n f n φ f 0 the gradients f p and f n are the cell averaged gradients computed separately by other means the v version of this scheme i e linearupwindv contains an additional limiter 14 δ f corr λ f limiter δ f o corr where 15 λ f limiter min 1 δ f o corr δ f ˆ c o r r δ f o corr 2 with 16 δ f ˆ c o r r 1 w f n f p φ f 0 w f p f n φ f 0 where w is the distance weight corresponding to a central difference linear interpolation from cell centered p and n to the shared face f this linear interpolation is written as 17 f f w f p 1 w f n the effect of λ f limiter is to limit f f of eq 10 to be at most the same as eq 17 3 parametric study on wave propagation in a periodic domain the parametric study is conducted with foamstar to find a proper numerical setting for propagation of a regular wave with properties given in table 1 the simulations are performed in a two dimensional domain with cyclic lateral boundary conditions the free surface and the wave kinematics are initialized at the initial time from a fully nonlinear stream function wave solution ducrozet et al 2019 the schematic view of the problem the initialized phase fraction field vof and the computational mesh are shown in fig 3 the computational domain covers one wavelength l λ and the height is taken to be two times the water depth 2 h h 0 6 m the computational meshes use a uniform cell distribution in the wave propagation direction with characteristic cell size of δ x in the vertical direction the cell distribution is specified in three zones the air the free surface and the underwater zone unless otherwise indicated the free surface zone is limited to z h h with a uniform cell distribution of size δ z in the vertical direction the air zone is above the free surface zone z h h and below is the underwater zone z h h cells outside the free surface zone are stretched perpendicularly from the free surface the level of stretching is specified in term of a ratio between of δ z of the first and the last cells 3 1 effect of time scheme simulations were performed with crank nicolson off center coefficient c c n 0 euler implicit 0 5 and 0 95 in order to observe the effect of the time integration scheme the time step is kept constant at δ t t 400 and mesh parameters are fixed to δ x λ 100 δ z h 20 and stretching ratio 5 fig 4 compares the simulated wave elevations at the center of the domain with those predicted by the stream function wave theory because the stream function wave theory provides a fully nonlinear solution of the potential flow waves it is used here as a reference for the simulated results noticeably the simulated wave amplitudes decrease gradually over time the amount of the amplitude decays are better evaluated by applying the moving window fast fourier transform mwfft to time series allen 1977 the results are shown in fig 5 in terms of the first harmonics and the corresponding phases the reference value obtained from the stream function wave theory is denoted as ref in fig 5 the phase differences between the cfd results and the stream function solution are significantly larger for the low order time integration scheme while the numerical errors in these simulations can be improved further through a refinement study the present results show that for the same mesh parameters and same time step sizes one may benefit significantly from using a highly accurate time integration scheme for the rest of the present study the time integration scheme is set to crank nicolson with c c n 0 95 3 2 mesh and time step convergence the computational meshes and time steps are tested to obtain the formal convergence order of the discretization schemes mesh parameters are given in table 2 in terms of lateral spacing δ x vertical spacing in the free surface zone δ z and time step δ t the mesh stretching ratio in the air zone and in the underwater zone is kept constant at 5 representative courant number co and cell reynolds number re δ can be defined by using analytic wave fluid velocities as co co x 2 co z 2 and re δ re δ x 2 re δ z 2 where co x u wave δ t δ x co z w wave δ t δ z re δ x u wave δ x ν re δ z w wave δ z ν and u wave and v wave are the maximum horizontal and vertical fluid velocities given by stream function wave theory respectively the kinematic viscosity of water is denoted by ν two series of tests are conducted the first series varies the cell size and consequently the cell reynolds numbers while the courant number is fixed by varying accordingly the time steps in the second series the cell reynolds numbers are fixed and the courant numbers are varied fig 6 shows snapshots of velocity fields at time instants t 20 t and t 40 t the results using v scheme remains smooth for at least 40 t between times 20 t and 40 t the distribution of the velocity field remains mostly unchanged with most visible differences in phases and the position of the crests without the v scheme the velocity field remains smooth for a shorter duration whereafter a large spurious velocity appears in the vicinity of the free surface consequently the free surface is very erroneous without using the v scheme for a long simulation duration amplitudes of the first harmonic of wave elevations at the center of the domain obtained over time for different courant numbers and cell reynolds numbers are compared in fig 7 the results show that the additional limiter introduced in the v scheme eq 14 leads to larger numerical dissipation than in the case without applying the v scheme without using the v scheme the high disturbance of the interface leads to a stong decrease of the wave amplitude for long simulations before the large interface disturbance errors of the first harmonics at 10 t and 20 t are shown in table 3 for mesh100 dt400 with and without the v scheme this mesh configuration table 2 corresponds to mesh parameters δ x λ 100 δ z h 20 and δ t t 400 the representative courant number is 0 171 and cell reynolds number is 2209 this shows that for short simulations the v scheme can lead to smaller wave amplitude than the case without v scheme the present results show that using the v scheme is beneficial for a long simulation duration by reducing the interface disturbance applying v scheme gives a slightly reduced wave amplitude it is thought to be manageable and insignificant for a long simulation time convergence analyses are performed for the first harmonics obtained during the first ten wave periods the orders of convergence are computed according to the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2014 which applies a least square method to get the order of convergence p and the associated uncertainty estimation eça and hoekstra 2014 the results are shown in fig 8 the orders of convergence p for varying courant and cell reynolds numbers and using the v scheme are estimated to be 1 14 and 1 60 respectively without using the v scheme the estimated convergence order increases to 1 93 and 1 69 similar results are obtained by larsen et al 2019 where it is stated that the interface disturbance can appear with the use of higher order schemes to capture a sharp interface between liquid and gas they also showed that the choice of time integration and convection schemes affect the interface shape and a combination of more or less diffusive schemes can improve the wave quality however the choice of more or less diffusive schemes depends on the case therefore the upwind scheme which is reported as giving gradually decreasing amplitude but consistent results is selected in the present study further simulations are performed without the v scheme while the results are evaluated with more emphasis on data up to 20 t 3 3 mesh spacing in vertical direction in deep water the velocity field of propagating waves has an hyperbolic profile in the vertical direction under the free surface according to the potential flow wave theory the maximum velocity occurs at the free surface and it decays rapidly far away from the free surface therefore in the vertical direction meshes are generated using 3 zones 1 underwater zone z h h 2 free surface zone z h h and 3 air zone z h h the cell resolution is configured to be relatively dense inside and near the free surface zone and it is coarsened gradually towards the bottom to study the effects of this coarsening simulations are performed on several meshes with different stretching ratios a naming scheme is chosen mesh ijk where i j and k represents the stretching ratio of zones underwater free surface and air respectively here the stretching ratio is defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum cell height fig 9 illustrates mesh 212 mesh 515 and mesh 818 the cells are uniformly distributed in the horizontal direction with δ x λ 100 and within the free surface zone with δ z h 20 as seen in fig 10 the first harmonic amplitudes and the phases for all three meshes are almost identical therefore the stretching ratio mesh 515 which is applied throughout this study is thought to be sufficient for the wave condition under consideration 4 inlet outlet condition 4 1 relaxation zones the wave generation and absorption method of foamstar is based on an explicit scheme which relaxes the computed solution towards a given target flow field mayer et al 1998 fuhrman 2004 engsig karup 2006 jacobsen et al 2012 seng 2012 the scheme requires a weight function which varies between 0 and 1 in the relaxation zones the relaxation is performed as follows 18 χ 1 w χ w χ t a r g e t where χ is the computed flow field i e either the vof field or the velocity field w is the weight function and χ t a r g e t is the given target flow field it shall be noted that there exists an implicit relaxation scheme which performs the relaxation directly in the governing equations vukčević 2016 kim et al 2012 this study does not cover this implicit approach due to its unavailablity in foamstar hence only the explicit relaxation scheme is considered the choice of the weight function w is important to minimize wave reflections a discussion on smoothness criteria for w was originally presented in engsig karup 2006 two common choices can be identified a polynomial weight function mayer et al 1998 engsig karup 2006 and an exponential weight function mayer et al 1998 engsig karup 2006 jacobsen et al 2012 seng 2012 seng 2012 introduces further a dynamic weight function w d defined as follows seng 2012 19 w d 1 1 w u u t a r g e t δ t δ x where w is the original static weight and δ x is the characteristic cell size seng 2012 the dynamic weight w d is recomputed at every time step and is changed locally and adaptively based on the local differences between computed and target velocity the relaxation proceeds as in eq 18 using w d instead of w the static weight function w remains either a polynomial or an exponential function 20 w ξ e ξ 3 5 1 e 1 exponential weight 2 ξ 3 3 ξ 2 polynomial weight where ξ 0 1 is a normalized coordinate in the relaxation zones the present study evaluates the explicit relaxation scheme using either exponential or polynomial weight functions in combination with the static or the dynamic weight formulation in addition the evaluation covers various sizes of the relaxation zone which is considered as an important parameter to obtain an optimal compromise between the computational cost and the amount of the reflected waves miquel et al 2018 reported 3 9 of wave reflection for regular waves using an explicit relaxation scheme with static exponential function miquel et al 2018 perić and abdel maksoud 2018 showed the wave reflection can be less than 1 for l o u t l e t 2 λ when a strength of relaxation factor is optimized and applied to the exponential weight function perić and abdel maksoud 2018 the target function is another important parameter when a floating or a fixed body exists within the incident wave field radiation diffraction waves are generated due to interactions of the wave field with the body in numerical computations using the relaxation schemes the target flow field is usually set to be either the incident wave field or calm water because the radiation diffraction waves are unknown alternatively the target wave field within the relaxation zones can be estimated from the observed wave elevations and kinematics in front of the outlet zone when the wave amplitude decreases the wavenumber changes due to a nonlinear effect which is proportional to o k 1 a 3 in the third order theory for slightly smaller waves the change of wavenumber is almost negligible therefore it is assumed that the propagating waves do not change their wave frequency and wave number the amplitudes and phases of the first harmonic of the observed waves are calculated using the fourier transform for corresponding ω and k 1 as follows 21 a 2 t cos δ φ t t t ζ x 0 τ cos k 1 x x 0 ω τ d τ and 22 tan δ φ t t t ζ x 0 τ sin k 1 x x 0 ω τ d τ t t t ζ x 0 τ cos k 1 x x 0 ω τ d τ where a is the amplitude of the first harmonic of the modified waves δ φ is the phase difference between the incident and the modified waves and ζ x 0 τ is the measured wave elevation in front of outlet zone at x 0 the modal wavenumber k 1 is obtained from nonlinear stream function theory rienecker and fenton 1981 wave elevations and fluid velocities of the modified waves are then given by 23 ζ a a a 0 2 n 1 n a a n cos k n x ω t δ φ 24 u 0 ψ 0 t 25 ψ a a b 0 z n 1 n b b n sin h k n z h cos h k n h cos k n x ω t δ φ where n a and n b are the numbers of truncated fourier modes of stream function waves and a n and b n are the amplitudes of the fourier mode for wave elevation and for stream function respectively k n are the wavenumber details can be found in ducrozet et al 2019 rienecker and fenton 1981 4 2 sponge layer method alternatively the addition of linear and quadratic damping source terms to the momentum equations can be used to damp waves park et al 1999 perić and abdel maksoud 2016 the approach is known as a sponge layer method and was originally proposed by israeli and orszag 1981 the momentum equations with the source terms are 26 ρ u t ρ u u t μ u u t p d g x ρ s where μ is a dynamic viscosity p d p ρ g x is the dynamic pressure the source terms s include both the linear and quadratic damping sources and are formulated to be applied to the vertical velocity components as follows 27 s 0 0 ρ c 1 c 2 u z w u z t where w is the weight function c 1 and c 2 are the linear and quadratic damping coefficients respectively through a parametric study perić and abdel maksoud 2016 reported wave reflection coefficients of less than 1 thanks to an optimal choice of alternatively c 1 or c 2 perić and abdel maksoud 2016 they proposed a practical recommendation for the simulation with exponential weight function and the condition l o u t l e t 2 λ in the present study only the linear damping is considered with polynomial weight function hence c 2 is set to zero 4 3 other alternatives two other alternatives for wave damping are considered in this study due to their simplicity the mesh stretching and the increased viscosity mesh stretching introduces the desired wave damping and also additional dispersive effects the increased viscosity is a method where the viscosity is increased artificially in the outlet zone wave damping occurs due to the increased energy loss caused by the artificial viscosity the momentum equation with increased viscosity in the outlet is written as 28 ρ u t ρ u u t μ μ a d d u u t p d g x ρ where μ a d d is the increased viscosity in the outlet zone 5 outlet study i numerical wave tank nwt the aim is to assess the quality of waves in a numerical wave tank as a prerequisite to perform a successful simulation involving wave structure interactions consequently the size of the domain is chosen to be representative of typical cases and the quality of the simulated waves is assessed in time 5 1 reflection coefficients waves simulated in numerical wave tanks are affected by the numerical dissipation the free surface instabilities and the performance of the wave absorption method at the outlet the latter is often characterised through the use of a wave reflection coefficient which is defined as the ratio of amplitudes of propagating and reflecting waves at steady state for small wave amplitudes the wave reflection coefficient is defined as in ursell et al 1960 29 c r a max a min a max a min where a max and a min are the maxima and minima of the wave envelope amplitude this definition works well for linear waves with no reflection the amplitude modulation of the linear wave goes to zero hence a max a min and the reflection coefficient becomes c r 0 when the linear waves are fully reflected the amplitude envelope has a min 0 therefore the reflection coefficient becomes c r 1 however wave conditions used in the present study are nonlinear and the above definition is no longer sufficient perić and abdel maksoud 2016 used the same definition as shown in eq 29 but the amplitude is replaced by the wave height perić and abdel maksoud 2016 the reflection coefficient eq 29 can be computed based on the first order amplitudes ignoring the higher harmonics i e by means of the fast fourier transform fft this definition was used in goda and suzuki 1976 chew et al 2015 carmigniani and violeau 2018 to quantify the reflection coefficient when the wave field is at quasi steady state in the present study the reflection coefficient is evaluated with first harmonic amplitude as in associated researches goda and suzuki 1976 chew et al 2015 carmigniani and violeau 2018 but the fft is performed within a moving window in time to capture the transient nature of the present simulations given data within a window of one period the time varying first harmonics at i th wave gauge is computed as 30 a i ω t 2 t t t t ζ x i t cos k x i ω τ d τ where the subscript i denotes i th wave gauge the present simulations contain 250 wave gauges distributed over 5 λ centered within the inner zone fig 11 the original definition of the wave reflection coefficient c r as in 29 is introduced with the assumption that the propagating and reflected waves are fully developed and no wave re reflections are travelling back in the interval of interest therefore the time and spatial intervals selection should not affect the result of the c r coefficient however considering the domain length and the simulation duration considered in the present case the re reflection may appear before the reflected waves are fully propagated and generally time varying wave amplitudes will occur during the simulation with also interface disturbance which may appear affecting the results consequently the coefficient of accumulated wave reflection is introduced in the present study to observe the acccumulated wave reflection over the simulation time this coefficient can still be used to assess the quality in time of the waves observed in the domain the coefficient of accumulated wave reflection κ r t is defined using the first harmonic amplitudes obtained in 30 31 κ r t max a i t min a i t max a i t min a i t 5 2 description of the case the selected wave condition is as shown in table 1 with the length of the domain set as in fig 11 the inlet relaxation zone is 1 5 λ and 7 λ is reserved for the inner zone where waves are propagated according to the governing equations the outlet relaxation zones vary between 0 5 λ to 6 λ such that the coefficients of accumulated wave reflection at various lengths of the outlet can be studied the vertical mesh spacing is mesh 515 waves are generated at the inlet boundary and within the inlet relaxation zone based on the nonlinear solution up to 15th order of the stream function wave theory in total 250 wave gauges are uniformly distributed over 5 λ centered within the inner zone fig 11 hence the first and last wave gauges are located 1λ away from inlet and outlet zones respectively free surface elevations read from these wave gauges are used in the evaluation of κ r t as described previously in section 5 1 it is to be expected that the simulated waves while propagating through out the computational domain may see their amplitude and phase vary due to numerical dissipation consequently the evaluation of κ r t may have some dependency on the selected distribution of the wave gauges theoretically wave gauges shall cover at least 2 λ in order to properly detect the complete envelope of the standing waves the nature of this dependency however is not studied in this paper 5 3 results of using relaxation schemes four combinations of weight functions static exponential static polynomial dynamic exponential and dynamic polynomial are studied implementing eqs 18 20 various lengths of the outlet l outlet 1 5 λ 3 λ and 6 λ are considered for each of the four weight functions in this parametric study the target function in inlet and outlet is set to be the incident waves computed with stream function wave theory the resulting maximum courant numbers co max are shown in fig 12 this number is associated with the interface disturbance because velocity spikes happen around the free surface simulations with dynamic polynomial weight fig 12d have a less varying and lower maximum co max than those with other choices for all cases with l o u t l e t 1 5 λ furthermore co max is less sensitive to the length of relaxation zones though a significant change occurs after approximately 20 t for the outlet of 0 5 λ the results of the static and dynamic exponential weight functions give varying but similar co max evolution for t 20 t beyond this time the results show that using a large outlet zone does not necessarily reduce co max overall the maximum courant number obtained using static polynomial weight is the highest the coefficients of accumulated wave reflection for different relaxation schemes and various lengths of the outlet are compared in fig 13 it appears that κ r t generally is increasing until approximately t 20 t reducing the lengths of the outlet zones from 1 5 λ to 0 5 λ increases κ r beyond 20 t the growth seems saturated with variations due to the interface disturbance using the dynamic polynomial weight with outlets of length greater than 1 5 λ gives the smallest variation of κ r in time fig 14 shows κ r t and the first harmonic amplitudes averaged over the simulation time t 15 t 20 t fig 14a clearly shows that κ r t increases significantly for outlets of length smaller than 1 λ as presented in fig 14b the first harmonic amplitudes obtained with static weights are closest to the reference value computed with the nonlinear stream function theory rienecker and fenton 1981 specifically the averaged first harmonic amplitude obtained from the cases l o u t l e t 1 5 λ using the dynamic weight and the static weight are respectively 3 5 and 2 2 less than the reference value to summarize even though the dynamic weight function gives slightly smaller wave amplitude around 1 less the wave reflection is reduced so as the interface disturbances this is the setup chosen for comparison using relaxation zones in the last section the results demonstrate strengths and weaknesses of each combination of static dynamic exponential and polynomial weights used in an explicit wave relaxation scheme 5 4 results of using stretched meshes it is difficult to find a set of common parameters to generate stretched meshes for wave propagations because the resulting damping properties may depend strongly on the selected numerical schemes the time step size and specific mesh setups and configurations monroy et al 2011 perić and abdel maksoud 2015 for the purpose of the present study mesh stretching is performed length wise in the propagation direction using a stretching ratio r x defined as 32 δ x n r x δ x n 1 where δ x represents the longitudinal length of the cell and the subscripts n and n 1 indicate the intermediate neighbours two types of stretching are considered the constant and the hyperbolic stretching 33 r x c constant stretching c 1 02 1 05 and 1 08 cos h γ n hyperbolic stretching γ 1 001 cells within the outlet zone are stretched until the length of the last three cells is larger than one wavelength δ x 1 λ the properties of stretched mesh outlets are summarized in table 4 the amount of stretching is visualized in fig 15 in particular the hyperbolic stretching yields a significantly dense distribution on one side of the outlet zone in principle the dense size is located at the start of the outlet zone and the mesh is stretched so that cells are increased in size in the propagation direction toward the end of the outlet zone table 5 shows time averaged κ r t over t 15 t 20 t at selected stretching ratios the constant ratio of r x 1 02 gives the smallest time average of κ r t hence it is selected to be representative for the stretched mesh outlet when comparing with other numerical outlets 5 5 results of using a linear damping source outlet perić and abdel maksoud 2016 showed that there is a need to appropriately define the damping coefficient to obtain an optimal wave absorption perić and abdel maksoud 2016 the authors used a froude scaling law to find a dependency of damping coefficients and showed that the linear and quadratic damping coefficients could be scaled by wave frequency and wavelength respectively a static exponential weight function was used in the outlet and the recommendation is to use a linear damping coefficient c 1 π ω 28 1 they proposed a method to estimate κ r t by analyzing the wave equation with respect to the use of the linear damping source applied to the present wave condition the algorithm predicts that the optimal linear coefficient for outlet of length 1 5 λ is c 1 7 5 and the estimated c r is 1 5 it is noted that the algorithm assumes that the wave field is damped towards calm water in the outlet zone and the weight is the static exponential function shen et al 2016 used the linear damping coefficient of c 1 20 with a second order polynomial weight function for irregular wave simulations shen and wan 2016 in the present study the linear damping coefficient with cubic polynomial weight given in equation 20 is studied with different lengths of the outlet table 6 the present results show that for the outlet of length l o u t l e t 1 5 λ using c 1 10 yields the lowest κ r t hence this result is selected to be representative for the use of linear damping source outlet it should be remarked that the weight function considered in the present study is different from previous studies perić and abdel maksoud 2016 shen and wan 2016 consequently it is able to make a difference 5 6 results of using increased viscous outlet the increased viscous outlet imposes an artificially high viscosity in the outlet zone for a smooth change of viscosity the added viscosity μ a d d is multiplied by the cubic polynomial weight function given in equation 20 three different added viscosities are considered with the values μ a d d 0 5 0 2 and 0 1 kg m 1 s 1 respectively the resulting coefficients of accumulated wave reflection at various lengths of the outlet are given in table 7 5 7 comparison and discussion the final comparison is done using several types of outlets stretched mesh linear damping source increased viscosity and relaxation schemes changing the target wave field the latter is set in turn to calm water incident waves and to the modified waves described in an earlier section the representative setup and results obtained from the parametric study for each outlet are used in the comparison the comparison is limited to the outlet length l o u t l e t 1 5 λ except for mesh stretching where the outlet is stretched as discussed in the dedicated section the time evolutions of the wave first harmonic amplitude and phase difference to the reference solution are presented in fig 16 the maximum errors with respect to the reference amplitude computed over 40 wave periods are below 7 amplitude modulations over the simulation time exists for all cases but are smaller for relaxation schemes which target the incident waves and the modified waves errors in the phase are around 3 using linear damping source and increased viscosity outlets however phase differences are smaller with the relaxation scheme outlets around 1 it appears that the phase difference is slowly approaching zero for the relaxation scheme using calm water as target fields the coefficients of accumulated wave reflection for the different outlets tested are plotted in fig 17 initially large κ r t are observed for linear damping increased viscosity and relax to calm water outlets this indicates that these outlets have an immediate effect on the initialized incident wave field after the initial disturbance κ r t increases during the whole simulation with relax to calm water outlet however κ r t obtained from simulations with linear damping and increased viscosity decreases toward a level similar to that of relax to waves outlets from t 22 t κ r t gradually increases over simulation time with mesh stretching outlet and relax to incident modified waves outlets these results show that it is important to use an appropriate target wave field in the relaxation zones when the target wave field differs from the flow entering the outlet the wave reflection becomes apparent the averages of κ r t computed over three distincts time intervals are tabulated in table 8 in the time duration t t 15 20 which is before the appearance of large interface disturbance the smallest κ r t is obtained for relax to modified waves apart from relax to calm water all approaches gives κ r t of about 2 3 over t 15 t 20 t the accumulated wave reflection coefficients in the present study are similar to the wave reflection coefficients obtained by using static exponential weight function in miquel et al 2018 perić and abdel maksoud 2018 showed that the wave reflection can be less than 1 introducing a strength factor of relaxation the results shown here confirm that all wave outlet techniques can give acceptable results if they are properly used outlet techniques using a linear damping source or an increased viscosity require a tuning step on parameters these parameters are c 1 for the linear damping source outlet and μ a d d for the increased viscosity outlet although perić and abdel maksoud 2016 provides a means to estimate optimal values of c 1 or c 2 the proper tuning of these additional parameters still represents additional work which must be performed on a case by case basis meanwhile minimizing the wave reflection with the relaxation scheme requires a parametric study on the weight function for a specific simulation condition though the relax to incident waves outlet gives the best results it should be considered to be case specific because out going waves are here expected to be the incident waves therefore this finding cannot be generalized to other cases where out going waves contain expected disturbances e g in the presence of a body and consequent radiation diffraction waves the performance of this target function may differ on the other hand the relax to calm water outlet is expected to give a performance consistent with what is shown in the present study 6 outlet study ii radiation waves 6 1 description a swaying lewis form in a two dimensional domain is introduced to study the effect of relaxation schemes and to compare different outlets a schematic view of the setup with different outlets is depicted in fig 18 in the middle of the domain the lewis form moves harmonically at amplitude a s and frequency ω the mesh is moving rigidly with the lewis form without deformation hence the initial mesh quality is preserved during the whole simulation the underwater offset of the lewis form is given as 34a x m 1 a 1 sin θ a 3 sin 3 θ 34b z m 1 a 1 cos θ a 3 cos 3 θ with a 1 h 0 1 2 m d a 3 h 0 1 2 m d 1 m d 3 h 0 1 h 0 1 2 8 h 0 1 4 σ π 4 where x z and θ π 2 π 2 are the underwater offsets and the corresponding angle journée 2001 m is a magnification factor b and d are breadth and draft respectively h 0 b 2 d and σ s b d are a ratio of half breadth to draft and an area coefficient corresponding to the block coefficient of a ship the geometric coefficients of lewis form used in this study are b 2 1 0 m d 1 0 m and σ 0 95 the offset above the free surface is generated by mirroring with respect to z 0 sway motions at different frequencies and amplitudes have been considered table 9 these amplitudes are selected such that the resulting radiation waves estimated at far field have lengths heights and steepness which are suitable for a finite volume method discretization meshes are generated using the standard openfoam meshing tool snappyhexmesh with refinements in x and z directions matching λ δ x 100 and h δ z 20 local split hex refinements near the body surface are applied up to level 4 an example of the computational meshes with l o u t l e t 2 5 λ is shown in fig 19 6 2 comparison of different outlets from the results of the previous parametric study parameters r x 1 02 c 1 20 and μ a d d 100 μ w a t e r are selected for mesh stretching linear damping source and increased viscosity outlets respectively the target functions of relaxation schemes are set to either calm water or linear potential flow the latter is available by ursell tasai s multipole expansion ursell 1949 tasai 1960 1961 with wheeler stretching to determine the dependency on the size of inner and outlet zones the relaxation schemes are firstly tested with different zone sizes the considered domain sizes are given in table 10 the domains are constructed between z d 0 75 λ 2 d with the length of outlet and inner zones scaled relatively to the expected wavelength cells near the body surface are kept at a similar size for all cases pressure force on the body surface is recorded at each time step and added mass and radiation damping are extracted by fourier transforms normalized added mass a 22 and radiation damping b 22 coefficients are computed as follows 35 a 22 a 22 ρ b 2 2 b 22 b 22 ρ ω b 2 2 where a 22 and b 22 are the added mass and radiation damping defined by 36 1 t t t t f 2 τ e i ω τ d τ a s ω 2 a 22 i ω b 22 where f 2 τ is the horizontal force and t is period an example of a 22 and b 22 for frequency ω 4 2 r a d s using mesh p100r25 i e l i n n e r 1 λ l o u t l e t 2 5 λ is shown in fig 20 it is noticeable that the radiation forces converge on average 1 6 times faster when the target function of the relaxation scheme is set to the known potential flow solution the result which is labeled long cfd domain is obtained on a mesh with the inner zone set to l i n n e r 12 5 λ this size corresponds to approximately 20 c g t where c g d ω d k is the group velocity the outlet zone for this mesh is set to l o u t l e t 5 λ the steepness k a of the radiation waves are expected to vary between 0 06 and 0 25 which are in the range of nonlinear waves hence due to this nonlinearity the computed radiation forces may deviate from the linear potential flow solution the result of long cfd domain is used here as a second reference in the comparison between the different outlets and domain sizes the results are summarized in table 11 where it can be seen that the deviations between linear potential flow solution and the results of the long cfd domain become larger as the wave steepness increases the relative deviations as shown in table 11 are computed as follows 37 rel dev 100 computed ref ref where ref is the linear potential flow solution and computed is the simulated data of e g the long cfd domain the average of these relative deviations among the three frequencies are shown in fig 21 where it can be observed that the results of the relax to calm water are approaching the results of the long cfd domain the radiation forces are not so sensitive to the size of the inner zone and the relative differences between relax to calm water and relax to potential flow are in the range of deviations of the long cfd domain with respect to different outlets a relative comparison can be made from tabulated data in table 12 the increased viscosity outlet μ a d d 100 μ w a t e r does not damp the radiation waves sufficiently and the time series of the radiation forces have modulation which increases dramatically due to reflection these are marked as in table 12 it appears that the increased viscosity outlet may not be sufficiently good to treat the out going waves without having its parameters tuned specifically for the particular case and for the wave frequency under consideration fig 21c and d shows that the relative deviations for all outlets can be improved by increasing the size of the outlet zone clearly the resulting radiation forces are more sensitive to the size of the outlet zone rather than to the size of the inner zone if the relaxation scheme is applied with a target function very close to the actual outgoing waves the size of inner and outlet zones can be reduced 7 conclusion different methodologies for wave outlets relaxation zones with various target functions damping layer mesh stretching are compared using two numerical setups all tests are run on collocated unstructured finite volume method meshes the first numerical setup tests the propagation and absorption of a regular wave and the second aims at computing radiation forces exerted on a harmonically swaying lewis form each of the outlets needs specific input parameters so dedicated parametric studies are conducted for the wave propagation case a first parametric study with periodic domain confirms that a time integration scheme of second order accuracy is necessary to maintain the wave amplitude for a long duration it also shows that introducing an additional flux limiter with the v scheme in openfoam gives more dissipation but less disturbance on the interface which is beneficial for the wave propagation simulation over long time the first test case used for comparing outlet performances consists in propagating regular waves from inlet to outlet through a 7 wavelengths long domain where only the two phase navier stokes equations apply the assessment of the wave quality is done comparing the first harmonic amplitude of the simulated waves with the fully nonlinear solution obtained from stream function wave theory and through a newly introduced coefficient of accumulated reflection the study shows that if the different outlets are tuned properly the coefficients of accumulated wave reflection obtained are similar and about 3 the use of a relaxation scheme with the explicit dynamic polynomial weight gives a robust and consistent result with sufficiently large size of outlet compared with other relaxation scheme for considered problem however it should be noted that the measured wave amplitude in the inner zone with application dynamic polynomial weight has less amplitude than the case with static exponential weight which is important for a practical case the wave reflection increases if the target fields in the outlet are very different from the solution entering the outlet with relaxation scheme variation from 8 using calm water to 1 7 using tuned solution the results obtained are also relevant in showing interface disturbance issues for simulation durations larger than 20 periods in the second numerical setup the computed radiation forces on the swaying lewis form provide an indicator for how much the computational domain can be reduced when using the different outlets similarly to what is shown in the wave propagation case the parametric study performed with various domain sizes and the outlet length confirms that a convergence towards known references both analytic solution from linear potential flow model and numerical results with large computational domain can be obtained for all outlet methodologies if the input parameters are properly tuned and the size of the outlet zone is sufficiently large with the relaxation scheme method setting the target function close to the actual outgoing waves reduces considerably both the number of steps to achieve steady state and the length of the outlet zone consequently saving simulation time credit authorship contribution statement young myung choi investigation software writing original draft young jun kim investigation software

21595,in wave structure interaction problems the minimization of wave reflection at boundaries is important for achieving accurate results and limiting the disturbances on the air water interface the present study compares a set of existing wave outlet techniques which are commonly applied in free surface simulations using a viscous flow solver these techniques are stretched mesh linear damping source increased viscosity and relaxation schemes the comparisons are performed for test conditions which include propagation of regular incident waves and damping of radiation waves keywords wave propagation wave outlet mesh stretching damping source viscosity outlet relaxation openfoam 1 introduction as computers become more and more powerful computational fluid dynamics cfd tools for solving free surface flows have gain more popularity within the naval and offshore engineering community one common application is the analysis of wave structure interactions typically ocean waves have periods in the range of 6 25 s and they travel long distances with very small energy dissipation for example waves with a wavelength of 73 15 m t 6 84 s will travel 924 km in a day while their height only diminishes by one or two percent because of friction lamb 1945 joseph 2006 for practical reasons the computational domain needs to be truncated to a manageable size the far field condition is replaced by wave outlet boundaries with specific numerical treatment in order to minimize reflection many numerical techniques have been developed to reduce wave reflection at these boundaries the simplest approach is to stretch the mesh toward the outlets which consequently yields varying performance depending on the configuration of the stretched mesh therefore it is attractive to develop more robust and efficient techniques israeli and orszag 1981 showed that damping zone or sponge layer techniques introducing a source term in governing equations can be used to absorb waves effectively israeli and orszag 1981 another technique is to use a combination of linear and quadratic vertical velocity sources in the sponge layer outlet zone park et al 1999 choi and yoon 2009 perić and abdel maksoud 2016 the numerical treatments of wave outlets are complicated by the existence of upstream propagated waves these waves are usually generated by the interaction between waves and structure in the computational domain as a consequence these scattering waves need to be absorbed at both inlet and outlet among the outlet techniques the approach of relaxation schemes appear to be able to satisfy this need mayer et al 1998 fuhrman 2004 engsig karup 2006 seng 2012 vukčević 2016 here the simulated waves are relaxed toward a given target in the sponge layer also called relaxation zone or blending zone the relaxation schemes can be further categorized into implicit and explicit relaxations the implicit relaxation scheme adds equations for the target flow field to the governing equations using a spatially distributed weight function as a result source terms appear in the momentum equations kim et al 2012 vukčević 2016 the explicit relaxation scheme performs the relaxation after solving the governing equations mayer et al 1998 fuhrman 2004 engsig karup 2006 a comparative study of relaxation schemes with dirichlet type boundary inlet outlet and active wave absorption techniques can be found in higuera et al 2013 miquel et al 2018 higuera et al 2013 reported with an active wave absorption technique wave reflection coefficients between 2 and 11 for a series of waves below 3 of wave height over wavelength ratio higuera et al 2013 the sommerfeld radiation condition which can be viewed as a perfect non reflecting boundary condition for regular linearized waves has been applied at the outlet by engquist and majda 1977 it has been shown that the sommerfeld radiation condition can be manipulated by approximation order at boundaries engquist and majda 1977 the higher order sommerfeld boundary conditions have been used by higdon 1987 givoli and neta 2003 to force waves to propagate outside the boundary in their approaches an accurate evaluation of the varying phase velocity at the boundary is essential to minimize reflection duz et al 2013 applied an approximated phase velocity with linearized sommerfeld boundary condition in irregular wave simulation on staggered grids düz et al 2013 later duz 2015 extended the sommerfeld boundary condition up to second order düz 2015 as this condition is applied on the outlet boundary surface the wave reflection obtained is relatively more sensitive to the case than when using relaxation schemes over the volumic domain other methods such as swense spectral wave explicit navier stokes equations can be applied to handle wave reflections in wave structure interaction problems with the swense method the difficulty of propagating incident waves can be avoided a comparative study with a similar solver as the one used in the present study can be found in li et al 2019 the present study aims at comparing existing outlet conditions for propagating waves in openfoam weller et al 1998 jasak 1996 rusche 2002 an open source gpl license library mainly for solving partial differential equations using finite volume method the third party toolbox known as waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 has been used for wave simulations and for the explicit wave relaxation scheme first a parametric study of the solver named foamstar is conducted in order to design a proper numerical setting for wave propagation with a cyclic lateral condition then two 2d test cases are proposed a numerical wave tank nwt with propagating incident waves and a 2d radiation problem results using the explicit relaxation scheme with different target functions mesh stretching techniques linear damping source and increased viscosity in the outlet are compared in the present study parametric studies are conducted for each outlet configuration note that non reflecting conditions based on mathematical formulations applied at the domain boundary such as the sommerfeld condition are not considered in the present study in the present study the 2d cases are only considered to minimize the complexity of computations and the number of parameters to be considered 2 numerical solver the foamstar is an in house code co developed by bureau veritas and ecole centrale de nantes in the openfoam framework for solving wave structure interaction problems it is based on the standard multi phase solver interdymfoam in the openfoam package rusche 2002 damiàn 2013 two special modules are introduced for wave structure interactions the wave generation module is taken from waves2foam and the mechanical solver is devised to solve the dynamics of rigid and flexible floating fixed bodies in waves some examples of 3d wave generation of realistic sea spectrum can be found in choi et al 2018 2 1 governing equations and solution algorithms the fluid is assumed incompressible and the incompressible navier stokes equations are applied to describe flow the governing equations are written as 1 u 0 and 2 ρ u t ρ u u t μ u u t p d g x ρ where u x and g 0 0 g t are the fluid velocity the position vector and gravitational acceleration vector respectively the dynamic pressure p d p ρ g x is introduced rusche 2002 the mixture density ρ and viscosity μ are given as 3 ρ ρ w α ρ a 1 α 4 μ μ w α μ a 1 α where the subscript w and a represent water and air respectively α is the volume of fluid vof for α 1 the control volume cv is totally wet and for α 0 it is totally dry the interface is inside the cell control volume where α 0 1 the transport equation for α is written as 5 α t α u c α u n α 1 α 0 where the third term on the left hand side is the artificial compression to keep the interface sharp u n is the fluid velocity normal to the interface and c α is the compression coefficient the solution algorithm of foamstar is shown in fig 1 in the time loop the weight used to generate and absorb waves in the relaxation zone is updated the governing equations and α transport equation are solved in the pimple loop an implementation of combined simple and piso algorithms supplied with openfoam the body motion is solved in the mechanical solver and the computational mesh is updated according to the displacement of the body surface boundaries after solving the α transport equation the relaxation scheme is applied to impose the target α field in the relaxation zones after solving the fluid velocity and pressure in the piso algorithm the fluid velocity is relaxed toward the prescribed target velocity field in the relaxation zone in the present study no turbulence model is considered when it is required however the turbulence model is solved as the last step in the algorithm details of each step in the solution algorithm are described in monroy et al 2016 2 2 finite volume discretization and definition the collocated second order finite volume discretization is applied to the whole computational domain to solve the governing equations the control volumes are arbitrary polyhedra with an example of the geometrical description of a computational cell with index p shown in fig 2 jasak 1996 the volume is v p each cell face is either a boundary face or an internal face which is connected to a neighbor cell of index n the surface area of an arbitrary face f is represented in terms of a normal vector s f where its magnitude is equal to the surface area the distance from cell p to its neighbor n is denoted as vector d f x n x p 2 3 time integration scheme a time integration scheme in openfoam can be selected among implicit euler euler crank nicolson cn and second order backward differentiation formula bdf2 the supplied multiphase solver of openfoam interdymfoam uses a special module which is called multidimensional universal limiter with explicit solution mules to solve the α transport equation mules employs a method based on predictor and corrector steps to ensure α boundedness as an example when the euler scheme is selected the predictor step is as follows 6 v p n 1 α p v p n α p n δ t f n f α f b 0 where the superscripts and n denote the predictor and time iteration respectively the time step between two successive time iterations is δ t the equation flux is f α f b where the superscript b denotes that the flux is bounded to ensure the boundedness f α f b computed by using a 1st order upwind scheme is used in the predictor step the corrector step introduces a flux limiter λ f such that the correction for the high order flux f α f u does not cause unboundedness the correction is as follows 7 v p n 1 α p n 1 v p n 1 α p δ t f λ f f α f u f α f b 0 the sum of equations 6 and 7 produces the original discretized α transport equation in summary the crank nicolson scheme in mules algorithm is a variation from the classical crank nicolson scheme due to the use of predictor and corrector steps the existence of a flux limiter λ f introduced to maximize the α transportation while keeping the α boundness the mules algorithm with the application of crank nicolson scheme is given in appendix a and a detailed description of the algorithm including mules can be found in damiàn 2013 for the crank nicolson time integration scheme the predictor and the corrector steps are formulated to account for the weight factor γ which exists in the classical formulation of the crank nicolson for γ 0 the scheme is equivalent to the explicit euler integration scheme and for γ 1 the resulting scheme is an implicit euler time integration scheme the classical formulation of the cn scheme requires γ 1 2 in openfoam the implementation allows γ to be selectable within a range of γ 1 2 1 to facilitate this selection an off center coefficient hereafter called the crank nicolson off center coefficient c c n is used instead of γ the relation is 8 c c n 1 γ γ c c n 0 1 where c c n 0 represents the implicit euler integration and c c n 1 represents the classical crank nicolson scheme it is commonly recommended to use c c n 0 9 as a compromise between stability and accuracy greenshields 2019 2 4 remarks on the v scheme in openfoam the treatment of the convection term in the navier stokes equations affects the numerical dissipation and stability one of the commonly used schemes is the second order upwinding scheme in openfoam it is selectable either as linearupwind or linearupwindv the latter is refered to as the v scheme differences exist when the scheme is applied to a vector field the v scheme contains an additional limiter which is applied to all components of the vector field greenshields 2019 the numerical details concerning linearupwind and linearupwindv are outlined in the following the finite volume discretization of the convection term leads 9 v p u f d v f n s f u f f f f n φ f f f where f is a vector field u is the transport velocity f f is the interpolated vector at the face center x f the face vector s f has the magnitude of the face area and the flux is φ f s f u f the index f represents the face index between cell p and n the computation of f f using the second order upwinding scheme is as follows 10 f f f upwind δ f corr where f upwind is determined from the cell value in the upwinding direction using the sign of the flux 11 f upwind f p φ f 0 f n φ f 0 the correction term δ f corr differs when selecting linearupwind or linearupwindv the linearupwind scheme proceeds as follows 12 δ f corr δ f o corr where 13 δ f o corr x f x p f p φ f 0 x f x n f n φ f 0 the gradients f p and f n are the cell averaged gradients computed separately by other means the v version of this scheme i e linearupwindv contains an additional limiter 14 δ f corr λ f limiter δ f o corr where 15 λ f limiter min 1 δ f o corr δ f ˆ c o r r δ f o corr 2 with 16 δ f ˆ c o r r 1 w f n f p φ f 0 w f p f n φ f 0 where w is the distance weight corresponding to a central difference linear interpolation from cell centered p and n to the shared face f this linear interpolation is written as 17 f f w f p 1 w f n the effect of λ f limiter is to limit f f of eq 10 to be at most the same as eq 17 3 parametric study on wave propagation in a periodic domain the parametric study is conducted with foamstar to find a proper numerical setting for propagation of a regular wave with properties given in table 1 the simulations are performed in a two dimensional domain with cyclic lateral boundary conditions the free surface and the wave kinematics are initialized at the initial time from a fully nonlinear stream function wave solution ducrozet et al 2019 the schematic view of the problem the initialized phase fraction field vof and the computational mesh are shown in fig 3 the computational domain covers one wavelength l λ and the height is taken to be two times the water depth 2 h h 0 6 m the computational meshes use a uniform cell distribution in the wave propagation direction with characteristic cell size of δ x in the vertical direction the cell distribution is specified in three zones the air the free surface and the underwater zone unless otherwise indicated the free surface zone is limited to z h h with a uniform cell distribution of size δ z in the vertical direction the air zone is above the free surface zone z h h and below is the underwater zone z h h cells outside the free surface zone are stretched perpendicularly from the free surface the level of stretching is specified in term of a ratio between of δ z of the first and the last cells 3 1 effect of time scheme simulations were performed with crank nicolson off center coefficient c c n 0 euler implicit 0 5 and 0 95 in order to observe the effect of the time integration scheme the time step is kept constant at δ t t 400 and mesh parameters are fixed to δ x λ 100 δ z h 20 and stretching ratio 5 fig 4 compares the simulated wave elevations at the center of the domain with those predicted by the stream function wave theory because the stream function wave theory provides a fully nonlinear solution of the potential flow waves it is used here as a reference for the simulated results noticeably the simulated wave amplitudes decrease gradually over time the amount of the amplitude decays are better evaluated by applying the moving window fast fourier transform mwfft to time series allen 1977 the results are shown in fig 5 in terms of the first harmonics and the corresponding phases the reference value obtained from the stream function wave theory is denoted as ref in fig 5 the phase differences between the cfd results and the stream function solution are significantly larger for the low order time integration scheme while the numerical errors in these simulations can be improved further through a refinement study the present results show that for the same mesh parameters and same time step sizes one may benefit significantly from using a highly accurate time integration scheme for the rest of the present study the time integration scheme is set to crank nicolson with c c n 0 95 3 2 mesh and time step convergence the computational meshes and time steps are tested to obtain the formal convergence order of the discretization schemes mesh parameters are given in table 2 in terms of lateral spacing δ x vertical spacing in the free surface zone δ z and time step δ t the mesh stretching ratio in the air zone and in the underwater zone is kept constant at 5 representative courant

wave δ x ν re δ z w wave δ z ν and u wave and v wave are the maximum horizontal and vertical fluid velocities given by stream function wave theory respectively the kinematic viscosity of water is denoted by ν two series of tests are conducted the first series varies the cell size and consequently the cell reynolds numbers while the courant number is fixed by varying accordingly the time steps in the second series the cell reynolds numbers are fixed and the courant numbers are varied fig 6 shows snapshots of velocity fields at time instants t 20 t and t 40 t the results using v scheme remains smooth for at least 40 t between times 20 t and 40 t the distribution of the velocity field remains mostly unchanged with most visible differences in phases and the position of the crests without the v scheme the velocity field remains smooth for a shorter duration whereafter a large spurious velocity appears in the vicinity of the free surface consequently the free surface is very erroneous without using the v scheme for a long simulation duration amplitudes of the first harmonic of wave elevations at the center of the domain obtained over time for different courant numbers and cell reynolds numbers are compared in fig 7 the results show that the additional limiter introduced in the v scheme eq 14 leads to larger numerical dissipation than in the case without applying the v scheme without using the v scheme the high disturbance of the interface leads to a stong decrease of the wave amplitude for long simulations before the large interface disturbance errors of the first harmonics at 10 t and 20 t are shown in table 3 for mesh100 dt400 with and without the v scheme this mesh configuration table 2 corresponds to mesh parameters δ x λ 100 δ z h 20 and δ t t 400 the representative courant number is 0 171 and cell reynolds number is 2209 this shows that for short simulations the v scheme can lead to smaller wave amplitude than the case without v scheme the present results show that using the v scheme is beneficial for a long simulation duration by reducing the interface disturbance applying v scheme gives a slightly reduced wave amplitude it is thought to be manageable and insignificant for a long simulation time convergence analyses are performed for the first harmonics obtained during the first ten wave periods the orders of convergence are computed according to the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2014 which applies a least square method to get the order of convergence p and the associated uncertainty estimation eça and hoekstra 2014 the results are shown in fig 8 the orders of convergence p for varying courant and cell reynolds numbers and using the v scheme are estimated to be 1 14 and 1 60 respectively without using the v scheme the estimated convergence order increases to 1 93 and 1 69 similar results are obtained by larsen et al 2019 where it is stated that the interface disturbance can appear with the use of higher order schemes to capture a sharp interface between liquid and gas they also showed that the choice of time integration and convection schemes affect the interface shape and a combination of more or less diffusive schemes can improve the wave quality however the choice of more or less diffusive schemes depends on the case therefore the upwind scheme which is reported as giving gradually decreasing amplitude but consistent results is selected in the present study further simulations are performed without the v scheme while the results are evaluated with more emphasis on data up to 20 t 3 3 mesh spacing in vertical direction in deep water the velocity field of propagating waves has an hyperbolic profile in the vertical direction under the free surface according to the potential flow wave theory the maximum velocity occurs at the free surface and it decays rapidly far away from the free surface therefore in the vertical direction meshes are generated using 3 zones 1 underwater zone z h h 2 free surface zone z h h and 3 air zone z h h the cell resolution is configured to be relatively dense inside and near the free surface zone and it is coarsened gradually towards the bottom to study the effects of this coarsening simulations are performed on several meshes with different stretching ratios a naming scheme is chosen mesh ijk where i j and k represents the stretching ratio of zones underwater free surface and air respectively here the stretching ratio is defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum cell height fig 9 illustrates mesh 212 mesh 515 and mesh 818 the cells are uniformly distributed in the horizontal direction with δ x λ 100 and within the free surface zone with δ z h 20 as seen in fig 10 the first harmonic amplitudes and the phases for all three meshes are almost identical therefore the stretching ratio mesh 515 which is applied throughout this study is thought to be sufficient for the wave condition under consideration 4 inlet outlet condition 4 1 relaxation zones the wave generation and absorption method of foamstar is based on an explicit scheme which relaxes the computed solution towards a given target flow field mayer et al 1998 fuhrman 2004 engsig karup 2006 jacobsen et al 2012 seng 2012 the scheme requires a weight function which varies between 0 and 1 in the relaxation zones the relaxation is performed as follows 18 χ 1 w χ w χ t a r g e t where χ is the computed flow field i e either the vof field or the velocity field w is the weight function and χ t a r g e t is the given target flow field it shall be noted that there exists an implicit relaxation scheme which performs the relaxation directly in the governing equations vukčević 2016 kim et al 2012 this study does not cover this implicit approach due to its unavailablity in foamstar hence only the explicit relaxation scheme is considered the choice of the weight function w is important to minimize wave reflections a discussion on smoothness criteria for w was originally presented in engsig karup 2006 two common choices can be identified a polynomial weight function mayer et al 1998 engsig karup 2006 and an exponential weight function mayer et al 1998 engsig karup 2006 jacobsen et al 2012 seng 2012 seng 2012 introduces further a dynamic weight function w d defined as follows seng 2012 19 w d 1 1 w u u t a r g e t δ t δ x where w is the original static weight and δ x is the characteristic cell size seng 2012 the dynamic weight w d is recomputed at every time step and is changed locally and adaptively based on the local differences between computed and target velocity the relaxation proceeds as in eq 18 using w d instead of w the static weight function w remains either a polynomial or an exponential function 20 w ξ e ξ 3 5 1 e 1 exponential weight 2 ξ 3 3 ξ 2 polynomial weight where ξ 0 1 is a normalized coordinate in the relaxation zones the present study evaluates the explicit relaxation scheme using either exponential or polynomial weight functions in combination with the static or the dynamic weight formulation in addition the evaluation covers various sizes of the relaxation zone which is considered as an important parameter to obtain an optimal compromise between the computational cost and the amount of the reflected waves miquel et al 2018 reported 3 9 of wave reflection for regular waves using an explicit relaxation scheme with static exponential function miquel et al 2018 perić and abdel maksoud 2018 showed the wave reflection can be less than 1 for l o u t l e t 2 λ when a strength of relaxation factor is optimized and applied to the exponential weight function perić and abdel maksoud 2018 the target function is another important parameter when a floating or a fixed body exists within the incident wave field radiation diffraction waves are generated due to interactions of the wave field with the body in numerical computations using the relaxation schemes the target flow field is usually set to be either the incident wave field or calm water because the radiation diffraction waves are unknown alternatively the target wave field within the relaxation zones can be estimated from the observed wave elevations and kinematics in front of the outlet zone when the wave amplitude decreases the wavenumber changes due to a nonlinear effect which is proportional to o k 1 a 3 in the third order theory for slightly smaller waves the change of wavenumber is almost negligible therefore it is assumed that the propagating waves do not change their wave frequency and wave number the amplitudes and phases of the first harmonic of the observed waves are calculated using the fourier transform for corresponding ω and k 1 as follows 21 a 2 t cos δ φ t t t ζ x 0 τ cos k 1 x x 0 ω τ d τ and 22 tan δ φ t t t ζ x 0 τ sin k 1 x x 0 ω τ d τ t t t ζ x 0 τ cos k 1 x x 0 ω τ d τ where a is the amplitude of the first harmonic of the modified waves δ φ is the phase difference between the incident and the modified waves and ζ x 0 τ is the measured wave elevation in front of outlet zone at x 0 the modal wavenumber k 1 is obtained from nonlinear stream function theory rienecker and fenton 1981 wave elevations and fluid velocities of the modified waves are then given by 23 ζ a a a 0 2 n 1 n a a n cos k n x ω t δ φ 24 u 0 ψ 0 t 25 ψ a a b 0 z n 1 n b b n sin h k n z h cos h k n h cos k n x ω t δ φ where n a and n b are the numbers of truncated fourier modes of stream function waves and a n and b n are the amplitudes of the fourier mode for wave elevation and for stream function respectively k n are the wavenumber details can be found in ducrozet et al 2019 rienecker and fenton 1981 4 2 sponge layer method alternatively the addition of linear and quadratic damping source terms to the momentum equations can be used to damp waves park et al 1999 perić and abdel maksoud 2016 the approach is known as a sponge layer method and was originally proposed by israeli and orszag 1981 the momentum equations with the source terms are 26 ρ u t ρ u u t μ u u t p d g x ρ s where μ is a dynamic viscosity p d p ρ g x is the dynamic pressure the source terms s include both the linear and quadratic damping sources and are formulated to be applied to the vertical velocity components as follows 27 s 0 0 ρ c 1 c 2 u z w u z t where w is the weight function c 1 and c 2 are the linear and quadratic damping coefficients respectively through a parametric study perić and abdel maksoud 2016 reported wave reflection coefficients of less than 1 thanks to an optimal choice of alternatively c 1 or c 2 perić and abdel maksoud 2016 they proposed a practical recommendation for the simulation with exponential weight function and the condition l o u t l e t 2 λ in the present study only the linear damping is considered with polynomial weight function hence c 2 is set to zero 4 3 other alternatives two other alternatives for wave damping are considered in this study due to their simplicity the mesh stretching and the increased viscosity mesh stretching introduces the desired wave damping and also additional dispersive effects the increased viscosity is a method where the viscosity is increased artificially in the outlet zone wave damping occurs due to the increased energy loss caused by the artificial viscosity the momentum equation with increased viscosity in the outlet is written as 28 ρ u t ρ u u t μ μ a d d u u t p d g x ρ where μ a d d is the increased viscosity in the outlet zone 5 outlet study i numerical wave tank nwt the aim is to assess the quality of waves in a numerical wave tank as a prerequisite to perform a successful simulation involving wave structure interactions consequently the size of the domain is chosen to be representative of typical cases and the quality of the simulated waves is assessed in time 5 1 reflection coefficients waves simulated in numerical wave tanks are affected by the numerical dissipation the free surface instabilities and the performance of the wave absorption method at the outlet the latter is often characterised through the use of a wave reflection coefficient which is defined as the ratio of amplitudes of propagating and reflecting waves at steady state for small wave amplitudes the wave reflection coefficient is defined as in ursell et al 1960 29 c r a max a min a max a min where a max and a min are the maxima and minima of the wave envelope amplitude this definition works well for linear waves with no reflection the amplitude modulation of the linear wave goes to zero hence a max a min and the reflection coefficient becomes c r 0 when the linear waves are fully reflected the amplitude envelope has a min 0 therefore the reflection coefficient becomes c r 1 however wave conditions used in the present study are nonlinear and the above definition is no longer sufficient perić and abdel maksoud 2016 used the same definition as shown in eq 29 but the amplitude is replaced by the wave height perić and abdel maksoud 2016 the reflection coefficient eq 29 can be computed based on the first order amplitudes ignoring the higher harmonics i e by means of the fast fourier transform fft this definition was used in goda and suzuki 1976 chew et al 2015 carmigniani and violeau 2018 to quantify the reflection coefficient when the wave field is at quasi steady state in the present study the reflection coefficient is evaluated with first harmonic amplitude as in associated researches goda and suzuki 1976 chew et al 2015 carmigniani and violeau 2018 but the fft is performed within a moving window in time to capture the transient nature of the present simulations given data within a window of one period the time varying first harmonics at i th wave gauge is computed as 30 a i ω t 2 t t t t ζ x i t cos k x i ω τ d τ where the subscript i denotes i th wave gauge the present simulations contain 250 wave gauges distributed over 5 λ centered within the inner zone fig 11 the original definition of the wave reflection coefficient c r as in 29 is introduced with the assumption that the propagating and reflected waves are fully developed and no wave re reflections are travelling back in the interval of interest therefore the time and spatial intervals selection should not affect the result of the c r coefficient however considering the domain length and the simulation duration considered in the present case the re reflection may appear before the reflected waves are fully propagated and generally time varying wave amplitudes will occur during the simulation with also interface disturbance which may appear affecting the results consequently the coefficient of accumulated wave reflection is introduced in the present study to observe the acccumulated wave reflection over the simulation time this coefficient can still be used to assess the quality in time of the waves observed in the domain the coefficient of accumulated wave reflection κ r t is defined using the first harmonic amplitudes obtained in 30 31 κ r t max a i t min a i t max a i t min a i t 5 2 description of the case the selected wave condition is as shown in table 1 with the length of the domain set as in fig 11 the inlet relaxation zone is 1 5 λ and 7 λ is reserved for the inner zone where waves are propagated according to the governing equations the outlet relaxation zones vary between 0 5 λ to 6 λ such that the coefficients of accumulated wave reflection at various lengths of the outlet can be studied the vertical mesh spacing is mesh 515 waves are generated at the inlet boundary and within the inlet relaxation zone based on the nonlinear solution up to 15th order of the stream function wave theory in total 250 wave gauges are uniformly distributed over 5 λ centered within the inner zone fig 11 hence the first and last wave gauges are located 1λ away from inlet and outlet zones respectively free surface elevations read from these wave gauges are used in the evaluation of κ r t as described previously in section 5 1 it is to be expected that the simulated waves while propagating through out the computational domain may see their amplitude and phase vary due to numerical dissipation consequently the evaluation of κ r t may have some dependency on the selected distribution of the wave gauges theoretically wave gauges shall cover at least 2 λ in order to properly detect the complete envelope of the standing waves the nature of this dependency however is not studied in this paper 5 3 results of using relaxation schemes four combinations of weight functions static exponential static polynomial dynamic exponential and dynamic polynomial are studied implementing eqs 18 20 various lengths of the outlet l outlet 1 5 λ 3 λ and 6 λ are considered for each of the four weight functions in this parametric study the target function in inlet and outlet is set to be the incident waves computed with stream function wave theory the resulting maximum courant numbers co max are shown in fig 12 this number is associated with the interface disturbance because velocity spikes happen around the free surface simulations with dynamic polynomial weight fig 12d have a less varying and lower maximum co max than those with other choices for all cases with l o u t l e t 1 5 λ furthermore co max is less sensitive to the length of relaxation zones though a significant change occurs after approximately 20 t for the outlet of 0 5 λ the results of the static and dynamic exponential weight functions give varying but similar co max evolution for t 20 t beyond this time the results show that using a large outlet zone does not necessarily reduce co max overall the maximum courant number obtained using static polynomial weight is the highest the coefficients of accumulated wave reflection for different relaxation schemes and various lengths of the outlet are compared in fig 13 it appears that κ r t generally is increasing until approximately t 20 t reducing the lengths of the outlet zones from 1 5 λ to 0 5 λ increases κ r beyond 20 t the growth seems saturated with variations due to the interface disturbance using the dynamic polynomial weight with outlets of length greater than 1 5 λ gives the smallest variation of κ r in time fig 14 shows κ r t and the first harmonic amplitudes averaged over the simulation time t 15 t 20 t fig 14a clearly shows that κ r t increases significantly for outlets of length smaller than 1 λ as presented in fig 14b the first harmonic amplitudes obtained with static weights are closest to the reference value computed with the nonlinear stream function theory rienecker and fenton 1981 specifically the averaged first harmonic amplitude obtained from the cases l o u t l e t 1 5 λ using the dynamic weight and the static weight are respectively 3 5 and 2 2 less than the reference value to summarize even though the dynamic weight function gives slightly smaller wave amplitude around 1 less the wave reflection is reduced so as the interface disturbances this is the setup chosen for comparison using relaxation zones in the last section the results demonstrate strengths and weaknesses of each combination of static dynamic exponential and polynomial weights used in an explicit wave relaxation scheme 5 4 results of using stretched meshes it is difficult to find a set of common parameters to generate stretched meshes for wave propagations because the resulting damping properties may depend strongly on the selected numerical schemes the time step size and specific mesh setups and configurations monroy et al 2011 perić and abdel maksoud 2015 for the purpose of the present study mesh stretching is performed length wise in the propagation direction using a stretching ratio r x defined as 32 δ x n r x δ x n 1 where δ x represents the longitudinal length of the cell and the subscripts n and n 1 indicate the intermediate neighbours two types of stretching are considered the constant and the hyperbolic stretching 33 r x c constant stretching c 1 02 1 05 and 1 08 cos h γ n hyperbolic stretching γ 1 001 cells within the outlet zone are stretched until the length of the last three cells is larger than one wavelength δ x 1 λ the properties of stretched mesh outlets are summarized in table 4 the amount of stretching is visualized in fig 15 in particular the hyperbolic stretching yields a significantly dense distribution on one side of the outlet zone in principle the dense size is located at the start of the outlet zone and the mesh is stretched so that cells are increased in size in the propagation direction toward the end of the outlet zone table 5 shows time averaged κ r t over t 15 t 20 t at selected stretching ratios the constant ratio of r x 1 02 gives the smallest time average of κ r t hence it is selected to be representative for the stretched mesh outlet when comparing with other numerical outlets 5 5 results of using a linear damping source outlet perić and abdel maksoud 2016 showed that there is a need to appropriately define the damping coefficient to obtain an optimal wave absorption perić and abdel maksoud 2016 the authors used a froude scaling law to find a dependency of damping coefficients and showed that the linear and quadratic damping coefficients could be scaled by wave frequency and wavelength respectively a static exponential weight function was used in the outlet and the recommendation is to use a linear damping coefficient c 1 π ω 28 1 they proposed a method to estimate κ r t by analyzing the wave equation with respect to the use of the linear damping source applied to the present wave condition the algorithm predicts that the optimal linear coefficient for outlet of length 1 5 λ is c 1 7 5 and the estimated c r is 1 5 it is noted that the algorithm assumes that the wave field is damped towards calm water in the outlet zone and the weight is the static exponential function shen et al 2016 used the linear damping coefficient of c 1 20 with a second order polynomial weight function for irregular wave simulations shen and wan 2016 in the present study the linear damping coefficient with cubic polynomial weight given in equation 20 is studied with different lengths of the outlet table 6 the present results show that for the outlet of length l o u t l e t 1 5 λ using c 1 10 yields the lowest κ r t hence this result is selected to be representative for the use of linear damping source outlet it should be remarked that the weight function considered in the present study is different from previous studies perić and abdel maksoud 2016 shen and wan 2016 consequently it is able to make a difference 5 6 results of using increased viscous outlet the increased viscous outlet imposes an artificially high viscosity in the outlet zone for a smooth change of viscosity the added viscosity μ a d d is multiplied by the cubic polynomial weight function given in equation 20 three different added viscosities are considered with the values μ a d d 0 5 0 2 and 0 1 kg m 1 s 1 respectively the resulting coefficients of accumulated wave reflection at various lengths of the outlet are given in table 7 5 7 comparison and discussion the final comparison is done using several types of outlets stretched mesh linear damping source increased viscosity and relaxation schemes changing the target wave field the latter is set in turn to calm water incident waves and to the modified waves described in an earlier section the representative setup and results obtained from the parametric study for each outlet are used in the comparison the comparison is limited to the outlet length l o u t l e t 1 5 λ except for mesh stretching where the outlet is stretched as discussed in the dedicated section the time evolutions of the wave first harmonic amplitude and phase difference to the reference solution are presented in fig 16 the maximum errors with respect to the reference amplitude computed over 40 wave periods are below 7 amplitude modulations over the simulation time exists for all cases but are smaller for relaxation schemes which target the incident waves and the modified waves errors in the phase are around 3 using linear damping source and increased viscosity outlets however phase differences are smaller with the relaxation scheme outlets around 1 it appears that the phase difference is slowly approaching zero for the relaxation scheme using calm water as target fields the coefficients of accumulated wave reflection for the different outlets tested are plotted in fig 17 initially large κ r t are observed for linear damping increased viscosity and relax to calm water outlets this indicates that these outlets have an immediate effect on the initialized incident wave field after the initial disturbance κ r t increases during the whole simulation with relax to calm water outlet however κ r t obtained from simulations with linear damping and increased viscosity decreases toward a level similar to that of relax to waves outlets from t 22 t κ r t gradually increases over simulation time with mesh stretching outlet and relax to incident modified waves outlets these results show that it is important to use an appropriate target wave field in the relaxation zones when the target wave field differs from the flow entering the outlet the wave reflection becomes apparent the averages of κ r t computed over three distincts time intervals are tabulated in table 8 in the time duration t t 15 20 which is before the appearance of large interface disturbance the smallest κ r t is obtained for relax to modified waves apart from relax to calm water all approaches gives κ r t of about 2 3 over t 15 t 20 t the accumulated wave reflection coefficients in the present study are similar to the wave reflection coefficients obtained by using static exponential weight function in miquel et al 2018 perić and abdel maksoud 2018 showed that the wave reflection can be less than 1 introducing a strength factor of relaxation the results shown here confirm that all wave outlet techniques can give acceptable results if they are properly used outlet techniques using a linear damping source or an increased viscosity require a tuning step on parameters these parameters are c 1 for the linear damping source outlet and μ a d d for the increased viscosity outlet although perić and abdel maksoud 2016 provides a means to estimate optimal values of c 1 or c 2 the proper tuning of these additional parameters still represents additional work which must be performed on a case by case basis meanwhile minimizing the wave reflection with the relaxation scheme requires a parametric study on the weight function for a specific simulation condition though the relax to incident waves outlet gives the best results it should be considered to be case specific because out going waves are here expected to be the incident waves therefore this finding cannot be generalized to other cases where out going waves contain expected disturbances e g in the presence of a body and consequent radiation diffraction waves the performance of this target function may differ on the other hand the relax to calm water outlet is expected to give a performance consistent with what is shown in the present study 6 outlet study ii radiation waves 6 1 description a swaying lewis form in a two dimensional domain is introduced to study the effect of relaxation schemes and to compare different outlets a schematic view of the setup with different outlets is depicted in fig 18 in the middle of the domain the lewis form moves harmonically at amplitude a s and frequency ω the mesh is moving rigidly with the lewis form without deformation hence the initial mesh quality is preserved during the whole simulation the underwater offset of the lewis form is given as 34a x m 1 a 1 sin θ a 3 sin 3 θ 34b z m 1 a 1 cos θ a 3 cos 3 θ with a 1 h 0 1 2 m d a 3 h 0 1 2 m d 1 m d 3 h 0 1 h 0 1 2 8 h 0 1 4 σ π 4 where x z and θ π 2 π 2 are the underwater offsets and the corresponding angle journée 2001 m is a magnification factor b and d are breadth and draft respectively h 0 b 2 d and σ s b d are a ratio of half breadth to draft and an area coefficient corresponding to the block coefficient of a ship the geometric coefficients of lewis form used in this study are b 2 1 0 m d 1 0 m and σ 0 95 the offset above the free surface is generated by mirroring with respect to z 0 sway motions at different frequencies and amplitudes have been considered table 9 these amplitudes are selected such that the resulting radiation waves estimated at far field have lengths heights and steepness which are suitable for a finite volume method discretization meshes are generated using the standard openfoam meshing tool snappyhexmesh with refinements in x and z directions matching λ δ x 100 and h δ z 20 local split hex refinements near the body surface are applied up to level 4 an example of the computational meshes with l o u t l e t 2 5 λ is shown in fig 19 6 2 comparison of different outlets from the results of the previous parametric study parameters r x 1 02 c 1 20 and μ a d d 100 μ w a t e r are selected for mesh stretching linear damping source and increased viscosity outlets respectively the target functions of relaxation schemes are set to either calm water or linear potential flow the latter is available by ursell tasai s multipole expansion ursell 1949 tasai 1960 1961 with wheeler stretching to determine the dependency on the size of inner and outlet zones the relaxation schemes are firstly tested with different zone sizes the considered domain sizes are given in table 10 the domains are constructed between z d 0 75 λ 2 d with the length of outlet and inner zones scaled relatively to the expected wavelength cells near the body surface are kept at a similar size for all cases pressure force on the body surface is recorded at each time step and added mass and radiation damping are extracted by fourier transforms normalized added mass a 22 and radiation damping b 22 coefficients are computed as follows 35 a 22 a 22 ρ b 2 2 b 22 b 22 ρ ω b 2 2 where a 22 and b 22 are the added mass and radiation damping defined by 36 1 t t t t f 2 τ e i ω τ d τ a s ω 2 a 22 i ω b 22 where f 2 τ is the horizontal force and t is period an example of a 22 and b 22 for frequency ω 4 2 r a d s using mesh p100r25 i e l i n n e r 1 λ l o u t l e t 2 5 λ is shown in fig 20 it is noticeable that the radiation forces converge on average 1 6 times faster when the target function of the relaxation scheme is set to the known potential flow solution the result which is labeled long cfd domain is obtained on a mesh with the inner zone set to l i n n e r 12 5 λ this size corresponds to approximately 20 c g t where c g d ω d k is the group velocity the outlet zone for this mesh is set to l o u t l e t 5 λ the steepness k a of the radiation waves are expected to vary between 0 06 and 0 25 which are in the range of nonlinear waves hence due to this nonlinearity the computed radiation forces may deviate from the linear potential flow solution the result of long cfd domain is used here as a second reference in the comparison between the different outlets and domain sizes the results are summarized in table 11 where it can be seen that the deviations between linear potential flow solution and the results of the long cfd domain become larger as the wave steepness increases the relative deviations as shown in table 11 are computed as follows 37 rel dev 100 computed ref ref where ref is the linear potential flow solution and computed is the simulated data of e g the long cfd domain the average of these relative deviations among the three frequencies are shown in fig 21 where it can be observed that the results of the relax to calm water are approaching the results of the long cfd domain the radiation forces are not so sensitive to the size of the inner zone and the relative differences between relax to calm water and relax to potential flow are in the range of deviations of the long cfd domain with respect to different outlets a relative comparison can be made from tabulated data in table 12 the increased viscosity outlet μ a d d 100 μ w a t e r does not damp the radiation waves sufficiently and the time series of the radiation forces have modulation which increases dramatically due to reflection these are marked as in table 12 it appears that the increased viscosity outlet may not be sufficiently good to treat the out going waves without having its parameters tuned specifically for the particular case and for the wave frequency under consideration fig 21c and d shows that the relative deviations for all outlets can be improved by increasing the size of the outlet zone clearly the resulting radiation forces are more sensitive to the size of the outlet zone rather than to the size of the inner zone if the relaxation scheme is applied with a target function very close to the actual outgoing waves the size of inner and outlet zones can be reduced 7 conclusion different methodologies for wave outlets relaxation zones with various target functions damping layer mesh stretching are compared using two numerical setups all tests are run on collocated unstructured finite volume method meshes the first numerical setup tests the propagation and absorption of a regular wave and the second aims at computing radiation forces exerted on a harmonically swaying lewis form each of the outlets needs specific input parameters so dedicated parametric studies are conducted for the wave propagation case a first parametric study with periodic domain confirms that a time integration scheme of second order accuracy is necessary to maintain the wave amplitude for a long duration it also shows that introducing an additional flux limiter with the v scheme in openfoam gives more dissipation but less disturbance on the interface which is beneficial for the wave propagation simulation over long time the first test case used for comparing outlet performances consists in propagating regular waves from inlet to outlet through a 7 wavelengths long domain where only the two phase navier stokes equations apply the assessment of the wave quality is done comparing the first harmonic amplitude of the simulated waves with the fully nonlinear solution obtained from stream function wave theory and through a newly introduced coefficient of accumulated reflection the study shows that if the different outlets are tuned properly the coefficients of accumulated wave reflection obtained are similar and about 3 the use of a relaxation scheme with the explicit dynamic polynomial weight gives a robust and consistent result with sufficiently large size of outlet compared with other relaxation scheme for considered problem however it should be noted that the measured wave amplitude in the inner zone with application dynamic polynomial weight has less amplitude than the case with static exponential weight which is important for a practical case the wave reflection increases if the target fields in the outlet are very different from the solution entering the outlet with relaxation scheme variation from 8 using calm water to 1 7 using tuned solution the results obtained are also relevant in showing interface disturbance issues for simulation durations larger than 20 periods in the second numerical setup the computed radiation forces on the swaying lewis form provide an indicator for how much the computational domain can be reduced when using the different outlets similarly to what is shown in the wave propagation case the parametric study performed with various domain sizes and the outlet length confirms that a convergence towards known references both analytic solution from linear potential flow model and numerical results with large computational domain can be obtained for all outlet methodologies if the input parameters are properly tuned and the size of the outlet zone is sufficiently large with the relaxation scheme method setting the target function close to the actual outgoing waves reduces considerably both the number of steps to achieve steady state and the length of the outlet zone consequently saving simulation time credit authorship contribution statement young myung choi investigation software writing original draft young jun kim investigation software

liquid flow visualization hydrodynamics 1 introduction drag reduction for surface ships is an important and continuous research topic efforts to reduce drag by optimizing the hull have been ongoing since ships have been in existence a number of studies dawson 1977 dejhalla et al 2001 jensen 1989 to reduce the pressure component of resistance through the potential flow theory have been well applied to the hull design however achievement in reducing the friction component of resistance is still not well applied in engineering marc perlin perlin et al 2016 reviewed a number of active and passive approaches to reduce the frictional resistance for boundary layer flow including engineered surface methods riblets large eddy breakup devices and superhydrophobic surfaces additive methods polymer and gas injection and morphological alteration methods air bubbles kumagai et al 2015 air layers and partial cavities however among these methods the most robust and promising method to be successfully applied to ships might be partial cavity drag reduction pcdr which was first developed by butuzov 1966 using an initial theoretical model for air cavities under a plate the physical essence of this drag reduction method lies in the formation of air layer in the boundary near surface which leads to changes in boundary layer states e g density viscosity and velocity distribution ceccio 2010 ferrante and elghobashi 2004 murai 2014 murai et al 2008 qin et al 2017 and thus greatly reduces the wall shear stress many previous studies amromin 2012 ceccio 2010 lay et al 2010 zverkhovskyi 2014 have found that a complete cavity covering the surface of an object can almost reduce the frictional resistance of this part to zero ventilated partial cavity ship also known as air cavity ship acs is generally suitable for flat bottom ship in which cavities are formed in a chamber with a front step generally the pcdr method consists of a back facing step cavitator mäkiharju et al 2013 qin et al 2019 zverkhovskyi 2014 creating a physical recess for the cavity some of which contains a beach step mäkiharju et al 2013 or cavity locker amromin et al 2011 used to change cavity s closure state considering the universality of the pcdr method the research in this study does not take the addition of a cavity locker into consideration although there is no precise physical definition of the arrangement of height of back facing step the difference between partial cavity and air layer is mainly due to the arrangement of ventilation mode where the mode of hole ventilation is adopted by the latter in the pioneering work by callenaere et al 2001 natural partial cavitation was analyzed with a series of step height 0 14 mm at a fixed incoming velocity and it is found that the height of step is one of the variables that has influence on the stability of partial cavity but not a parameter to distinguish air layer or partial cavity in order to gain a fundamental physical understanding of ventilated cavity flow in the boundary layer a variety of potential flow studies and water tunnel experiments were performed on flat plate cavity flow similar to the ventilated supercavitation flow franc and michel 2006 jiang et al 2019 2018 karn et al 2016 savchenko 2001 the cavity morphology gas entrainment law closure mode and dependence of gas demand on these factors in the boundary layer show different characteristics under different working conditions but there are many issues needed further exploration in particular one of the key problems in this technology has not been clearly revealed that is how to determine the gas demand for establishing a ventilated cavity and the relationship between its influencing factors arndt et al 2009 ceccio 2010 previous studies mäkiharju et al 2013 zverkhovskyi 2014 have focused on the gas demand cavity shape closure mode and other issues when the cavity reaches the complete coverage of the chamber however the evolution characteristics of a single cavity from early formation to a certain coverage state have not been paid enough attention the evolution process of a single cavity is of guiding significance to the design of multiple cavities specially considering the limited coverage of a single cavity under the working speed range of the merchant ship amromin 2012 the goal of maximum drag reduction rate with minimum ventilation by multiple cavities is the optimization of the all cavities which may correspond to a certain stage rather than the saturation state of a single cavity three types of stable cavity were found by matveev et al 2009 in an open surface water channel experiment through using a stepped model under a small froude fr number range 0 16 0 37 as fr increases it begins with a single tongue like cavity followed by a double tongue like cavity and finally a square flat cavity the square shaped cavity obtained in the water tunnel experiment by mäkiharju et al 2013 has no great difference in topology between two geometrically scaled plates arndt et al 2009 carried out a plate experimental study in a water tunnel and found that the cavity presented a single tongue shape when fr was less than 0 2 and when fr was beyond 0 41 two extended cavities appeared on both sides a 3 d wall mounted fence as a facing step was used to conduct the water tunnel ventilation experiment by barbaca et al 2017 and it was found that the square like cavity consisting of the stable area and the re entrant jet dominated unstable area was obtained within relatively high fr range owing to the experimental conditions such as the blocking effect of the water tunnel geometry of the plate inconsistent incoming flow and ventilation conditions there is no unified conclusion on the distribution of cavity morphology and the mechanism of morphology transition is not well understood based on the potential flow theory four two dimensional closure patterns cavity with a pulsating re entrant jet cavity with a smooth attachment unstable cavity and unclosed cavity were proposed by matveev 2003 through the analysis of the ventilation flow behind a wedge callenaere et al 2001 have done a series of groundbreaking work on re entrant jet induced cloud cavitation instability and its surrounding regimes the classified non auto oscillating type cavity i e long cavity and thin cavities with periodic re entrant jet is closely related to the practical application of large scale drag reduction where no re entrant jet was observed and gas shedding was continuous without overall oscillating in terms of long cavity but the tail presented a periodic behavior dominated by re entrant jet for the latter one for ventilation experiments behind a gas jet cavitator jiang et al 2018 or 2 d foils michel 1984 the cavity presented overall instability namely pulsating cavities under some working condition where the gas water interface has distinct periodic wavy waves defined systematically by michel and franc franc and michel 2006 michel 1984 mäkiharju et al 2013 did not observe significant gas shedding at the cavity interface and attributed the dominant mechanism of gas loss to the gas entrainment at the cavity closure hence proposed the hypothesis of three potential gas shedding modes cavity impinge re entrant jet and viscous forces stretches based on flat plate experiments re entrant jet entrainment mechanism and interfacial wave dominant entrainment mechanism were put forward by zverkhovskyi 2014 who also attributed the gas leakage to the cavity closure region cavities with re entrant jet behavior as the primary mechanism of gas entrainment was observed by barbaca et al 2018 in the water tunnel ventilated flow over a wall mounted fence in an up to date 2 d wall mounted fence water tunnel experiment barbaca et al 2019 thoroughly discussed cavities shedding behavior where re entrant jet wave pinch off and turbulence induced break up dominated mechanisms are responsible for large scale and small scale shedding under different stages with moderate to large fr range the main causes of gas leakage are generally known as cavity closure region under a moderate froude number range which is recognized by these researchers however the understanding of gas entrainment characteristics and closure mode is still insufficient especially the water tunnel experiment is different from the towing tank where the water is still in particular the blocking effect in towing tank on cavity closure can be neglected which may have a relatively obvious influence on the result such as closure mode the condition of cavity transition karn et al 2016 in the water tunnel in addition the deeper water condition makes up for water tunnel s inability to apply the deep water gravity wave theory which is close to the actual state what s more in order to ensure the relative motion water in a water tunnel has a momentum which is obviously contrary to the actual situation especially the momentum of water is a necessary condition to trigger a re entrant jet the bifurcation behavior of the cavity was found when gas was injected via hole into a cross flow by vigneau et al 2001a 2001b mäkiharju et al 2017 and mäkiharju and ceccio 2018 quantitatively analyzed the topological characteristics of the bifurcation represented by the spreading angle in their study the value of spreading angle is the result of the drag equilibrium of the cavity pressure and the convection of the boundary layer on the cavity which is affected by factors such as froude number and reynolds number of the inflow the condition of the injected gas and the hole parameters in a 3 d wall mounted fence ventilated cavity flow experiment conducted by barbaca et al 2017 bifurcation also occurred at the end of the cavity by means of slot ventilation and the results showed that froude number was an dominant parameter leading to the transition however the distribution of such topological features the nature of topological differences and the physical mechanism behind the transformation of topological features have not been well proposed the empirical or semi empirical dimensionless relationship between morphology of ventilated supercavitation cavity and gas demand has been thoroughly derived and established epshtein 1973 logvinovich 1972 spurk 2002 however many efforts are needed on ventilated boundary flows to support similar conclusion a positive correlation between cavity length and gas demand was found by a series of previous ventilated cavity model ship experiments cucinotta et al 2017 jin ho 1999 latorre 1997 but there lacks a relatively appropriate mathematical model to determine the relationship in addition more favorable evidence is needed to analyze the dependence of gas demand on flow conditions such as froude number and reynolds number mäkiharju et al 2013 moreover it was found by mäkiharju et al 2013 that when froude number was relatively small in large scale experiment the gas demand required to form a complete covered cavity increased sharply which similar results have not been found in congeneric studies is it a coincidence or governed by some mechanism still needs to be explored restricted to experimental conditions the experimental data measured by ventilated cavity ship are relatively insufficient in this work with the target of analyzing and predicting the transition condition of cavity patterns we focus on the evolution characteristics of the ventilated cavity flow from early formation to complete coverage as well as the flow patterns and its distribution under a broad range of velocities and ventilation rate the closure modes gas entrainment law essence of topological features and transition mechanism of morphology are particularly concerned the dependence of gas demand on closure mode and incoming flow condition is paid close attention therefore we carry out ventilated partial cavity experimental study in a calm water towing tank using a model ship the remainder of this paper is organized into the following three sections the experimental conditions are introduced in section 2 in section 3 1 the cavity patterns are described in detail closure and shedding characteristics of cavity are given in section 3 2 the essence of topological features and the hypothesis of the formation and transformation mechanism dominating the morphology of cavity are analyzed in section 3 3 in section 3 4 the quantitative analysis of cavity growth curves is demonstrated the dependency of gas demand required for a complete covering cavity on the incoming flow condition is presented in section 3 5 finally the conclusion and perspectives are presented in section 4 2 experimental methods the experiments were performed at the key aviation scientific and technological laboratory of high speed hydrodynamic in special vehicle research institute of china the dimensions of the water tank are 500 m length 6 5 m width 5 m depth the trailer has a towing capacity of 0 22 m s with a precision of 0 1 0 3 during steady operation the entire system fig 1 consisted of the ship model gas tank and pipe valve system camera system trailer and data acquisition system the original ship model as shown in fig 2 a was 3 m long and 0 85 m wide with a fixed displacement of 120 kg δ the ship model had a smooth surface apparent roughness height within 0 015 mm and met the allowable error standard specified in cb z 244 88 glider model resistance test method on the basis of the original ship model a flat gas chamber was chipped at the bottom of the ship and a step was set at the ventilation slot to form the ventilation ship model vsm as shown in fig 2 b c the appearance of the hypothetical cavity formed after ventilation is shown in fig 2 c in order to restrict the cavity from floating up on either side of the ship there are two skegs on both sides of the bottom of the gas chamber as shown in fig 2 e the main body of the model was composed of wood and two plexiglas plates were used as observation windows to observe the cavity as shown in fig 2 b the ship model had three degrees of freedom of motion during the towing longitudinal and vertical movement and longitudinal rotation the tanks were full of pure industrial oxygen the gas flow rate expressed in this paper is translated into standard atmospheric pressure 1 bar and standard temperature 273 k after passing through the valve the gas was connected with the mass flow meter and flowed to the rectangular pressure chamber plenum on the bottom of the ship through the gas pipe there was a slot vent on one side of the plenum and the gas flowed to the bottom of the ship via the slot as shown in fig 2 d e the alicat mcr d5m mass flow controller with a full scale of 1000 slpm has a maximum overall measurement uncertainty of 2 the trailer and data acquisition system consisted of a trailer single component force transducer pull wire displacement sensor tilt angle sensor and data acquisition system the towing speed and model ship s drag sinkage and trim value were collected synchronously through the data acquisition system the specific parameters of each sensor are shown in table 1 the target ventilation rate was set prior to towing when the ventilation rate was stable the towing started one entire towing operation can be divided into acceleration smooth operation reach the target speed of trailer and deceleration three periods data during the smooth run of ship within the smooth operation period was taken as valid value when the surface waves dissipated the next round of towing began the specific parameters of vsm and experimental conditions are summarized in table 2 one example of a typical operation u 5 00 m s qa 300 slpm is shown in fig 3 including the three periods of the trailer described above as well as the corresponding drag and the motion state represented by the trim value of vsm due to the robust dynamic stability of vsm in other working conditions the trim fluctuation during smooth run of ship is similar to the example here fig 3 that is the fluctuation can be ignored and the average trim value is no more than 3 owing to the curved feature of the bow the height of the step is not evenly distributed in the span wise direction but varied from 9 mm to 12 mm and averaged at 10 mm based on the numerical approach refer to the supplemental information the boundary layer thickness at the position of the step is close to h 10 mm and the boundary layer of the incoming flow upstream of the step reaches turbulence under all towing conditions to image the cavity two same charge coupled device ccd cameras point gray gs3 u3 51s5m c were installed on the ship s deck through a metal bracket and were concentrated to the bottom of the ship s plexiglas viewing window labelled watch window 1 and watch window 2 as shown in fig 2 b two cameras with a maximum recording speed of 75 fps started and ended shoot at the same time the combination of the two cameras was designed to capture the entire view of cavity at the bottom of the trailer as shown in fig 4 there were several scattered fluorescent lamps as the light source since the gas liquid interface was obvious after ventilation there was no special optical treatment here and the shape of cavity was directly captured by ccd cameras the cameras started to shoot when the ship started to move and the shooting time lasted from tens of seconds to several minutes when the ship s drag is stable after ventilation for a certain period of time more often it s about 3 min after the start of ventilation images with less fluctuation of cavity shape in a continuous period of time are selected as the effective cavity shape less fluctuation means that the images are corresponding to the period of smooth run of ship fig 3 excluded those under acceleration of trailer early smooth operation and deceleration of trailer period the time average of multiple effective images at least 15 images are grayscale processed as raw photo every single raw photo is processed by the procedure of image binarization with the same threshold value one example process of determining cavity area and boundary is shown in fig 4 the cavity area extracted from the binary images are averaged as the final cavity area s cavity which the maximum uncertainty is no more than 5 the uncertainty obtained here is based on the relative fluctuation between single cavity area and the average one s cavity see fig 5 the following physical parameters such as ventilation rate qa and towing velocity u are key variables these variables are converted into the following dimensionless forms gas entrainment coefficient cq froude number based on ship length fr reynolds number based on ship length re and equivalent cavity length coefficient l c 1 c q q a u w h 2 f r u g l 3 r e u l ρ μ 4 l c s cavity s where g is the gravitational acceleration ρ and μ are the density and viscosity of water respectively the fr based on ship length is selected because it can represent the change in friction resistance of the ship model and the length of cavity since the cavity is not uniformly distributed in the span wise direction to be specific l c reflects the dimensionless area coefficient rather than length of the cavity but the difference is ignored here for the sake of simplifying the analysis 3 result and discussion 3 1 flow pattern of ventilated cavity based on the classification of morphology and bubble dynamics several distinct flow patterns of cavity are founded with increasing ventilation rate under fixed fr specifically as shown in fig 6 the selected images a b c d e are typical patterns of cavity flow namely discrete foamy flow dff fig 6 a initial coalescing cavity icc fig 6 b meniscus growth cavity mgc fig 6 c and bottle neck stable cavity bnsc fig 6 d and e when the ventilation rate is gradually increased with fr 0 92 u 5 00 m s dff contains a large number of foamy clusters with feature length concentrated in the range 10 100 mm foam is mainly presented in the form of free ribbons which do not keep a strong connection with each other and thus the gas liquid interface is very clear the location of the vent works as a facing step where flow separation and re attachment occurs le et al 1997 and the ejected gas tends to coalesce into larger bubbles foam coalescing bubbles and a cavity with a continuous interface coexist for icc this is the initial status of cavity transition from dff to a continuous and transparent cavity at the rear of the transparent cavity there are many bubbles on the order of 10 mm or smaller which make the interface blurred behind the bubble group is the falling foam a similar phenomenon occurs before the formation of a clear interface ventilated supercavitation flow jiang et al 2018 2019 karn et al 2016 mgc is a visually distinguishable transparent cavity the rear of the cavity is not flat but short in the middle and long on the sides similar to a crescent moon hence it is named meniscus growth cavity the transparent interface of bnsc is extended to the stern the cavity completely covers the bottom of the ship which has the most stability and the greatest drag reduction potential interestingly it is found that the tail of the cavity is not flat a curved growth stagnation zone is formed on both rear sides of the cavity which does not vary with the ventilation rate the shape of the cavity tail resembles the neck of a vase hence the name bottle neck stable cavity the existence of stagnation zone is highly suspected to be resulted by the strong vortex excited by the divergent wave together with the stern wave which has a typical angle along the motion direction on both sides of the ship the strong vortex tends to be an external disturbance to the cavity and result in the discontinuity of the cavity at the stern region of the bottom hence the growth stagnation zone of the cavity is formed based on the criterion of the dimensionless cavity length l c the growth of the cavity in the near hull experienced formation logarithmic growth and maturity three stages with increasing ventilation rate under fixed fr three stages corresponding to the evolution characteristics of the cavity regime namely discrete foamy initial coalescence logarithmic growth and stable form is illustrated in fig 7 in the formation stage the ventilation rate is quite low gas in the water exits as individual discrete foam as the number and concentration of bubbles are insufficient to reach certain threshold value of coalescence when the ventilation rate increases beyond threshold the aggregation effect of high concentration bubbles on gas liquid flow dominates with a tendency of initial coalescence of a transparent interface as the ventilation rate continues to increase it quickly moves from the formation stage to the logarithmic growth stage at this stage the cavity growth rate is very fast and even a slight increase in the ventilation rate can lead to a significant increase in cavity length subsequently when the ventilation rate increases to a saturation value the cavity almost reaches a non incremental equilibrium in coverage area between growth and shedding and presents stable form in morphology since the bottom of the gas chamber is a continuous plane all the way to the stern and the size of the ship is small relative to the tank the growth of the cavity is neither limited by the geometric conditions of the ship nor the blocking effect but the finite bottom area under this condition it enters the maturity stage where the state of cavity is stable in coverage area and morphology when ventilation rate is around or above the saturation value when fr varies from 0 37 to 1 10 in the formation and maturity stages the corresponding flow patterns of dff icc and bnsc remain nearly the same however there are four distinct topological cavity features as shown in fig 8 in the logarithmic growth stage i e jet growth cavity jgc bifurcation growth cavity bgc meniscus growth cavity and waterfall growth cavity wgc corresponding to fig 8 a d respectively jgc appears when fr is at 0 37 u 2 00 m s the tail of jgc shares some similarity in shape to that of the velocity distribution surface formed by plane jet where the shedding bubble group is mainly concentrated in the crater the central region of the tail as the ventilation rate increases the size of the cavity increases slightly but the shape keeps close when fr is increased to 0 55 u 3 00 m s a bifurcation appears in the middle of the entire cavity the middle region is occupied by water pocket and the cavity extends on the two sides the cavity with a middle vacancy and two thick and long branches on the sides resembles a swallow s tail hence it is named bgc it s worth noting that in the water tunnel 3 d fence experiment by barbaca et al 2017 the phenomenon of bifurcation together with the splitting of re entrant jet also appeared at the end of the cavity with slot ventilation under a moderate fr range more interestingly the current result shows that the bifurcation point in the middle has little change with the ventilation rate under fixed fr where similar result also occurred in the experiment by barbaca et al 2017 mgc appears when fr is approximately in the range of 0 74 0 92 u 4 00 5 00 m s when fr is above 0 92 u 5 00 m s wgc appears with a flat tail and the behavior of uniform gas pocket shedding which is similar to a waterfall the most noteworthy feature of wgc is that the entire cavity shows a tendency of a contracting abdomen that is the cavity is concentrated in the inner region and the two sides show symmetrically curved vacancies based on various flow patterns of cavity described above we obtain the cavity regime map under different fr and cq as shown in fig 9 it seems evident that the transition of cavity morphology in the logarithmic growth stage tends to be fr dominant which will be explored in depth in section 3 3 the red dotted line is the approximate boundary line of the transition between the logarithmic growth and maturity stages the acronyms of the seven cavity flow patterns and their corresponding names are summarized in table 3 the minimum ventilation rate required to form the bnsc is named the minimum morphology saturated rate msr min msr min is an approximate value obtained from the difference of the test points in the regime map fig 9 it s worth noting that the definition of msr min here is consistent with the definition of minimum rate of ventilation required to establish a fully courage cavity by mäkiharju et al 2013 arndt et al 2009 and amromin et al 2011 it is found that msr min does not show a simple positive correlation with fr the relationship between msr min and fr is illustrated in fig 10 when fr is lower than 0 74 msr min is negatively correlated with fr followed by a positive correlation when fr is greater than 0 74 here the relatively greater needing of msr min for fr lower than 0 74 may be explained by gravity wave modulation mechanism which has been widely found in water tunnel experiments that it may be an important factor limiting cavity growth arndt et al 2009 ceccio 2010 mäkiharju et al 2013 zverkhovskyi 2014 according to this hypothesis the limiting cavity length l limit is limited to half of the linear gravity wavelength λ which the quantization relation can be expressed by simplified formula 5 5 l limit 0 5 λ u 2 π g according to the above gravity wave modulation mechanism a sketch of the virtual interaction between the linear gravity wave and the ship is presented in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that when fr is less than 0 55 the gravity waves are all closed in the bottom of the ship this signifies that in this fr range less than 0 55 the gravity waves have an inhibitory effect on the formation of the cavity however this hindrance effect can be counteracted if given enough ventilation rate this mechanism may reveal why the v shaped swerve fig 10 occurs 3 2 closure and shedding characteristics for a stratified horizontal flow with less dense overlying fluid its interface will become unstable when there are fluctuations on the interface specifically for the stratified gas liquid flow here when instability occurs it will be manifested in two ways the gas entrainment at the interface and the tail of the cavity the overall oscillation behavior of the cavity in our experiment the overall oscillation behavior of the cavity was not observed which was found by mäkiharju et al 2013 and arndt et al 2009 in the perturbed flow experiment that is to say the external interference to the cavity shape is relatively small here and the cavity exists in a quasi steady state with continuous shedding of gas pockets under different fr the shedding behavior of cavity also shows great distinction here we focus on the shedding and closure characteristics of the four types of cavity jgc bgc mgc and wgc in the logarithmic growth stage as shown in fig 12 where the typical variation states of a time series are selected for fr 0 37 jgc as shown in fig 12 a there is a coronal rip in the middle of the tail then the rip is torn followed by the release of large gas bags and finally the tail is restored to its original state at 0 10 s however it does not mean that all shedding periods are 0 1 s as shown here but they are close on the order of magnitude the tail of the cavity which undergoes a small amplitude periodic oscillation is closed with an angle to the underside the small amplitude local periodic oscillation behavior can be regarded as a metastable state which is similar to the thin non auto oscillating cavity regime classified by barbaca et al 2019 and callenaere et al 2001 but without larger scale oscillations and the presence of re entrant jet flow the summarized pattern diagram is shown in fig 13 a it should be noted that the angle closure defined here is similar to the type 1 cavity proposed by matveev 2003 tail of type 1 cavity has a certain angle with the wall surface and is accompanied by pulsating re entrant jet however although small scale of periodic oscillations are observed in the tail here there is no sign of pulsating re entrant jet as fr increases to 0 55 bgc as shown in fig 12 b several small rips occurs at the end of the cavity as the annotated rip 1 5 shows and then rips enlarge finally a portion of the cavity separates from the tail at the thinnest point of the connection and becomes an independent gas pocket the evolution process of the rips indicates that the surface tension and viscous force is dominant for the behavior of gas stretching ligament and the trend of shrinking cavity the gas entrainment mechanism here is similar to the entrainment mechanisms for low viscosity plunging jets kiger and duncan 2012 mäkiharju et al 2013 which the jet is segregated into a stream of discrete droplets but still with a contiguous ligament the tail of the cavity whose shedding is dominated by group rips is smoothly closed on the bottom the summarized pattern diagram is shown in fig 13 b the closure mode here smooth adherent closure is consistent with type 2 cavity proposed by matveev 2003 which is an ideal closure pattern when fr increase to 0 74 mgc as shown in fig 12 c the partial gas pocket is pulled out of the tail and cut off at the shortest joint the gas entrainment here is consistent with the phenomenon of wave pinch off which is dominated by capillary gravity waves proposed by barbaca et al 2018 and sene 1988 in their study the capillary waves are formed at the interface and its typical length is considered to be related to the turbulence intensity of the gas liquid interface when the typical length of capillary gravity waves can be compared with the cavity thickness the cavity is easy to fracture the wavelengths observed here are about 20 40 mm which are similar to the that of observed by mäkiharju et al 2013 10 mm small scale plate and rotte et al 2015 5 20 mm in their experiments the tail of the cavity is still closed smoothly to the wall as fig 13 c shows however as fr increases to 1 10 wgc the shedding strength becomes very severe as shown in fig 12 d specifically at the tail of the cavity the shedding is present to be the mode of layer peeling in the span wise direction with the same level as the dashed line highlights in fig 12 d the gas entrainment mode is consistent with the wave pinch off mechanism but it is obviously severe enough to shape the tail of the cavity a flat tail the intense and fragmented behavior of gas shedding leads to the realization that in addition to wave pinch off mechanism there may be coupled with turbulent boundary layer induced break up which is similar to the procedure of eddies decomposition however as it was found by barbaca et al 2019 in the water tunnel experiment the single effect of turbulence induced break up on shedding is characterized by the behavior of irregular small scale of gaseous structures which is slightly different from the relatively orderly shedding here in the span wise direction the shedding behavior in span wise direction here makes one aware of the transverse waves part of the kelvin wave which are triggered by the motion of the ship similar to the behavior here it is obvious that the transverse wave propagation at the gas liquid interface of ship bottom is one source of force on decomposing cavity that cannot be ignored there are reasons to think that the two mechanisms wave pinch off and turbulence induced break up together dominate the gas shedding but the relative forces between the two mechanisms are currently indistinguishable the tail of wgc does not show the characteristics of close i e open closure and the summarized pattern is shown in fig 13 d open closure is similar to type 4 cavity proposed by matveev 2003 which the cavity is not closed and a large amount of gas is needed to extend a certain length 3 3 topological features and transition hypothesis as mentioned above section 3 1 fig 8 there are four distinct cavity jgc bgc mgc and wgc in the logarithmic growth stage here we try to illustrate the possible topological features of the morphological differences and put forward the hypothesis of the formation and transformation mechanism which dominates the morphology of cavity specifically the difference of cavity morphology can be represented by the geometric relationship shown in fig 14 a where the four colored solid lines with intersection of the x axis x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 are the two dimensional outline sketch of the cavity corresponding to jgc bgc mgc and wgc the tangent line l1 4 is set at the half upper contour of the cavity and the angle of intersection ß 1 4 is obtained by the tangent line and the positive x axis the intersection angle ß is the mathematical quantity used to represent the topological difference of cavity the obtuse angle range represents the range of jgc and for the acute angle range as the angle increases it represents the transition of the cavity from bgc to mgc and wgc as shown in fig 14 b the physical significance of the intersection angle may be related to the force balanced state of the cavity here it is quite difficult to quantify the relationship between ß and specific physical variables however the study on the topological features of gas layer via single hole injection by lee 2015 and mäkiharju et al 2017 can be used as a reference specifically in their study the sweep angle of the gas branch is the result of the drag equilibrium of the cavity pressure and the convection of the boundary layer on the cavity which is related to the speed of incoming flow the cross sectional area of the gas branch and the pressure inside the cavity here three hypothetical mechanisms i e rectangular jet dominant pressure difference dominant and wave pinch off dominant are put forward as shown in fig 15 which leads to the morphology formation and transformation of the cavity as the simplicity it can be considered that a rectangular plane jet flow is set into the low speed airflow within the cavity that is the composite semi confined space plane jet flow as shown in fig 15 a similar simplification is proposed by arndt et al 2009 in analyzing the influence of slot area the central line velocity of the rectangular jet shows x n attenuation with the increase of the distance from slot the longitudinal velocity distribution of the rectangular jet is similar to the semi ellipse or cosine curve which shares some similarity with the tail profile of jgc in shape however due to the limit of current experimental conditions rigorous velocity measurements need to be carried out specifically the boundary of the cavity tail is determined by the velocity distribution or momentum distribution inside the cavity and is the result of the balance between upstream momentum transfer and gas entrainment however the leading effect of the rectangular jet decreases with the increase of the towing velocity u because the initial momentum of the composite jet is positive related with u jet u u jet is the velocity of the ventilated gas flow hence it can be imagined that this mechanism generally dominates when fr is relatively small which can be referred to the cavity morphology obtained by matveev et al 2009 in the experiment similar to jgc occurred in the lowest fr range the position of cavity closure is also determined by the pressure difference between the gas and liquid phase at the closure specifically the cavity pressure at the closure p cavity is equal to or slightly higher than the static pressure of surrounding flow p water otherwise the cavity will decompose or can not extend over there if the static pressure is higher than closure pressure similar conclusions are also obtained by mäkiharju et al 2013 and zverkhovskyi 2014 which the former found that the pressure peak appears at the bifurcation position of the cavity by numerical results and the latter found that pressure inside the longer cavities is slightly less than the surrounding water by plate experiment here it reveals the bifurcation behavior of bgc and mgc that is bifurcation region as shown in fig 15 b is where the pressure is concentrated the pressure concentrated region on the bottom of hull on the one hand results from the front facing step the step combined with the continuous cavity behind the step create an effect similar to turbulent hydraulic jump and then a pressure peak appears at the end of the cavity le et al 1997 mortazavi et al 2016 on the other hand is an inherent phenomenon on the bottom of the stepped ship flow separation is formed behind the step but the separation zone is far away from 6 times of step height and pressure peak zone occurs in the reattachment zone doustdar and kazemi 2019 hence the cavity gets blocked in the middle region in addition there is wall attachment effect on the two sides which makes the velocity of airflow deflected to the sides and two thick branches form it is necessary to satisfy certain towing velocity conditions when pressure difference becomes significant so the transition from jgc to bgc and mgc occurs when fr 0 5 0 9 similarly it should recall that in the experiment by matveev et al 2009 fr condition satisfying the cavity similar to mgc is beyond and next to the range of jgc it is important to note that negative cavitation numbers will occur when fr is quite low and the volume balance of the corresponding cavity is different from the above pressure balance pattern matveev and miller 2011 even if the injection is stopped the formed cavity can theoretically continue to exist indefinitely the mode of zero entrainment rate is considered to be related to self circulating flow inside the cavity eventually neither of the above mechanisms rectangular jet dominant and pressure difference dominant becomes important when the gas entrainment rate at the end of the cavity is very intense as shown in fig 15 c only the cavity with enough thickness and momentum can survive from the strong wave pinch off effect otherwise it will be swept away which shapes the cavity tail flat this strong gas entrainment effect usually occurs at high fr range and it explains why the cavity is particularly thick when fr 1 10 as shown in fig 8 d as described early section 3 2 there are two mechanisms turbulent induced break up and wave pinch off that coexist and dominate the gas shedding the breaking force on gas shedding by the above mechanisms in boundary layer is obviously more intense with the increase of fr the increasing turbulence energy under higher fr is converted into the force on breaking the closure of gas cavity down into smaller and smaller gas pockets or independent bubble which is similar to the procedure of eddies breaking the amplitude of transverse waves part of the kelvin wave excited by the ship motion is also more significant the propagation of transverse waves at the gas liquid interface leads disturbance to the stable existence of cavity under this condition only the interface of cavity with a greater continuity or momentum can survive in a balance of supply and loss turbulence induced break up works like to make the end of the cavity more brittle while the wave pinch off mechanism works as a final scissors cutting the cavity at the weakest connection which shapes cavity like a square again reference can be found from the results by matveev et al 2009 similar to the wgc which is under the largest fr intervals all three mechanisms exist simultaneously and only in different fr intervals they play a dominant role in fact due to the inconsistent experimental conditions and complex physical mechanism involved there is no unified consensus on the current understanding of flow patterns fig 16 presents the typical flow patterns obtained by some investigators in the experiment with the same research objective overall flow patterns are scattered but there seems to be some meaningful clues on those trends specifically the flow patterns in the current experiment as shown in fig 16 a are also found by other investigators but are dispersedly existed the three flow patterns fig 16 a1 jgc fig 16 a3 mgc and fig 16 a4 mgc we obtained were also found by matveev et al 2009 fig 16 b1 b2 and b3 in their water channel experiment but their fr range 0 16 0 26 and 0 37 is quite different however the order where the three flow patterns appear under fr is consistent which implies that the three hypotheses of transformation mechanism proposed above may be unified in the towing tank and water channel what is more the ventilation rate range of matveev et al 2009 may be still in the logarithmic stage hence there is no bnsc fig 16 a5 in the current results similarly in the 3 d wall mounted fence experiment by barbaca et al 2017 the transition between different flow patterns is dominated by fr as shown in fig 16 d1 d2 and d3 the fr increases gradually which is quite consistent with the current result note that even if the current model has a small trim change less than 3 the comparative result may reveal that the effect of a small trim on the cavity flow pattern is not significant however in the water tunnel experiment by zverkhovskyi 2014 and mäkiharju et al 2013 only one cavity morphology was obtained by using slot ventilation as shown in fig 16 c1 and fig 16 e1 according to their experimental setup their sides of plate are both attached to the tunnel wall which makes the effect of rectangular jet and wall attachment weakened and the three dimensional characteristics of the cavity are not obvious similarly bifurcation behavior of the cavity observed by barbaca et al 2017 2018 appeared in the 3 d inlet flow experiment fig 16 d2 and d3 but did not occur in the 2 d inlet flow experiment fig 16 d4 under the same conditions as for the single pattern as shown in fig 16 c2 obtained by zverkhovskyi 2014 in the towing tank experiment may be due to the limitation of fr range 0 12 0 21 so that other patterns are hidden as regard the study of hole ventilation by mäkiharju et al 2017 it is found that superposition effect of gas layer is very complex spacing number of holes ventilation rate as well as the inflow condition will affect the cavity shape as shown in fig 16 e2 e5 however an interesting finding is that if the number of holes tends to increase and the spacing is closer the final gas layer morphology will tend to fig 16 e3 it seems to be consistent with our findings bnsc fig 16 a5 if the number of holes is infinite the limit case is slot on this condition the saturation form of the cavity gas layer seems to be consistent however the phenomenon of re entrant jet appearing in the experiment conducted by barbaca et al 2017 2018 was not widely reported in similar experiments note that both in the seminal work on re entrant jet instability conducted by callenaere et al 2001 and wall mounted fence flow experiment by barbaca et al 2017 2018 the appearance of re entrant jet is under the condition of high inlet velocity that is analogous to the super critical open channel flow regime condition is met which is not met in most of the above experiments in this regard barbaca et al 2017 also emphasized that no re entrant jet appeared when the inlet flow is similar to the sub critical open channel flow regime in addition there is a slight difference between the towing tank and the water tunnel that is the water in the towing tank is stationary which weakens the trigger condition of re entrant jet that requires a high momentum of water hence re entrant jet is rarely reported in the towing tank experiment however more direct experimental results are needed to support the applicability of the re entrant jet instability phenomenon observed by barbaca et al 2019 in the water tunnel to the towing tank due to the lack of high clarity and high frame rate of the cavity wake images at present rigorous conclusion is expected to be given after improving image approach 3 4 quantitative analysis of cavity growth curves as described above section 3 1 fig 7 it is found that the relationship between cavity length and ventilation rate tends to meet a logarithmic correlation and we try to quantify this relationship here furthermore the influence of the cavity closure mode on gas demand is expected to be analyzed based on the logarithmic correlation fig 17 presents the cavity growth curves for fr in the range from 0 37 to 1 10 the corresponding dimensionless cavity length under different dimensionless ventilation coefficients the cavity growth curve is fitted by logarithmic eq 6 the least squares algorithm is adapted to determine the parameters a b and c based on the experimental data in the formation and logarithmic growth stages hence the curves of five colors in fig 17 with r squared values of 0 89 0 87 0 85 0 95 and 0 98 are obtained the deviations between the experimental data in the above two stages and the curve fitting are acceptable although there is scattering in the maturity stage the growth curve focuses on the differences in the above two stages l c is regarded as a constant in the maturity stage 6 l c f c q a b ln c q c based on the five fitting results above the constants of the logarithmic curve is extracted and analyzed a represents the limit state of cavity length and c represents the starting state of cavity growth thus b containing the impact of fr on l c is linked to the cavity growth process a correlation analysis between fr n and b is conducted as shown in fig 18 the least squares algorithm is adapted to determine the parameters n it can be seen that n 1 9865 reaches the maximum correlation of r 2 0 9626 for simplicity n is taken as 2 therefore we have b 0 326fr 2 the formula for cavity length can be expressed as follows 12 l c f c q a 0 326 f r 2 ln c q c c q m s r min l c constant c q m s r min here n 2 may not be simply a coincidence if we refer to previous relevant studies amromin 2012 butuzov 1966 buyvol 1980 spurk 2002 the dependence of cavity length on fr 2 is derived from potential flow theory for flat wall by butuzov 1966 but this relationship is a limit state and does not include the influence of ventilation rate although amromin et al 2011 and mäkiharju et al 2013 did not find fr dependence in their experiment as the issue will be discussed in section 3 5 it is possible that the fr range they studied is within the interference range moreover the relationship established by mäkiharju et al 2013 and amromin et al 2011 between fr and cq was based on the cq required for a complete coverage of cavity rather than on the change process of cq in the requirement for formation and logarithmic growth of cavity therefore b reflects the effect of fr on the growth process of cavities rather than the effect on cavity in maturity stage as cq of maturity stage is jointly influenced by factors such as the gravity wave modulation effect re and closure modes hence it can be speculated that fr 2 has a certain universality in governing cavity growth under formation and logarithmic growth stage which is expected to be obtained in scaling experiments or similar experiments of course this still needs to be further proved when the cavity is stable the amount of gas entering the cavity is balanced with the amount of gas leaking out the simplified two dimensional cavity is selected as the control body for the gas flux balance analysis of cavity in logarithmic growth stage and maturity stage as shown in fig 19 the leakage can be divided into two regions the interface qout t interface gas entrainment rate due to interface turbulence entrainment and the tail qout c closure gas entrainment rate due to closure gas entrainment these two mechanisms are quite different and the research on interfacial entrainment is relatively sufficient corrsin and kistler 1955 mäkiharju et al 2013 meneveau and sreenivasan 1990 in their study qout t can be estimated by the following equation 13 q o u t t ξ u l c where ξ is the average void fraction and ū is average transfer velocity at gas liquid interface based on their conclusions ξ can be approximated as a constant independent of fr and l c in the logarithmic growth stage here ū is proportional to the towing velocity u the gas flux balance equation of the control body can be expressed as the following equation 14 q i n q o u t t q o u t c ψ u l c q o u t c where qin is rate of gas entering the control body ψ is constant term at a fixed average transfer velocity qout t is proportional to l c while qout c is positive correlation with l c although it is hard to analyze qout c quantitatively its trend is of great concern based the equations 7 11 the gas demand for l c 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 in logarithmic growth stage and l c at maturity stage is given in fig 20 obviously with the growth of l c cq does not have a continuous positive correlation with the fr specifically cq undergoes a v shaped swerve when l c is beyond 0 5 fig 20 is divided into three intervals based on the criterion of closure mode discussed above section 3 2 fig 12 obviously the gas demand corresponding to angle closure is the highest followed by open closure and smooth adherent closure is the lowest it implies that the gas demand is dominated by the closure mode based on fig 20 it is obvious that with the increase of l c the growth rate of qout c is significantly higher than that of qout t the change of qout c when l c ranges from 0 3 to 0 5 0 3 to 0 6 and 0 3 to 0 9 is given by the equations 15 17 15 δ q o u t c l c 0 3 0 5 q o u t c l c 0 5 q o u t c l c 0 3 q i n l c 0 5 5 3 q i n l c 0 3 16 δ q o u t c l c 0 3 0 6 q o u t c l c 0 6 q o u t c l c 0 3 q i n l c 0 6 2 q i n l c 0 3 17 δ q o u t c l c 0 3 0 9 q o u t c l c 0 9 q o u t c l c 0 3 q i n l c 0 9 3 q i n l c 0 3 the inequality is reduced to equal sign for approximate estimation as qout c of l c 0 3 is relatively small the deviation caused by this simplification is acceptable for the sake of comparing the change of qout c qout c is normalized with that of fr 0 37 as the benchmark the result of normalization is given in fig 21 similarly the graph is divided into three intervals by corresponding closure modes considering that when l c reaches more than 0 5 qout c corresponding to this length is much larger than that of qout c in the initial stage such as l c 0 3 in order to simplify the analysis the change of qout c qout c is approximately equivalent to qout c as given in equation 18 18 q o u t c l c δ δ q o u t c l c q o u t c l c δ q o u t c l c where l c δ means that l c plus micro increment over l c further simplifying the analysis it can be considered that qout t under l c 0 5 is relatively small comparing to qout c especially when l c 0 9 hence qout c can be equivalent to qin 19 q i n l c 0 5 q o u t c l c 0 5 δ q o u t c l c 0 5 the simplification equation 19 here can be supported by previous studies in particular mäkiharju et al 2013 did not observe significant interface shedding in both small scale and large scale experiments michel 2006 and savchenko and savchenko 2012 pointed out that the interface shedding dominates only when flow instabilities occur near the gas liquid interface which is similar to the kelvin helmholtz instability but condition satisfied is that the velocity difference of gas liquid interface is relatively large based on the above assumptions as shown in fig 21 especially the curve of l c 0 3 0 9 approximately reflects the gas demand corresponding to different closure modes this association is consistent with the emphasis of closure mode on ventilated supercavitation and flat wall flow proposed by many scholars karn et al 2016 mäkiharju et al 2013 matveev 2003 wu et al 2019 obviously angle closure is considered as a metastable closure mode described in section 3 2 where the gas demand is the highest the optimal smooth adherent closure is considered as the most ideal closure mode where the gas demand is almost one tenth of the angle closure open closure generally occurs when fr is relatively large and its gas demand is roughly three to four times that of optimal smooth adherent closure in addition the experiments by mäkiharju et al 2013 are worth recalling they found that the gas demand required by establishing the cavity is almost three to four times to maintain the cavity here it is speculated that the closure mode corresponding to maintain a cavity might be similar to optimal smooth adherent closure and establish a cavity might be similar to the current open closure 3 5 dependency analysis of ventilation demand if less influential factors are omitted cq is generally considered a function of fr re we and gp 20 c q f f r r e w e g p where we is weber number gp represents the geometric parameters of the chamber generally weber number dominates at relatively low speed and has an effect of preventing gas loss mäkiharju et al 2013 there is no unified description of gp model hence the most valuable aspect of the current velocity range and the scope of engineering application is to explore the dependencies of cq on fr and re to explore this further the current results gas entrainment coefficient required by bnsc are compared with those obtained with the same target gas entrainment coefficient required by establishing the cavity as shown in fig 22 for the sake of comparison we define a unified gas entrainment coefficient cq 21 c q q a u b w l where b w is the width for ship or plate l is the length for ship or plate the dependencies of cq on fr and re are shown in fig 22 a and b overall it seems to be more about fr dependence rather than re in addition the cq range of the current result is close on the order of magnitude to the experiments by mäkiharju et al 2013 amromin et al 2011 and arndt et al 2009 in particular considering that they all adopt beach or cavity locker at the tail hence it suggests that the influence of beach or cavity locker on the ventilation rate required by establishing the cavity is not significant moreover when re changes between the orders of ten thousand and ten million the results of ours and that of mäkiharju et al 2013 amromin et al 2011 and arndt et al 2009 show no unified trend of change however cq does change regularly with respect to fr in particular both the current experiment and the experiment by mäkiharju et al 2013 show that there is a greater gas demand in the smaller fr range which appeared in the large scale experiment mäkiharju et al 2013 but without a specific explanation however it seems that this is not an accident here it is inferred that it may be the effect of gravitational wave modulation mechanism as it is proposed above section 3 1 fig 10 fig 11 hence it has the gravitational wave interference region the interval of influence may be related to the geometric model gp when crossing this interference interval it is found that cq seems to have a continuous positive correlation with fr which is reflected in the current experiment and experiments by mäkiharju et al 2013 and arndt et al 2019 it is speculated that this continuous positive correlation may be an fr dependent interval moreover mäkiharju et al 2013 stated that the boundary layer at the back facing step would be turbulence only when fr is greater than 0 7 in small scale experiments except the points inside the black dashed circle all the working conditions represented by the points satisfy the turbulence condition the order of magnitude difference of the points inside the black dashed circle comparing with other points may be due to the difference in laminar entrainment and turbulent entrainment where the restraint effect of surface tension on gas shedding for the former condition is obviously higher than that of the latter hence fr dependence here should be based on a framework that satisfies turbulence 4 summary and outlook in order to analyze and predict the transition condition of cavity patterns a ventilated cavity model ship is investigated in a calm water towing tank under a moderate froude fr number range and ventilation conditions the area covered by the ventilated cavity as well as its closure modes growth and shedding characteristics and distribution of cavity morphology and its transition mechanism are closely investigated the main findings and conclusions are as follows according to the criteria of the cavity length formation logarithmic growth and maturity three stages are found with the increase in ventilation rate at fixed froude number fr based on the classification of morphology and bubble dynamics the cavity patterns are named discrete foamy flow dff initial coalescing cavity icc and bottle neck stable cavity bnsc corresponding to the formation and maturity stage however there are four distinct topological cavity features in logarithmic growth stage namely jet growth cavity jgc bifurcation growth cavity bgc meniscus growth cavity mgc and waterfall growth cavity wgc the cavity patterns of various geometric shapes dff icc jgc bgc mgc wgc and bnsc are mapped under different fr and cq based on observation the shedding and closure characteristics of the four types of cavity jgc bgc mgc and wgc in the logarithmic growth stage show great distinction the closure patterns of angle closure smooth adherent closure and open closure corresponds to jgc bgc and mgc and wgc respectively the shedding patterns of small periodic oscillation shedding group rips evolution shedding and wave pinch off shedding corresponds to jgc bgc and mgc and wgc respectively intersection angle ß is used to represent the topological difference of cavity jgc bgc mgc and wgc in the logarithmic growth stage three hypothetical mechanisms namely rectangular jet dominant pressure difference dominant and wave pinch off dominant are put forward to explain the formation and transformation of jgc bgc and mgc and wgc respectively the mathematical model of logarithm can relatively well relate the relationship between cavity length and ventilation rate and it is found that fr 2 may have a certain universality in governing cavity growth under all the experimental conditions a simplified control body model is used to approximate the effect of cavity closure on gas demand the difference in gas entrainment rate due to closure mode represents remarkable on the overall gas entrainment rate by comparing the results of our experiment gas entrainment coefficient required by bnsc with those of similar experiments gas entrainment coefficient required by establishing the cavity it is found that the gas demand is more like fr dependence which needs to meet turbulence condition and fr exceeds a certain range last but not the least due to the lack of advanced measuring equipment the hypothesis of the formation and transformation mechanism rectangular jet dominant pressure difference dominant and wave pinch off dominant need to be confirmed further where numerical calculation cucinotta et al 2019 2018 may be considered for further analysis as regard the influence of trim value on cavity patterns first of all two issues should be clarified 1 the cavity is obtained at the stage of smooth run of ship where trim fluctuation is negligible and the average trim value is less than 3 2 the cavity is obtained at the state of force equilibrium for ship motion under the given freedom which also means that the force of the cavity is balanced hence based on the above condition we ignore the influence of trim on cavity patterns however it does not mean that the trim has nothing to do with cavity patterns if the single effect of trim on the cavity is to be strictly investigated ventilation experiments under the fixed trim value can be conducted however cavity obtained under fixed trim means that the ship does not have a freedom and can t be derived to the actual state of ship moving in the free surface with freedom unlike water tunnel experiment where plate s motion balance is not taken into consideration when it comes to the existence of freedom of the ship another concern is introduced here which is the coupling of the cavity and the motion of ship this coupling on motion is a dynamic equilibrium state achieved by the interaction between the cavity and the ship hence if the coupling effect on ship motion can t be proved as a weak force the results obtained by ship under fixed trim may be hard to be strictly linked to the influence on cavity patterns of course rigorous research is also necessary to analyze this factor in depth in the future limited by the test condition the cavitation number of the cavity is not given here in fact it is not only the volume balance of the cavity that needs attention but also the pressure balance represented by the cavitation number cavitation number as one basic variable connecting cavity length and froude number shows different characteristic law from that of volumetric flow rate which is sufficiently discussed in the research by barbaca et al 2019 2017 in particular when fr exceeds a certain threshold cavitation number under fixed cavity length does not change with fr barbaca et al 2019 while for fully formed cavity there is a linear transfer relationship between volume flow rate and cavitation number barbaca et al 2017 hence it is expected to be included in the later experiments due to the limitation of the length of an article this paper does not give drag reduction rate information under different cavity states we hope to carry out this part further in the future declaration of competing

liquid flow visualization hydrodynamics 1 introduction drag reduction for surface ships is an important and continuous research topic efforts to reduce drag by optimizing the hull have been ongoing since ships have been in existence a number of studies dawson 1977 dejhalla et al 2001 jensen 1989 to reduce the pressure component of resistance through the potential flow theory have been well applied to the hull design however achievement in reducing the friction component of resistance is still not well applied in engineering marc perlin perlin et al 2016 reviewed a number of active and passive approaches to reduce the frictional resistance for boundary layer flow including engineered surface methods riblets large eddy breakup devices and superhydrophobic surfaces additive methods polymer and gas injection and morphological alteration methods air bubbles kumagai et al 2015 air layers and partial cavities however among these methods the most robust and promising method to be successfully applied to ships might be partial cavity drag reduction pcdr which was first developed by butuzov 1966 using an initial theoretical model for air cavities under a plate the physical essence of this drag reduction method lies in the formation of air layer in the boundary near surface which leads to changes in boundary layer states e g density viscosity and velocity distribution ceccio 2010 ferrante and elghobashi 2004 murai 2014 murai et al 2008 qin et al 2017 and thus greatly reduces the wall shear stress many previous studies amromin 2012 ceccio 2010 lay et al 2010 zverkhovskyi 2014 have found that a complete cavity covering the surface of an object can almost reduce the frictional resistance of this part to zero ventilated partial cavity ship also known as air cavity ship acs is generally suitable for flat bottom ship in which cavities are formed in a chamber with a front step generally the pcdr method consists of a back facing step cavitator mäkiharju et al 2013 qin et al 2019 zverkhovskyi 2014 creating a physical recess for the cavity some of which contains a beach step mäkiharju et al 2013 or cavity locker amromin et al 2011 used to change cavity s closure state considering the universality of the pcdr method the research in this study does not take the addition of a cavity locker into consideration although there is no precise physical definition of the arrangement of height of back facing step the difference between partial cavity and air layer is mainly due to the arrangement of ventilation mode where the mode of hole ventilation is adopted by the latter in the pioneering work by callenaere et al 2001 natural partial cavitation was analyzed with a series of step height 0 14 mm at a fixed incoming velocity and it is found that the height of step is one of the variables that has influence on the stability of partial cavity but not a parameter to distinguish air layer or partial cavity in order to gain a fundamental physical understanding of ventilated cavity flow in the boundary layer a variety of potential flow studies and water tunnel experiments were performed on flat plate cavity flow similar to the ventilated supercavitation flow franc and michel 2006 jiang et al 2019 2018 karn et al 2016 savchenko 2001 the cavity morphology gas entrainment law closure mode and dependence of gas demand on these factors in the boundary layer show different characteristics under different working conditions but there are many issues needed further exploration in particular one of the key problems in this technology has not been clearly revealed that is how to determine the gas demand for establishing a ventilated cavity and the relationship between its influencing factors arndt et al 2009 ceccio 2010 previous studies mäkiharju et al 2013 zverkhovskyi 2014 have focused on the gas demand cavity shape closure mode and other issues when the cavity reaches the complete coverage of the chamber however the evolution characteristics of a single cavity from early formation to a certain coverage state have not been paid enough attention the evolution process of a single cavity is of guiding significance to the design of multiple cavities specially considering the limited coverage of a single cavity under the working speed range of the merchant ship amromin 2012 the goal of maximum drag reduction rate with minimum ventilation by multiple cavities is the optimization of the all cavities which may correspond to a certain stage rather than the saturation state of a single cavity three types of stable cavity were found by matveev et al 2009 in an open surface water channel experiment through using a stepped model under a small froude fr number range 0 16 0 37 as fr increases it begins with a single tongue like cavity followed by a double tongue like cavity and finally a square flat cavity the square shaped cavity obtained in the water tunnel experiment by mäkiharju et al 2013 has no great difference in topology between two geometrically scaled plates arndt et al 2009 carried out a plate experimental study in a water tunnel and found that the cavity presented a single tongue shape when fr was less than 0 2 and when fr was beyond 0 41 two extended cavities appeared on both sides a 3 d wall mounted fence as a facing step was used to conduct the water tunnel ventilation experiment by barbaca et al 2017 and it was found that the square like cavity consisting of the stable area and the re entrant jet dominated unstable area was obtained within relatively high fr range owing to the experimental conditions such as the blocking effect of the water tunnel geometry of the plate inconsistent incoming flow and ventilation conditions there is no unified conclusion on the distribution of cavity morphology and the mechanism of morphology transition is not well understood based on the potential flow theory four two dimensional closure patterns cavity with a pulsating re entrant jet cavity with a smooth attachment unstable cavity and unclosed cavity were proposed by matveev 2003 through the analysis of the ventilation flow behind a wedge callenaere et al 2001 have done a series of groundbreaking work on re entrant jet induced cloud cavitation instability and its surrounding regimes the classified non auto oscillating type cavity i e long cavity and thin cavities with periodic re entrant jet is closely related to the practical application of large scale drag reduction where no re entrant jet was observed and gas shedding was continuous without overall oscillating in terms of long cavity but the tail presented a periodic behavior dominated by re entrant jet for the latter one for ventilation experiments behind a gas jet cavitator jiang et al 2018 or 2 d foils michel 1984 the cavity presented overall instability namely pulsating cavities under some working condition where the gas water interface has distinct periodic wavy waves defined systematically by michel and franc franc and michel 2006 michel 1984 mäkiharju et al 2013 did not observe significant gas shedding at the cavity interface and attributed the dominant mechanism of gas loss to the gas entrainment at the cavity closure hence proposed the hypothesis of three potential gas shedding modes cavity impinge re entrant jet and viscous forces stretches based on flat plate experiments re entrant jet entrainment mechanism and interfacial wave dominant entrainment mechanism were put forward by zverkhovskyi 2014 who also attributed the gas leakage to the cavity closure region cavities with re entrant jet behavior as the primary mechanism of gas entrainment was observed by barbaca et al 2018 in the water tunnel ventilated flow over a wall mounted fence in an up to date 2 d wall mounted fence water tunnel experiment barbaca et al 2019 thoroughly discussed cavities shedding behavior where re entrant jet wave pinch off and turbulence induced break up dominated mechanisms are responsible for large scale and small scale shedding under different stages with moderate to large fr range the main causes of gas leakage are generally known as cavity closure region under a moderate froude number range which is recognized by these researchers however the understanding of gas entrainment characteristics and closure mode is still insufficient especially the water tunnel experiment is different from the towing tank where the water is still in particular the blocking effect in towing tank on cavity closure can be neglected which may have a relatively obvious influence on the result such as closure mode the condition of cavity transition karn et al 2016 in the water tunnel in addition the deeper water condition makes up for water tunnel s inability to apply the deep water gravity wave theory which is close to the actual state what s more in order to ensure the relative motion water in a water tunnel has a momentum which is obviously contrary to the actual situation especially the momentum of water is a necessary condition to trigger a re entrant jet the bifurcation behavior of the cavity was found when gas was injected via hole into a cross flow by vigneau et al 2001a 2001b mäkiharju et al 2017 and mäkiharju and ceccio 2018 quantitatively analyzed the topological characteristics of the bifurcation represented by the spreading angle in their study the value of spreading angle is the result of the drag equilibrium of the cavity pressure and the convection of the boundary layer on the cavity which is affected by factors such as froude number and reynolds number of the inflow the condition of the injected gas and the hole parameters in a 3 d wall mounted fence ventilated cavity flow experiment conducted by barbaca et al 2017 bifurcation also occurred at the end of the cavity by means of slot ventilation and the results showed that froude number was an dominant parameter leading to the transition however the distribution of such topological features the nature of topological differences and the physical mechanism behind the transformation of topological features have not been well proposed the empirical or semi empirical dimensionless relationship between morphology of ventilated supercavitation cavity and gas demand has been thoroughly derived and established epshtein 1973 logvinovich 1972 spurk 2002 however many efforts are needed on ventilated boundary flows to support similar conclusion a positive correlation between cavity length and gas demand was found by a series of previous ventilated cavity model ship experiments cucinotta et al 2017 jin ho 1999 latorre 1997 but there lacks a relatively appropriate mathematical model to determine the relationship in addition more favorable evidence is needed to analyze the dependence of gas demand on flow conditions such as froude number and reynolds number mäkiharju et al 2013 moreover it was found by mäkiharju et al 2013 that when froude number was relatively small in large scale experiment the gas demand required to form a complete covered cavity increased sharply which similar results have not been found in congeneric studies is it a coincidence or governed by some mechanism still needs to be explored restricted to experimental conditions the experimental data measured by ventilated cavity ship are relatively insufficient in this work with the target of analyzing and predicting the transition condition of cavity patterns we focus on the evolution characteristics of the ventilated cavity flow from early formation to complete coverage as well as the flow patterns and its distribution under a broad range of velocities and ventilation rate the closure modes gas entrainment law essence of topological features and transition mechanism of morphology are particularly concerned the dependence of gas demand on closure mode and incoming flow condition is paid close attention therefore we carry out ventilated partial cavity experimental study in a calm water towing tank using a model ship the remainder of this paper is organized into the following three sections the experimental conditions are introduced in section 2 in section 3 1 the cavity patterns are described in detail closure and shedding characteristics of cavity are given in section 3 2 the essence of topological features and the hypothesis of the formation and transformation mechanism dominating the morphology of cavity are analyzed in section 3 3 in section 3 4 the quantitative analysis of cavity growth curves is demonstrated the dependency of gas demand required for a complete covering cavity on the incoming flow condition is presented in section 3 5 finally the conclusion and perspectives are presented in section 4 2 experimental methods the experiments were performed at the key aviation scientific and technological laboratory of high speed hydrodynamic in special vehicle research institute of china the dimensions of the water tank are 500 m length 6 5 m width 5 m depth the trailer has a towing capacity of 0 22 m s with a precision of 0 1 0 3 during steady operation the entire system fig 1 consisted of the ship model gas tank and pipe valve system camera system trailer and data acquisition system the original ship model as shown in fig 2 a was 3 m long and 0 85 m wide with a fixed displacement of 120 kg δ the ship model had a smooth surface apparent roughness height within 0 015 mm and met the allowable error standard specified in cb z 244 88 glider model resistance test method on the basis of the original ship model a flat gas chamber was chipped at the bottom of the ship and a step was set at the ventilation slot to form the ventilation ship model vsm as shown in fig 2 b c the appearance of the hypothetical cavity formed after ventilation is shown in fig 2 c in order to restrict the cavity from floating up on either side of the ship there are two skegs on both sides of the bottom of the gas chamber as shown in fig 2 e the main body of the model was composed of wood and two plexiglas plates were used as observation windows to observe the cavity as shown in fig 2 b the ship model had three degrees of freedom of motion during the towing longitudinal and vertical movement and longitudinal rotation the tanks were full of pure industrial oxygen the gas flow rate expressed in this paper is translated into standard atmospheric pressure 1 bar and standard temperature 273 k after passing through the valve the gas was connected with the mass flow meter and flowed to the rectangular pressure chamber plenum on the bottom of the ship through the gas pipe there was a slot vent on one side of the plenum and the gas flowed to the bottom of the ship via the slot as shown in fig 2 d e the alicat mcr d5m mass flow controller with a full scale of 1000 slpm has a maximum overall measurement uncertainty of 2 the trailer and data acquisition system consisted of a trailer single component force transducer pull wire displacement sensor tilt angle sensor and data acquisition system the towing speed and model ship s drag sinkage and trim value were collected synchronously through the data acquisition system the specific parameters of each sensor are shown in table 1 the target ventilation rate was set prior to towing when the ventilation rate was stable the towing started one entire towing operation can be divided into acceleration smooth operation reach the target speed of trailer and deceleration three periods data during the smooth run of ship within the smooth operation period was taken as valid value when the surface waves dissipated the next round of towing began the specific parameters of vsm and experimental conditions are summarized in table 2 one example of a typical operation u 5 00 m s qa 300 slpm is shown in fig 3 including the three periods of the trailer described above as well as the corresponding drag and the motion state represented by the trim value of vsm due to the robust dynamic stability of vsm in other working conditions the trim fluctuation during smooth run of ship is similar to the example here fig 3 that is the fluctuation can be ignored and the average trim value is no more than 3 owing to the curved feature of the bow the height of the step is not evenly distributed in the span wise direction but varied from 9 mm to 12 mm and averaged at 10 mm based on the numerical approach refer to the supplemental information the boundary layer thickness at the position of the step is close to h 10 mm and the boundary layer of the incoming flow upstream of the step reaches turbulence under all towing conditions to image the cavity two same charge coupled device ccd cameras point gray gs3 u3 51s5m c were installed on the ship s deck through a metal bracket and were concentrated to the bottom of the ship s plexiglas viewing window labelled watch window 1 and watch window 2 as shown in fig 2 b two cameras with a maximum recording speed of 75 fps started and ended shoot at the same time the combination of the two cameras was designed to capture the entire view of cavity at the bottom of the trailer as shown in fig 4 there were several scattered fluorescent lamps as the light source since the gas liquid interface was obvious after ventilation there was no special optical treatment here and the shape of cavity was directly captured by ccd cameras the cameras started to shoot when the ship started to move and the shooting time lasted from tens of seconds to several minutes when the ship s drag is stable after ventilation for a certain period of time more often it s about 3 min after the start of ventilation images with less fluctuation of cavity shape in a continuous period of time are selected as the effective cavity shape less fluctuation means that the images are corresponding to the period of smooth run of ship fig 3 excluded those under acceleration of trailer early smooth operation and deceleration of trailer period the time average of multiple effective images at least 15 images are grayscale processed as raw photo every single raw photo is processed by the procedure of image binarization with the same threshold value one example process of determining cavity area and boundary is shown in fig 4 the cavity area extracted from the binary images are averaged as the final cavity area s cavity which the maximum uncertainty is no more than 5 the uncertainty obtained here is based on the relative fluctuation between single cavity area and the average one s cavity see fig 5 the following physical parameters such as ventilation rate qa and towing velocity u are key variables these variables are converted into the following dimensionless forms gas entrainment coefficient cq froude number based on ship length fr reynolds number based on ship length re and equivalent cavity length coefficient l c 1 c q q a u w h 2 f r u g l 3 r e u l ρ μ 4 l c s cavity s where g is the gravitational acceleration ρ and μ are the density and viscosity of water respectively the fr based on ship length is selected because it can represent the change in friction resistance of the ship model and the length of cavity since the cavity is not uniformly distributed in the span wise direction to be specific l c reflects the dimensionless area coefficient rather than length of the cavity but the difference is ignored here for the sake of simplifying the analysis 3 result and discussion 3 1 flow pattern of ventilated cavity based on the classification of morphology and bubble dynamics several distinct flow patterns of cavity are founded with increasing ventilation rate under fixed fr specifically as shown in fig 6 the selected images a b c d e are typical patterns of cavity flow namely discrete foamy flow dff fig 6 a initial coalescing cavity icc fig 6 b meniscus growth cavity mgc fig 6 c and bottle neck stable cavity bnsc fig 6 d and e when the ventilation rate is gradually increased with fr 0 92 u 5 00 m s dff contains a large number of foamy clusters with feature length concentrated in the range 10 100 mm foam is mainly presented in the form of free ribbons which do not keep a strong connection with each other and thus the gas liquid interface is very clear the location of the vent works as a facing step where flow separation and re attachment occurs le et al 1997 and the ejected gas tends to coalesce into larger bubbles foam coalescing bubbles and a cavity with a continuous interface coexist for icc this is the initial status of cavity transition from dff to a continuous and transparent cavity at the rear of the transparent cavity there are many bubbles on the order of 10 mm or smaller which make the interface blurred behind the bubble group is the falling foam a similar phenomenon occurs before the formation of a clear interface ventilated supercavitation flow jiang et al 2018 2019 karn et al 2016 mgc is a visually distinguishable transparent cavity the rear of the cavity is not flat but short in the middle and long on the sides similar to a crescent moon hence it is named meniscus growth cavity the transparent interface of bnsc is extended to the stern the cavity completely covers the bottom of the ship which has the most stability and the greatest drag reduction potential interestingly it is found that the tail of the cavity is not flat a curved growth stagnation zone is formed on both rear sides of the cavity which does not vary with the ventilation rate the shape of the cavity tail resembles the neck of a vase hence the name bottle neck stable cavity the existence of stagnation zone is highly suspected to be resulted by the strong vortex excited by the divergent wave together with the stern wave which has a typical angle along the motion direction on both sides of the ship the strong vortex tends to be an external disturbance to the cavity and result in the discontinuity of the cavity at the stern region of the bottom hence the growth stagnation zone of the cavity is formed based on the criterion of the dimensionless cavity length l c the growth of the cavity in the near hull experienced formation logarithmic growth and maturity three stages with increasing ventilation rate under fixed fr three stages corresponding to the evolution characteristics of the cavity regime namely discrete foamy initial coalescence logarithmic growth and stable form is illustrated in fig 7 in the formation stage the ventilation rate is quite low gas in the water exits as individual discrete foam as the number and concentration of bubbles are insufficient to reach certain threshold value of coalescence when the ventilation rate increases beyond threshold the aggregation effect of high concentration bubbles on gas liquid flow dominates with a tendency of initial coalescence of a transparent interface as the ventilation rate continues to increase it quickly moves from the formation stage to the logarithmic growth stage at this stage the cavity growth rate is very fast and even a slight increase in the ventilation rate can lead to a significant increase in cavity length subsequently when the ventilation rate increases to a saturation value the cavity almost reaches a non incremental equilibrium in coverage area between growth and shedding and presents stable form in morphology since the bottom of the gas chamber is a continuous plane all the way to the stern and the size of the ship is small relative to the tank the growth of the cavity is neither limited by the geometric conditions of the ship nor the blocking effect but the finite bottom area under this condition it enters the maturity stage where the state of cavity is stable in coverage area and morphology when ventilation rate is around or above the saturation value when fr varies from 0 37 to 1 10 in the formation and maturity stages the corresponding flow patterns of dff icc and bnsc remain nearly the same however there are four distinct topological cavity features as shown in fig 8 in the logarithmic growth stage i e jet growth cavity jgc bifurcation growth cavity bgc meniscus growth cavity and waterfall growth cavity wgc corresponding to fig 8 a d respectively jgc appears when fr is at 0 37 u 2 00 m s the tail of jgc shares some similarity in shape to that of the velocity distribution surface formed by plane jet where the shedding bubble group is mainly concentrated in the crater the central region of the tail as the ventilation rate increases the size of the cavity increases slightly but the shape keeps close when fr is increased to 0 55 u 3 00 m s a bifurcation appears in the middle of the entire cavity the middle region is occupied by water pocket and the cavity extends on the two sides the cavity with a middle vacancy and two thick and long branches on the sides resembles a swallow s tail hence it is named bgc it s worth noting that in the water tunnel 3 d fence experiment by barbaca et al 2017 the phenomenon of bifurcation together with the splitting of re entrant jet also appeared at the end of the cavity with slot ventilation under a moderate fr range more interestingly the current result shows that the bifurcation point in the middle has little change with the ventilation rate under fixed fr where similar result also occurred in the experiment by barbaca et al 2017 mgc appears when fr is approximately in the range of 0 74 0 92 u 4 00 5 00 m s when fr is above 0 92 u 5 00 m s wgc appears with a flat tail and the behavior of uniform gas pocket shedding which is similar to a waterfall the most noteworthy feature of wgc is that the entire cavity shows a tendency of a contracting abdomen that is the cavity is concentrated in the inner region and the two sides show symmetrically curved vacancies based on various flow patterns of cavity described above we obtain the cavity regime map under different fr and cq as shown in fig 9 it seems evident that the transition of cavity morphology in the logarithmic growth stage tends to be fr dominant which will be explored in depth in section 3 3 the red dotted line is the approximate boundary line of the transition between the logarithmic growth and maturity stages the acronyms of the seven cavity flow patterns and their corresponding names are summarized in table 3 the minimum ventilation rate required to form the bnsc is named the minimum morphology saturated rate msr min msr min is an approximate value obtained from the difference of the test points in the regime map fig 9 it s worth noting that the definition of msr min here is consistent with the definition of minimum rate of ventilation required to establish a fully courage cavity by mäkiharju et al 2013 arndt et al 2009 and amromin et al 2011 it is found that msr min does not show a simple positive correlation with fr the relationship between msr min and fr is illustrated in fig 10 when fr is lower than 0 74 msr min is negatively correlated with fr followed by a positive correlation when fr is greater than 0 74 here the relatively greater needing of msr min for fr lower than 0 74 may be explained by gravity wave modulation mechanism which has been widely found in water tunnel experiments that it may be an important factor limiting cavity growth arndt et al 2009 ceccio 2010 mäkiharju et al 2013 zverkhovskyi 2014 according to this hypothesis the limiting cavity length l limit is limited to half of the linear gravity wavelength λ which the quantization relation can be expressed by simplified formula 5 5 l limit 0 5 λ u 2 π g according to the above gravity wave modulation mechanism a sketch of the virtual interaction between the linear gravity wave and the ship is presented in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that when fr is less than 0 55 the gravity waves are all closed in the bottom of the ship this signifies that in this fr range less than 0 55 the gravity waves have an inhibitory effect on the formation of the cavity however this hindrance effect can be counteracted if given enough ventilation rate this mechanism may reveal why the v shaped swerve fig 10 occurs 3 2 closure and shedding characteristics for a stratified horizontal flow with less dense overlying fluid its interface will become unstable when there are fluctuations on the interface specifically for the stratified gas liquid flow here when instability occurs it will be manifested in two ways the gas entrainment at the interface and the tail of the cavity the overall oscillation behavior of the cavity in our experiment the overall oscillation behavior of the cavity was not observed which was found by mäkiharju et al 2013 and arndt et al 2009 in the perturbed flow experiment that is to say the external interference to the cavity shape is relatively small here and the cavity exists in a quasi steady state with continuous shedding of gas pockets under different fr the shedding behavior of cavity also shows great distinction here we focus on the shedding and closure characteristics of the four types of cavity jgc bgc mgc and wgc in the logarithmic growth stage as shown in fig 12 where the typical variation states of a time series are selected for fr 0 37 jgc as shown in fig 12 a there is a coronal rip in the middle of the tail then the rip is torn followed by the release of large gas bags and finally the tail is restored to its original state at 0 10 s however it does not mean that all shedding periods are 0 1 s as shown here but they are close on the order of magnitude the tail of the cavity which undergoes a small amplitude periodic oscillation is closed with an angle to the underside the small amplitude local periodic oscillation behavior can be regarded as a metastable state which is similar to the thin non auto oscillating cavity regime classified by barbaca et al 2019 and callenaere et al 2001 but without larger scale oscillations and the presence of re entrant jet flow the summarized pattern diagram is shown in fig 13 a it should be noted that the angle closure defined here is similar to the type 1 cavity proposed by matveev 2003 tail of type 1 cavity has a certain angle with the wall surface and is accompanied by pulsating re entrant jet however although small scale of periodic oscillations are observed in the tail here there is no sign of pulsating re entrant jet as fr increases to 0 55 bgc as shown in fig 12 b several small rips occurs at the end of the cavity as the annotated rip 1 5 shows and then rips enlarge finally a portion of the cavity separates from the tail at the thinnest point of the connection and becomes an independent gas pocket the evolution process of the rips indicates that the surface tension and viscous force is dominant for the behavior of gas stretching ligament and the trend of shrinking cavity the gas entrainment mechanism here is similar to the entrainment mechanisms for low viscosity plunging jets kiger and duncan 2012 mäkiharju et al 2013 which the jet is segregated into a stream of discrete droplets but still with a contiguous ligament the tail of the cavity whose shedding is dominated by group rips is smoothly closed on the bottom the summarized pattern diagram is shown in fig 13 b the closure mode here smooth adherent closure is consistent with type 2 cavity proposed by matveev 2003 which is an ideal closure pattern when fr increase to 0 74 mgc as shown in fig 12 c the partial gas pocket is pulled out of the tail and cut off at the shortest joint the gas entrainment here is consistent with the phenomenon of wave pinch off which is dominated by capillary gravity waves proposed by barbaca et al 2018 and sene 1988 in their study the capillary waves are formed at the interface and its typical length is considered to be related to the turbulence intensity of the gas liquid interface when the typical length of capillary gravity waves can be compared with the cavity thickness the cavity is easy to fracture the wavelengths observed here are about 20 40 mm which are similar to the that of observed by mäkiharju et al 2013 10 mm small scale plate and rotte et al 2015 5 20 mm in their experiments the tail of the cavity is still closed smoothly to the wall as fig 13 c shows however as fr increases to 1 10 wgc the shedding strength becomes very severe as shown in fig 12 d specifically at the tail of the cavity the shedding is present to be the mode of layer peeling in the span wise direction with the same level as the dashed line highlights in fig 12 d the gas entrainment mode is consistent with the wave pinch off mechanism but it is obviously severe enough to shape the tail of the cavity a flat tail the intense and fragmented behavior of gas shedding leads to the realization that in addition to wave pinch off mechanism there may be coupled with turbulent boundary layer induced break up which is similar to the procedure of eddies decomposition however as it was found by barbaca et al 2019 in the water tunnel experiment the single effect of turbulence induced break up on shedding is characterized by the behavior of irregular small scale of gaseous structures which is slightly different from the relatively orderly shedding here in the span wise direction the shedding behavior in span wise direction here makes one aware of the transverse waves part of the kelvin wave which are triggered by the motion of the ship similar to the behavior here it is obvious that the transverse wave propagation at the gas liquid interface of ship bottom is one source of force on decomposing cavity that cannot be ignored there are reasons to think that the two mechanisms wave pinch off and turbulence induced break up together dominate the gas shedding but the relative forces between the two mechanisms are currently indistinguishable the tail of wgc does not show the characteristics of close i e open closure and the summarized pattern is shown in fig 13 d open closure is similar to type 4 cavity proposed by matveev 2003 which the cavity is not closed and a large amount of gas is needed to extend a certain length 3 3 topological features and transition hypothesis as mentioned above section 3 1 fig 8 there are four distinct cavity jgc bgc mgc and wgc in the logarithmic growth stage here we try to illustrate the possible topological features of the morphological differences and put forward the hypothesis of the formation and transformation mechanism which dominates the morphology of cavity specifically the difference of cavity morphology can be represented by the geometric relationship shown in fig 14 a where the four colored solid lines with intersection of the x axis x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 are the two dimensional outline sketch of the cavity corresponding to jgc bgc mgc and wgc the tangent line l1 4 is set at the half upper contour of the cavity and the angle of intersection ß 1 4 is obtained by the tangent line and the positive x axis the intersection angle ß is the mathematical quantity used to represent the topological difference of cavity the obtuse angle range represents the range of jgc and for the acute angle range as the angle increases it represents the transition of the cavity from bgc to mgc and wgc as shown in fig 14 b the physical significance of the intersection angle may be related to the force balanced state of the cavity here it is quite difficult to quantify the relationship between ß and specific physical variables however the study on the topological features of gas layer via single hole injection by lee 2015 and mäkiharju et al 2017 can be used as a reference specifically in their study the sweep angle of the gas branch is the result of the drag equilibrium of the cavity pressure and the convection of the boundary layer on the cavity which is related to the speed of incoming flow the cross sectional area of the gas branch and the pressure inside the cavity here three hypothetical mechanisms i e rectangular jet dominant pressure difference dominant and wave pinch off dominant are put forward as shown in fig 15 which leads to the morphology formation and transformation of the cavity as the simplicity it can be considered that a rectangular plane jet flow is set into the low speed airflow within the cavity that is the composite semi confined space plane jet flow as shown in fig 15 a similar simplification is proposed by arndt et al 2009 in analyzing the influence of slot area the central line velocity of the rectangular jet shows x n attenuation with the increase of the distance from slot the longitudinal velocity distribution of the rectangular jet is similar to the semi ellipse or cosine curve which shares some similarity with the tail profile of jgc in shape however due to the limit of current experimental conditions rigorous velocity measurements need to be carried out specifically the boundary of the cavity tail is determined by the velocity distribution or momentum distribution inside the cavity and is the result of the balance between upstream momentum transfer and gas entrainment however the leading effect of the rectangular jet decreases with the increase of the towing velocity u because the initial momentum of the composite jet is positive related with u jet u u jet is the velocity of the ventilated gas flow hence it can be imagined that this mechanism generally dominates when fr is relatively small which can be referred to the cavity morphology obtained by matveev et al 2009 in the experiment similar to jgc occurred in the lowest fr range the position of cavity closure is also determined by the pressure difference between the gas and liquid phase at the closure specifically the cavity pressure at the closure p cavity is equal to or slightly higher than the static pressure of surrounding flow p water otherwise the cavity will decompose or can not extend over there if the static pressure is higher than closure pressure similar conclusions are also obtained by mäkiharju et al 2013 and zverkhovskyi 2014 which the former found that the pressure peak appears at the bifurcation position of the cavity by numerical results and the latter found that pressure inside the longer cavities is slightly less than the surrounding water by plate experiment here it reveals the bifurcation behavior of bgc and mgc that is bifurcation region as shown in fig 15 b is where the pressure is concentrated the pressure concentrated region on the bottom of hull on the one hand results from the front facing step the step combined with the continuous cavity behind the step create an effect similar to turbulent hydraulic jump and then a pressure peak appears at the end of the cavity le et al 1997 mortazavi et al 2016 on the other hand is an inherent phenomenon on the bottom of the stepped ship flow separation is formed behind the step but the separation zone is far away from 6 times of step height and pressure peak zone occurs in the reattachment zone doustdar and kazemi 2019 hence the cavity gets blocked in the middle region in addition there is wall attachment effect on the two sides which makes the velocity of airflow deflected to the sides and two thick branches form it is necessary to satisfy certain towing velocity conditions when pressure difference becomes significant so the transition from jgc to bgc and mgc occurs when fr 0 5 0 9 similarly it should recall that in the experiment by matveev et al 2009 fr condition satisfying the cavity similar to mgc is beyond and next to the range of jgc it is important to note that negative cavitation numbers will occur when fr is quite low and the volume balance of the corresponding cavity is different from the above pressure balance pattern matveev and miller 2011 even if the injection is stopped the formed cavity can theoretically continue to exist indefinitely the mode of zero entrainment rate is considered to be related to self circulating flow inside the cavity eventually neither of the above mechanisms rectangular jet dominant and pressure difference dominant becomes important when the gas entrainment rate at the end of the cavity is very intense as shown in fig 15 c only the cavity with enough thickness and momentum can survive from the strong wave pinch off effect otherwise it will be swept away which shapes the cavity tail flat this strong gas entrainment effect usually occurs at high fr range and it explains why the cavity is particularly thick when fr 1 10 as shown in fig 8 d as described early section 3 2 there are two mechanisms turbulent induced break up and wave pinch off that coexist and dominate the gas shedding the breaking force on gas shedding by the above mechanisms in boundary layer is obviously more intense with the increase of fr the increasing turbulence energy under higher fr is converted into the force on breaking the closure of gas cavity down into smaller and smaller gas pockets or independent bubble which is similar to the procedure of eddies breaking the amplitude of transverse waves part of the kelvin wave excited by the ship motion is also more significant the propagation of transverse waves at the gas liquid interface leads disturbance to the stable existence of cavity under this condition only the interface of cavity with a greater continuity or momentum can survive in a balance of supply and loss turbulence induced break up works like to make the end of the cavity more brittle while the wave pinch off mechanism works as a final scissors cutting the cavity at the weakest connection which shapes cavity like a square again reference can be found from the results by matveev et al 2009 similar to the wgc which is under the largest fr intervals all three mechanisms exist simultaneously and only in different fr intervals they play a dominant role in fact due to the inconsistent experimental conditions and complex physical mechanism involved there is no unified consensus on the current understanding of flow patterns fig 16 presents the typical flow patterns obtained by some investigators in the experiment with the same research objective overall flow patterns are scattered but there seems to be some meaningful clues on those trends specifically the flow patterns in the current experiment as shown in fig 16 a are also found by other investigators but are dispersedly existed the three flow patterns fig 16 a1 jgc fig 16 a3 mgc and fig 16 a4 mgc we obtained were also found by matveev et al 2009 fig 16 b1 b2 and b3 in their water channel experiment but their fr range 0 16 0 26 and 0 37 is quite different however the order where the three flow patterns appear under fr is consistent which implies that the three hypotheses of transformation mechanism proposed above may be unified in the towing tank and water channel what is more the ventilation rate range of matveev et al 2009 may be still in the logarithmic stage hence there is no bnsc fig 16 a5 in the current results similarly in the 3 d wall mounted fence experiment by barbaca et al 2017 the transition between different flow patterns is dominated by fr as shown in fig 16 d1 d2 and d3 the fr increases gradually which is quite consistent with the current result note that even if the current model has a small trim change less than 3 the comparative result may reveal that the effect of a small trim on the cavity flow pattern is not significant however in the water tunnel experiment by zverkhovskyi 2014 and mäkiharju et al 2013 only one cavity morphology was obtained by using slot ventilation as shown in fig 16 c1 and fig 16 e1 according to their experimental setup their sides of plate are both attached to the tunnel wall which makes the effect of rectangular jet and wall attachment weakened and the three dimensional characteristics of the cavity are not obvious similarly bifurcation behavior of the cavity observed by barbaca et al 2017 2018 appeared in the 3 d inlet flow experiment fig 16 d2 and d3 but did not occur in the 2 d inlet flow experiment fig 16 d4 under the same conditions as for the single pattern as shown in fig 16 c2 obtained by zverkhovskyi 2014 in the towing tank experiment may be due to the limitation of fr range 0 12 0 21 so that other patterns are hidden as regard the study of hole ventilation by mäkiharju et al 2017 it is found that superposition effect of gas layer is very complex spacing number of holes ventilation rate as well as the inflow condition will affect the cavity shape as shown in fig 16 e2 e5 however an interesting finding is that if the number of holes tends to increase and the spacing is closer the final gas layer morphology will tend to fig 16 e3 it seems to be consistent with our findings bnsc fig 16 a5 if the number of holes is infinite the limit case is slot on this condition the saturation form of the cavity gas layer seems to be consistent however the phenomenon of re entrant jet appearing in the experiment conducted by barbaca et al 2017 2018 was not widely reported in similar experiments note that both in the seminal work on re entrant jet instability conducted by callenaere et al 2001 and wall mounted fence flow experiment by barbaca et al 2017 2018 the appearance of re entrant jet is under the condition of high inlet velocity that is analogous to the super critical open channel flow regime condition is met which is not met in most of the above experiments in this regard barbaca et al 2017 also emphasized that no re entrant jet appeared when the inlet flow is similar to the sub critical open channel flow regime in addition there is a slight difference between the towing tank and the water tunnel that is the water in the towing tank is stationary which weakens the trigger condition of re entrant jet that requires a high momentum of water hence re entrant jet is rarely reported in the towing tank experiment however more direct experimental results are needed to support the applicability of the re entrant jet instability phenomenon observed by barbaca et al 2019 in the water tunnel to the towing tank due to the lack of high clarity and high frame rate of the cavity wake images at present rigorous conclusion is expected to be given after improving image approach 3 4 quantitative analysis of cavity growth curves as described above section 3 1 fig 7 it is found that the relationship between cavity length and ventilation rate tends to meet a logarithmic correlation and we try to quantify this relationship here furthermore the influence of the cavity closure mode on gas demand is expected to be analyzed based on the logarithmic correlation fig 17 presents the cavity growth curves for fr in the range from 0 37 to 1 10 the corresponding dimensionless cavity length under different dimensionless ventilation coefficients the cavity growth curve is fitted by logarithmic eq 6 the least squares algorithm is adapted to determine the parameters a b and c based on the experimental data in the formation and logarithmic growth stages hence the curves of five colors in fig 17 with r squared values of 0 89 0 87 0 85 0 95 and 0 98 are obtained the deviations between the experimental data in the above two stages and the curve fitting are acceptable although there is scattering in the maturity stage the growth curve focuses on the differences in the above two stages l c is regarded as a constant in the maturity stage 6 l c f c q a b ln c q c based on the five fitting results above the constants of the logarithmic curve is extracted and analyzed a represents the limit state of cavity length and c represents the starting state of cavity growth thus b containing the impact of fr on l c is linked to the cavity growth process a correlation analysis between fr n and b is conducted as shown in fig 18 the least squares algorithm is adapted to determine the parameters n it can be seen that n 1 9865 reaches the maximum correlation of r 2 0 9626 for simplicity n is taken as 2 therefore we have b 0 326fr 2 the formula for cavity length can be expressed as follows 12 l c f c q a 0 326 f r 2 ln c q c c q m s r min l c constant c q m s r min here n 2 may not be simply a coincidence if we refer to previous relevant studies amromin 2012 butuzov 1966 buyvol 1980 spurk 2002 the dependence of cavity length on fr 2 is derived from potential flow theory for flat wall by butuzov 1966 but this relationship is a limit state and does not include the influence of ventilation rate although amromin et al 2011 and mäkiharju et al 2013 did not find fr dependence in their experiment as the issue will be discussed in section 3 5 it is possible that the fr range they studied is within the interference range moreover the relationship established by mäkiharju et al 2013 and amromin et al 2011 between fr and cq was based on the cq required for a complete coverage of cavity rather than on the change process of cq in the requirement for formation and logarithmic growth of cavity therefore b reflects the effect of fr on the growth process of cavities rather than the effect on cavity in maturity stage as cq of maturity stage is jointly influenced by factors such as the gravity wave modulation effect re and closure modes hence it can be speculated that fr 2 has a certain universality in governing cavity growth under formation and logarithmic growth stage which is expected to be obtained in scaling experiments or similar experiments of course this still needs to be further proved when the cavity is stable the amount of gas entering the cavity is balanced with the amount of gas leaking out the simplified two dimensional cavity is selected as the control body for the gas flux balance analysis of cavity in logarithmic growth stage and maturity stage as shown in fig 19 the leakage can be divided into two regions the interface qout t interface gas entrainment rate due to interface turbulence entrainment and the tail qout c closure gas entrainment rate due to closure gas entrainment these two mechanisms are quite different and the research on interfacial entrainment is relatively sufficient corrsin and kistler 1955 mäkiharju et al 2013 meneveau and sreenivasan 1990 in their study qout t can be estimated by the following equation 13 q o u t t ξ u l c where ξ is the average void fraction and ū is average transfer velocity at gas liquid interface based on their conclusions ξ can be approximated as a constant independent of fr and l c in the logarithmic growth stage here ū is proportional to the towing velocity u the gas flux balance equation of the control body can be expressed as the following equation 14 q i n q o u t t q o u t c ψ u l c q o u t c where qin is rate of gas entering the control body ψ is constant term at a fixed average transfer velocity qout t is proportional to l c while qout c is positive correlation with l c although it is hard to analyze qout c quantitatively its trend is of great concern based the equations 7 11 the gas demand for l c 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 in logarithmic growth stage and l c at maturity stage is given in fig 20 obviously with the growth of l c cq does not have a continuous positive correlation with the fr specifically cq undergoes a v shaped swerve when l c is beyond 0 5 fig 20 is divided into three intervals based on the criterion of closure mode discussed above section 3 2 fig 12 obviously the gas demand corresponding to angle closure is the highest followed by open closure and smooth adherent closure is the lowest it implies that the gas demand is dominated by the closure mode based on fig 20 it is obvious that with the increase of l c the growth rate of qout c is significantly higher than that of qout t the change of qout c when l c ranges from 0 3 to 0 5 0 3 to 0 6 and 0 3 to 0 9 is given by the equations 15 17 15 δ q o u t c l c 0 3 0 5 q o u t c l c 0 5 q o u t c l c 0 3 q i n l c 0 5 5 3 q i n l c 0 3 16 δ q o u t c l c 0 3 0 6 q o u t c l c 0 6 q o u t c l c 0 3 q i n l c 0 6 2 q i n l c 0 3 17 δ q o u t c l c 0 3 0 9 q o u t c l c 0 9 q o u t c l c 0 3 q i n l c 0 9 3 q i n l c 0 3 the inequality is reduced to equal sign for approximate estimation as qout c of l c 0 3 is relatively small the deviation caused by this simplification is acceptable for the sake of comparing the change of qout c qout c is normalized with that of fr 0 37 as the benchmark the result of normalization is given in fig 21 similarly the graph is divided into three intervals by corresponding closure modes considering that when l c reaches more than 0 5 qout c corresponding to this length is much larger than that of qout c in the initial stage such as l c 0 3 in order to simplify the analysis the change of qout c qout c is approximately equivalent to qout c as given in equation 18 18 q o u t c l c δ δ q o u t c l c q o u t c l c δ q o u t c l c where l c δ means that l c plus micro increment over l c further simplifying the analysis it can be considered that qout t under l c 0 5 is relatively small comparing to qout c especially when l c 0 9 hence qout c can be equivalent to qin 19 q i n l c 0 5 q o u t c l c 0 5 δ q o u t c l c 0 5 the simplification equation 19 here can be supported by previous studies in particular mäkiharju et al 2013 did not observe significant interface shedding in both small scale and large scale experiments michel 2006 and savchenko and savchenko 2012 pointed out that the interface shedding dominates only when flow instabilities occur near the gas liquid interface which is similar to the kelvin helmholtz instability but condition satisfied is that the velocity difference of gas liquid interface is relatively large based on the above assumptions as shown in fig 21 especially the curve of l c 0 3 0 9 approximately reflects the gas demand corresponding to different closure modes this association is consistent with the emphasis of closure mode on ventilated supercavitation and flat wall flow proposed by many scholars karn et al 2016 mäkiharju et al 2013 matveev 2003 wu et al 2019 obviously angle closure is considered as a metastable closure mode described in section 3 2 where the gas demand is the highest the optimal smooth adherent closure is considered as the most ideal closure mode where the gas demand is almost one tenth of the angle closure open closure generally occurs when fr is relatively large and its gas demand is roughly three to four times that of optimal smooth adherent closure in addition the experiments by mäkiharju et al 2013 are worth recalling they found that the gas demand required by establishing the cavity is almost three to four times to maintain the cavity here it is speculated that the closure mode corresponding to maintain a cavity might be similar to optimal smooth adherent closure and establish a cavity might be similar to the current open closure 3 5 dependency analysis of ventilation demand if less influential factors are omitted cq is generally considered a function of fr re we and gp 20 c q f f r r e w e g p where we is weber number gp represents the geometric parameters of the chamber generally weber number dominates at relatively low speed and has an effect of preventing gas loss mäkiharju et al 2013 there is no unified description of gp model hence the most valuable aspect of the current velocity range and the scope of engineering application is to explore the dependencies of cq on fr and re to explore this further the current results gas entrainment coefficient required by bnsc are compared with those obtained with the same target gas entrainment coefficient required by establishing the cavity as shown in fig 22 for the sake of comparison we define a unified gas entrainment coefficient cq 21 c q q a u b w l where b w is the width for ship or plate l is the length for ship or plate the dependencies of cq on fr and re are shown in fig 22 a and b overall it seems to be more about fr dependence rather than re in addition the cq range of the current result is close on the order of magnitude to the experiments by mäkiharju et al 2013 amromin et al 2011 and arndt et al 2009 in particular considering that they all adopt beach or cavity locker at the tail hence it suggests that the influence of beach or cavity locker on the ventilation rate required by establishing the cavity is not significant moreover when re changes between the orders of ten thousand and ten million the results of ours and that of mäkiharju et al 2013 amromin et al 2011 and arndt et al 2009 show no unified trend of change however cq does change regularly with respect to fr in particular both the current experiment and the experiment by mäkiharju et al 2013 show that there is a greater gas demand in the smaller fr range which appeared in the large scale experiment mäkiharju et al 2013 but without a specific explanation however it seems that this is not an accident here it is inferred that it may be the effect of gravitational wave modulation mechanism as it is proposed above section 3 1 fig 10 fig 11 hence it has the gravitational wave interference region the interval of influence may be related to the geometric model gp when crossing this interference interval it is found that cq seems to have a continuous positive correlation with fr which is reflected in the current experiment and experiments by mäkiharju et al 2013 and arndt et al 2019 it is speculated that this continuous positive correlation may be an fr dependent interval moreover mäkiharju et al 2013 stated that the boundary layer at the back facing step would be turbulence only when fr is greater than 0 7 in small scale experiments except the points inside the black dashed circle all the working conditions represented by the points satisfy the turbulence condition the order of magnitude difference of the points inside the black dashed circle comparing with other points may be due to the difference in laminar entrainment and turbulent entrainment where the restraint effect of surface tension on gas shedding for the former condition is obviously higher than that of the latter hence fr dependence here should be based on a framework that satisfies turbulence 4 summary and outlook in order to analyze and predict the transition condition of cavity patterns a ventilated cavity model ship is investigated in a calm water towing tank under a moderate froude fr number range and ventilation conditions the area covered by the ventilated cavity as well as its closure modes growth and shedding characteristics and distribution of cavity morphology and its transition mechanism are closely investigated the main findings and conclusions are as follows according to the criteria of the cavity length formation logarithmic growth and maturity three stages are found with the increase in ventilation rate at fixed froude number fr based on the classification of morphology and bubble dynamics the cavity patterns are named discrete foamy flow dff initial coalescing cavity icc and bottle neck stable cavity bnsc corresponding to the formation and maturity stage however there are four distinct topological cavity features in logarithmic growth stage namely jet growth cavity jgc bifurcation growth cavity bgc meniscus growth cavity mgc and waterfall growth cavity wgc the cavity patterns of various geometric shapes dff icc jgc bgc mgc wgc and bnsc are mapped under different fr and cq based on observation the shedding and closure characteristics of the four types of cavity jgc bgc mgc and wgc in the logarithmic growth stage show great distinction the closure patterns of angle closure smooth adherent closure and open closure corresponds to jgc bgc and mgc and wgc respectively the shedding patterns of small periodic oscillation shedding group rips evolution shedding and wave pinch off shedding corresponds to jgc bgc and mgc and wgc respectively intersection angle ß is used to represent the topological difference of cavity jgc bgc mgc and wgc in the logarithmic growth stage three hypothetical mechanisms namely rectangular jet dominant pressure difference dominant and wave pinch off dominant are put forward to explain the formation and transformation of jgc bgc and mgc and wgc respectively the mathematical model of logarithm can relatively well relate the relationship between cavity length and ventilation rate and it is found that fr 2 may have a certain universality in governing cavity growth under all the experimental conditions a simplified control body model is used to approximate the effect of cavity closure on gas demand the difference in gas entrainment rate due to closure mode represents remarkable on the overall gas entrainment rate by comparing the results of our experiment gas entrainment coefficient required by bnsc with those of similar experiments gas entrainment coefficient required by establishing the cavity it is found that the gas demand is more like fr dependence which needs to meet turbulence condition and fr exceeds a certain range last but not the least due to the lack of advanced measuring equipment the hypothesis of the formation and transformation mechanism rectangular jet dominant pressure difference dominant and wave pinch off dominant need to be confirmed further where numerical calculation cucinotta et al 2019 2018 may be considered for further analysis as regard the influence of trim value on cavity patterns first of all two issues should be clarified 1 the cavity is obtained at the stage of smooth run of ship where trim fluctuation is negligible and the average trim value is less than 3 2 the cavity is obtained at the state of force equilibrium for ship motion under the given freedom which also means that the force of the cavity is balanced hence based on the above condition we ignore the influence of trim on cavity patterns however it does not mean that the trim has nothing to do with cavity patterns if the single effect of trim on the cavity is to be strictly investigated ventilation experiments under the fixed trim value can be conducted however cavity obtained under fixed trim means that the ship does not have a freedom and can t be derived to the actual state of ship moving in the free surface with freedom unlike water tunnel experiment where plate s motion balance is not taken into consideration when it comes to the existence of freedom of the ship another concern is introduced here which is the coupling of the cavity and the motion of ship this coupling on motion is a dynamic equilibrium state achieved by the interaction between the cavity and the ship hence if the coupling effect on ship motion can t be proved as a weak force the results obtained by ship under fixed trim may be hard to be strictly linked to the influence on cavity patterns of course rigorous research is also necessary to analyze this factor in depth in the future limited by the test condition the cavitation number of the cavity is not given here in fact it is not only the volume balance of the cavity that needs attention but also the pressure balance represented by the cavitation number cavitation number as one basic variable connecting cavity length and froude number shows different characteristic law from that of volumetric flow rate which is sufficiently discussed in the research by barbaca et al 2019 2017 in particular when fr exceeds a certain threshold cavitation number under fixed cavity length does not change with fr barbaca et al 2019 while for fully formed cavity there is a linear transfer relationship between volume flow rate and cavitation number barbaca et al 2017 hence it is expected to be included in the later experiments due to the limitation of the length of an article this paper does not give drag reduction rate information under different cavity states we hope to carry out this part further in the future declaration of competing

21597,vortex shedding behind hydrofoils with trailing edge truncation was analyzed via numerical simulations the naca0009 hydrofoil was analyzed numerically using the spalart allmaras turbulence model the hydrofoil lift coefficient variation curve was monitored during the simulation and the vortex shedding frequency was obtained as the oscillation frequency of the lift coefficient curve the mode of vortex shedding of the perpendicular truncated and oblique truncated trailing edges were compared the vortex shedding behavior under different oblique truncation angles and the impact of the angle of attack on vortex shedding were also explored the results showed that the oblique truncated trailing edge can substantially change the intensity and frequency of vortex shedding of the hydrofoil furthermore there exists an oblique truncation angle at which the vortex shedding frequency is minimized in the presence of an angle of attack the hydrofoil with oblique truncated trailing edges was less affected by vortex shedding from the tail keywords vortex shedding trailing edge oblique truncation hydrofoil nomenclature c hydrofoil chord length mm b maximum thickness of hydrofoil mm α angle

reynolds number of the flow exceeds a certain critical value the boundary layers on the top and the bottom surfaces of the hydrofoil will experience flow separation and form shear layers these shear layers will further detach from the tail of the hydrofoil in the form of vortices the detached vortices form a periodic vortex array in the wake known as the karmen vortex street this formation will cause the hydrofoil to vibrate and experience periodic fatigue stress additionally propellers used on boats will experience resonance if the frequency of the vortex induced vibration approaches the natural frequency of the propeller such resonance will cause significant damage to the propeller blade therefore analyzing the vortex shedding phenomenon of hydrofoils and exploring how the vortex shedding frequency changes under different conditions is important for the design of marine engineering structures a plethora of plans have been proposed to control karmen vortex streets rashidi et al 2016 post and corke 2004 used plasma actuators to control vortex separation on a national advisory committee for aeronautics naca airfoil with a large angle of attack sung et al 2006 altered the momentum of the flow field in the wake using an electrical discharge in the fluid in the boundary layer gao et al 2015 analyzed the flow behavior of passing cylinders with different roughness values and found that an increasing surface roughness of the cylinder results in a smaller displacement response and higher frequency of vortex shedding huerre and monkewitz 1990 summarized the instability of the flow field around the hydrofoil and the flow characteristics of bluff body wakes prasad and williamson 1997 further summarized the vortex dynamics of the flow passing bluff body based on the instability of the flow field blake and gershfeld 1989 reviewed past studies on hydrofoils and found that the vortex shedding phenomenon is more significant for hydrofoils with a symmetrical or blunt trailing edge ausoni et al 2006 shifted the turbulence transition point upstream to the leading edge of the hydrofoil by changing the surface roughness and found that such a shift results in lower vortex shedding frequency and a lock in phenomenon ausoni et al 2007 with further investigation on vortex shedding researchers have found that the vortex shedding frequency can be changed effectively by altering the geometry of the trailing edge for example the segmented trailing edge designed by rodriguez 1991 and the wave shaped trailing edge designed by tombazis and bearman 1997 can both alleviate hydrofoil vibration donaldson 1956 analyzed the vortex induced vibration of a turbine with trailing edges of different angles and found that the vibration of the turbine blade was reduced substantially when the angle of the trailing edge was set to 30 lockey et al 2006 demonstrated that a v shaped trailing edge could reduce the vortex shedding intensity processing the trailing edge into an oblique shape is a commonly used method to reduce the vibration of the hydrofoil bourgoyne et al 2005 analyzed vortex shedding on an arc shaped hydrofoil with an oblique trailing edge under a high reynolds number flow and determined that vortex shedding was stronger from blunt and oblique trailing edges mosallem 2008 numerically and experimentally analyzed the characteristics of flow past beveled trailing edges attached to flat plates by comparing the vortex shedding phenomenon in trailing edges with bevel angles of 27 and 60 the results showed an asymmetrical wake behind the 27 beveled trailing edge and karman street vortices behind the 60 beveled trailing edge zobeiri et al 2012 compared the vortex shedding from a perpendicular truncated trailing edge and an oblique truncated trailing edge and showed that the collision between upper and lower vortices and the resulting vorticity redistribution were the main reasons for the vibration reduction obtained with the oblique trailing edge with the continuous development of computational technologies the use of numerical simulations has become a solid approach to analyze the vortex shedding from hydrofoils these numerical studies can better reveal the underlying mechanisms behind vortex shedding mulvany et al 2004 simulated the turbulent flow around a naca16 hydrofoil using four turbulence models including standard k ε realizable k ε standard k ω and shear stress transport sst k ω and further validated the reliability of the numerical simulations by comparing their results with those of bourgoyne et al 2003 ausoni et al 2007 analyzed vortex shedding from a two dimensional 2d hydrofoil with a truncated trailing edge via numerical simulations lee et al 2015 numerically analyzed the wake flow from oblique truncated trailing edges of a hydrofoil by combining the hybrid particle mesh method and the vorticity based subgrid scale mode the numerical results showed good agreement with the experimental data hu et al 2020 conducted a series of numerical simulations on the blunt trailing edge hydrofoils and found that vortex shedding frequency increased linearly with the velocity of the incoming flow yao et al 2014 reported that the fluid flow damping of donaldson s trailing edge was significantly greater than that of the blunt trailing edge and no locking phenomenon occurred through direct numerical simulations zeng et al 2019 found that donaldson s trailing edge at high flow rates can significantly reduce the amplitude of vibration caused by vortex shedding this phenomenon is caused by the energy dissipation of vortex collisions from the upper and lower trailing edges sagmo et al 2019 suggested that the separation distance of lateral flow at the trailing edge of the hydrofoil would affect the shedding frequency of the vortex thomareis and papadakis 2017 found that the serrated trailing edge could reduce the energy of vortex shedding by de correlating the spanwise coherence of vortices a considerable amount of work has been performed on the vortex shedding from a static hydrofoil however more in depth analyses are still required to further investigate the formation and development of the trailing vortex behind the hydrofoil and to understand how the formation of vortex is affected by the oblique trailing edge in this study the 2d wake flow and vortex shedding from an oblique truncated trailing edge of a ncac0009 hydrofoil were analyzed via computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations we explored how the lift of the hydrofoil and vortex shedding from the trailing edge were affected by flow velocity oblique truncation angle and angle of attack and determined the relationships between the vortex shedding frequency and these influencing factors the results showed that oblique truncation could change the mode and frequency of vortex shedding from the top and bottom surfaces of the trailing edge of the hydrofoil the circumstances of such effects were related to the oblique truncation angle additionally the intensity of vortex shedding from the hydrofoil with an oblique truncated trailing edge reduced significantly in the presence of an angle of attack no vortex shedding was observed under a small angle of attack 2 mathematical modeling the spalart allmaras s a turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1992 was used for the numerical simulation this model is suitable for simulations requiring high accuracy at the boundary layer e g for simulations required to calculate wing lift in this model the energy and information were assumed to flow only from large scales to small scales in the free shear flow additionally the eddy viscosity coefficient only considered the production term and diffusion terms in the s a equation the reynolds stress is defined as follows 1 u i u j 2 v t s i j s i j u i x j u j x i 2 here eddy viscosity v t is defined as follows 2 v t v f v 1 f v 1 χ 3 χ 3 c v 1 3 χ v v where v is the molecular

of the naca0009 hydrofoil was used as the computational model in this study the length of the cord of the hydrofoil was c 100 mm the thickness of the trailing edge was b 3 22 mm the bevel angle i e angle between the horizontal line and the oblique section of the trailing edge truncation was β the angle of attack of the hydrofoil was α the length of the trailing edge after truncation was δh all parameters are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 2 the computational domain was an 8c 3c rectangular area the left boundary was set as the velocity inlet the flow velocity could be adjusted by changing the physical value imposed on the inlet boundary a corresponding pressure outlet was imposed on the right boundary both the top and bottom boundaries were set as symmetrical planes to ensure that the flow field was sufficiently large the distance from the centerline of the hydrofoil to the top and bottom boundaries were set as 1 5c whereas the distance between the front point of the hydrofoil and the left boundary was set as 2c to simulate the flow field around the hydrofoil in detail the local grid near the surface of the hydrofoil was refined to 5c 1c the mesh used in this computational model consisted of trimmed and prism cells the mesh in the flow field was generated by the trimmed mesh generator with a base size of 0 05c the mesh size in the refined region was 5 of the base size see fig 3 the total number of cells in the computational model was 2 084 801 given that the velocity in the boundary layer of the hydrofoil will experience drastic changes during the real movement a prism mesh was used in the boundary layer of the hydrofoil because the computations performed in this study involved a relatively large reynolds number re 1e6 the first layer of the mesh was generated according to the condition of y 1 in addition the growth ratio and the total number of layers of the prism mesh were set at 1 2 and 20 to ensure a smooth transition from the prism mesh to the external mesh see fig 4 4 convergence verification and simulation results we used a larger domain 13c 6c for the numerical simulation see fig 5 the results are shown in fig 6 the comparisons showed that the results of the two domains are very similar to reduce the grid number and save computation time the smaller domain with the dimension of 8c 3c was used in the present simulation a convergence verification was performed on the mesh number timestep and turbulence model to ensure that the results were accurate specifically a nondimensionalized parameter t tu c was defined in this study and used as the x axis to plot the stabilized lift coefficient c l the c l curves obtained under different simulation conditions were then compared with one another three different mesh strategies with total cell numbers of 1 465 259 2 084 801 and 3 244 258 were used to verify the mesh convergence during the mesh generation process the boundary layer mesh was generated according to y 1 with a total of 20 prism layers and a growth ratio of 1 2 in the simulation the cord of the hydrofoil was c 100 mm b 9 mm the oblique truncation angle of the trailing edge was β 30 δh 0 mm and the angle of attack was α 0 the inlet velocity and the timestep were set at 12 m s and 1e 6 s respectively the final results obtained from the simulation are presented in table 1 and fig 7 the relative errors are displayed in table 1 the results of coarse mesh and medium mesh are compared with those of fine mesh as the cell number increases the relative error gradually decreases the relative errors of c l c l max and f of 1 465 259 cell numbers are 14 44 48 58 and 0 87 respectively those of 2 446 913 cells are 2 38 2 18 and 0 26 respectively this indicates the convergence of the present simulation with respect to the cell number the convergence analysis was further performed on the timestep under this mesh condition the simulations were run at the timesteps of dt 1e 6 and dt 2e 6 the lift data of the hydrofoil obtained using these two timestep values are shown in table 2 and fig 8 the mesh and timestep convergence analyses show that a converging result can be obtained from the simulation using a total mesh number of 2 084 801 and timestep of dt 1e 6 based on the convergence analysis of the mesh timestep and the computational model we used a total cell number of 2 084 801 a timestep of dt 1e 6 s and the s a turbulence model for our numerical simulation the c l curve obtained under these conditions is shown in fig 9 a after the simulation was stabilized c l was found to oscillate periodically the c l curve in the frequency domain could then be obtained via the fourier transform of fig 9 a and the main oscillation frequency was found to be 740 63 hz the lift coefficient curve of the perpendicular truncated trailing edge and oblique truncated trailing edge were obtained after the flow field was stabilized these curves were further analyzed using the fourier transform the results revealed only one frequency peak for the perpendicular truncated trailing edge but three frequency peaks for the oblique truncated trailing edge on the lift coefficient curve this finding indicates that the vortices generated on the top and bottom surfaces of the oblique truncated trailing edge were no longer symmetrical furthermore the vortex shedding mode was different for the perpendicular truncated and oblique truncated trailing edges 5 comparison with experimental results the variations in vortex shedding frequency at the trailing edge were analyzed by placing the hydrofoil in flow fields with different u ref values numerical results were then compared with experimental measurements to validate the reliability of the simulation specifically the same truncated hydrofoil used in zobeiri et al 2012 was used in our validation simulation in this model a trailing edge of 7 length blunt trailing edge δh 0 225 mm was retained in the hydrofoil the cord had the dimensions of c 100 mm and b 9 mm the oblique truncation angle of the trailing edge was β 30 the angle of attack was α 0 the boundary layer of the model was recalculated by using the preset values of u ref a timestep of dt 1e 6 s was used in the simulation the final vortex shedding frequencies obtained from the simulation f pre was compared with the vortex shedding frequencies f exp obtained in zobeiri et al 2012 table 3 as shown in fig 10 the vortex shedding frequency obtained from the simulation was proportional to the incoming flow velocity u ref the relationship between the frequency and velocity was obtained by linear regression as f 67 969u ref 62 475 the vortex shedding frequencies obtained from the simulation were very close to those obtained from the experiments 6 effect of oblique truncation on vortex shedding two oblique truncated hydrofoil models were used for the numerical simulation the first type of hydrofoil had a sharp trailing edge δh 0 mm whereas the other type had a blunt trailing edge δh 0 225 mm both models were placed in a flow field of u ref 12 m s to perform the calculation the oblique truncation angle and the angle of attack were set to β 30 and α 0 respectively the mesh distribution in the boundary layer was the same as the one discussed earlier a timestep of dt 1e 6 s was used in the simulation the results were shown in table 4 as shown in fig 11 the vortex shedding frequency was almost the same for the hydrofoils with blunt and sharp trailing edges at a flow velocity of 12 m s however the maximum value and the fluctuation amplitude of the lift coefficient decreased significantly for the sharp trailing edge additionally the negative lift induced by the oblique truncation further increased for the sharp trailing edge comparison of the vorticity curves in figs 12 and 13 shows that the intensity of vortex generated behind the sharp trailing edge reduced substantially compared to that behind the blunt trailing edge to analyze the effect of the oblique truncation on vortex shedding a couple of monitoring points were set near the end of the oblique truncated and perpendicular truncated trailing edges fig 14 among them p7 and p6 were the two end points on the top and bottom surfaces of the perpendicular truncated trailing edge p5 and p1 were the two end points on the top and bottom surfaces of the oblique truncated trailing edge and p2 p3 and p4 were located on the extension line of the bottom surface of the oblique truncated trailing edge the location of p4 coincided with the location of p6 as shown in fig 15 vortex shedding occurred alternatively on the top and bottom surfaces of the perpendicular truncated trailing edge with the same intensity and period for the oblique truncated trailing edge however the intensity of vortex shedding was slightly weaker on the top surface whereas the vortex shedding frequency was almost the same on both the top and bottom surfaces additionally the perpendicular truncated and oblique truncated trailing edges shared very similar time history curves of vorticity the vorticity curves measured at points p2 p3 and p4 indicate that the intensity of the vortex detached from the bottom surface was reduced substantially after leaving the surface additionally the intensity of vortices detached from the bottom surface was much weaker than those detached from the top surface upon reaching the same location 7 boundary layers around the hydrofoil to analyze the flow behavior in the boundary layer near the hydrofoil several monitoring points were set near the hydrofoil surface along the cord direction to obtain the flow velocity near the hydrofoil the average velocity measured from the monitoring points within one period after the flow field became stable is denoted as u mean the horizontal coordinate of the measuring points and the vertical distance to the surface of the hydrofoil were marked as x and y respectively the maximum thickness of the hydrofoil was b 9 0 mm the calculation results are shown in fig 16 as shown in fig 16 the average flow velocity u mean measured near the hydrofoil first increased and then remained constant with increasing distance from the surface of the hydrofoil with an increasing x from 0 5c to the trailing edge the location at which u mean reached its maximum value became farther away from the surface of the hydrofoil and the corresponding maximum velocity simultaneously became smaller in fig 17 u mean obtained from the measurements ceased to increase further when the monitoring points were sufficiently far away from the hydrofoil surface these monitoring points were then considered as the outermost locations of the boundary layer the distance from these monitoring points to the surface of the hydrofoil was taken as the thickness of the boundary t b following this approach we then observed how the boundary layer thickness varied along the cord on the top and bottom surfaces of the hydrofoil fig 16 the variation in the boundary layer along the cord underwent three stages on the oblique truncated hydrofoil a growth stage a rapid growth stage and a steady growth stage in addition the boundary layer thickness on the bottom surface was significantly larger than that on the top surface the boundary layer thickness started to increase rapidly at a location near 60 of the cord length meanwhile the growth of the boundary layer thickness was significantly faster on the bottom surface than that on the top surface at a location near 80 of the cord length the boundary layer thickness on the bottom surface started to increase slowly for the boundary layer on the top surface this transition occurred slightly later 8 effect of different oblique truncation angles we analyzed the vortex shedding phenomenon in the wake from a hydrofoil whose trailing edge was truncated completely at different truncation angles β the hydrofoil model used in the simulation had δh 0 mm the inlet velocity timestep and base mesh size were set at u ref 12 m s dt 1e 6 s and 0 005 m respectively in the numerical simulation the boundary layer mesh was generated with a growth ratio of 1 2 y 1 and a total of 12 layers the simulation results are shown in table 5 as shown in fig 18 a vortex shedding frequency f decreased first and then increased with increasing β the minimal vortex shedding frequency was obtained at β of 60 70 the vortex shedding frequency was reduced by having the hydrofoil truncated at an oblique angle of β 30 90 without considering the optimum solution truncating the trailing edge at a small angle can substantially reduce the vortex shedding frequency as shown in fig 18 b the average lift coefficient induced by the oblique truncation of the hydrofoil also showed a decreasing and increasing trend with increasing β furthermore the increasing trend of c l with an increasing β could be approximated by a linear curve the time domain and frequency domain curves of the lift coefficient under oblique truncation angles were shown in fig 19 as shown in fig 20 a f the intensity of vortex detached from the top and bottom surfaces decreased slightly after the trailing edge of the hydrofoil was obliquely truncated the change in vorticity was more significant on the bottom surface than that on the top surface of the hydrofoil at the same time the mode of vortex shedding also became different although vortex shedding was still generated from a standard point vortex at the endpoint on the top surface of the oblique truncated hydrofoil the boundary layer on the bottom surface of the hydrofoil extended beyond the surface along the tangent direction and reached the same horizontal location of the endpoint on the top surface when β was small flow separation then occurred in this extended region forming vortices 9 impact of angle of attack on vortex shedding in real applications hydrofoils most often exhibit a certain angle of attack therefore how the vortex shedding in the wake is affected by the angle of attack was evaluated in this study to further explore the impact of the oblique truncation on vortex shedding hydrofoils with a sharp trailing edge δh 0 β 30 and perpendicular truncated trailing edge β 90 were analyzed and compared the simulations performed in section 7 showed quite different vertex shedding behaviors on the top and bottom surfaces from the trailing edge of oblique truncated hydrofoils such a difference may become more evident in the presence of an angle of attack and may further affect lift and drag thus it is necessary to establish a hydrofoil model with an oblique truncation in the reverse direction to contrast the oblique truncated hydrofoil both models are shown in fig 21 the inlet flow velocity in the computational domain was set at u ref 12 m s a timestep of dt 1e 6 s and the same meshing parameters were used for the simulation the simulation results are shown in table 6 as shown in table 6 the presence of an angle of attack decreases the vortex shedding frequency the oblique truncation at the trailing edge reduces the lift coefficient of the hydrofoil the oblique line shown in the figure suggests that the vortex shedding no longer causes the lift of the hydrofoil to oscillate periodically after the angle of attack is sufficiently large in this case the effect of vortex shedding on the lift of hydrofoil can be neglected as shown in fig 22 the lift coefficient of the hydrofoil was reduced substantially for the oblique truncated hydrofoil compared to that of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil the variations in the corresponding lift coefficient curve were also more stable for the oblique truncated hydrofoil furthermore when α 9 the lift coefficient curve of the oblique truncated hydrofoil no longer fluctuated after the flow field became stable this finding suggests that the vortex shedding was very weak and had only a subtle impact on the hydrofoil for the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil however the hydrofoil was still affected substantially by vortex shedding in the wake under the same angle of attack the corresponding lift coefficient curve also showed periodic fluctuations with a further increase in the angle of attack the lift curve of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil ceased to fluctuate for all different angles of attack the lift of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil was always greater than that of the oblique truncated hydrofoil in other words the lift still decreased because of the presence of oblique truncation this finding suggests that the vortex shedding behavior was still different on the top and bottom surfaces of the oblique truncated hydrofoil for the hydrofoil with an oblique truncation in the reverse direction the effect of vortex shedding on the hydrofoil with an angle of attack was even less significant at an angle of attack of α 6 the lift curve of the hydrofoil was almost a straight line after the flow field was stabilized in this case vortex shedding had a negligible effect on the hydrodynamic performance of the hydrofoil as shown in table 7 the lift drag ratio of the oblique truncated hydrofoil was greater than that of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil when α 6 and α 9 in particular the lift drag ratio of the hydrofoil was improved significantly when the oblique truncation was on the suction surface this feature indicates that the oblique truncated hydrofoil exhibited a better hydrodynamics performance at a small angle of attack in the case of a relatively large angle of attack α 12 the lift drag ratio of the oblique truncated hydrofoil was smaller than that of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil because the trailing edge of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil was also free from vortex shedding induced vibration the hydrofoil with a perpendicular truncated trailing edge could also be selected in the case of a large angle of attack comparison of fig 23 a and b shows that the presence of an angle of attack had a more significant impact on the vortex shedding from the top surface of the hydrofoil on the contrary the vortex shedding from the bottom surface was still similar to that without any angle of attack after the vortex was detached from the top surface the point like region with high vorticity disappeared in this case the vortex shedding mode became closer to that from the bottom surface of the hydrofoil comparison of fig 23 d and e shows that there still exists vortex shedding in the form of regular point vortices from the bottom surface of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil when α 9 therefore the lift coefficient of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil still tends to fluctuate periodically under this angle of attack however no significant vortex shedding was observed on the top and bottom surfaces of the oblique truncated hydrofoil the lift coefficient approached a straight line 10 conclusion vortex shedding from an oblique truncated trailing edge was analyzed via numerical simulation specifically we explored how vortex shedding was affected by the oblique truncation angle and the angle of attack the variations in the velocity in the boundary layer of the hydrofoil were also explored additionally several vorticity monitoring points were set near the perpendicular and oblique truncated trailing edges to analyze the impact of oblique truncation on vortex shedding changing the oblique truncation angle of the trailing edge affected the vortex shedding behavior in the wake of the hydrofoil the vortex shedding frequency decreased first and then increased with increasing oblique truncation angles β the vortex shedding frequency was minimized at a certain angle β around 65 for the working condition explored in this study simultaneously the negative lift induced by the oblique truncated trailing edge showed an increasing and decreasing trend in the presence of an angle of attack the vortex shedding frequency for the hydrofoil with an oblique truncated trailing edge was substantially smaller than that with a perpendicular truncated trailing edge when the angle of attack was sufficiently large vortex shedding no longer occurred from the tail of the hydrofoil after the flow field stabilized and the lift coefficient no longer fluctuated such transitions occurred at even smaller angles of attack for the hydrofoil with an oblique truncated trailing edge the minimum angle of attack required to eliminate the vortex shedding effect could be further reduced by oblique truncation of the

reynolds number of the flow exceeds a certain critical value the boundary layers on the top and the bottom surfaces of the hydrofoil will experience flow separation and form shear layers these shear layers will further detach from the tail of the hydrofoil in the form of vortices the detached vortices form a periodic vortex array in the wake known as the karmen vortex street this formation will cause the hydrofoil to vibrate and experience periodic fatigue stress additionally propellers used on boats will experience resonance if the frequency of the vortex induced vibration approaches the natural frequency of the propeller such resonance will cause significant damage to the propeller blade therefore analyzing the vortex shedding phenomenon of hydrofoils and exploring how the vortex shedding frequency changes under different conditions is important for the design of marine engineering structures a plethora of plans have been proposed to control karmen vortex streets rashidi et al 2016 post and corke 2004 used plasma actuators to control vortex separation on a national advisory committee for aeronautics naca airfoil with a large angle of attack sung et al 2006 altered the momentum of the flow field in the wake using an electrical discharge in the fluid in the boundary layer gao et al 2015 analyzed the flow behavior of passing cylinders with different roughness values and found that an increasing surface roughness of the cylinder results in a smaller displacement response and higher frequency of vortex shedding huerre and monkewitz 1990 summarized the instability of the flow field around the hydrofoil and the flow characteristics of bluff body wakes prasad and williamson 1997 further summarized the vortex dynamics of the flow passing bluff body based on the instability of the flow field blake and gershfeld 1989 reviewed past studies on hydrofoils and found that the vortex shedding phenomenon is more significant for hydrofoils with a symmetrical or blunt trailing edge ausoni et al 2006 shifted the turbulence transition point upstream to the leading edge of the hydrofoil by changing the surface roughness and found that such a shift results in lower vortex shedding frequency and a lock in phenomenon ausoni et al 2007 with further investigation on vortex shedding researchers have found that the vortex shedding frequency can be changed effectively by altering the geometry of the trailing edge for example the segmented trailing edge designed by rodriguez 1991 and the wave shaped trailing edge designed by tombazis and bearman 1997 can both alleviate hydrofoil vibration donaldson 1956 analyzed the vortex induced vibration of a turbine with trailing edges of different angles and found that the vibration of the turbine blade was reduced substantially when the angle of the trailing edge was set to 30 lockey et al 2006 demonstrated that a v shaped trailing edge could reduce the vortex shedding intensity processing the trailing edge into an oblique shape is a commonly used method to reduce the vibration of the hydrofoil bourgoyne et al 2005 analyzed vortex shedding on an arc shaped hydrofoil with an oblique trailing edge under a high reynolds number flow and determined that vortex shedding was stronger from blunt and oblique trailing edges mosallem 2008 numerically and experimentally analyzed the characteristics of flow past beveled trailing edges attached to flat plates by comparing the vortex shedding phenomenon in trailing edges with bevel angles of 27 and 60 the results showed an asymmetrical wake behind the 27 beveled trailing edge and karman street vortices behind the 60 beveled trailing edge zobeiri et al 2012 compared the vortex shedding from a perpendicular truncated trailing edge and an oblique truncated trailing edge and showed that the collision between upper and lower vortices and the resulting vorticity redistribution were the main reasons for the vibration reduction obtained with the oblique trailing edge with the continuous development of computational technologies the use of numerical simulations has become a solid approach to analyze the vortex shedding from hydrofoils these numerical studies can better reveal the underlying mechanisms behind vortex shedding mulvany et al 2004 simulated the turbulent flow around a naca16 hydrofoil using four turbulence models including standard k ε realizable k ε standard k ω and shear stress transport sst k ω and further validated the reliability of the numerical simulations by comparing their results with those of bourgoyne et al 2003 ausoni et al 2007 analyzed vortex shedding from a two dimensional 2d hydrofoil with a truncated trailing edge via numerical simulations lee et al 2015 numerically analyzed the wake flow from oblique truncated trailing edges of a hydrofoil by combining the hybrid particle mesh method and the vorticity based subgrid scale mode the numerical results showed good agreement with the experimental data hu et al 2020 conducted a series of numerical simulations on the blunt trailing edge hydrofoils and found that vortex shedding frequency increased linearly with the velocity of the incoming flow yao et al 2014 reported that the fluid flow damping of donaldson s trailing edge was significantly greater than that of the blunt trailing edge and no locking phenomenon occurred through direct numerical simulations zeng et al 2019 found that donaldson s trailing edge at high flow rates can significantly reduce the amplitude of vibration caused by vortex shedding this phenomenon is caused by the energy dissipation of vortex collisions from the upper and lower trailing edges sagmo et al 2019 suggested that the separation distance of lateral flow at the trailing edge of the hydrofoil would affect the shedding frequency of the vortex thomareis and papadakis 2017 found that the serrated trailing edge could reduce the energy of vortex shedding by de correlating the spanwise coherence of vortices a considerable amount of work has been performed on the vortex shedding from a static hydrofoil however more in depth analyses are still required to further investigate the formation and development of the trailing vortex behind the hydrofoil and to understand how the formation of vortex is affected by the oblique trailing edge in this study the 2d wake flow and vortex shedding from an oblique truncated trailing edge of a ncac0009 hydrofoil were analyzed via computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations we explored how the lift of the hydrofoil and vortex shedding from the trailing edge were affected by flow velocity oblique truncation angle and angle of attack and determined the relationships between the vortex shedding frequency and these influencing factors the results showed that oblique truncation could change the mode and frequency of vortex shedding from the top and bottom surfaces of the trailing edge of the hydrofoil the circumstances of such effects were related to the oblique truncation angle additionally the intensity of vortex shedding from the hydrofoil with an oblique truncated trailing edge reduced significantly in the presence of an angle of attack no vortex shedding was observed under a small angle of attack 2 mathematical modeling the spalart allmaras s a turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1992 was used for the numerical simulation this model is suitable for simulations requiring high accuracy at the boundary layer e g for simulations required to calculate wing lift in this model the energy and information were

parameters are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 2 the computational domain was an 8c 3c rectangular area the left boundary was set as the velocity inlet the flow velocity could be adjusted by changing the physical value imposed on the inlet boundary a corresponding pressure outlet was imposed on the right boundary both the top and bottom boundaries were set as symmetrical planes to ensure that the flow field was sufficiently large the distance from the centerline of the hydrofoil to the top and bottom boundaries were set as 1 5c whereas the distance between the front point of the hydrofoil and the left boundary was set as 2c to simulate the flow field around the hydrofoil in detail the local grid near the surface of the hydrofoil was refined to 5c 1c the mesh used in this computational model consisted of trimmed and prism cells the mesh in the flow field was generated by the trimmed mesh generator with a base size of 0 05c the mesh size in the refined region was 5 of the base size see fig 3 the total number of cells in the computational model was 2 084 801 given that the velocity in the boundary layer of the hydrofoil will experience drastic changes during the real movement a prism mesh was used in the boundary layer of the hydrofoil because the computations performed in this study involved a relatively large reynolds number re 1e6 the first layer of the mesh was generated according to the condition of y 1 in addition the growth ratio and the total number of layers of the prism mesh were set at 1 2 and 20 to ensure a smooth transition from the prism mesh to the external mesh see fig 4 4 convergence verification and simulation results we used a larger domain 13c 6c for the numerical simulation see fig 5 the results are shown in fig 6 the comparisons showed that the results of the two domains are very similar to reduce the grid number and save computation time the smaller domain with the dimension of 8c 3c was used in the present simulation a convergence verification was performed on the mesh number timestep and turbulence model to ensure that the results were accurate specifically a nondimensionalized parameter t tu c was defined in this study and used as the x axis to plot the stabilized lift coefficient c l the c l curves obtained under different simulation conditions were then compared with one another three different mesh strategies with

respect to the cell number the convergence analysis was further performed on the timestep under this mesh condition the simulations were run at the timesteps of dt 1e 6 and dt 2e 6 the lift data of the hydrofoil obtained using these two timestep values are shown in table 2 and fig 8 the mesh and timestep convergence analyses show that a converging result can be obtained from the simulation using a total mesh number of 2 084 801 and timestep of dt 1e 6 based on the convergence analysis of the mesh timestep and the computational model we used a total cell number of 2 084 801 a timestep of dt 1e

periodically the c l curve in the frequency domain could then be obtained via the fourier transform of fig 9 a and the main oscillation frequency was found to be 740 63 hz the lift coefficient curve of the perpendicular truncated trailing edge and oblique truncated trailing edge were obtained after the flow field was stabilized these curves were further analyzed using the fourier transform the results revealed only one frequency peak for the perpendicular truncated trailing edge but three frequency peaks for the oblique truncated trailing edge on the lift coefficient curve this finding indicates that the vortices generated on the top and bottom surfaces of the oblique truncated trailing edge were no longer symmetrical furthermore the vortex shedding mode was different for the perpendicular truncated and oblique truncated trailing edges 5 comparison with experimental results the variations in vortex shedding frequency at the trailing edge were analyzed by placing the hydrofoil in flow fields with different u ref values numerical results were then compared with experimental measurements to validate the reliability of the simulation specifically the same truncated

had a blunt trailing edge δh 0 225 mm both models were placed in a flow field of u ref 12 m s to perform the calculation the oblique truncation angle and the angle of attack were set to β 30 and α 0 respectively the mesh distribution in the boundary layer was the same as the one discussed earlier a timestep of dt 1e 6 s was used in the simulation the results were shown in table 4 as shown in fig 11 the vortex shedding frequency was almost the same for the hydrofoils with blunt and sharp trailing edges at a flow velocity of 12 m s however the maximum value and the fluctuation amplitude of the lift coefficient decreased significantly for the sharp trailing edge additionally the negative lift induced by the oblique truncation further increased for the sharp trailing edge comparison of the vorticity curves in figs 12 and 13 shows that the intensity of vortex generated behind the sharp trailing edge reduced substantially compared to that behind the blunt trailing edge to analyze the

the hydrofoil and the corresponding maximum velocity simultaneously became smaller in fig 17 u mean obtained from the measurements ceased to increase further when the monitoring points were sufficiently far away from the hydrofoil surface these monitoring points were then considered as the outermost locations of the boundary layer the distance from these monitoring points to the surface of the hydrofoil was taken as the thickness of the boundary t b following this approach we then observed how the boundary layer thickness varied along the cord on the top and bottom surfaces of the hydrofoil fig 16 the variation in the boundary layer along the cord underwent three stages on the oblique truncated hydrofoil a growth stage a rapid growth stage and a steady growth stage in addition the boundary layer thickness on the bottom surface was significantly larger than that on the top surface the boundary layer thickness started to increase rapidly at a location near 60 of the cord length meanwhile the growth of the boundary layer thickness was significantly faster on the bottom surface than that on the top surface at a location near 80 of the cord length the boundary layer thickness on the bottom surface started to increase slowly for the boundary layer on the top surface this transition occurred slightly later 8 effect of different oblique truncation angles we analyzed the vortex shedding phenomenon in the wake from a hydrofoil whose trailing edge was truncated completely at different truncation angles β the hydrofoil model used in the simulation had δh 0 mm the inlet velocity timestep and base mesh size were set at u ref 12 m s dt 1e 6 s and 0 005 m respectively in the numerical simulation the boundary layer mesh was generated with a growth ratio of 1 2 y 1 and a total of 12 layers the simulation results are shown in table 5 as shown in fig 18 a vortex shedding frequency f decreased first and then increased with increasing β the minimal vortex shedding frequency was obtained at β of 60 70 the vortex shedding frequency was reduced by having the hydrofoil truncated at an oblique angle of β 30 90 without considering the optimum solution truncating the trailing edge at a small angle can substantially reduce the vortex shedding frequency as shown in fig 18 b the average lift coefficient induced by the oblique truncation of the hydrofoil also showed a decreasing and increasing trend with increasing β furthermore the increasing trend of c l with an increasing β could be approximated by a linear curve the time domain and frequency domain curves of the lift coefficient under oblique truncation angles were shown in fig 19 as shown in fig 20 a f the intensity of vortex detached from the top and bottom surfaces decreased slightly after the trailing edge of the hydrofoil was obliquely truncated the change in vorticity was more significant on the bottom surface than that on the top surface of the hydrofoil at the same time the mode of vortex shedding also became different although vortex shedding was still generated from a standard point vortex at the endpoint on the top surface of the oblique truncated hydrofoil the boundary layer on the bottom surface of the hydrofoil extended beyond the surface along the tangent direction and reached the same horizontal location of the endpoint on the top surface when β was small flow separation then occurred in this extended region forming vortices 9 impact of angle of attack on vortex shedding in real applications hydrofoils most often exhibit a certain angle of attack therefore how the vortex shedding in the wake is affected by the angle of attack was evaluated in this study to further explore the impact of the oblique truncation on vortex shedding hydrofoils with a sharp trailing edge δh 0 β 30 and perpendicular truncated trailing edge β 90 were analyzed and compared the simulations performed in section 7 showed quite different vertex shedding behaviors on the top and bottom surfaces from the trailing edge of oblique truncated hydrofoils such a difference may become more evident in the presence of an angle of attack and may further affect lift and drag thus it is necessary to establish a hydrofoil model with an oblique truncation in the reverse direction to contrast the oblique truncated hydrofoil both models are shown in fig 21 the inlet flow velocity in the computational domain was set at u ref 12 m s a timestep of dt 1e 6 s and the same meshing parameters were used for the simulation the simulation results are shown in table 6 as shown in table 6 the presence of an angle of attack decreases the vortex shedding frequency the oblique truncation at the trailing edge reduces the lift coefficient of the hydrofoil the oblique line shown in the figure suggests that the vortex shedding no longer causes the lift of the hydrofoil to oscillate periodically after the angle of attack is sufficiently large in this case the effect of vortex shedding on the lift of hydrofoil can be neglected as shown in fig 22 the lift coefficient of the hydrofoil was reduced substantially for the oblique truncated hydrofoil compared to that of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil the variations in the corresponding lift coefficient curve were also more stable for the oblique truncated hydrofoil furthermore when α 9 the lift coefficient curve of the oblique truncated hydrofoil no longer fluctuated after the flow field became stable this finding suggests that the vortex shedding was very weak and had only a subtle impact on the hydrofoil for the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil however the hydrofoil was still affected substantially by vortex shedding in the wake under the same angle of attack the corresponding lift coefficient curve also showed periodic fluctuations with a further increase in the angle of attack the lift curve of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil ceased to fluctuate for all different angles of attack the lift of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil was always greater than that of the oblique truncated hydrofoil in other words the lift still decreased because of the presence of oblique truncation this finding suggests that the vortex shedding behavior was still different on the top and bottom surfaces of the oblique truncated hydrofoil for the hydrofoil with an oblique truncation in the reverse direction the effect of vortex shedding on the hydrofoil with an angle of attack was even less significant at an angle of attack of α 6 the lift curve of the hydrofoil was almost a straight line after the flow field was stabilized in this case vortex shedding had a negligible effect on the hydrodynamic performance of the hydrofoil as shown in table 7 the lift drag ratio of the oblique truncated hydrofoil was greater than that of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil when α 6 and α 9 in particular the lift drag ratio of the hydrofoil was improved significantly when the oblique truncation was on the suction surface this feature indicates that the oblique truncated hydrofoil exhibited a better hydrodynamics performance at a small angle of attack in the case of a relatively large angle of attack α 12 the lift drag ratio of the oblique truncated hydrofoil was smaller than that of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil because the trailing edge of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil was also free from vortex shedding induced vibration the hydrofoil with a perpendicular truncated trailing edge could also be selected in the case of a large angle of attack comparison of fig 23 a and b shows that the presence of an angle of attack had a more significant impact on the vortex shedding from the top surface of the hydrofoil on the contrary the vortex shedding from the bottom surface was still similar to that without any angle of attack after the vortex was detached from the top surface the point like region with high vorticity disappeared in this case the vortex shedding mode became closer to that from the bottom surface of the hydrofoil comparison of fig 23 d and e shows that there still exists vortex shedding in the form of regular point vortices from the bottom surface of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil when α 9 therefore the lift coefficient of the perpendicular truncated hydrofoil still tends to fluctuate periodically under this angle of attack however no significant vortex shedding was observed on the top and bottom surfaces of the oblique truncated hydrofoil the lift coefficient approached a straight line 10 conclusion vortex shedding from an oblique truncated trailing edge was analyzed via numerical simulation specifically we explored how vortex shedding was affected by the oblique truncation angle and the angle of attack the variations in the velocity in the boundary layer of the hydrofoil were also explored additionally several vorticity monitoring points were set near the perpendicular and oblique truncated trailing edges to analyze the impact of oblique truncation on vortex shedding changing the oblique truncation angle of the trailing edge affected the vortex shedding behavior in the wake of the hydrofoil the vortex shedding frequency decreased first and then increased with increasing oblique truncation angles β the vortex shedding frequency was minimized at a certain angle β around 65 for the working condition explored in this study simultaneously the negative lift induced by the oblique truncated trailing edge showed an increasing and decreasing trend in the presence of an angle of attack the vortex shedding frequency for the hydrofoil with an oblique truncated trailing edge was substantially smaller than that with a perpendicular truncated trailing edge when the angle of attack was sufficiently large vortex shedding no longer occurred from the tail of the hydrofoil after the flow field stabilized and the lift coefficient no longer fluctuated such transitions occurred at even smaller angles of attack for the hydrofoil with an oblique truncated trailing edge the minimum angle of attack required to eliminate the vortex shedding effect could be further reduced by oblique truncation of the trailing edge in the reverse direction credit authorship contribution statement jian hu writing review editing methodology zibin wang writing original draft software chongge chen data curation

21598,hull forms of high performance sailing dinghies are very interesting for yacht designers after a long period in which the attention has been focused on one design boats in recent years a few exciting restricted classes such as international moth international 14 18 skiff and class a catamaran become recognized in several countries and led to interesting advances in high performance yacht design 1001velacup r3 class is two people racing dinghy designed according to a box rule with limitation on loa and bmax and total sail area the boats must be designed and built by students of european universities and race yearly in italy this paper focuses on two best ranked boats led from the university of palermo and tryagain managed by the university of naples but designed by the university of roma3 team these boats were definitely superior as regard motion resistance when tested without appendages during 2017 midwinter indoor race and although very different in main section shape had comparable performances the observed behaviours and the availability of experimental data suggested a suitable numerical approach and a fair comparison between experimental and numerical

implemented in a wide range of fields such as aviation automotive and of course power and sailing craft as reported in nam and bang 2017 sailing boat design is a challenging task because the designer has to consider the effect of two different fluids water and air the performance of the boat is strongly influenced by the environmental conditions in terms of wind speed and wave height and frequency in this case full scale efd tests are a reliable reference for further cfd analysis as commented in zlatev et al 2009 on the other hand cfd becomes essential when is not possible to build full scale prototypes or when the designer wants to explore a wide number of solutions large cfd use in last america s cup campaigns proved its utility and reliability on a comparative basis parametric cad models can accelerate cfd analysis because it is possible to generate and to modify the parameters of a model if properly designed as in myung and han 2001 and quickly estimate the performance of the new product from several standpoints as in raymond and cudby 2012 where a series of different planing hull forms has been numerically analyzed however the combination of efd and cfd can lead to revolutionary new design as in andersson et al 2017 and as demonstrated by last developments in imoca 60 yachts america s cup and volvo ocean race competitors in literature works about efd and cfd comparison can be found but mainly referring to scale models as in viola et al 2014 where the authors tested a scaled model 1 4 of a high performance skiff sail keeping it fast and flat to find the optimal longitudinal position of the crew after some decades in which efd and cfd were considered in an alternative way at present they are commonly used together experimental tests are considered as a benchmark and a reference for cfd development and validation while cfd in terms of the number of investigable configurations and study of the flow details has great advantages the experimental validation of cfd assessments is especially interesting and meaningful when no scale factor and consequently no model full size correlation is involved during the last years significant advances in sailing craft design have been done they have been mainly pushed by america s cup ocean racing and record setting vessels even if recent works by pennanen et al 2016 and day 2017 are focused on olympic dinghies performances like the laser racing or high performance small sailing craft design poses difficulties as their speed is not defined a priori but related to wind force due to their small length 1001velacup r3 class boats can sail not only in the critical froude range fr 0 4 to fr 0 6 but also over and below the increased use of hydrodynamic lift as a mean for resistance reduction at high speed deeply modified hull form trends of sailing craft besides the search of total hydrodynamic lift in multihulls and radical foil options of few mono hulls a general preference toward hard chine hulls can be observed in performance yachts since the first partial hard chines appeared on racing dinghies like 49er or international 14 in the early nineties decades of experience studies and developments of small power craft provided a strong contribution to the identification of the influence of hard chine versus round bilge hull forms as reported in begovic et al 2013 begovic and bertorello 2017 hard chine when used in racing dinghies is generally reduced in length with respect to lwl it starts from the transom and vanishes somewhere forward mid ship very often in recent designs hard chine between bottom and side at a certain height over the waterline can be seen the design of such hulls feature is generally empirical and left to experience and intuition scientific approaches to the matter are presented in le clercq and hudson 2010 this paper focuses on two best ranked 1001velacup r3 class boats led from the university of palermo and tryagain managed by the university of naples but designed by the university of roma3 team these boats were highly superior among eight similar competitors as regard motion resistance when tested during 2017 midwinter indoor race they are very different in main section shape have different and counteracting behaviours observed at different relative speeds within total comparable performances the first objective of the paper is to validate cfd for this type of boats at a low froude number and secondly to investigate via cfd the difference between the two hull forms in section 2 a brief resume of high performances dinghies with emphasis on 1001velacupr3 class is reported section 3 shows the lines drawing and the main characteristics of the two hulls while in section 4 according to the towing tank set up the experimental uncertainty has been estimated the cae environment in terms of cad and cfd modelling as described in section 5 will be used for the verification and validation v v procedure described in section 6 finally in section 7 a fair comparison between experimental and numerical results is presented 2 high performance sailing dinghies and 1001velacup class developments high performance sailing dinghies had a significant development in the early sixties of the last century when several successful designs some of them still ranked as olympic classes became to be serially produced the phenomenon was mainly due to new materials and technologies and to new skills got by racing crews in the use of trapeze the quite higher performances in respect to heavier boats already well established in the racing field were due to the strong contribution of living ballast righting moment and allowed by dacron sails and light alloy spars flying dutchman and international 5o5 were the leaders of this trend followed by less extreme 470 flying junior and 420 all of them presented round bilge sections and all of them were able to plane in reaching conditions with adequate wind speed besides such one design classes in which technical development was restricted to rig tuning and detail improvements a few box ruled classes grew up in this case designers were free to propose different hull forms within given main dimensions so that new experiments were encouraged the contribution of international 14 and 18 skiffs as well as international moth or osprey in uk were of the highest value in order to identify the new borders of dinghy performances hull forms changed and hard chines for the after part of the hull became common chines allowed quite better control when reaching the planing regime at lower boat speed from box ruled class developments and from the availability of carbon rigs and laminated sails in the early 90ies the present generation of performance dinghies was born they represent today the most advanced one design racing classes and are led by the successful 49er now well established as olympic high performance boat the living ballast concept is exploited in even more radical ways by both helmsman and forward using trapeze and by terraces or outriggers to set their position even further offset from the boat side 1001velacup r3class is a box ruled racing dinghy designed by students of technical universities and boats must be built within academic laboratories more details can be found at www 1001velacup eu each design team is coordinated and led by a professor the class is active in italy with some foreign competitors and about thirty boats have been built until now racing conditions can vary but as the race is held at the end of september are generally from light to medium wind due to their small length very efficient sail plan and different weather conditions 1001velacup r3class boat can sail in a wide froude number range over and below the critical one that is fr 0 4 0 6 this allows different hull forms and main section shapes while principal dimensions are the same for the whole fleet there is no minimum allowed hull weight the crew can use trapezes outriggers to extend the hull beam to a maximum of 2 10 m are allowed the result of such high righting moment due to crew weight shifted windward is a boat that sails perfectly upright or with the smallest heeling angles crew optimal weight is around 150 kg these factors and very similar displacement values make cfd optimization widely used by several design teams although with different limits and software options due to available hardware resources in 2017 university of naples federico ii organized an indoor race held in its towing tank eight boats from different universities took part to the regatta and their performance data as towing resistance dynamic trim sinkage pitch and heave in the regular sea have been shared among the participants 3 led and tryagain hull forms the lines drawing of the two considered boats are shown in fig 1 while their main characteristics are given in table 1 the origin of the reference is located at the forward perpendicular x values backward of fp and z values above dwl are positive fig 1 also shows the appendages while the green line represents the hard chine in tryagain and the red lines represent the dwl of the two dinghies 4 experimental setup the tests were performed in the towing tank of the university of naples federico ii whose dimensions are 135 9 4 2 m and the maximum carriage speed is 8 m s the boats were free to surge heave pitch and roll sway and yaw were restrained by two guidance rods furthermore one laser keyance il 600 was mounted on the carriage to measure the vertical displacement sinkage the boats have been towed by a self adjusting device incorporating the load cell so that the towing direction is always horizontal trim and heel angles have been measured by two inclinometers all tests were performed without turbulence simulation at carriage speed from 1 to 3 m s the measurements of resistance dynamic sinkage and trim in calm water were performed at the sampling rate of 500 hz the choice to consider a longitudinal flow aligned with centerplane is due to the target of the experimental tests that was a fair comparison of similar hull forms to study the effect of the shape of the transversal sections the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the boat shown is bauscia from the politecnico of milano experimental uncertainty analysis has been performed according to the ittc 2014 recommended procedures and guidelines for the instrumentation used in the towing tank the type b uncertainty is given in table 2 the type b uncertainty related to measurement of model motions using an optical motion capture system can be gained from the body residuals which are typically substantially less than 0 5 mm for the translator motions and according to previous experience of the authors max 2 once standard uncertainties u a and u b are determined the combined and expanded uncertainties are defined as 1 u c combined u a 2 u b 2 expanded uncertainty total uncertainty u 2u c where 2 is coverage factor for 95 confidence level or u 3u c for 99 confidence level experimental results are reported in the following table 3 for the experimental results the mean standard deviation is defined as 2 u a m e a n s t d e v n where n is the number of repeated runs and for both boats it was equal to 5 expended uncertainty analysis is calculated with the 95 confidence level i e the coverage factor is equal to 2 table 3 shows the experimental results for led evaluated at 1 m s 5 numerical setup 5 1 cae environment in this section the applied numerical approach depicted in fig 3 is described generally speaking two main strategies to solve the problem of the boat equilibrium can be addressed the first approach consists in moving the hull in terms of sinkage and trim in the computational domain and re computing the grid at each time step until the equilibrium of forces and moments is found while the second approach consists in fixing the hull in a prescribed position for a given sinkage and trim and run the simulation until convergence of the solution the latter approach has been adopted in this work specifically during the pre processing step the whole domain surrounding the hull model is trimmed along the centre of flotation and sinkage according to data from the towing tank test a new mesh is automatically generated and solved until a prescribed level of convergence is achieved the loop bounded by the dashed line of fig 3 which represents the cae environment has been developed in ansys workbench 18 1 the hull geometry has been modelled with the cad software creo 4 0 while pre processing and solution have been managed with icem cfd and fluent respectively no graphical user interface gui is needed since files and data exchange between applications happens via batch files the efficiency of the applied approach has been tested in a previous work by ingrassia et al 2017 if no data are available about sinkage and trim one can apply the procedure described in yang et al 2000 to obtain an estimate of both to be used as input in the loop 5 2 cad modelling the original hull surfaces have been rebuilt and managed for cfd purpose with the cad software creo 4 0 the same modelling strategy for both the hulls has been adopted by sweeping the original sections along the keel line and sheer line care has been taken in applying features like tweaking or cutting in order to obtain a surface as much close as possible to the original one this is not a trivial problem since numerical analyses will be compared with experimental data on a real model and not on a perfect model reply however in a previous work by di paola et al 2018 a reverse engineering approach applied to led after four years of regattas showed marginal differences between the cad model of the mould the perfect model and the scanned surface of the boat the real model 5 3 cfd modelling as previously said ansys workbench 18 1 has been adopted both for pre processing icem cfd and solution of the rans equations fluent a structured mesh has been mapped with 76 blocks fig 4 shows a close up of the edge structure surrounding the hull of led the red lines represent the main curves of half a hull while the black ones are the edges of the blocks some straight edges have been split and carefully curved and smoothed blue line of fig 4 in order to increase the mesh quality once satisfactory results mostly in terms of skewness and determinant have been achieved the same topology has been associated with tryagain fig 5 shows a mesh detail close to the bow of led left and tryagain right while some details of the so called reference computational domain whose extension is related to the loa are shown in table 4 the k ε realizable turbulence model and the implicit scheme of the volume of fluid vof method to capture the free surface effect have been adopted the spatial discretization and the transient formulation have been modelled with the second order and first order accuracy respectively as in most of the engineering applications the wall distance y of the first cell has been chosen close to 30 lower values of wall y require a very fine mesh otherwise a large amount of stretched hexahedral will cause numerical ventilation to increase viola et al 2012 a bi geometric law with an expansion rate of 1 3 has been chosen for all block edges moreover the grid size near the boundaries has been enlarged in order to favour numerical dissipation which helps in reducing wave reflection wave damping the ansys mesh metrics give rise to both determinant 3 3 and skewness greater than 0 5 this high quality mesh has been solved without the need of reducing the default values of the under relaxation for the equation integration the boundary layer has been modelled with the fluent s enhanced wall treatment a two layer model which smoothly blends the logarithmic and linear formulations depending on wall y concerning the boundary condition only half of the hull has been modelled according to symmetry a hydrostatic pressure outlet has been used on the outflow surface whilst inflow boundary condition on the other four prism faces has been set turbulence intensity and viscosity ratio at the boundaries have been set to 0 01 and 10 respectively although the simulations in calm water can be considered as steady state problems in the present work a transient formulation has been adopted and according to ittc 2011 the time step should range between 0 005 0 01 l u being l the reference length and u the boat speed however dealing with low froude numbers a smaller time step may be necessary four cases in the range 0 0025 0 02 seconds have been investigated at the lowest fr no remarkable differences have been observed at least for the lower time steps hence a reference value of 0 005 s has been adopted for all the simulations discussed in section 7 finally the hull grid size in the flow direction is about 0 02 m consequently the courant number ranges between co 0 125 and co 3 depending on the inflow velocity notice that the k ω sst turbulence model has been tested and results obtained at fr 0 15 have been compared with the ones obtained with the k ε model no appreciable differences have been observed and the computed resistances differ one each other by less than 1 6 verification and validation in this work the ittc 2017 methodology for the process of verification and validation v v has been applied to the hull of led at the lower froude number fr 0 15 v v is a two steps process the first step consists of defining the simulation numerical uncertainty u sn whose main contributions eça and hoekstra 2006 are related to the iterative uncertainty u i and to the grid discretization uncertainty u g with the following eq 3 3 u s n u i 2 u g 2 provided that a well converged solution has been achieved iterative uncertainty results in a negligible level hence the verification study will deal with the grid discretization uncertainty through a systematic grid refinement zou and larsson 2014 accordingly it is possible to consider the second term only as shown in eq 4 4 u sn 2 u g 2 to validate the model the error e is calculated with the comparison of experimental d and numerical s errors according to the following eq 5 5 e d s δ d δ sn δ sm where δ d δ sn and δ sm represent the experimental numerical and modelling errors this error is then compared with the validation uncertainty u val which depends on the sum of experimental u d and numerical u sn uncertainties 6 u val 2 u d 2 u sn 2 if the error e from eq 5 is smaller than the validation uncertainty from eq 6 the model is validated with a certain level of uncertainty with the following eq 7 7 e u v a l when performing the verification step the richardson extrapolation re can be used to express the numerical solution for which at least three solutions are needed with the following eq 8 8 s i s 0 α h i p where s i is the solution of the i th simulation s 0 is the solution if the model has infinitively fine grid h n 1 n i 3 and p is the order of accuracy the most recent application of v v procedure the least squares root method lsr creates at least four grid points to perform the fitting of eq 8 in the least squares sense eça hoekstra 2014 for the purpose a grid size h 2 3 has been adopted to obtain the fine f reference r medium m and coarse c grids points all the simulations have been followed for 50 s and high order convergence trends have been achieved with residuals of the o 10 6 table 5 shows the resistance obtained for each of the simulations moving from coarse to fine the number of cells doubles each time according to data from table 5 the lsr method has been applied and the obtained results are reported in table 6 while fig 6 shows the regression curve with the uncertainty bar of both reference grid and experimental data after the verification process it is possible to evaluate the validation uncertainty with eq 6 9 u val 6 1 and the error with eq 5 10 e 2 4 since the error is smaller than the validation uncertainty according to eq 7 the model is validated 7 results in what follows a brief resume of all the numerical simulations results is highlighted the procedure depicted in fig 3 firstly requires the cad model to be fixed in its hydrostatic equilibrium position for the purpose the boats have been weighted just before the test and each team established the position of the ballast over the deck to get the designed zero speed trim and displacement the 180 kg of ballast needed to simulate crew rigging fittings and sails cannot be moved during the test the difference in the ballast position on led left and tryagain right consequent to the different longitudinal distribution of displaced volume can be observed in fig 7 measurement of fore and aft freeboard has been used to establish the draft and static trim to set up the cad file a batch file written in tcl tk language automatically reads data from table 7 applies rotation trim and translation sinkage to the model and generates a new input mesh file for fluent dealing with a structured mesh the pre processing step is very quick a few seconds fig 8 shows the experimental and numerical resistance curves whose values are given in tables 7 and 8 respectively at the tested velocity of 1 2 and 3 m s corresponding to fr 0 15 0 30 and 0 45 respectively the differences between experimental and numerical results are given in table 9 it is to notice that δlift has been calculated with respect to the total displaced weight bare hull weight and ballast total resistance has been divided into two main components the first in the following named friction is pure viscous force due to the wetted surface the second namely pressure is the component to get the total bare hull resistance the following table 10 and fig 9 show the values and trends of the defined components in fig 9 pressure and friction resistance components of the two hulls at the considered froude numbers are shown it is possible to observe no appreciable differences at fr 0 15 and 0 45 at fr 0 3 while friction component has the same value for both hulls the pressure one shows different values with tryagain significantly worse than led at the increased relative speed at fr 0 45 the tryagain s hard chine reduces wetted surface and begins to provide further benefits on resistance components the trends of the diagrams allow foreseeing a tryagain s better performance of further increased fr figs 10 and 11 show the skin friction coefficient contour on the bottom of the hulls at fr 0 30 and 0 45 respectively at both fr it is possible to note a larger extension of high values of the skin friction in the forepart of tryagain due to her greater entrance angle and fuller forebody moving abaft the skin friction coefficient grows more along the round bilge of led than along the hard chine of tryagain fig 10 also shows with red curves the freeboard evaluated at a vof water vof air 0 5 it can be observed the hard chine always below the wetted side in a large central and aft part of the hull at fr 0 45 fig 11 the friction resistance of tryagain is 5 lower than that of led and the benefit of the tryagain s hard chine becomes evident in fact the wetted side now moves below the chine and the skin friction coefficient from the mid length abaft is lower than that of led finally a deeper investigation has been carried out to identify pressure values along waterline and wave patterns at three offsets from the centreline in fig 12 the pressure values and trends measured along the keel from the forward perpendicular to the stern at fr 0 3 are shown presumably the difference in the bow shape with fuller tryagain bow and larger half entrance angle is responsible for the large gap in the values from fp to 25 of lwl from mid length abaft the values are almost the same for the two hull forms in fig 13 the pressure values measured at three different waterlines are reported for the two hull forms at fr 0 3 the depths of the waterlines are 0 025 0 050 and 0 075 m below the waterline while the dotted line represents the static pressure at the corresponding depth the pressure drop at the stern of tryagain at z 0 025 m continuous blue line shows that separation occurs with consequent pressure resistance increasing the different trends of pressure values in the forward part of the hull are confirmed by the wave cuts and could be useful to explain the difference in resistance observed on the two boats and reported in fig 9 figs 14 and 15 show the wave pattern of led up and tryagain down at fr 0 30 and 0 45 wave height is measured on a plane whose projections are shown in the figures parallel to centre plane at 0 75 m 1 00 m and 1 50 m offset from cl starting 5 m forward the bow and quitting 20 m abaft the stern a plot of wave height is reported in fig 16 fr 0 3 and 17 fr 0 45 in the diagrams data relative to the hull length only are reported fig 16 highlights the led better behaviour at lower speed with smaller waves in the fore and central part of the cut while from fig 17 a quite levelled behaviour can be observed with very similar wave crest and through magnitude confirming once again the differences between the two boats the diagrams and considerations reported in this paragraph lead to the following conclusions round bilge hull forms are definitively superior in the low medium fr range that for fine weather mediterranean conditions is the most of sailed time hard chine is a benefit provided the average speed is adequately high this could be due to design oriented to extreme performances and or to predicted strong wind racing conditions full bow sections should be avoided submerged transom deteriorates performances at lower fr while giving an edge at medium and high fr allows better performances a compromise design presumably superior to both the considered hull form should take the led hull form as a basis with hard chine shaped stern where hard chine vanishes at about 1 3 lwl 8 conclusions the presented work deals with cfd and efd application to high performance dinghy hull design the availability of two 1001velacup r3 class hulls with the same l oa and different transversal sections allowed us to investigate the effect of round and hard chine hull forms experiments have been performed at the university of naples federico ii while numerical setup has been carried on by palermo university s group the work has been focused on resistance trim and sinkage assessment at different froude numbers the main aim of this work is a fair comparison between numerical and experimental methods for resistance assessment although the reported differences between the two hulls could seem marginal their trends are clearly shown by both approaches in this respect obtained cfd results and proposed numerical modelling give the possibility to analyse carefully the effects of hull changes on pressure field wetted surface changes and on global performances like resistance trim and sinkage the highest technical level of

21598,hull forms of high performance sailing dinghies are very interesting for yacht designers after a long period in which the attention has been focused on one design boats in recent years a few exciting restricted classes such as international moth international 14 18 skiff and class a catamaran become recognized in several countries and led to interesting advances in high performance yacht design 1001velacup r3 class is two people racing dinghy designed according to a box rule with limitation on loa and bmax and total sail area the boats must be designed and built by students of european universities and race yearly in italy this paper focuses on two best ranked boats led from the university of palermo and tryagain managed by the university of naples but designed by the university of roma3 team these boats were definitely superior as regard motion resistance when tested without appendages during 2017 midwinter indoor race and although very different in main section shape had comparable performances the observed behaviours and the availability of experimental data suggested a suitable numerical approach and a fair comparison between experimental and numerical

implemented in a wide range of fields such as aviation automotive and of course power and sailing craft as reported in nam and bang 2017 sailing boat design is a challenging task because the designer has to consider the effect of two different fluids water and air the performance of the boat is strongly influenced by the environmental conditions in terms of wind speed and wave height and frequency in this case full scale efd tests are a reliable reference for further cfd analysis as commented in zlatev et al 2009 on the other hand cfd becomes essential when is not possible to build full scale prototypes or when the designer wants to explore a wide number of solutions large cfd use in last america s cup campaigns proved its utility and reliability on a comparative basis parametric cad models can accelerate cfd analysis because it is possible to generate and to modify the parameters of a model if properly designed as in myung and han 2001 and quickly estimate the performance of the new product from several standpoints as in raymond and cudby 2012 where a series of different planing hull forms has been numerically analyzed however the combination of efd and cfd can lead to revolutionary new design as in andersson et al 2017 and as demonstrated by last developments in imoca 60 yachts america s cup and volvo ocean race competitors in literature works about efd and cfd comparison can be found but mainly referring to scale models as in viola et al 2014 where the authors tested a scaled model 1 4 of a high performance skiff sail keeping it fast and flat to find the optimal longitudinal position of the crew after some decades in which efd and cfd were considered in an alternative way at present they are commonly used together experimental tests are considered as a benchmark and a reference for cfd development and validation while cfd in terms of the number of investigable configurations and study of the flow details has great advantages the experimental validation of cfd assessments is especially interesting and meaningful when no scale factor and consequently no model full size correlation is involved during the last years significant advances in sailing craft design have been done they have been mainly pushed by america s cup ocean racing and record setting vessels even if recent works by pennanen et al 2016 and day 2017 are focused on olympic dinghies performances like the laser racing or high performance small sailing craft design poses difficulties as their speed is not defined a priori but related to wind force due to their small length 1001velacup r3 class boats can sail not only in the critical froude range fr 0 4 to fr 0 6 but also over and below the increased use of hydrodynamic lift as a mean for resistance reduction at high speed deeply modified hull form trends of sailing craft besides the search of total hydrodynamic lift in multihulls and radical foil options of few mono hulls a general preference toward hard chine hulls can be observed in performance yachts since the first partial hard chines appeared on racing dinghies like 49er or international 14 in the early nineties decades of experience studies and developments of small power craft provided a strong contribution to the identification of the influence of hard chine versus round bilge hull forms as reported in begovic et al 2013 begovic and bertorello 2017 hard chine when used in racing dinghies is generally reduced in length with respect to lwl it starts from the transom and vanishes somewhere forward mid ship very often in recent designs hard chine between bottom and side at a certain height over the waterline can be seen the design of such hulls feature is generally empirical and left to experience and intuition scientific approaches to the matter are presented in le clercq and hudson 2010 this paper focuses on two best ranked 1001velacup r3 class boats led from the university of palermo and tryagain managed by the university of naples but designed by the university of roma3 team these boats were highly superior among eight similar competitors as regard motion resistance when tested during 2017 midwinter indoor race they are very different in main section shape have different and counteracting behaviours observed at different relative speeds within total comparable performances the first objective of the paper is to validate cfd for this type of boats at a low froude number and secondly to investigate via cfd the difference between the two hull forms in section 2 a brief resume of high performances dinghies with emphasis on 1001velacupr3 class is reported section 3 shows the lines drawing and the main characteristics of the two hulls while in section 4 according to the towing tank set up the experimental uncertainty has been estimated the cae environment in terms of cad and cfd modelling as described in section 5 will be used for the verification and validation v v procedure described in section 6 finally in section 7 a fair comparison between experimental and numerical results is presented 2 high performance sailing dinghies and 1001velacup class developments high performance sailing dinghies had a significant development in the early sixties of the last century when several successful designs some of them still ranked as olympic classes became to be serially produced the phenomenon was mainly due to new materials and technologies and to new skills got by racing crews in the use of trapeze the quite higher performances in respect to heavier boats already well established in the racing field were due to the strong contribution of living ballast righting moment and allowed by dacron sails and light alloy spars flying dutchman and international 5o5 were the leaders of this trend followed by less extreme 470 flying junior and 420 all of them presented round bilge sections and all of them were able to plane in reaching conditions with adequate wind speed besides such one design classes in which technical development was restricted to rig tuning and detail improvements a few box ruled classes grew up in this case designers were free to propose different hull forms within given main dimensions so that new experiments were encouraged the contribution of international 14 and 18 skiffs as well as international moth or osprey in uk were of the highest value in order to identify the new borders of dinghy performances hull forms changed and hard chines for the after part of the hull became common chines allowed quite better control when reaching the planing regime at lower boat speed from box ruled class developments and from the availability of carbon rigs and laminated sails in the early 90ies the present generation of performance dinghies was born they represent today the most advanced one design racing classes and are led by the successful 49er now well established as olympic high performance boat the living ballast concept is exploited in even more radical ways by both helmsman and forward using trapeze and by terraces or outriggers to set their position even further offset from the boat side 1001velacup r3class is a box ruled racing dinghy designed by students of technical universities and boats must be built within academic laboratories more details can be found at www 1001velacup eu each design team is coordinated and led by a professor the class is active in italy with some foreign competitors and about thirty boats have been built until now racing conditions can vary but as the race is held at the end of september are generally from light to medium wind due to their small length very efficient sail plan and different weather conditions 1001velacup r3class boat can sail in a wide froude number range over and below the critical one that is fr 0 4 0 6 this allows different hull forms and main section shapes while principal dimensions are the same for the whole fleet there is no minimum allowed hull weight the crew can use trapezes outriggers to extend the hull beam to a maximum of 2 10 m are allowed the result of such high righting moment due to crew weight shifted windward is a boat that sails perfectly upright or with the smallest heeling angles crew optimal weight is around 150 kg these factors and very similar displacement values make cfd optimization widely used by several design teams although with different limits and software options due to available hardware resources in 2017 university of naples federico ii organized an indoor race held in its towing tank eight boats from different universities took part to the regatta and their performance data as towing resistance dynamic trim sinkage pitch and heave in the regular sea have been shared among the participants 3 led and tryagain hull forms the lines drawing of the two considered boats are shown in fig 1 while their main characteristics are given in table 1 the origin of the reference is located at the forward perpendicular x values backward of fp and z values above dwl are positive fig 1 also shows the appendages while the green line represents the hard chine in tryagain and the red lines represent the dwl of the two dinghies 4 experimental setup the tests were performed in the towing tank of the university of naples federico ii whose dimensions are 135 9 4 2 m and the maximum carriage speed is 8 m s the boats were free to surge heave pitch and roll sway and yaw were restrained by two guidance rods furthermore one laser keyance il 600 was mounted on the carriage to measure the vertical displacement sinkage the boats have been towed by a self adjusting device incorporating the load cell so that the towing direction is always horizontal trim and heel angles have been measured by two inclinometers all tests were performed without turbulence simulation at carriage speed from 1 to 3 m s the measurements of resistance dynamic sinkage and trim in calm water were performed at the sampling rate of 500 hz the choice to consider a longitudinal flow aligned with centerplane is due to the target of the experimental tests that was a fair comparison of similar hull forms to study the effect of the shape of the transversal sections the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the boat shown is bauscia from the politecnico of milano experimental uncertainty analysis has been performed according to the ittc 2014 recommended procedures and guidelines for the instrumentation used in the towing tank the type b uncertainty is given in table 2 the type b uncertainty related to measurement of model motions using an optical motion capture system can be gained from the body residuals which are typically substantially less than 0 5 mm for the translator motions and according to previous experience of the authors max 2 once standard uncertainties u a and u b are determined the combined and expanded uncertainties are defined as 1 u c combined u a 2 u b 2 expanded uncertainty total uncertainty u 2u c where 2 is coverage factor for 95 confidence level or u 3u c for 99 confidence level experimental results are reported in the following table 3 for the experimental results the mean standard deviation is defined as 2 u a m e a n s t d e v n where n is the number of repeated runs and for both boats it was equal to 5 expended uncertainty analysis is calculated with the 95 confidence level i e the coverage factor is equal to 2 table 3 shows the experimental results for led evaluated at 1 m s 5 numerical setup 5 1 cae environment in this section the applied numerical approach depicted in fig 3 is described generally speaking two main strategies to solve the problem of the boat equilibrium can be addressed the first approach consists in moving the hull in terms of sinkage and trim in the computational domain and re computing the grid at each time step until the equilibrium of forces and moments is found while the second approach consists in fixing the hull in a prescribed position for a given sinkage and trim and run the simulation until convergence of the solution the latter approach has been adopted in this work specifically during the pre processing step the whole domain surrounding the hull model is trimmed along the centre of flotation and sinkage according to data from the towing tank test a new mesh is automatically generated and solved until a prescribed level of convergence is achieved the loop bounded by the dashed line of fig 3 which represents the cae environment has been developed in ansys workbench 18 1 the hull geometry has been modelled with the cad software creo 4 0 while pre processing and solution have been managed with icem cfd and fluent respectively no graphical user interface gui is needed since files and data exchange between applications happens via batch files the efficiency of the applied approach has been tested in a previous work by ingrassia et al 2017 if no data are available about sinkage and trim one can apply the procedure described in yang et al 2000 to obtain an estimate of both to be used as input in the loop 5 2 cad modelling the original hull surfaces have been rebuilt and managed for cfd purpose with the cad software creo 4 0 the same modelling strategy for both the hulls has been adopted by sweeping the original sections along the keel line and sheer line care has been taken in applying features like tweaking or cutting in order to obtain a surface as much close as possible to the original one this is not a trivial problem since numerical analyses will be compared with experimental data on a real model and not on a perfect model reply however in a previous work by di paola et al 2018 a reverse engineering approach applied to led after four years of regattas showed marginal differences between the cad model of the mould the perfect model and the scanned surface of the boat the real model 5 3 cfd modelling as previously said ansys workbench 18 1 has been adopted both for pre processing icem cfd and solution of the rans equations fluent a structured mesh has been mapped with 76 blocks fig 4 shows a close up of the edge structure surrounding the hull of led the red lines represent the main curves of half a hull while the black ones are the edges of the blocks some straight edges have been split and carefully curved and smoothed blue line of fig 4 in order to increase the mesh quality once satisfactory results mostly in terms of skewness and determinant have been achieved the same topology has been associated with tryagain fig 5 shows a mesh detail close to the bow of led left and tryagain right while some details of the so called reference computational domain whose extension is related to the loa are shown in table 4 the k ε realizable turbulence model and the implicit scheme of the volume of fluid vof method to capture the free surface effect have been adopted the spatial discretization and the transient formulation have been modelled with the second order and first order accuracy respectively as in most of the engineering applications the wall distance y of the first cell has been chosen close to 30 lower values of wall y require a very fine mesh otherwise a large amount of stretched hexahedral will cause numerical ventilation to increase viola et al 2012 a bi geometric law with an expansion rate of 1 3 has been chosen for all block edges moreover the grid size near the boundaries has been enlarged in order to favour numerical dissipation which helps in reducing wave reflection wave damping the ansys mesh metrics give rise to both determinant 3 3 and skewness greater than 0 5 this high quality mesh has been solved without the need of reducing the default values of the under relaxation for the equation integration the boundary layer has been modelled with the fluent s enhanced wall treatment a two layer model which smoothly blends the logarithmic and linear formulations depending on wall y concerning the boundary condition only half of the hull has been modelled according to symmetry a hydrostatic pressure outlet has been used on the outflow surface whilst inflow boundary condition on the other four prism faces has been set turbulence intensity and viscosity ratio at the boundaries have been set to 0 01 and 10 respectively although the simulations in calm water can be considered as steady state problems in the present work a transient formulation has been adopted and according to ittc 2011 the time step should range between 0 005 0 01 l u being l the reference length and u the boat speed however dealing with low froude numbers a smaller time step may be necessary four cases in the range 0 0025 0 02 seconds have been investigated at the lowest fr no remarkable differences have been observed at least for the lower time steps hence a reference value of 0 005 s has been adopted for all the simulations discussed in section 7 finally the hull grid size in the flow direction is about 0 02 m consequently the courant number ranges between co 0 125 and co 3 depending on the inflow velocity notice that the k ω sst turbulence model has been tested and results obtained at fr 0 15 have been compared with the ones obtained with the k ε model no appreciable differences have been observed and the computed resistances differ one each other by less than 1 6 verification and validation in this work the ittc 2017 methodology for the process of verification and validation v v has been applied to the hull of led at the lower froude number fr 0 15 v v is a two steps process the first step consists of defining the simulation numerical uncertainty u sn whose main contributions eça and hoekstra 2006 are related to the iterative uncertainty u i and to the grid discretization uncertainty u g with the following eq 3 3 u s n u i 2 u g 2 provided that a well converged solution has been achieved iterative uncertainty results in a negligible level hence the verification study will deal with the grid discretization uncertainty through a systematic grid refinement zou and larsson 2014 accordingly it is possible to consider the second term only as shown in eq 4 4 u sn 2 u g 2 to validate the model the error e is calculated with the comparison of experimental d and numerical s errors according to the following eq 5 5 e d s δ d δ sn δ sm where δ d δ sn and δ sm represent the experimental numerical and modelling errors this error is then compared with the validation uncertainty u val which depends on the sum of experimental u d and numerical u sn uncertainties 6 u val 2 u d 2 u sn 2 if the error e from eq 5 is smaller than the validation uncertainty from eq 6 the model is validated with a certain level of uncertainty with the following eq 7 7 e u v a l when performing the verification step the richardson extrapolation re can be used to express the numerical solution for which at least three solutions are needed with the following eq 8 8 s i s 0 α h i p where s i is the solution of the i th simulation s 0 is the solution if the model has infinitively fine grid h n 1 n i 3 and p is the order of accuracy the most recent application of v v procedure the least squares root method lsr creates at least four grid points to perform the fitting of eq 8 in the least squares sense eça hoekstra 2014 for the purpose a grid size h 2 3 has been adopted to obtain the fine f reference r medium m and coarse c grids points all the simulations have been followed for 50 s and high order convergence trends have been achieved with residuals of the o 10 6 table 5 shows the resistance obtained for each of the simulations moving from coarse to fine the number of cells doubles each time according to data from table 5 the lsr method has been applied and the obtained results are reported in table 6 while fig 6 shows the regression curve with the uncertainty bar of both reference grid and experimental data after the verification process it is possible to evaluate the validation uncertainty with eq 6 9 u val 6 1 and the error with eq 5 10 e 2 4 since the error is smaller than the validation uncertainty according to eq 7 the model is validated 7 results in what follows a brief resume of all the numerical simulations results is highlighted the procedure depicted in fig 3 firstly requires the cad model to be fixed in its hydrostatic equilibrium position for the purpose the boats have been weighted just before the test and each team established the position of the ballast over the deck to get the designed zero speed trim and displacement the 180 kg of ballast needed to simulate crew rigging fittings and sails cannot be moved during the test the difference in the ballast position on led left and tryagain right consequent to the different longitudinal distribution of displaced volume can be observed in fig 7 measurement of fore and aft freeboard has been used to establish the draft and static trim to set up the cad file a batch file written in tcl tk language automatically reads data from table 7 applies rotation trim and translation sinkage to the model and generates a new input mesh file for fluent dealing with a structured mesh the pre processing step is very quick a few seconds fig 8 shows the experimental and numerical resistance curves whose values are given in tables 7 and 8 respectively at the tested velocity of 1 2 and 3 m s corresponding to fr 0 15 0 30 and 0 45 respectively the differences between experimental and numerical results are given in table 9 it is to notice that δlift has been calculated with respect to the total displaced weight bare hull weight and ballast total resistance has been divided into two main components the first in the following named friction is pure viscous force due to the wetted surface the second namely pressure is the component to get the total bare hull resistance the following table 10 and fig 9 show the values and trends of the defined components in fig 9 pressure and friction resistance components of the two hulls at the considered froude numbers are shown it is possible to observe no appreciable differences at fr 0 15 and 0 45 at fr 0 3 while friction component has the same value for both hulls the pressure one shows different values with tryagain significantly worse than led at the increased relative speed at fr 0 45 the tryagain s hard chine reduces wetted surface and begins to provide further benefits on resistance components the trends of the diagrams allow foreseeing a tryagain s better performance of further increased fr figs 10 and 11 show the skin friction coefficient contour on the bottom of the hulls at fr 0 30 and 0 45 respectively at both fr it is possible to note a larger extension of high values of the skin friction in the forepart of tryagain due to her greater entrance angle and fuller forebody moving abaft the skin friction coefficient grows more along the round bilge of led than along the hard chine of tryagain fig 10 also shows with red curves the freeboard evaluated at a vof water vof air 0 5 it can be observed the hard chine always below the wetted side in a large central and aft part of the hull at fr 0 45 fig 11 the friction resistance of tryagain is 5 lower than that of led and the benefit of the tryagain s hard chine becomes evident in fact the wetted side now moves below the chine and the skin friction coefficient from the mid length abaft is lower than that of led finally a deeper investigation has been carried out to identify pressure values along waterline and wave patterns at three offsets from the centreline in fig 12 the pressure values and trends measured along the keel from the forward perpendicular to the stern at fr 0 3 are shown presumably the difference in the bow shape with fuller tryagain bow and larger half entrance angle is responsible for the large gap in the values from fp to 25 of lwl from mid length abaft the values are almost the same for the two hull forms in fig 13 the pressure values measured at three different waterlines are reported for the two hull forms at fr 0 3 the depths of the waterlines are 0 025 0 050 and 0 075 m below the waterline while the dotted line represents the static pressure at the corresponding depth the pressure drop at the stern of tryagain at z 0 025 m continuous blue line shows that separation occurs with consequent pressure resistance increasing the different trends of pressure values in the forward part of the hull are confirmed by the wave cuts and could be useful to explain the difference in resistance observed on the two boats and reported in fig 9 figs 14 and 15 show the wave pattern of led up and tryagain down at fr 0 30 and 0 45 wave height is measured on a plane whose projections are shown in the figures parallel to centre plane at 0 75 m 1 00 m and 1 50 m offset from cl starting 5 m forward the bow and quitting 20 m abaft the stern a plot of wave height is reported in fig 16 fr 0 3 and 17 fr 0 45 in the diagrams data relative to the hull length only are reported fig 16 highlights the led better behaviour at lower speed with smaller waves in the fore and central part of the cut while from fig 17 a quite levelled behaviour can be observed with very similar wave crest and through magnitude confirming once again the differences between the two boats the diagrams and considerations reported in this paragraph lead to the following conclusions round bilge hull forms are definitively superior in the low medium fr range that for fine weather mediterranean conditions is the most of sailed time hard chine is a benefit provided the average speed is adequately high this could be due to design oriented to extreme performances and or to predicted strong wind racing conditions full bow sections should be avoided submerged transom deteriorates performances at lower fr while giving an edge at medium and high fr allows better performances a compromise design presumably superior to both the considered hull form should take the led hull form as a basis with hard chine shaped stern where hard chine vanishes at about 1 3 lwl 8 conclusions the presented work deals with cfd and efd application to high performance dinghy hull design the availability of two 1001velacup r3 class hulls with the same l oa and different transversal sections allowed us to investigate the effect of round and hard chine hull forms experiments have been performed at the university of naples federico ii while numerical setup has been carried on by palermo university s group the work has been focused on resistance trim and sinkage assessment at different froude numbers the main aim of this work is a fair comparison between numerical and experimental methods for resistance assessment although the reported differences between the two hulls could seem marginal their trends are clearly shown by both approaches in this respect obtained cfd results and proposed numerical modelling give the possibility to analyse carefully the effects of hull changes on pressure field wetted surface changes and on global performances like resistance trim and sinkage the highest technical level of

21599,a numerical investigation was conducted to examine the effect of injection velocity of a pair of air jets positioned at the two shoulders of a circular cylinder on the vortex shedding at a low reynolds number re 100 not only the momentum but also the air flow are injected into the cylinder boundary layer by the air jets yielding the gas liquid two phase fluid in the wake the ejected air pushes the borderline of boundary layer outwardly but cannot break through the shear layer air columns ejected from jets roll up to form air bubbles at u jet u in 3 delaying the vortex formation to some extent in contrast a water entrained air bubble with size larger than the recirculation region is formed at u jet u in 4 the vortex shedding is eliminated within a considerable length resulting in the vanishing of periodic fluctuation and amplitude of hydrodynamic forces therefore the threshold of fully control of near wake is u jet u in 4 the time mean drag coefficient and the fluctuation of lift coefficient are reduced up to 99 93 and 17 07 respectively in the presence of air jets with sufficient momentum the air bubble vortex interference and the mergence and split of air bubbles are depending on the bubble size and the velocity distribution of ambient fluid keywords air jet flow control air bubble vortex interference wake flow drag reduction 1 introduction flow around cylindrical structures is prevalent in the natural and engineering applications occurring when water flows past deep water risers heat exchangers and bridge piers to name a few when the reynolds number re u in d ν where u in is the free stream velocity d is the cylinder diameter and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity exceeds a critical value which is 47 for a circular cylinder henderson 1997 periodic vortex shedding emerges in the wake causing fluctuating fluid forces on the cylinder and hence producing structural vibration acoustic noise fang et al 2019 and resonance wang et al 2020a xu et al 2020 effective control methods are therefore required in engineering applications to alter the flow wake and reduce the negative impacts of vortex shedding a great quantity of control schemes have been introduced in the past several decades broadly categorized into passive and active techniques choi et al 2008 in the past decades passive control mainly realized by geometry modification has been extensively investigated due to the simpler implementation without consumption of external energy zdravkovich 1981 yang et al 2019 wang et al 2019a fairings zhu et al 2017 splitter plates wang et al 2019 zhu and wang 2019 zhu et al 2020a helical strakes xu et al 2017 control rods zhu and yao 2015 ding et al 2019 and strips wang et al 2019b zhu et al 2020b are the typical examples nevertheless most of them successfully work in narrow operation ranges compared to passive control active control can adjust the flow separation and vortex shedding more effectively and timely in the cost of external energy input zhu and gao 2017 wang et al 2020b typical active control methods include oscillation rotation zou et al 2019 acoustic excitation and synthetic jets as a promising active control technique synthetic jets have been applied on bluff bodies to modify wakes and hydrodynamic characteristics and control vortex induced vibrations vivs wang et al 2017 feng and wang 2010 experimentally investigated the flow over a circular cylinder controlled by a synthetic jet placed at the rear stagnation point at re 950 it was found that the jet vortex pairs formed near the exit interacted with the shear layers from the cylinder resulting in a symmetric wake mode and hence the weaker interaction between the upper and lower shear layers in their subsequent report feng et al 2010 pointed out that the control effect can be enhanced by increasing the jet momentum the similar experiments on a square cylinder with a jet positioned at the rear surface were carried out by qu et al 2017 at re 836 the wake was observed to be symmetric with the shedding frequency consistent with the control frequency and the separation was effectively suppressed due to the strong perturbations of the jet flow based on the wind tunnel tests at re 3 33 104 gao et al 2019 reported that the lift force was significantly reduced with the implementation of active wake jet at the rear stagnation point and a better control effectiveness was achieved with a higher jet momentum the high reynolds number of 103 105 is considered in the aforementioned literature and only one jet arranged at the rear or front stagnation point is concerned recently wang et al 2016 numerically investigated the wake control of a circular cylinder using a pair of jets at a low reynolds number of 100 it was reported that the vortex street can be effectively suppressed when the pair of jets operated with sufficient momentum and was placed in the quarter arc edge of the leeward side the effects of position angle and momentum coefficient of a pair of jets on the viv control were numerically examined at re 150 wang et al 2019 2020 it was found that both the in line and cross flow vibrations were suppressed when the jets with sufficiently high momentum were positioned at the leeward side the fluid injected from the jets is the same as the ambient fluid either air or water in the previous studies few literature has reported the influence of different fluid medium such as air injected into water flow which will generate gas liquid two phase flow in the wake in our previous study the flow control of a circular cylinder with a pair of air jets positioned at the two shoulders of the cylinder was numerically investigated zhu et al 2019a air vortices and bubbles formed by the jet interrupted the development of boundary layer and naturally shedding vortices resulting in the delay of vortex formation and the suppression of viv in terms of the position coinciding with vortices two migration modes were proposed for the air bubbles in the flow wake the viv control becomes more effective with increasing of the injection velocity of air flow nevertheless only three velocity ratios u jet u in 0 5 1 and 2 where u jet is the free stream velocity were considered in the study corresponding to the momentum coefficient c μ 2ρ g u jet 2 d ρ w u in 2 d from 2 181 10 5 to 3 488 10 4 therefore more comprehensive study on the effect of injection velocity is conducted in this work using the direct numerical simulation dns as detailed flow structure information can be provided by dns at a low reynolds number with the elimination of uncertainties associated with turbulence modeling the reduction of hydrodynamic forces evolution of flow structures migration of air bubbles and time averaged flow field are discussed in detail 2 problem description as shown in fig 1 a pair of air jets is mounted on the two lateral sides of a circular cylinder i e 90 from the rear stagnation point of the cylinder and each air jet covers 5 of the cylinder surface the equipped cylinder is immersed in a uniform water flow u in and air flow is ejected from the couple of jets with a uniform velocity u jet normal to the cylinder surface yielding gas liquid two phase flow in the wake the normalized injection velocity u jet u in ranges from 0 to 7 corresponding to the momentum coefficient c μ from 0 to 5 236 10 3 where u jet u in 0 represents the bare cylinder without the arrangement of air jets the effect of the injection velocity of lateral air jets on the flow over a circular cylinder is examined at a low reynolds number re 100 as the wake transition from two dimensional to three dimensional instability occurs around re 190 jiang et al 2016a b jiang et al 2016a b the two dimensional dns is adopted in this work a rectangular region is selected as the computational domain with 75d in the streamwise direction and 20d in the transverse direction as depicted in fig 1 yielding a blocking rate of 5 the domain size independence test has been carried out in our previous study zhu et al 2019a and thereby no more expatiation here the center of the cylinder is located at a distance of 10d from the upstream and two lateral boundaries resulting in a relatively longer distance of 65d between the cylinder center and the outlet boundary to capture the flow wake a uniform flow is prescribed at the inlet boundary as u u in and v 0 where u and v are the velocity components in the streamwise direction x and transverse direction y respectively the outlet boundary is set as a zero gradient condition u x 0 and v x 0 jiang et al 2018 bhatt and alam 2018 at the two lateral boundaries the symmetrical conditions are adopted as u y 0 and v 0 the no slip condition is imposed on the cylinder surface u 0 and v 0 while the uniform velocity normal to the cylinder surface v u jet is defined in the outlet of air jets 3 computational model and method 3 1 governing equations and solution methodology the two dimensional of flow over the circular cylinder with a pair of air jets is carried out with the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd solver open foam which is composed of c libraries and solves the navier stokes ns equations with the finite volume discretization method fvdm and piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm due to the limited flow velocities and operation at atmospheric pressure both the air and water are considered as incompressible fluid in this work the two dimensional incompressible flow landau and lifshitz 1959 is governed by the unsteady navier stokes ns equations that expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j where x i is the cartesian coordinate in i direction u i is the velocity component in the direction x i t is the flow time p is the pressure and ρ and ν are the density and kinematic viscosity of the mixture fluid pozzetti and peters 2018 fuster et al 2009 respectively defined as 3 ρ 1 α w ρ g α w ρ w 4 ν 1 α w ν g α w ν w where subscript g and w represent air and water respectively and α w is the volume fraction of water the gas liquid interface is identified using the volume of fluid vof model hieu et al 2004 the two dimensional transport equations for the fraction functions are expressed as 5 α w t u α w x v α w y 0 6 α t u α x v α y 0 where α is the volume fraction of air the fourth order cubic scheme and the second order linear scheme are used to deal with the convective and diffusion terms respectively zhu et al 2019b a blended scheme composed of the second order crank nicolson scheme and the first order euler implicit scheme is employed to handle the time derivative term the normalized time step δtu in d is set as 0 001 in accordance with the requirement of the maximum courant friedrichs lewy cfl number in the whole computational domain below 0 5 3 2 computational mesh and mesh dependence check as depicted in fig 2 a large circle of diameter 4d enveloping the circular cylinder with the same center is employed to create an o xy grid system near the cylinder the perimeter of the circular cylinder is equally discretized by 320 nodes and each air jet contains 8 nodes the grid along the radial direction is denser near the cylinder surface with the height of the first layer grid 0 00656d y 0 1 and the cell expansion ratio of 1 015 accordingly fine grids are generated in the wake of cylinder to capture the recirculation region and vortex street the mesh independence check was conducted first for the bare cylinder u jet u in 0 table 1 compares the important calculated results for four different mesh resolutions where st is the strouhal number obtained by the application of the fast fourier transform fft algorithm for the time series of lift coefficient and c d mean and c l rms are the time averaged drag coefficient and root mean square rms lift coefficient respectively defined as 7 c d mean 1 n i 1 n 2 f d t ρ u i n 2 d 8 c l rms 1 n i 1 n 2 f l t ρ u i n 2 d 2 where n is the number of values in the time series for statistics f d t and f l t are the drag and lift forces acting on the cylinder surface respectively the relative deviations in parenthesis are calculated by using the results from the former case as reference values it is seen that the strouhal number and hydrodynamic coefficients converge at m3 with the maximum difference between m3 and m4 less than 1 5 as the further increase of mesh resolution has negligible effect on the results the mesh resolution of m3 is adopted in the two dimensional simulations 3 3 model validation the computational model used in this work is compared with those available in the literature for flow over a bare circular cylinder at the same reynolds number re 100 as listed in table 2 the deviation between the present st 0 166 and others is quite small within 2 5 the present c d mean 1 34 agrees well with previous reports 1 34 by kang et al 1999 and 1 33 by sharman et al 2005 and the maximum deviation is less than 5 23 as compared to engelman and jamina 1990 muralidharan et al 2013 and burbeau and sagaut 2002 the similar deviation is found in c l rms overall the concerned parameters display good agreement with those in the literature 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic coefficients time series of the hydrodynamic coefficients of the equipped cylinder with air ejected at different velocities are compared in fig 3 it is clearly seen that both the drag and lift coefficients of the bare cylinder fluctuate periodically at certain frequencies f cd 2f cl where f cd and f cl are the corresponding frequencies of c d and c l the periodic loading is the cause of self sustained oscillation and hence potentially fatigue damage the periodical fluctuation is significantly affected by the air jets both the curves of c d and c l become rough at u jet u in 1 illustrating the noise introduced by the air injection and the participation of more frequencies in the fluctuation as 0 096 hz 0 292 hz and 0 482 hz in f cl and 0 197 hz 0 385 hz and 0 582 hz in f cd nevertheless the contribution from higher frequencies is relatively little for c l implying the influence of air flow on vortex shedding is limited in this case when the normalized injection velocity is increased to 2 apart from c d the amplitude of c l also irregularly varies over time suggesting the competition between the air jet flow and the vortex shedding the periodic fluctuation of hydrodynamic coefficients completely disappears at u jet u in 3 with the absent of associated dominant frequencies indication the suppression of vortex shedding from the circular cylinder at u jet u in 4 the fluctuation of hydrodynamic coefficients becomes even smaller illustrating the greater reduction in hydrodynamic forces the reduction of fluid forces exerted on the cylinder surface by ambient fluid is quantitatively compared in fig 4 where the percentages are calculated by using the results from the baseline case the bare cylinder as reference values the rms lift coefficient is reduced by 32 36 when the pair of jets eject air flow in u jet u in nonetheless the drag reduction is limited to 0 17 as the normalized injection velocity increases from 1 to 3 both the lift and drag reductions gain obvious growth up to 96 25 and 15 61 respectively the reduction of fluid forces shows a tendency toward stabilization as the injection velocity further increases it indicates that further increase of injection velocity from u jet u in 4 has no amplification effect on the force reduction which is not recommended due also to the rise of power consumption 4 2 flow structure and evolution in the wake figs 5 7 compare the flow structure evolution of the equipped cylinder at two representative injection velocity u jet u in 1 and u jet u in 4 during a cycle with the bare cylinder where t tu in d is the normalized flow time the flow structure is illustrated in streamlines and two typical velocity contours u 0 and u 1 where u is the normalized velocity u u u in and 1 to 8 represent the moments marked in the lift curve the separation point of boundary layer and the recirculation region can be identified from the contour of u 0 the shear layer is easily outlined by the contours of u 0 and u 1 i e the distance between the contours of u 0 and u 1 represents the thickness of shear layer additionally it is easy to get the process of vortex shedding from the streamlines as shown in fig 5 a clockwise vortex is formed at the upper side of cylinder surface at moment 1 resulting in the formation of an anticlockwise velocity along the cylinder surface consequently the pressure in the upper side is higher than that in the lower side triggering the downward lift force from moment 1 to 3 the clockwise vortex grows gradually leading to the increase of downward lift force acting on the cylinder surface meanwhile an opposing vortex in anticlockwise direction across the wake is drawn by the clockwise vortex during its growth at moment 3 the approach of vorticity in the opposite sign cuts off the supply of vorticity to the clockwise vortex from its boundary layer as a consequence the clockwise vortex is shed from the shear layer and subsequently convected downstream by ambient flow from moment 3 to 5 while the lower anticlockwise vortex grows in size the lift force induced by the upper clockwise vortex is therefore reduced gradually to zero from moment 5 to 8 the lower anticlockwise vortex plays the same role as the former shed clockwise vortex but contributing to the upward lift force the vortex shedding occurs alternately and symmetrically between the two sides explaining the sinusoidal fluctuation of lift force it is also seen from fig 5 that the boundary layers thicken gradually and separate from the cylinder surface around 110 after that the thicknesses of shear layers on both sides continue to increase but are equal to each other the downward deviation of recirculation region is associated with the growth and shedding of the upper vortex while the upward deviation of recirculation region is associated with the growth and shedding of the lower vortex fig 6 reveals the air jet flow does not break through the boundary layer at u jet u in 1 instead it is drawn by the shear layer from the cylinder surface forming a continuous air column like air shear layer nevertheless the air jet flow transfers its momentum to the shear layer during the shear process contributing to the delay of vortex formation and thereby the reduction of lift force subsequently the air column rolls up synchronously with the shear layer to generate an air bubble which locates in the center of vortex and convect downstream with the vortex furthermore many small air bubbles present between the upper and lower air columns and around the shed air bubbles due to the intense interaction with the ambient water flow unlike the bare cylinder the small vortex drawn by its opposing vortex across the wake is not observed due to the occurrence of air columns and bubbles additionally the recirculation region is obviously distorted especially at the position close to the rear surface of cylinder therefore the curve of lift coefficient becomes unsmooth the lift force is further sharply decreased as the normalized injection velocity increases to 4 as seen in fig 7 the recirculation region is mainly occupied by the air ejected from the couple of jets and both the lengths of recirculation region and the shear layer are significantly elongated due to the momentum injected by air jets consequently the vortex formation is delayed to a further downstream position the essential difference between u jet u in 4 and u jet u in 1 is that the air flow transforms passivity into initiative at u jet u in 4 remarkably extending the shear layer while it is drawn by the shear layer at u jet u in 1 it confirms that sufficient jet momentum is required to effectively suppress vortex shedding as reported in previous literature 18 19 furthermore air gathers in a big bubble that contains but larger than the recirculation region a small part of water is entrained by air flow in the big air bubble indicating the violent mixing of air and water which partly contribute to the irregular fluctuating of lift force fig 8 compares the wake width at x d 1 and x d 10 for the considered cases where the wake width is defined as the spacing between the contours of u mean 1 on both sides of cylinder u mean is the time averaged streamwise velocity it is clearly seen from the left column that the outline of boundary layer is pushed outwardly by the air jet flow in the near wake x d 1 and the higher the jet momentum coefficient the wider the near wake width at u jet u in 4 nevertheless the variation of wake width is slight as the injection velocity further increases confirming the air jets with u jet u in 4 have sufficient momentum to control the wake flow the right column in fig 8 depicts the vortex formation length which is prolonged with the increase of injection velocity as well as the wake width at x d 10 which is narrowed as compared to the bare cylinder at u jet u in 7 the vortex formation length reaches 8d about three times of the bare cylinder while the wake width is reduced by 35 the significant elongation of vortex formation length and the decrease of wake width at u jet u in 4 illustrate the great performance in fluid force reduction as in fig 4 4 3 air volume fraction fig 9 shows the contours of time averaged air volume fraction at different injection velocities where the black line represents the contour of α mean 0 5 at u jet u in 1 air columns of length around 1d are observed at the outlet of air jets the air volume fraction rapidly drops when air bubbles are carried downstream after the shedding from air columns the air columns are extended to 3 3d at u jet u in 2 owing to the increase of jet momentum and the air concentration in the recirculation region is accordingly increased at u jet u in 3 some air bubbles emerge between the two air columns and partly connect them more air enters the recirculation region at u jet u in 4 forming a big water entrained air bubble this big air bubble is further enlarged and more water is squeezed out from it as u jet u in increases the evolution of air columns and bubbles with the increase of injection velocity is also illustrated in fig 10 unlike fig 9 the instantaneous snap in the same phase is compared in fig 10 to clearly reveal the air bubbles in the flow wake at u jet u in 1 air bubbles separated from air columns are scattered in small size in the wake while being carried downstream by vortices the size of air bubbles grows gradually as the injection velocity increases from 1 to 3 as a result the deformation of vortices is strengthened due to the interference from air bubbles at u jet u in 4 air bubbles start to separate from the tip of the big water entrained air bubble instead of the air columns vortices are shed from the same position significantly delaying the vortex formation therefore u jet u in 4 is the threshold of fully control of near wake the controlled wake length continues to grow as the injection velocity further increases additionally the vortices become more defective as result of the interruption from air bubbles there are three kinds of air bubble vortex interference observed in the wake as shown in fig 11 the small scattered air bubbles migrate faster than the vortices at u jet u in 1 indicating the slight influence of small bubbles on vortices convection at u jet u in 2 the second kind of interference occurs with air bubbles locating in the center of vortices and being synchronously convected downstream with vortices the occurrence of air bubbles leads to the stretch deformation of vortices nevertheless the bubbles have no sufficient momentum to escape from vortices large bubbles are formed in the wake at u jet u in 4 falling into the third pattern these bubbles draw the ambient vortices and transfer momentum to the vortices while migrating downstream as seen from the right column in fig 11 consequently the vortices are broken into small pieces and hence easier dissipated apart from the three patterns of interference the mergence and split of air bubbles are observed in the wake as depicted in fig 12 two air bubbles labelled a and b at t 260s are selected for illustration where the size of bubble a is larger than bubble b from t 260s to t 272s bubble a is stretched by the ambient vortices because the local flow velocity at its lower side is higher than that at the upper side as a result bubble a is split into two smaller bubbles a1 and a2 at t 272s the size of bubble a2 is similar to bubble b whereas bubble a1 is relatively large subsequently bubble a2 and bubble b migrate faster than bubble a1 and they catch up the adjacent downstream vortices at t 284s as the local velocity of bubble a2 is greater than bubble b the two bubbles merge into a larger one labelled c at t 288s therefore the evolution of air bubbles is related to the bubble size and the velocity distribution of ambient fluid fig 13 displays the instantaneous snapshots of the air bubbles in the far wake of x 50 60d associated with c lmax the resolution of each snapshot is 145 530 and the area occupied by air bubbles is identified and counted by the colored contours of air volume fraction it is seen that the occupied area a g grows gradually with increasing u jet u in from 1 0 to 3 0 and then fluctuates around 3 7 in u jet u in range of 3 0 7 0 which coincides with the trend of hydrodynamic coefficients it implies the air volume fraction in the downstream of the water entrained air bubble has no distinct difference at u jet u in 3 0 nevertheless the size of air bubbles varies both spatially and temporally due to the frequent mergence and split evolution as a result the mean size of air bubbles in the instantaneous snapshots has no pronounced regularity as u jet u in increases fig 14 plots the time histories of air volume fraction at six monitoring points p1 p6 with coordinates in parenthesis where p1 p3 locate at the wake centerline y 0 and p4 p6 locate at y 1d at p1 1d 0 the air volume fraction switches between 0 and 1 at u jet u in 2 illustrating the competition between air and water in contrast the air volume fraction maintains 1 at u jet u in 7 indicating the occupation of air when it moves to p4 1d 1d α 0 occurs in the both two cases it indicates the air jet flow cannot reach this position consistent with the borderline of boundary layer pushed outwardly by jet flow in the near wake as in fig 8 although both of the air volume fractions at u jet u in 2 and u jet u in 7 switch between 0 and 1 at p2 13d 0 the proportion of α 1 at u jet u in 7 is obviously more than that at u jet u in 2 the similar phenomenon is observed at points p3 p5 and p6 nonetheless the proportion of α 0 increases as the monitoring point moves downstream from x 13d to x 30d or departs transversely from the wake centerline to y 1d the variation of air volume fraction at the monitoring points quantitatively demonstrates the air concentration in the wake and the migration of air bubbles as in figs 9 10 the associated time series of streamwise velocities at the six monitoring points are depicted in fig 15 as p1 locates at the wake centerline in the recirculation region the streamwise velocity is close to 0 with negligible fluctuation in contrast u almost equals to u in at p4 confirming p4 is outside the shear layer as seen in fig 8 the difference of streamwise velocity emerges between u jet u in 2 and u jet u in 7 for the other four monitoring points which is closely related with the lengths of the recirculation region and the water entrained air bubble in the case of u jet u in 2 both the points at x 13d p2 and p5 and x 30d p3 and p6 are outside the recirculation region and little affected by the migration of air bubbles due to the small size and space rate as a consequence the streamwise velocity varies around u u in 1 with certain frequencies conversely the four points are inside the water entrained air bubble at u jet u in 7 resulting in the lower streamwise velocities u u in 0 5 with no distinct dominant frequencies 4 4 flow velocity along the wake centerline fig 16 presents the comparison of the time averaged streamwise velocities along the wake centerline the tip of recirculation region is illustrated by the time averaged streamwise velocity changing sign from negative to positive yan et al 2018 it is clearly seen that the length of recirculation region is elongated by injecting air flow into the wake of cylinder and the greater the injection momentum the longer the recirculation region nevertheless the reverse flow velocity is significantly reduced when the air flow enters the recirculation region with sufficient momentum consequently the pressure in the recirculation region rises and the pressure difference between the front and rear surface of cylinder drops partly contributing to the drag reduction it is noted that the time averaged streamwise velocity fluctuates along the wake centerline in the recirculation region at u jet u in 3 indicating the violent mixing of air flow and reverse water flow in contrast the trough of u mean appears distinctly as the bare cylinder but being pushed downstream by the air flow at u jet u in 1 and u jet u in 2 there is a sharp rise in the time averaged streamwise velocity behind the recirculation region as shown in fig 16 the larger the injection velocity the smaller the rising speed particularly at u jet u in 4 the rising speed is less than 40 of the bare cylinder the inflection point of the rising curve corresponds to the shedding point of vortices reflecting the effective scope of vortex elimination which is in consistent with the vorticities in fig 10 5 conclusions in the current study the effect of the injection momentum of active air jet flow control on the vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder at a low reynolds number of 100 has been examined based on two dimensional direct numerical simulation the major conclusions are obtained as follows 1 the pair of air jets mounted on the two shoulders of circular cylinder inject momentum as well as air flow into the cylinder boundary layer yielding the competition between the air flow and vortex shedding in the wake and introducing some noise into the fluctuation of fluid forces the periodic variation of hydrodynamic forces vanishes when air jets eject flow at a triple incoming velocity u jet u in 3 and the fluctuation amplitude is close to 0 at u jet u in 4 consequently more than 95 reduction in lift and 15 reduction in time mean drag are achieved at u jet u in 3 2 as compared to the bare cylinder both the lengths of vortex formation and recirculation region are elongated with the increase of injection momentum while the wake width is narrowed gradually explaining the suppression of vortex shedding and the reduction of fluid forces although the borderline of boundary layer is pushed outwardly by the ejected air the air flow cannot break through the shear layer of the cylinder surface instead it is enveloped by the shear layer air columns occur at the outlet of jets and roll up to form air bubbles under the shear action of shear layers at u jet u in 3 contributing to the delay of vortex formation in contrast more air gather behind the cylinder and a water entrained air bubble with size larger than the recirculation region is formed at u jet u in 4 interrupting the interaction between the upper and lower shear layers within a considerable length as a result the vortex shedding is eliminated in the near wake however the increase of normalized injection velocity from 4 has less effect on further suppression suggesting u jet u in 4 is the critical injection velocity 3 three kinds of air bubble vortex interference have been observed in the wake the first pattern is small scattered air bubbles migrate faster than vortices with slight influence on the vortices convection the second one is air bubbles locate in the center of vortices and synchronously convect downstream with vortices although the air bubbles cannot escape from vortices the presence of bubbles results in the stretch deformation of vortices the last pattern is large bubbles have sufficient momentum to draw the ambient vortices leading to the distortion or even separation of vortices further extensive studies are required to evaluate the control of active air jets on vortex induced vibration and to uncover the underlying physics of air bubble vortex interference and vortex induced vibration credit authorship contribution statement hongjun zhu supervision writing original draft tao tang formal analysis junlei wang

21599,a numerical investigation was conducted to examine the effect of injection velocity of a pair of air jets positioned at the two shoulders of a circular cylinder on the vortex shedding at a low reynolds number re 100 not only the momentum but also the air flow are injected into the cylinder boundary layer by the air jets yielding the gas liquid two phase fluid in the wake the ejected air pushes the borderline of boundary layer outwardly but cannot break through the shear layer air columns ejected from jets roll up to form air bubbles at u jet u in 3 delaying the vortex formation to some extent in contrast a water entrained air bubble with size larger than the recirculation region is formed at u jet u in 4 the vortex shedding is eliminated within a considerable length resulting in the vanishing of periodic fluctuation and amplitude of hydrodynamic forces therefore the threshold of fully control of near wake is u jet u in 4 the time mean drag coefficient and the fluctuation of lift coefficient are reduced up to 99 93 and 17 07 respectively in the presence of air jets with sufficient momentum the air bubble vortex interference and the mergence and split of air bubbles are depending on the bubble size and the velocity distribution of ambient fluid keywords air jet flow control air bubble vortex interference wake flow drag reduction 1 introduction flow around cylindrical structures is prevalent in the natural and engineering applications occurring when water flows past deep water risers heat exchangers and bridge piers to name a few when the reynolds number re u in d ν where u in is the free stream velocity d is the cylinder diameter and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity exceeds a critical value which is 47 for a circular cylinder henderson 1997 periodic vortex shedding emerges in the wake causing fluctuating fluid forces on the cylinder and hence producing structural vibration acoustic noise fang et al 2019 and resonance wang et al 2020a xu et al 2020 effective control methods are therefore required in engineering applications to alter the flow wake and reduce the negative impacts of vortex shedding a great quantity of control schemes have been introduced in the past several decades broadly categorized into passive and active techniques choi et al 2008 in the past decades passive control mainly realized by geometry modification has been extensively investigated due to the simpler implementation without consumption of external energy zdravkovich 1981 yang et al 2019 wang et al 2019a fairings zhu et al 2017 splitter plates wang et al 2019 zhu and wang 2019 zhu et al 2020a helical strakes xu et al 2017 control rods zhu and yao 2015 ding et al 2019 and strips wang et al 2019b zhu et al 2020b are the typical examples nevertheless most of them successfully work in narrow operation ranges compared to passive control active control can adjust the flow separation and vortex shedding more effectively and timely in the cost of external energy input zhu and gao 2017 wang et al 2020b typical active control methods include oscillation rotation zou et al 2019 acoustic excitation and synthetic jets as a promising active control technique synthetic jets have been applied on bluff bodies to modify wakes and hydrodynamic characteristics and control vortex induced vibrations vivs wang et al 2017 feng and wang 2010 experimentally investigated the flow over a circular cylinder controlled by a synthetic jet placed at the rear stagnation point at re 950 it was found that the jet vortex pairs formed near the exit interacted with the shear layers from the cylinder resulting in a symmetric wake mode and hence the weaker interaction between the upper and lower shear layers in their subsequent report feng et al 2010 pointed out that the control effect can be enhanced by increasing the jet momentum the similar experiments on a square cylinder with a jet positioned at the rear surface were carried out by qu et al 2017 at re 836 the wake was observed to be symmetric with the shedding frequency consistent with the control frequency and the separation was effectively suppressed due to the strong perturbations of the jet flow based on the wind tunnel tests at re 3 33 104 gao et al 2019 reported that the lift force was significantly reduced with the implementation of active wake jet at the rear stagnation point and a better control effectiveness was achieved with a higher jet momentum the high reynolds number of 103 105 is considered in the aforementioned literature and only one jet arranged at the rear or front stagnation point is concerned recently wang et al 2016 numerically investigated the wake control of a circular cylinder using a pair of jets at a low reynolds number of 100 it was reported that the vortex street can be effectively suppressed when the pair of jets operated with sufficient momentum and was placed in the quarter arc edge of the leeward side the effects of position angle and momentum coefficient of a pair of jets on the viv control were numerically examined at re 150 wang et al 2019 2020 it was found that both the in line and cross flow vibrations were suppressed when the jets with sufficiently high momentum were positioned at the leeward side the fluid injected from the jets is the same as the ambient fluid either air or water in the previous studies few literature has reported the influence of different fluid medium such as air injected into water flow which will generate gas liquid two phase flow in the wake in our previous study the flow control of a circular cylinder with a pair of air jets positioned at the two shoulders of the cylinder was numerically investigated zhu et al 2019a air vortices and bubbles formed by the jet interrupted the development of boundary layer and naturally shedding vortices resulting in the delay of vortex formation and the suppression of viv in terms of the position coinciding with vortices two migration modes were proposed for the air bubbles in the flow wake the viv control becomes more effective with increasing of the injection velocity of air flow nevertheless only three velocity ratios u jet u in 0 5 1 and 2 where u jet is the free stream velocity were considered in the study corresponding to the momentum coefficient c μ 2ρ g u jet 2 d ρ w u in 2 d from 2 181 10 5 to 3 488 10 4 therefore more comprehensive study on the effect of injection velocity is conducted in this work using the direct numerical simulation dns as detailed flow structure information can be provided by dns at a low reynolds number with the elimination of uncertainties associated with turbulence modeling the reduction of hydrodynamic forces evolution of flow structures migration of air bubbles and time averaged flow field are discussed in detail 2 problem description as shown in fig 1 a pair of air jets is mounted on the two lateral sides of a circular cylinder i e 90 from the rear stagnation point of the cylinder and each air jet covers 5 of the cylinder surface the equipped cylinder is immersed in a uniform water flow u in and air flow is ejected from the couple of jets with a uniform velocity u jet normal to the cylinder surface yielding gas liquid two phase flow in the wake the normalized injection velocity u jet u in ranges from 0 to 7 corresponding to the momentum coefficient c μ from 0 to 5 236 10 3 where u jet u in 0 represents the bare cylinder without the arrangement of air jets the effect of the injection velocity of lateral air jets on the flow over a circular cylinder is examined at a low reynolds number re 100 as the wake transition from two dimensional to three dimensional instability occurs around re 190 jiang et al 2016a b jiang et al 2016a b the two dimensional dns is adopted in this work a rectangular region is selected as the computational domain with 75d in the streamwise direction and 20d in the transverse direction as depicted in fig 1 yielding a blocking rate of 5 the domain size independence test has been carried out in our previous study zhu et al 2019a and thereby no more expatiation here the center of the cylinder is located at a distance of 10d from the upstream and two lateral boundaries resulting in a relatively longer distance of 65d between the cylinder center and the outlet boundary to capture the flow wake a uniform flow is prescribed at the inlet boundary as u u in and v 0 where u and v are the velocity components in the streamwise direction x and transverse direction y respectively the outlet boundary is set as a zero gradient condition u x 0 and v x 0 jiang et al 2018 bhatt and alam 2018 at the two lateral boundaries the symmetrical conditions are adopted as u y 0 and v 0 the no slip condition is imposed on the cylinder surface u 0 and v 0 while the uniform velocity normal to the cylinder surface v u jet is defined in the outlet of air jets 3 computational model and method 3 1 governing equations and solution methodology the two dimensional of flow over the circular cylinder with a pair of air jets is carried out with the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd solver open foam which is composed of c libraries and solves the navier stokes ns equations with the finite volume discretization method fvdm and piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm due to the limited flow velocities and operation at atmospheric pressure both the air and water are considered as incompressible fluid in this work the two dimensional incompressible flow landau and lifshitz 1959 is governed by the unsteady navier stokes ns equations that expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j where x i is the cartesian coordinate in i direction u i is the velocity component in the direction x i t is the flow time p is the pressure and ρ and ν are the density and kinematic viscosity of the mixture fluid pozzetti and peters 2018 fuster et al 2009 respectively defined as 3 ρ 1 α w ρ g α w ρ w 4 ν 1 α w ν g α w ν w where subscript g and w represent air and water respectively and α w is the volume fraction of water the gas liquid interface is identified using the volume of fluid vof model hieu et al 2004 the two dimensional transport equations for the fraction functions are expressed as 5 α w t u α w x v α w y 0 6 α t u α x v α y 0 where α is the volume fraction of air the fourth order cubic scheme and the second order linear scheme are used to deal with the convective and diffusion terms respectively zhu et al 2019b a blended scheme composed of the second order crank nicolson scheme and the first order euler implicit scheme is employed to handle the time derivative term the normalized time step δtu in d is set as 0 001 in accordance with the requirement of the maximum courant friedrichs lewy cfl number in the whole computational domain below 0 5 3 2 computational mesh and mesh dependence check as depicted in fig 2 a large circle of diameter 4d enveloping the circular cylinder with the same center is employed to create an o xy grid system near the cylinder the perimeter of the circular cylinder is equally discretized by 320 nodes and each air jet contains 8 nodes the grid along the radial direction is denser near the cylinder surface with the height of the first layer grid 0 00656d y 0 1 and the cell expansion ratio of 1 015 accordingly fine grids are generated in the wake of cylinder to capture the recirculation region and vortex street the mesh independence check was conducted first for the bare cylinder u jet u in 0 table 1 compares the important calculated results for four different mesh resolutions where st is the strouhal number obtained by the application of the fast fourier transform fft algorithm for the time series of lift coefficient and c d mean and c l rms are the time averaged drag coefficient and root mean square rms lift coefficient respectively defined as 7 c d mean 1 n i 1 n 2 f d t ρ u i n 2 d 8 c l rms 1 n i 1 n 2 f l t ρ u i n 2 d 2 where n is the number of values in the time series for statistics f d t and f l t are the drag and lift forces acting on the cylinder surface respectively the relative deviations in parenthesis are calculated by using the results from the former case as reference values it is seen that the strouhal number and hydrodynamic coefficients converge at m3 with the maximum difference between m3 and m4 less than 1 5 as the further increase of mesh resolution has negligible effect on the results the mesh resolution of m3 is adopted in the two dimensional simulations 3 3 model validation the computational model used in this work is compared with those available in the literature for flow over a bare circular cylinder at the same reynolds number re 100 as listed in table 2 the deviation between the present st 0 166 and others is quite small within 2 5 the present c d mean 1 34 agrees well with previous reports 1 34 by kang et al 1999 and 1 33 by sharman et al 2005 and the maximum deviation is less than 5 23 as compared to engelman and jamina 1990 muralidharan et al 2013 and burbeau and sagaut 2002 the similar deviation is found in c l rms overall the concerned parameters display good agreement with those in the literature 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic coefficients time series of the hydrodynamic coefficients of the equipped cylinder with air ejected at different velocities are compared in fig 3 it is clearly seen that both the drag and lift coefficients of the bare cylinder fluctuate periodically at certain frequencies f cd 2f cl where f cd and f cl are the corresponding frequencies of c d and c l the periodic loading is the cause of self sustained oscillation and hence potentially fatigue damage the periodical fluctuation is significantly affected by the air jets both the curves of c d and c l become rough at u jet u in 1 illustrating the noise introduced by the air injection and the participation of more frequencies in the fluctuation as 0 096 hz 0 292 hz and 0 482 hz in f cl and 0 197 hz 0 385 hz and 0 582 hz in f cd nevertheless the contribution from higher frequencies is relatively little for c l implying the influence of air flow on vortex shedding is limited in this case when the normalized injection velocity is increased to 2 apart from c d the amplitude of c l also irregularly varies over time suggesting the competition between the air jet flow and the vortex shedding the periodic fluctuation of hydrodynamic coefficients completely disappears at u jet u in 3 with the absent of associated dominant frequencies indication the suppression of vortex shedding from the circular cylinder at u jet u in 4 the fluctuation of hydrodynamic coefficients becomes even smaller illustrating the greater reduction in hydrodynamic forces the reduction of fluid forces exerted on the cylinder surface by ambient fluid is quantitatively compared in fig 4 where the percentages are calculated by using the results from the baseline case the bare cylinder as reference values the rms lift coefficient is reduced by 32 36 when the pair of jets eject air flow in u jet u in nonetheless the drag reduction is limited to 0 17 as the normalized injection velocity increases from 1 to 3 both the lift and drag reductions gain obvious growth up to 96 25 and 15 61 respectively the reduction of fluid forces shows a tendency toward stabilization as the injection velocity further increases it indicates that further increase of injection velocity from u jet u in 4 has no amplification effect on the force reduction which is not recommended due also to the rise of power consumption 4 2 flow structure and evolution in the wake figs 5 7 compare the flow structure evolution of the equipped cylinder at two representative injection velocity u jet u in 1 and u jet u in 4 during a cycle with the bare cylinder where t tu in d is the normalized flow time the flow structure is illustrated in streamlines and two typical velocity contours u 0 and u 1 where u is the normalized velocity u u u in and 1 to 8 represent the moments marked in the lift curve the separation point of boundary layer and the recirculation region can be identified from the contour of u 0 the shear layer is easily outlined by the contours of u 0 and u 1 i e the distance between the contours of u 0 and u 1 represents the thickness of shear layer additionally it is easy to get the process of vortex shedding from the streamlines as shown in fig 5 a clockwise vortex is formed at the upper side of cylinder surface at moment 1 resulting in the formation of an anticlockwise velocity along the cylinder surface consequently the pressure in the upper side is higher than that in the lower side triggering the downward lift force from moment 1 to 3 the clockwise vortex grows gradually leading to the increase of downward lift force acting on the cylinder surface meanwhile an opposing vortex in anticlockwise direction across the wake is drawn by the clockwise vortex during its growth at moment 3 the approach of vorticity in the opposite sign cuts off the supply of vorticity to the clockwise vortex from its boundary layer as a consequence the clockwise vortex is shed from the shear layer and subsequently convected downstream by ambient flow from moment 3 to 5 while the lower anticlockwise vortex grows in size the lift force induced by the upper clockwise vortex is therefore reduced gradually to zero from moment 5 to 8 the lower anticlockwise vortex plays the same role as the former shed clockwise vortex but contributing to the upward lift force the vortex shedding occurs alternately and symmetrically between the two sides explaining the sinusoidal fluctuation of lift force it is also seen from fig 5 that the boundary layers thicken gradually and separate from the cylinder surface around 110 after that the thicknesses of shear layers on both sides continue to increase but are equal to each other the downward deviation of recirculation region is associated with the growth and shedding of the upper vortex while the upward deviation of recirculation region is associated with the growth and shedding of the lower vortex fig 6 reveals the air jet flow does not break through the boundary layer at u jet u in 1 instead it is drawn by the shear layer from the cylinder surface forming a continuous air column like air shear layer nevertheless the air jet flow transfers its momentum to the shear layer during the shear process contributing to the delay of vortex formation and thereby the reduction of lift force subsequently the air column rolls up synchronously with the shear layer to generate an air bubble which locates in the center of vortex and convect downstream with the vortex furthermore many small air bubbles present between the upper and lower air columns and around the shed air bubbles due to the intense interaction with the ambient water flow unlike the bare cylinder the small vortex drawn by its opposing vortex across the wake is not observed due to the occurrence of air columns and bubbles additionally the recirculation region is obviously distorted especially at the position close to the rear surface of cylinder therefore the curve of lift coefficient becomes unsmooth the lift force is further sharply decreased as the normalized injection velocity increases to 4 as seen in fig 7 the recirculation region is mainly occupied by the air ejected from the couple of jets and both the lengths of recirculation region and the shear layer are significantly elongated due to the momentum injected by air jets consequently the vortex formation is delayed to a further downstream position the essential difference between u jet u in 4 and u jet u in 1 is that the air flow transforms passivity into initiative at u jet u in 4 remarkably extending the shear layer while it is drawn by the shear layer at u jet u in 1 it confirms that sufficient jet momentum is required to effectively suppress vortex shedding as reported in previous literature 18 19 furthermore air gathers in a big bubble that contains but larger than the recirculation region a small part of water is entrained by air flow in the big air bubble indicating the violent mixing of air and water which partly contribute to the irregular fluctuating of lift force fig 8 compares the wake width at x d 1 and x d 10 for the considered cases where the wake width is defined as the spacing between the contours of u mean 1 on both sides of cylinder u mean is the time averaged streamwise velocity it is clearly seen from the left column that the outline of boundary layer is pushed outwardly by the air jet flow in the near wake x d 1 and the higher the jet momentum coefficient the wider the near wake width at u jet u in 4 nevertheless the variation of wake width is slight as the injection velocity further increases confirming the air jets with u jet u in 4 have sufficient momentum to control the wake flow the right column in fig 8 depicts the vortex formation length which is prolonged with the increase of injection velocity as well as the wake width at x d 10 which is narrowed as compared to the bare cylinder at u jet u in 7 the vortex formation length reaches 8d about three times of the bare cylinder while the wake width is reduced by 35 the significant elongation of vortex formation length and the decrease of wake width at u jet u in 4 illustrate the great performance in fluid force reduction as in fig 4 4 3 air volume fraction fig 9 shows the contours of time averaged air volume fraction at different injection velocities where the black line represents the contour of α mean 0 5 at u jet u in 1 air columns of length around 1d are observed at the outlet of air jets the air volume fraction rapidly drops when air bubbles are carried downstream after the shedding from air columns the air columns are extended to 3 3d at u jet u in 2 owing to the increase of jet momentum and the air concentration in the recirculation region is accordingly increased at u jet u in 3 some air bubbles emerge between the two air columns and partly connect them more air enters the recirculation region at u jet u in 4 forming a big water entrained air bubble this big air bubble is further enlarged and more water is squeezed out from it as u jet u in increases the evolution of air columns and bubbles with the increase of injection velocity is also illustrated in fig 10 unlike fig 9 the instantaneous snap in the same phase is compared in fig 10 to clearly reveal the air bubbles in the flow wake at u jet u in 1 air bubbles separated from air columns are scattered in small size in the wake while being carried downstream by vortices the size of air bubbles grows gradually as the injection velocity increases from 1 to 3 as a result the deformation of vortices is strengthened due to the interference from air bubbles at u jet u in 4 air bubbles start to separate from the tip of the big water entrained air bubble instead of the air columns vortices are shed from the same position significantly delaying the vortex formation therefore u jet u in 4 is the threshold of fully control of near wake the controlled wake length continues to grow as the injection velocity further increases additionally the vortices become more defective as result of the interruption from air bubbles there are three kinds of air bubble vortex interference observed in the wake as shown in fig 11 the small scattered air bubbles migrate faster than the vortices at u jet u in 1 indicating the slight influence of small bubbles on vortices convection at u jet u in 2 the second kind of interference occurs with air bubbles locating in the center of vortices and being synchronously convected downstream with vortices the occurrence of air bubbles leads to the stretch deformation of vortices nevertheless the bubbles have no sufficient momentum to escape from vortices large bubbles are formed in the wake at u jet u in 4 falling into the third pattern these bubbles draw the ambient vortices and transfer momentum to the vortices while migrating downstream as seen from the right column in fig 11 consequently the vortices are broken into small pieces and hence easier dissipated apart from the three patterns of interference the mergence and split of air bubbles are observed in the wake as depicted in fig 12 two air bubbles labelled a and b at t 260s are selected for illustration where the size of bubble a is larger than bubble b from t 260s to t 272s bubble a is stretched by the ambient vortices because the local flow velocity at its lower side is higher than that at the upper side as a result bubble a is split into two smaller bubbles a1 and a2 at t 272s the size of bubble a2 is similar to bubble b whereas bubble a1 is relatively large subsequently bubble a2 and bubble b migrate faster than bubble a1 and they catch up the adjacent downstream vortices at t 284s as the local velocity of bubble a2 is greater than bubble b the two bubbles merge into a larger one labelled c at t 288s therefore the evolution of air bubbles is related to the bubble size and the velocity distribution of ambient fluid fig 13 displays the instantaneous snapshots of the air bubbles in the far wake of x 50 60d associated with c lmax the resolution of each snapshot is 145 530 and the area occupied by air bubbles is identified and counted by the colored contours of air volume fraction it is seen that the occupied area a g grows gradually with increasing u jet u in from 1 0 to 3 0 and then fluctuates around 3 7 in u jet u in range of 3 0 7 0 which coincides with the trend of hydrodynamic coefficients it implies the air volume fraction in the downstream of the water entrained air bubble has no distinct difference at u jet u in 3 0 nevertheless the size of air bubbles varies both spatially and temporally due to the frequent mergence and split evolution as a result the mean size of air bubbles in the instantaneous snapshots has no pronounced regularity as u jet u in increases fig 14 plots the time histories of air volume fraction at six monitoring points p1 p6 with coordinates in parenthesis where p1 p3 locate at the wake centerline y 0 and p4 p6 locate at y 1d at p1 1d 0 the air volume fraction switches between 0 and 1 at u jet u in 2 illustrating the competition between air and water in contrast the air volume fraction maintains 1 at u jet u in 7 indicating the occupation of air when it moves to p4 1d 1d α 0 occurs in the both two cases it indicates the air jet flow cannot reach this position consistent with the borderline of boundary layer pushed outwardly by jet flow in the near wake as in fig 8 although both of the air volume fractions at u jet u in 2 and u jet u in 7 switch between 0 and 1 at p2 13d 0 the proportion of α 1 at u jet u in 7 is obviously more than that at u jet u in 2 the similar phenomenon is observed at points p3 p5 and p6 nonetheless the proportion of α 0 increases as the monitoring point moves downstream from x 13d to x 30d or departs transversely from the wake centerline to y 1d the variation of air volume fraction at the monitoring points quantitatively demonstrates the air concentration in the wake and the migration of air bubbles as in figs 9 10 the associated time series of streamwise velocities at the six monitoring points are depicted in fig 15 as p1 locates at the wake centerline in the recirculation region the streamwise velocity is close to 0 with negligible fluctuation in contrast u almost equals to u in at p4 confirming p4 is outside the shear layer as seen in fig 8 the difference of streamwise velocity emerges between u jet u in 2 and u jet u in 7 for the other four monitoring points which is closely related with the lengths of the recirculation region and the water entrained air bubble in the case of u jet u in 2 both the points at x 13d p2 and p5 and x 30d p3 and p6 are outside the recirculation region and little affected by the migration of air bubbles due to the small size and space rate as a consequence the streamwise velocity varies around u u in 1 with certain frequencies conversely the four points are inside the water entrained air bubble at u jet u in 7 resulting in the lower streamwise velocities u u in 0 5 with no distinct dominant frequencies 4 4 flow velocity along the wake centerline fig 16 presents the comparison of the time averaged streamwise velocities along the wake centerline the tip of recirculation region is illustrated by the time averaged streamwise velocity changing sign from negative to positive yan et al 2018 it is clearly seen that the length of recirculation region is elongated by injecting air flow into the wake of cylinder and the greater the injection momentum the longer the recirculation region nevertheless the reverse flow velocity is significantly reduced when the air flow enters the recirculation region with sufficient momentum consequently the pressure in the recirculation region rises and the pressure difference between the front and rear surface of cylinder drops partly contributing to the drag reduction it is noted that the time averaged streamwise velocity fluctuates along the wake centerline in the recirculation region at u jet u in 3 indicating the violent mixing of air flow and reverse water flow in contrast the trough of u mean appears distinctly as the bare cylinder but being pushed downstream by the air flow at u jet u in 1 and u jet u in 2 there is a sharp rise in the time averaged streamwise velocity behind the recirculation region as shown in fig 16 the larger the injection velocity the smaller the rising speed particularly at u jet u in 4 the rising speed is less than 40 of the bare cylinder the inflection point of the rising curve corresponds to the shedding point of vortices reflecting the effective scope of vortex elimination which is in consistent with the vorticities in fig 10 5 conclusions in the current study the effect of the injection momentum of active air jet flow control on the vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder at a low reynolds number of 100 has been examined based on two dimensional direct numerical simulation the major conclusions are obtained as follows 1 the pair of air jets mounted on the two shoulders of circular cylinder inject momentum as well as air flow into the cylinder boundary layer yielding the competition between the air flow and vortex shedding in the wake and introducing some noise into the fluctuation of fluid forces the periodic variation of hydrodynamic forces vanishes when air jets eject flow at a triple incoming velocity u jet u in 3 and the fluctuation amplitude is close to 0 at u jet u in 4 consequently more than 95 reduction in lift and 15 reduction in time mean drag are achieved at u jet u in 3 2 as compared to the bare cylinder both the lengths of vortex formation and recirculation region are elongated with the increase of injection momentum while the wake width is narrowed gradually explaining the suppression of vortex shedding and the reduction of fluid forces although the borderline of boundary layer is pushed outwardly by the ejected air the air flow cannot break through the shear layer of the cylinder surface instead it is enveloped by the shear layer air columns occur at the outlet of jets and roll up to form air bubbles under the shear action of shear layers at u jet u in 3 contributing to the delay of vortex formation in contrast more air gather behind the cylinder and a water entrained air bubble with size larger than the recirculation region is formed at u jet u in 4 interrupting the interaction between the upper and lower shear layers within a considerable length as a result the vortex shedding is eliminated in the near wake however the increase of normalized injection velocity from 4 has less effect on further suppression suggesting u jet u in 4 is the critical injection velocity 3 three kinds of air bubble vortex interference have been observed in the wake the first pattern is small scattered air bubbles migrate faster than vortices with slight influence on the vortices convection the second one is air bubbles locate in the center of vortices and synchronously convect downstream with vortices although the air bubbles cannot escape from vortices the presence of bubbles results in the stretch deformation of vortices the last pattern is large bubbles have sufficient momentum to draw the ambient vortices leading to the distortion or even separation of vortices further extensive studies are required to evaluate the control of active air jets on vortex induced vibration and to uncover the underlying physics of air bubble vortex interference and vortex induced vibration credit authorship contribution statement hongjun zhu supervision writing original draft tao tang formal analysis junlei wang
