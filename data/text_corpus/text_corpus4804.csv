24020,a depth integrated high resolution down to 25 50 m tide and storm surge model has been developed for the alaska region with a focus on the coasts of western alaska the model uses the adcirc basin to channel scale unstructured grid circulation code forced with climate forecast system version 2 reanalysis meteorology the tidal solution has been validated at 121 shelf and nearshore stations with lower overall errors than a data assimilated tidal model fes2012 the adcirc model shows considerable skill at simulating tide and coastal surge and resulting overland flooding on the yukon kuskokwim delta during both summer and winter storms the root mean square error of the model does not exceed 20 cm at any station outperforming the global ocean forecasting system gofs 3 1 a 1 12 data assimilated ocean general circulation model which is coupled to sea ice physics the adcirc model incorporates the effect of sea ice through parameterizations of the wind drag coefficient modifying the air sea momentum transfer under ice coverage three large winter storms with distinctly different ice coverages along the coasts of western alaska were chosen to exhibit the variable effect of sea ice on the resulting storm surge under forming coastal ice coverage local increases in water levels due to ice is seen in coastal areas and under predominantly dense pack ice an increase in momentum transfer in the marginal sea ice at the shelf break leads to an increase in sea levels across the entire bering sea both commensurate with observations under the most variable ice fields results are mixed in part due to uncertainties in the air sea ice drag parameterization such as related to the assumption that sea ice drift and wind velocities are always well correlated including a description of sea ice drift and current speeds explicitly in the air sea ice drag formulation and considering wave surge ice interaction should improve the description of momentum transferred to the water column and resulting simulation of surge keywords alaska storm surge tides sea ice high resolution 1 introduction coastal alaska fig 1 spans over 54 000 km with highly diverse geography ranging from sharp volcanic relief in the south to low lying deltas and tundra in the west and north the geometry of the region is complex and the tidal range across the four main basins varies dramatically ranging from a macro tidal coast along the gulf of alaska to a micro tidal environment in chukchi and beaufort seas moreover particularly strong storms developing in the late fall and winter induce storm surge that can amplify significantly on the broad and shallow bering shelf the low lying coastal floodplain of western alaska is particularly vulnerable to the effects of such surge which combined with a meso tidal environment can result in significant damages to these coastal communities as a representative of the high impact storms that pass through the region the november 2011 bering sea superstorm resulted in damages to 37 villages and cities due to surge which measured up to 3 m in portions of the norton sound kinsman and deraps 2012 the additional complication for the alaska region is the presence of sea ice and how it affects tides and surge the details of which are not well understood currently there is particular interest in the effect of sea ice on tides and storm surges changing climatic conditions may affect ice coverage and thickness in the present and future hence alaska s risk exposure overeem et al 2011 in the bering chukchi and beaufort seas sea ice is present for a significant portion of the year and there is strong inter and intra annual variability in the ice coverage erikson et al 2015 sea ice usually begins forming in november and can last in the bering sea until as late as july as the ice forms it covers the entirety of the beaufort and chukchi seas while extending to the shelf break of the bering shelf in the south storms in alaska are also stronger during the late autumn and winter months when portions or entire basins are covered in ice mesquita et al 2010 however in the past four decades there has been an observed delay in the formation of sea ice in the bering sea which has coincided with a 26 per decade decrease in total sea ice cover in the bering sea erikson et al 2015 there is some indication that these changes are already having an effect on the severity of the storm environment where for example ice drift speeds have doubled over the past two decades spreen et al 2011 effectively increasing the transfer of momentum to the water at the ice ocean interface quantifying the potential effects of these changing ice conditions requires a baseline understanding of the underlying wind ice ocean interactions a significant body of modeling work has been conducted to develop an understanding of the interplay between sea ice tides and atmospheric forcing in the arctic region recently kleptsova and pietrzak 2018 used a high resolution barotropic tidal model to investigate the seasonal effect of ice on tidal constituents in the canadian arctic archipelago demonstrating that tidal phases can change by 180 degrees on a month to month basis zhang et al 2010 examined the impact of atmospheric forcing and tides on the development of sea ice in the bering sea on decadal time scales and showed the strong impact of wind driven ice mass advection on sea ice extent variability the unstructured grid finite volume ao fvcom has been applied to the arctic ocean for ice free conditions chen et al 2009 and extended with a coupled sea ice model gao et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2009 highlighted the importance of stratification on tidal currents and phasing but not the total water transport and thus tidal elevation this model zhang et al 2016 showed good ability to reproduce sea ice extent ice drift and ice thickness in the arctic region over multi decadal periods but it has yet to be applied for the simulation of specific storm surge events storm surge modeling efforts for the region in particular have focused on the beaufort and chukchi seas kowalik 1984 and norton sound johnson and kowalik 1986 blier et al 1997 chapman et al 2009 while these previous models have used a variety of methods to account for the presence of ice coverage they have not focused on resolving coastal floodplains or inlets in order to improve our understanding of the combined impact of tides and surge to coastal communities on the western alaska coast the main focus of this study is to simulate tides and historic storm surge events using an unstructured grid based model of the alaska region with high resolution to resolve coastal floodplains and inlets on the bering sea and the western alaskan coast additionally we investigate a simplified parameterization of the effect of sea ice on air sea wind drag henceforth called air sea ice drag impacting the development and propagation of storm surge when sea ice conditions exist previously both data assimilated barotropic tidal models foreman et al 2006 and baroclinic coupled ocean ice models chen et al 2009 danielson et al 2011 have been developed to study tides in the bering sea these previous works highlight the importance of dissipation of tidal energy as the tide flows through the aleutian islands tidal studies of the arctic ocean and along the northern coasts of alaska have shown that the presence of sea ice can significantly alter the barotropic mode and is important to consider when modeling in ice covered regions kleptsova and pietrzak 2018 kagan and sofina 2010 holloway and proshutinsky 2007 satellite altimeter data has also shown strong seasonal variability in tidal constituents due to sea ice in the alaska region north of 60 degrees latitude fok et al 2012 as such the current study provides results for the arctic ocean portions of the alaska region beaufort and chukchi sea but acknowledges that tidal model performance may suffer here due to the lack of a fully coupled ice ocean model nevertheless it is stressed that our main focus is the combined effect of tides and surge to the western alaska coast where ice is generally thinner and present less often we start by comparing our high resolution model in the bering sea to data assimilated tidal model solutions fes2012 carr√®re et al 2013 and an array of tidal constituent observations along the alaskan coast second sea level variations during a strong summer storm are analyzed versus the global ocean forecast system 3 1 gofs 3 1 metzger et al 2017 an operational 1 12 data assimilated ocean general circulation modeling ogcm system in addition comparisons with observations are made along the western alaska coast last a parameterization for air sea ice drag is proposed used to simulate three particularly strong winter storms under varying ice conditions and compared to a previously used parameterization the sea level variations here are also compared to the fully ice coupled gofs 3 1 model and the observations at the available western alaska coastal locations we evaluate the accuracy of our model for predicting peak surge and the water level time series throughout a month under each scenario finally limitations of the current model setup are discussed and suggestions for future model improvements are made 2 model description 2 1 adcirc ocean circulation model the alaska tide and storm surge model described in this paper applies the unstructured grid advanced circulation adcirc code as implemented in this model adcirc solves the depth integrated barotropic shallow water equations in spherical coordinates in a continuous galerkin finite element framework to compute water surface elevation and currents westerink et al 2008 adcirc s finite element unstructured grid framework and high computational scalability allows us to apply the alaska tide and storm surge model over a wide range of hydrodynamic scales from the deep ocean to the nearshore into coastal estuaries and onto coastal floodplains a wetting and drying algorithm based on water depths is used to represent both flooding and the recession of water 2 2 model domain definition and development the model domain fig 2 stretches from the north pacific ocean to the arctic ocean including the gulf of alaska bering sea chukchi sea and beaufort sea there are two curved open ocean boundaries in the model the northern boundary is in the arctic ocean with a northernmost point of 80 n and ranges from 190 w in the west to 134 w in the east the longer southern boundary follows across the northern pacific ocean from 204 w in the west to 128 w in the east the southern extent of this boundary is 39 n we chose the open ocean boundaries to be primarily in deep water where the tidal signal is dominated by the major astronomical tidal constituents and nonlinear tidal constituents are minimal the land boundaries of the domain are defined by the russian coastline to the west and the alaskan coastline to the east the minimum resolution of the model is approximately 5 km in the deep ocean the resolution increases to 1 km on the alaskan shelf and to at least 500 m along most of the coast in addition a number of overland regions on the western alaska coast are finely represented in the model to enable the detailed simulation of coastal flooding an aspect that other coastal ocean models of the region have not yet included of particular interest here is the vulnerable low lying deltaic system formed by the yukon and kuskokwim rivers in the bering sea fig 2 the yukon kuskokwim yk delta is home to native alaskan populations who reside in bethel and numerous other small villages the delta has been incorporated into the model in extensive detail with element sizes as small as 25 m other overland areas represented in the model are found north of the bering strait which are resolved using minimum element sizes between 25 m and 50 m this includes the numerous inlets and lagoons on the chukchi sea facing side of the alaskan coastline and the barrier islands lagoons and floodplains of kotzebue sound the grid itself contains 8 060 620 triangular linear elements comprised of 4 055 605 vertices fig 2 highlights the narrow shelves along alaska s southern and northern coasts the submarine ridge that separates the pacific ocean from the bering sea and the expansive bering and chukchi shelves the bering and chukchi shelves are on average less than 100 m deep and the core bering strait region is on average approximately 50 m deep the model bathymetry and topography have been assembled from a variety of sources etopo1 amante and eakins 2009 the international bathymetric chart of the arctic ocean jakobsson et al 2012 gebco gebco 2014 various national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa produced digital elevation models lim et al 2011b a carignan et al 2009b medley et al 2009 carignan et al 2009a taylor et al 2008 and the srtm30 bathymetry and elevation data becker et al 2009 2 3 parameterized dissipative and dispersive processes the adcirc model described in this paper applies three parameterizations to include dissipative processes in the momentum equations two are incorporated into the bottom stress term in the i th horizontal direction east west and south north shown here in einstein s notation 1 œÑ b i n

linear frictional coefficient related to internal tide induced energy conversion the term on the left is a parameterized implementation of bottom friction using a spatially varying manning s n coefficient deep and shelf waters are assigned a manning s n coefficient of 0 025 while back bays estuaries and lagoons are assigned a default value of 0 035 overland values are assigned using land cover data from the national land cover database nlcd homer et al 2015 which are converted to representative manning s n coefficients using table 3 in bunya et al 2010 fig 2 shows the resulting manning s n coefficients on the yk delta the f i term is a parameterized description of the conversion of the barotropic to baroclinic tidal energy due to the generation of baroclinic internal tides

frequency is calculated using temperature and salinity casts from the world ocean database boyer et al 2013 considered here to be time and season independent high grid resolution through the aleutians and in many key embayments together with an accurate advection scheme and the momentum diffusion term directly simulate lateral eddy structure and dissipation the eddy viscosity coefficient in the diffusion term is set to 2 m2s 1 in water and 20 m2s 1 overland 2 4 tidal forcing tides are forced in the model with a periodic elevation boundary condition using the eight dominant astronomical tidal constituents the semidiurnal m 2 n 2 s 2 k 2 and diurnal o 1 k 1 p 1 q 1 along the two curved open ocean boundaries in addition tidal potential functions and the self attraction and load tide are forced at each node within the model domain for the same eight constituents the boundary and self attraction and load tide forcing data has been predominantly extracted from the fes2012 data assimilated global tidal solutions carr√®re et al 2013 the k 1 constituent boundary forcing was extracted from the tpxo8 data assimilated global tidal solutions egbert et al 1994 egbert and erofeeva 2002 based on better agreement with observations for tidal amplitudes with this constituent than fes2012 the nodal factors and equilibrium arguments for the tidal forcing are determined based on the starting time and duration of the simulation a ramping period is used to ensure that any initial transients are minimized prior to times where results are recorded 2 5 atmospheric forcing atmospheric wind speed and pressure fields from the national centers for environmental prediction s climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 saha et al 2014 reanalysis are used to force the model at the ocean surface cfsv2 provides hourly wind speeds at a 10 m height with a horizontal resolution of 0 205 degrees by 0 204 degrees and hourly atmospheric pressure reduced to mean sea level at a resolution of 0 5 degrees to have more consistent open boundary conditions in the presence of atmospheric pressure forcing the elevation change according to the inverted barometer effect is accounted for along the open boundary neutral stability 10 m wind speeds u 10 i are converted to a surface stress in the i th horizontal direction east west and south north as follows 3 œÑ s i œÅ a c d u 10 i u 10 j u 10 j where œÅ a is the density of air and c d is the drag coefficient defining the air sea momentum transfer under no ice conditions c d is equivalent to c d w the air sea drag coefficient c d w is computed from garratt s drag formula garratt 1977 limited to an upper bound of c d w 0 0025 in order to represent sheeting of waves at high wind speeds 27 m s 4 c d w min 2 5 0 75 0 067 u 10 j u 10 j 1 0 3 2 6 ice cover and forcing ice coverage impacts the energy balance of the ocean during a storm for example measurements have shown that c d has a lower dependency on wind speed at high ice densities macklin 1983 fujisaki et al 2009 momentum from the wind may be imparted to the ice through form drag c d i f and skin drag c d i s instead of directly to the ocean the ice then transfers this momentum to the ocean through its movement altering the relationship between wind speed and ocean stresses and in turn the resulting storm surge previous adcirc applications in this region chapman et al 2005 2009 used an empirical formulation for c d i c e cf birnbaum and l√ºpkes 2002 garbrecht et al 2002 that was applied as a lower limit on c d under ice coverage i e 5 c d max c d w c

2009 but smoothly transitions to the same lower limit 0 00075 as c d w in 4 a f is the area fraction of ice coverage and ranges from 0 to 1 as a potential improvement to 5 in this study we use a drag coefficient that integrally combines contributions from both the ice covered and ice free portions of a given element various investigations have shown that an area weighted approach zippel and thompson 2016 l√ºpkes and birnbaum 2005 l√ºpkes et al 2013 that considers both the form and skin drag over the ice floe l√ºpkes and birnbaum 2005 l√ºpkes et al 2013 lu et al 2011 can be used as a parameterization for the drag coefficient leading to the following formulation which we adopt here 6 c d 1 a f c d w a f c d i s c d i f where c d i s is the contribution due to ice skin drag represented as a constant value of 0 0015 l√ºpkes et al 2012 and c d i f is the form drag contribution from the ice represented as a semi parabolic function of a f l√ºpkes et al 2012 7 c d i f 4 c d i f m a x a f 1 a f where we set c d i f m a x to 0 0025 which is the maximum value of c d i f that occurs at 50 ice coverage note that c d i f m a x used here is approximately four times as large as standard c d i f m a x 0 000558 l√ºpkes and birnbaum 2005 but it is close to the upper bound of experimental measurements presented in l√ºpkes et al 2012 the total c d as a function of a f and u 10 is illustrated in fig 3 c d is almost always larger than c d w and maximum 0 0045 at 50 ice coverage this is explained as an effect of the form drag in which there is an interplay between the increased number of ice floe edges and additional sheltering of the atmospheric flow downstream of ice floes with increasing sea ice concentration l√ºpkes et al 2012 this is in contrast to 5 where ice is essentially not considered in high wind speeds as the wind drag coefficient c d w is higher than the ice drag c d i c e under most high wind speed scenarios as the ice coverage percentage increases towards 100 ice skin drag assumed to be constant here becomes the dominant momentum transfer mechanism from air to ocean thus at a high ice coverage a f 90 and relatively high wind speeds c d is less than c d w the open ocean air sea drag in order to compute a f in this study gridded daily 1 12 sea ice concentration fields that have been developed for the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate reanalysis project grumbine 1996 2014 are used all meteorological and ice data used in this study is linearly interpolated in space and time onto our model grid 3 tides and model data comparisons the tidal range across the four main basins in the alaskan region varies dramatically fig 4 the macro tidal coast along the gulf of alaska exhibits strong basin edge tidal amplification where the geometry of cook inlet in the western gulf of alaska provides favorable conditions for local amplification of the semi diurnal constituents the major tidal constituents enter the bering sea as a progressive wave from the pacific ocean through the aleutian islands kowalik 1999 as the tide moves through the island chain and over the associated undersea mountain range high currents and associated vertical and lateral eddying through the passes dissipate tidal energy foreman et al 2006 in the bering sea dissipation over the broad and shallow bering sea shelf and the reflections caused by the shape of the partially enclosed basin lead to a complex structure for the main tidal constituents there is relatively little tidal flux through the bering strait from the micro tidal chukchi and beaufort seas into the bering sea the micro tidal environment north of the bering strait is due to weakened tidal potential forcing at high latitudes westerink et al 1994 overall the geometric and bathymetric complexity of the alaskan region coupled with the importance of geostrophic effects at high latitudes results in complex tidal dynamics with strong spatial variability in order to assess the representation of the tidal dynamics in our model we computed a 120 day tide only forced simulation and harmonically analyzed the resulting time history records over the last 90 days a 30 day hyperbolic tangent ramp function was applied to minimize the generation of transients associated with the quiescent initial condition the model results for the four major tidal constituents k 1 o 1 m 2 n 2 spatial distribution of amplitudes and phases are shown in fig 5 are compared regionally against the data assimilated fes2012 tidal solutions fig 6 and locally against 115 noaa water level tide gauges along the alaska coastline https tidesandcurrents noaa gov products html and 6 international association for the physical sciences of the oceans iapso shelf based stations smithson 1992 locations are shown in fig 1 the distribution of the presented model errors at these stations is shown in fig 7 and table 1 shows the modeled to observed error statistics for the both the presented model and the fes2012 global tidal model 3 1 diurnal constituents the amplitudes of the diurnal constituents vary slowly between 0 2 m to 0 5 m in the gulf of alaska here diurnal differences with the fes2012 model are under 2 5 cm except at the back of cook inlet where k 1 differences become large presumably because of insufficient resolution in the fes2012 model indeed adcirc amplitude phase errors with tide gauge data is within 10 10 almost everywhere including at the back of cook inlet for k 1 however the amplitudes are underestimated for o 1 in the bering sea the diurnal constituents are larger and vary more rapidly spatially with amplitudes between 0 m and 1 m there is strong edge amplification along the entire eastern edge of the bering shelf particularly in bristol bay in the southeast bering sea both of the main diurnal constituents exhibit two prominent amphidromic and one degenerate amphidromic points on the southern portion of the bering sea shelf just north of the bering strait and on the northwestern end of norton sound notable differences with the fes2012 model feature along the edge of the yk delta and into norton sound which correspond to some of the larger diurnal phase and amplitude differences of the model with tide gauge observations in particular the under prediction of diurnal amplitudes in the kuskokwim river may correspond to an insufficient description of certain features here the bathymetry is notably difficult to measure with high resolution methods such as lidar due to turbidity in the water additionally no river inflow is included in the model the stations with the largest errors in norton sound such as unalakleet and shaktoolik are found within or in front of inlets and back bays which have not been fully resolved in the model these inlets and other details are important for capturing localized gradients in the tidal amplitudes due to dissipation as the tide propagates into the backbay furthermore the location of a degenerate amphidrome in the westernmost portion of norton sound increases the challenge of modeling the diurnal tide at these stations although differences with the fes2012 model are not largely apparent in the high latitudes where the diurnal amplitudes are small phase lag errors at the tide gauges are large in regions such as the eastern chukchi sea which is approximately 100 degrees out of phase for k 1 such phase lag errors are found near the amphidromic point just north of the bering strait indicating that amphidromic positioning is likely the source of most of the error here since amphidromic points are strongly impacted by the frictional dynamics rienecker and teubner 1980 the error could be attributed to inaccurate representations of the shelf edge sea bed or sea ice friction or otherwise uncertainties in the tidal boundary conditions overall the coefficient of determination or r 2 values for the presented model computed amplitudes of the main diurnal constituents range between 0 845 and 0 962 while the r 2 values for the diurnal phases range between 0 902 and 0 956 the absolute average error for each of the constituents is 3 5 cm and 2 5 cm respectively for the k 1 and o 1 constituents respectively in comparison to the fes2012 global tidal model the presented model performs significantly better for the larger k 1 constituent across all error metrics but the opposite is seen for the o 1 constituent table 1 this discrepancy can be attributed partly to the use of the tpxo8 global tidal model to force the k 1 tidal constituent at the open ocean boundaries 3 2 semidiurnal constituents the two major semidiurnal constituents have an almost identical structure to each other with the m 2 constituent being considerably larger in magnitude basin edge amplification leads to amplitudes of greater than 1 m for the m 2 tide along the gulf of alaska coast resonance in cook inlet leads to strong amplification of the semidiurnal tide similar to the diurnal tides differences with fes2012 in the gulf of alaska only become significant at the back of cook inlet where the m 2 amplitude exceeds 3 5 m however it should be noted that the presented model is in excellent agreement with tide gauge observations here the aleutian islands have a strong effect on the structure of the semidiurnal tides with large gradients in both amplitude and phase across the island chain prior to the addition of parameterized internal tide dissipation to the model the m 2 amplitude was overpredicted by at least 20 at each of the tidal stations found on the north side of the aleutian islands the aleutian islands and related strong bathymetric gradients are conducive to generating internal tides that dissipate the barotropic tide as parameterized by eq 2 moreover tidal currents are strong in this area fig 8 also leading to greater dissipation inclusion of this parameterized baroclinically generated dissipation effectively halved the average error in the semidiurnal amplitudes on the north side of the aleutians although noticeable differences in the m 2 tide with the fes2012 model through some regions of the aleutian islands are observable the presented model is in close agreement at every tide gauge here large gradients in amplitude and phase are seen in the bering sea with strong amplification in bristol bay both semidiurnal constituents have 8 amphidromic points in the domain with five being located on the bering chukchi shelf the partially closed nature of the bering sea which reflects the tide and the breadth and depth of the shallow shelf are the main factors contributing to the complexity of the tide in this area the high level of spatial complexity is more evident in the semidiurnal constituents than the diurnal ones because of the shorter semidiurnal wavelengths the amphidromic system in norton sound leads to small semidiurnal tidal amplitudes there as with the diurnal constituents the greatest differences with fes2012 occur in bristol bay along the yk delta and into norton sound compared with observations the presented model is in close agreement except for in the kuskokwim river and wood river north bristol bay the semidiurnal tide is generally well predicted by the presented model with r 2 values of greater than 0 947 for all amplitudes and greater than 0 953 for the phases the absolute average error is 8 cm for the m 2 tide phase lags at the tide gauges are in excellent agreement with observations including in the vicinity of amphidromic points in the bering sea across all errors statistics for the m 2 tide the presented model performs better than fes2012 at the primarily coastal observation stations table 1 overall in terms of amplitudes the absolute average error is approximately 4 7 cm smaller and the normalized root mean square error rmse is 25 less in the presented model the normalized rmse in the phase is 39 less the differences between the models fig 6 are fairly small in the semidiurnal constituents away from the coast but large differences appear in the nearshore particularly in the m 2 constituent this and the difference in performance between the models at nearshore stations highlight the importance of nearshore model resolution to capture the complexity and amplification of the tide as it interacts with shallow bathymetry in nearshore areas of the 121 data comparison stations only 20 stations used a time series greater than 3 months to derive the harmonic constituents a longer record would be desirable to improve the accuracy of the harmonic decomposition the simulations presented in this paper do not include the effects of sea ice dissipation on the tide which can have large effects on amphidromic positioning kleptsova and pietrzak 2018 many of the comparison constituents are based on ice free records as most of the stations throughout western and northern alaska are short term and were deployed in ice free conditions however intra seasonal variability of tides is expected as large portions of the bering and chukchi sea vary between ice covered and ice free conditions throughout the year thus forcing the northern boundary of the model with stationary constituents from satellite altimetry derived global solutions may also negatively impact amphidromic positioning in the northern region of the domain meteorology is also ignored in this tidal data comparison and may affect total dissipation and or may drive pressure modes on the regional and basin scale 4 storm surge under ice free conditions to assess the performance of the coupled tide and storm surge model without the added complications of ice the model was applied during august 2012 an ice free summer month featuring a notable summer storm event along the coast of western alaska summer storms in the region are typically longer less intense and slower than storms in late fall and winter mesquita et al 2010 with lower mean storm surge heights this month was simulated using a 16 day ramping period and a 31 day simulation period with tidal forcing and the hourly cfsv2 atmospheric forcing applied this simulation was also run without tidal forcing in order to better understand the evolution of storm surges all three noaa stations with data were used to assess the computed water levels along the coast of western and northern alaska nome red dog dock and prudhoe bay nome is located at the head of norton sound red dog dock sits on the chukchi sea to the north of kotzebue sound and prudhoe bay is located in the north of alaska on the beaufort sea fig 1 the event of interest around august 14 18 2012 consisted of predominately southerly winds moving from west to east over the bering sea and led to increased water levels over a large portion of the coastline both north and south of the bering strait fig 9 shows the progression of the storm s wind field and the development of storm surge in general the storm surge component of total water level is focused on the shelves and sounds and amplifies along the eastern shores of the bering and chukchi seas as the storm moved over norton sound in the morning of the 15th over 1 m of surge was built up along the northern portion of the sound the surge entering norton sound was amplified in the eastern portion of the sound particularly norton bay and held against the northern portion by strong winds the storm produced strong mainly southerly currents of up to 1 ms 1 within the bering and chukchi seas and through the bering strait analyses indicate that the modeled elevation and current fields are strongly impacted by geostrophic effects particularly in the west of norton sound and along the north slope where storm surge is increased by up to 0 3 m forcing wind speeds table 2 are both over and underestimated by the cfsv2 forcing during the storm along the alaskan coasts and atmospheric pressure is in strong agreement to observations at the coastal stations table 3 the water surface elevation response at all stations with or without tides is generally well captured fig 10 peak errors in the water surface elevation response are small no more than 6 7 cm and in fact slightly overestimated table 4 the non tidal surge response of the model was also compared to the gofs 3 1 ogcm which does not include tides at the available observation stations right column of fig 10 the general trend is quite comparable between the models however the water level response for the presented model follows the observations more closely in particular the simulated peak surges at nome and red dog dock are in very good agreement to observations while they are underestimated in gofs 3 1 at prudhoe bay in the northern arctic the presented model is able to reproduce the smaller trough on august 15 however neither model could reproduce the significant trough on august 25 statistically correlation coefficients and rmse are comparable between the models except at nome where the presented model performs noticeably better tables 5 and 6 5 storm surge in the presence of sea ice in the winter and late fall there are a higher number of extreme events in the alaska region mesquita et al 2010 storms representative of this trend affected the bering sea in november 2011 february 2011 and january 2017 fig 11 shows the area fraction a f of ice or percent ice coverage over the model domain during these months the november 2011 storm occurred while narrow marginal ice zones were starting to form along the coasts of the chukchi and bering seas with partial 50 area fractions being representative in this proposed parameterization sea ice with these concentrations increases the amount of momentum imparted into the sea under wind forcing in february 2011 the chukchi sea and most of the bering sea north of the shelf break was covered in pack ice with an area fraction between 95 and 100 an ice coverage greater than 90 specifically in strong winds is capable of decreasing the wind stress on the water the zone adjacent to the shelf break was covered in an extensive marginal ice zone with highly variable sea ice area fraction due to a low arctic sea ice extent in january 2017 much of the ice in the bering sea was present in concentrations ranging from 30 near the ice edge to 70 closer to shore which represents a range with the greatest enhancement of air sea momentum transfer in our air sea ice drag parameterization presented in 6 this proposed air sea ice drag parameterization will also be compared to the previously used parameterization shown in 5 all three storms had similar tracks of extremely low atmospheric pressure minimum below 950 960 mbar fig 12 and resulted in more than 1 5 m of surge in western alaska each of the storms were simulated as part of a month long simulation with and without tides a 5 day ramping period was used for tides to quantify the impact that ice coverage had on the resulting surge each storm was also run without considering ice coverage 5 1 november 2011 this extratropical cyclone affected the bering sea and coastal alaska from november 8th to november 11th 2011 the storm entered the model domain late into the day on november 7th with a central low pressure of 943 mbar with a track over the western aleutian islands and a cohesive cyclonic structure and maximum sustained wind speeds reaching 35 ms 1 the progression of the storm in the bering sea and the response in water surface elevation without tides are shown in fig 13 as the storm moved over the bering sea shelf strong shelf currents in excess of 2 ms 1 developed the predominantly southerly and southeasterly winds forced water into and across norton sound with strong cross sound setup and through the bering strait late in the day on november 9th the storm clearly separates into two bands as the first band of strong southeasterly winds passed storm surge was built up in the eastern and northern portion of norton sound and amplified in norton bay this band maintained its strength north of the bering strait causing storm surge to build up along the coastal areas northeast of the bering strait including kotzebue sound and at red dog dock in between these two bands calmer winds allowed for the storm surge to relax and begin to exit norton sound however as the second slightly weaker band of westerly winds moved over norton sound surge was again built up in the eastern and northern portion this second band had weakened significantly traveling north and therefore had much less effect on water levels north of the bering strait during this storm there was significant overland flooding which occurred along the yk delta region the extent of this flooding was estimated by 56 using evidence of snow melt in satellite imagery fig 14 compares this estimated maximum flooding extent to that simulated by the presented model including tidal forcing and the proposed ice drag while certain areas differ the general flooding patterns are in qualitative agreement moreover maximum surge height critical to the estimation of overland flooding is considerably larger than that simulated by gofs 3 1 this is particularly apparent in norton sound most of bristol bay and along the coast of the yk delta with the exception that maximum surge in gofs 3 1 is greatly amplified at the head of bristol bay fig 15 the comparison with satellite observation and gofs 3 1 highlights the ability of the presented model to reasonably represent surge amplification and the kilometers of overland flooding that was caused in this region by the november 2011 bering sea superstorm tables 2 and 3 show that the cfsv2 meteorology at nome red dog dock and prudhoe bay captures most of the details of the wind speed and atmospheric pressure the water surface elevation comparisons throughout the month long period at these same stations are generally in good agreement with observations fig 16 peaks associated with the strongest portion of the storm are underestimated although they are stronger than simulated by the gofs 3 1 model the initial storm surge peak at nome on november 9 around 10 00 gmt is underpredicted by 0 43 m when not considering ice coverage considering the proposed ice drag parameterization enhances the surge matching the peak within 0 02 m a significant improvement the first peak at red dog dock on november 10 around 2 00 gmt of 1 67 m is underpredicted by 0 53 m despite a 0 15 m increase when accounting for ice coverage the ultimate peak surge on november 10 of 2 7 m at nome is underpredicted by 0 89 m despite an increase in the modeled signal due to ice coverage of approximately 0 3 m the second smaller peak at red dog dock of 0 5 m is accurately captured with an approximate 0 1 m increase due to the proposed ice drag parameterization the increase in water levels due to this is focused at the coast particularly along the nearshore marginal ice zone in norton sound where winds were strong fig 17 we also note that the post event drawdown on november 13 at red dog dock is overpredicted by 0 49 m when considering ice while it is in close agreement without ice fig 16 table 4 shows that considering ice coverage using the proposed parameterization generally improves the accuracy of the peak water surface elevation responses while the rmse becomes slightly larger the previous parameterization eq 5 had little to no effect on the peak surge at nome in particular however in all cases the presented adcirc models are able to achieve a higher correlation to the data table 5 and smaller rmse table 6 compared to gofs 3 1 in the bering sea where there is only a small amount of sea ice coverage in the northern portion of the domain at prudhoe bay the presented model performs less well but is still comparable to the fully ice coupled gofs 3 1 model the underprediction of the peak surges in the presented models can be attributed to a variety of possible causes there is clearly some underprediction of the cfsv2 wind speed at both nome and red dog dock associated with the different bands of the storm this may be due to a low bias in the wind forcing of the cfsv2 model furthermore the degree to which uncertainty in the air sea ice interaction as implemented limits the accuracy of the current model is unclear the underlying assumption of a high correlation between ice drift speed relative to the water currents and wind velocity may be violated under marginal ice and certain wind conditions resulting in higher rmse for the month when considering ice effects in particular the drawdown event at red dog dock suggests overprediction when ice effects are considered possibly because ice may be drifting out of kotzebue sound with the surge recession and therefore violating the underlying speed and velocity relation assumption additionally wave effects may also impact the amplification of storm surge measured significant wave heights reached 12 m in the bering sea on november 9 kinsman and deraps 2012 as these waves move onto the shelf and transform due to depth limited breaking within the nearshore and the shore marginal ice zone as it existed the resulting wave radiation stress gradients may add significant shore directed forcing in the shallow and fragmented ice covered nearshore zone given the shallow bathymetry this effect can increase water levels by as much as 0 5 m to 1 m in ice free conditions dietrich et al 2010 2011 2012 5 2 february 2011 the major february 2011 storm event affected the bering sea region from the 22nd until the 25th following two slightly weaker storms during this time the bering shelf and chukchi sea were covered with dense pack ice with a fringe of highly variable sea ice concentration along the bering shelf break fig 11 this storm had a similar track to the november 2011 storm but weakened much farther south over the bering sea the minimum central pressure of the storm reached 955 mbar in the domain and the strongest winds exceeded 30 ms 1 storm surge was built up on the eastern edge of the bering sea basin and amplified greatly on the shelf blocking by st lawrence island directed surge into norton sound although some was also forced to the northwest between the island and the chukotka peninsula and eventually through the bering strait because the wind speeds over the shelf were much weaker than in november 2011 the shelf velocities generated during the storm on the bering shelf were weaker in comparison the storm surge directed into norton sound was amplified in the eastern and northern portion a high pressure system measuring greater than 1050 mbar followed the storm inducing a negative surge the progression of the wind and pressure fields and the development of water levels through the storm are found in fig 18 while the atmospheric pressure of the cfsv2 model matched observations closely table 3 table 2 shows that there is a clear under representation of the storm s wind speed at coastal stations and red dog dock in particular the comparisons for water surface elevation throughout the month long period are generally in good agreement to observations fig 19 the successive storms produce three distinguishable surge events at nome and red dog dock and one on february 26 in prudhoe bay peak water levels for the first on february 18 and third on february 25 surge events are underpredicted by 0 1 to 0 3 m although accounting for ice using the proposed air sea interaction formula enhances surges by up to 0 1 m and brings all peaks into better agreement with the observations the second and smallest surge event on february 21 at both nome and red dock dog are predicted accurately and indicate little effect of ice due to the fact that the surge was locally generated in the norton sound where the ice concentration was high applying the proposed ice drag parameterization to the february ice coverage generally leads to a slight increase in total water levels at the data comparison stations the proposed ice parameterization controls the drag coefficient for stronger winds over the shelf to be between 0 and 20 less for these storms suggesting we would see a reduction in storm surge instead of the increase seen computing the difference in computed maximum water levels with and without ice effects fig 17 suggests that a 0 2 to 0 4 m lift across the entire bering shelf is driven by the significant enhancement of air sea drag in the broad marginal ice zone that spans across the bering sea shelf break the proposed parameterization applied increases the drag coefficient by up to 200 for the wide range of ice concentrations that occur in the marginal ice zone compared to ice free conditions the previous drag parameterization eq 5 has a similar effect to the proposed for the smaller peaks but for the large event led to a decrease in accuracy with respect to the peak water level the addition of ice coverage generally improves the overall water surface elevation accuracy for this storm table 4 this is the case for both ice drag parameterizations two possibly important processes are still missing in these simulations we are not considering momentum imparted to the sea through wave dissipation particularly in the marginal ice that stretches across the bering sea at the pack ice ice free water interface additionally any damping of storm surge and tidally driven currents which may occur under the dense pack ice is not considered overall the dense ice pack case is well modeled however counter intuitive to the idea that it provides a protective cover from storm surge over the ocean during winter it appears that high concentrations of pack ice allow for significant surge events along the western alaskan coast compared to the presented model the ice coupled gofs 3 1 model significantly under represents the peak water level anomalies at the western alaska stations of nome and red dog dock during february 2011 fig 19 even given the dense pack ice coverage over the northern half of the model domain it is noted that the peak water level is more accurately represented by adcirc with or without the effect of ice on air sea drag the proposed model performs better with respect to the data in the bering sea region at nome and red dog dock tables 5 and 6 at prudhoe bay there is a small difference between the water surface elevation errors but the correlation to the data is higher in the gofs 3 1 model 5 3 january 2017 in january 2017 a series of low pressure systems with strong winds followed an extratropical cyclone with a central low under 940 mbar on a similar track to both the february and november 2011 storms ice cover conditions were very fragmented throughout the month in the bering sea fig 11 winds were predominantly southerly and speeds exceeded 35 ms 1 as the increased water levels propagated into the eastern half of the bering sea they were amplified on the shallower portions of the shelf this led to five days of significantly elevated water levels for the entire northern edge of the bering sea and much of western alaska the progression of the wind and pressure fields and the development of water levels without tides through the storm are found in fig 20 by january 2017 a meteorological and water level gauge had been recently installed at unalakleet in the easternmost portion of norton sound the comparison of the cfsv2 meteorology to data at nome unalakleet and red dog dock shows that the major storm features are well captured in terms of wind and pressure tables 2 and 3 the computed and measured water levels are shown at nome unalakleet red dock dock and prudhoe bay in fig 21 three to four well defined peaks appear at the western alaskan stations the comparison between modeled and observed water levels are generally good in non peak surge portions of the record the no ice simulation better matched the record while the with ice simulations often have greater drift in water levels being either too low or too high table 4 shows that the rmse at the observation stations is increased by the proposed ice drag parameterization while the parameterization from eq 5 decreases the rmse during the peak water levels the proposed ice parameterization over predicts some of the peak water levels for example by up to 0 5 m at nome for portions of the storm but accurately captures the ultimate peak regionally the proposed ice drag parameterization changes water level by as much as 0 6 m throughout the simulation fig 17 this increase is coastally focused in the bering sea correlating to the variable ice field there in the chukchi sea the effect is more regional due to the broader and denser ice coverage there the opposite effect is seen at the main peaks when using the previous drag parameterization as the magnitude of all peak errors increased generally in the direction of under prediction clearly the proposed air sea ice momentum transfer parameterization employed in this work imparts too much momentum to the surge in some scenarios particularly the secondary surge events for this storm however the primary surge peak was better represented in comparison to the previous parameterization eq 5 and no ice cases this proposed application assumes that there is a proportional relationship between the wind speed and the ice drift ocean current differential which generates the horizontal stresses at the ice ocean interface this assumption may be particularly flawed in the case of the highly fractured ice fields and variable wind fields additionally the aforementioned ice wave and wave surge interactions may have a substantial effect on these storm surges due to the extensive partial ice field despite these discrepancies the presented model again compares favorably to gofs 3 1 in the bering sea in particular where it appears to capture the major water level trends more accurately fig 21 this is also clear in the error statistics tables 5 and 6 however unlike the other events the presented model with and without ice also outperforms gofs 3 1 at prudhoe bay 6 discussion an important consideration for evaluation of our coastal ocean model in this study is to determine if errors are due to those in the atmospheric forcing the air sea ice drag parameterizations or some deficiency in the model itself e g grid resolution and bathymetry the august 2012 summer storm enabled an evaluation of the model without considering the effect of ice on the air sea drag in this example the cfsv2 wind speeds measured at the stations are fairly accurate slightly overestimated at nome and underestimated at red dog dock and prudhoe bay the resulting peak surges were the most accurate out of any storm evaluated an overestimation by 5 7 cm at the three stations the correlations in water level time series for our model are more accurate than those of gofs 3 1 at nome where the largest surge was measured and comparable at the other two stations overall it can be said that given an accurate representation of the meteorology which appeared to be the case for this storm at least in the coastal zone the presented model is capable of accurately simulating the development of storm surge generated by a summer storm in western alaska in comparison to the summer storm the peak surges are generally underestimated for the more energetic winter storms occurring in the presence of ice cover some of the underprediction may be related to localized underprediction in the cfsv2 winds for example the average error for the cfsv2 wind speeds at the stations during the august 2012 and january 2017 storms are smaller and more positive than those during the february 2011 and november 2011 storms the corresponding peak surge errors during the august 2012 and january 2017 storms are also smaller and tend to be positive it is important to highlight that the build up of surge over a continental shelf strongly depends on the wind stress resio and westerink 2008 which is proportional to the wind velocity squared eq 3 in fact proportional to the velocity cubed taking into account the linear relationship with air sea drag eq 4 thus wind speed is critical to the accurate development of surge typically it is expected that minimum central pressure and wind speeds in a coarse resolution model like cfsv2 will be significantly underestimated in tropical cyclones which are intense and small in scale here the meteorological characteristics of the larger scale extratropical storms that develop in alaska appear to be generally well captured by cfsv2 tables 2 and 3 see also supplementary figures 22 25 however wind speeds particularly at red dog dock and during the february 2011 and november 2011 storms certainly have a tendency to be underestimated compared to the observations importantly the observations shown are at coastal stations where the maximum wind speeds and the minimum pressure of the storm did not generally pass over thus it is unclear if the underestimation in wind speeds is a nearshore transitional effect or this extends more broadly over the bering and chukchi seas although the differences in average errors of cfsv2 wind speeds between the storms may appear small the effect of any wind speed error on surge heights is inflated due to the squared even cubed relationship another important consideration here is the effect of the proposed air sea ice drag parameterization on the surge response maximum water levels for all three winter storms were increased in the coastal zone when considering sea ice in the proposed drag parameterization the largest increases exceeded 0 5 m in norton sound and kotzebue sound during the january 2017 storms and along the yk delta during the november 2011 storm this was a result of the additional air sea momentum input in the fractured sea ice coverage zone regardless if that is located nearshore or not during the february 2011 storms the coastal zone had dense pack ice coverage which would be expected to decrease the surge height but the fracture sea ice zone at the bering sea shelf edge resulted in an overall increase to surge heights overall compared with observations the increase in peak surge due to the proposed consideration of ice in this work resulted in a general decrease in the peak surge error at the stations increase to peak surge model skill in this regard the air sea ice drag parameterization was effective this is particularly the case when compared to the adcirc runs performed using eq 5 which generally lead to a decrease in the model skill with respect to peak surges on the contrary considering the effect of sea ice using the proposed drag parameterization generally resulted in an increased rmse a decrease in the correlation coefficient of the surge response except during the february 2011 storm under dense pack ice where it helped inspection of the time series plots shows that although peak surge is often increased towards observations smaller water level maxima and minima tend to be overestimated during the month under the more variable ice conditions november 2011 and january 2017 storms explaining the additional rmse error computed over that period thus there is an uncertainty in the air sea ice drag parameterization related to the fact that it is assumed that there is a proportional relationship between the wind speed and the ice drift ocean current differential speed which generates the horizontal stresses at the ice ocean interface this assumption may tend to be more accurate for peak surge due to the presence of a strong dominant wind direction furthermore the air sea ice drag formulation does not consider other potentially important factors in the computation of the drag coefficient such as ice floe geometry melt ponds ridges floe separation distance or atmospheric stratification tsamados et al 2014 additionally the presence of ice makes it such that the momentum lost by the air is not necessarily delivered locally to the water some of the momentum can be transported away by advecting ice floes and some can be dissipated in ice ice collisions in general the parameterization in 5 more successfully captures water level trends at the northernmost station of prudhoe bay at the western alaskan stations the rmse differences between the proposed parameterization or the no ice simulations and the simulations using the parameterization in 5 are smaller although it is was not directly considered here wave effects may also impact the amplification of storm surge in western alaska for example significant wave heights as large as 12 m were measured in the bering sea on november 9 kinsman and deraps 2012 under fragmented ice coverage in the nearshore zone these dissipative waves may add significant forcing to the water column driving currents and setup this could help explain why greater correlation with observations in non tidal residual water levels were recorded during february 2011 under dense pack ice in the coastal zone compared to correlations during the november 2011 and january 2017 storms which had more variable nearshore ice conditions 7 conclusions and future work our non asssimilative high resolution tide and storm surge adcirc model for alaska connects all four major basins in the region the gulf of alaska and the bering chukchi and beaufort seas in order to model all pertinent processes across these marginal seas the model represents at scales ranging from 5000 m to 25 m the geometric bathymetric topographic and surface roughness complexity of the alaskan coast tidal constituents from global tidal models are used as boundary conditions in order to simulate tides throughout the domain the climate forecast system version 2 reanalysis wind and pressure fields provide atmospheric forcing ncep s automated sea ice analysis fields and a parameterization of the form and skin drag over the ice aim to account for the effect of ice on surface wind stresses generating surge the presented hydrodynamic model s solutions for the eight dominant astronomical tidal constituents have been compared to data assimilated global tidal solutions fes2012 and 121 mainly coastal tide gauges without considering the impact of the meteorology or sea ice generally our model has smaller tidal errors than fes2012 at the coastal tide gauges because of the high resolution we provide we have simulated the storm surge during an ice free summer storm and during more energetic winter storms under varying ice conditions time series of simulated water elevation response is compared with observations at three to four stations in western and northern alaska the gofs 3 1 data assimilated ocean general circulation modeling ogcm system which is fully coupled to a sea ice model but does not simulate tides was used as a basis for additional comparison and evaluation of our higher resolution depth integrated model that uses a parameterization of air sea ice drag in summary despite some limitations of the presented model underestimated wind speeds in the meteorological forcing during high energy sections of the storms uncertainty in the air sea ice drag related to the correlation of wind speed and ice drift speed and lack of wave surge ice interaction considerable skill at simulating tide and coastal surge is shown across all events with consistently less error than the coarser resolution data assimilated models the fes2012 tide model and the gofs 3 1 ogcm current funded collaborations with noaa are focused towards developing a greater understanding of how ice coverage influences tidal and storm surge processes on the inner shelf and at the coast in order to improve model forecast skill in western alaska this includes coupling long wave hydrodynamics directly to a phase averaged wind wave model which considers sea ice physics and the direct computation of wind and current induced ice ocean stresses through a coupled sea ice model which computes ice motion the inclusion of breaking waves at the coast particularly through the coastal marginal ice zone would allow for wave momentum input over much of the bering sea to be transferred to the surge over the relatively narrow coastal ice zone due to depth limited wave

24020,a depth integrated high resolution down to 25 50 m tide and storm surge model has been developed for the alaska region with a focus on the coasts of western alaska the model uses the adcirc basin to channel scale unstructured grid circulation code forced with climate forecast system version 2 reanalysis meteorology the tidal solution has been validated at 121 shelf and nearshore stations with lower overall errors than a data assimilated tidal model fes2012 the adcirc model shows considerable skill at simulating tide and coastal surge and resulting overland flooding on the yukon kuskokwim delta during both summer and winter storms the root mean square error of the model does not exceed 20 cm at any station outperforming the global ocean forecasting system gofs 3 1 a 1 12 data assimilated ocean general circulation model which is coupled to sea ice physics the adcirc model incorporates the effect of sea ice through parameterizations of the wind drag coefficient modifying the air sea momentum transfer under ice coverage three large winter storms with distinctly different ice coverages along the coasts of western alaska were chosen to exhibit the variable effect of sea ice on the resulting storm surge under forming coastal ice coverage local increases in water levels due to ice is seen in coastal areas and under predominantly dense pack ice an increase in momentum transfer in the marginal sea ice at the shelf break leads to an increase in sea levels across the entire bering sea both commensurate with observations under the most variable ice fields results are mixed in part due to uncertainties in the air sea ice drag parameterization such as related to the assumption that sea ice drift and wind velocities are always well correlated including a description of sea ice drift and current speeds explicitly in the air sea ice drag formulation and considering wave surge ice interaction should improve the description of momentum transferred to the water column and resulting simulation of surge keywords alaska storm surge tides sea ice high resolution 1 introduction coastal alaska fig 1 spans over 54 000 km with highly diverse geography ranging from sharp volcanic relief in the south to low lying deltas and tundra in the west and north the geometry of the region is complex and the tidal range across the four main basins varies dramatically ranging from a macro tidal coast along the gulf of alaska to a micro tidal environment in chukchi and beaufort seas moreover particularly strong storms developing in the late fall and winter induce storm surge that can amplify significantly on the broad and shallow bering shelf the low lying coastal floodplain of western alaska is particularly vulnerable to the effects of such surge which combined with a meso tidal environment can result in significant damages to these coastal communities as a representative of the high impact storms that pass through the region the november 2011 bering sea superstorm resulted in damages to 37 villages and cities due to surge which measured up to 3 m in portions of the norton sound kinsman and deraps 2012 the additional complication for the alaska region is the presence of sea ice and how it affects tides and surge the details of which are not well understood currently there is particular interest in the effect of sea ice on tides and storm surges changing climatic conditions may affect ice coverage and thickness in the present and future hence alaska s risk exposure overeem et al 2011 in the bering chukchi and beaufort seas sea ice is present for a significant portion of the year and there is strong inter and intra annual variability in the ice coverage erikson et al 2015 sea ice usually begins forming in november and can last in the bering sea until as late as july as the ice forms it covers the entirety of the beaufort and chukchi seas while extending to the shelf break of the bering shelf in the south storms in alaska are also stronger during the late autumn and winter months when portions or entire basins are covered in ice mesquita et al 2010 however in the past four decades there has been an observed delay in the formation of sea ice in the bering sea which has coincided with a 26 per decade decrease in total sea ice cover in the bering sea erikson et al 2015 there is some indication that these changes are already having an effect on the severity of the storm environment where for example ice drift speeds have doubled over the past two decades spreen et al 2011 effectively increasing the transfer of momentum to the water at the ice ocean interface quantifying the potential effects of these changing ice conditions requires a baseline understanding of the underlying wind ice ocean interactions a significant body of modeling work has been conducted to develop an understanding of the interplay between sea ice tides and atmospheric forcing in the arctic region recently kleptsova and pietrzak 2018 used a high resolution barotropic tidal model to investigate the seasonal effect of ice on tidal constituents in the canadian arctic archipelago demonstrating that tidal phases can change by 180 degrees on a month to month basis zhang et al 2010 examined the impact of atmospheric forcing and tides on the development of sea ice in the bering sea on decadal time scales and showed the strong impact of wind driven ice mass advection on sea ice extent variability the unstructured grid finite volume ao fvcom has been applied to the arctic ocean for ice free conditions chen et al 2009 and extended with a coupled sea ice model gao et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2009 highlighted the importance of stratification on tidal currents and phasing but not the total water transport and thus tidal elevation this model zhang et al 2016 showed good ability to reproduce sea ice extent ice drift and ice thickness in the arctic region over multi decadal periods but it has yet to be applied for the simulation of specific storm surge events storm surge modeling efforts for the region in particular have focused on the beaufort and chukchi seas kowalik 1984 and norton sound johnson and kowalik 1986 blier et al 1997 chapman et al 2009 while these previous models have used a variety of methods to account for the presence of ice coverage they have not focused on resolving coastal floodplains or inlets in order to improve our understanding of the combined impact of tides and surge to coastal communities on the western alaska coast the main focus of this study is to simulate tides and historic storm surge events using an unstructured grid based model of the alaska region with high resolution to resolve coastal floodplains and inlets on the bering sea and the western alaskan coast additionally we investigate a simplified parameterization of the effect of sea ice on air sea wind drag henceforth called air sea ice drag impacting the development and propagation of storm surge when sea ice conditions exist previously both data assimilated barotropic tidal models foreman et al 2006 and baroclinic coupled ocean ice models chen et al 2009 danielson et al 2011 have been developed to study tides in the bering sea these previous works highlight the importance of dissipation of tidal energy as the tide flows through the aleutian islands tidal studies of the arctic ocean and along the northern coasts of alaska have shown that the presence of sea ice can significantly alter the barotropic mode and is important to consider when modeling in ice covered regions kleptsova and pietrzak 2018 kagan and sofina 2010 holloway and proshutinsky 2007 satellite altimeter data has also shown strong seasonal variability in tidal constituents due to sea ice in the alaska region north of 60 degrees latitude fok et al 2012 as such the current study provides results for the arctic ocean portions of the alaska region beaufort and chukchi sea but acknowledges that tidal model performance may suffer here due to the lack of a fully coupled ice ocean model nevertheless it is stressed that our main focus is the combined effect of tides and surge to the western alaska coast where ice is generally thinner and present less often we start by comparing our high resolution model in the bering sea to data assimilated tidal model solutions fes2012 carr√®re et al 2013 and an array of tidal constituent observations along the alaskan coast second sea level variations during a strong summer storm are analyzed versus the global ocean forecast system 3 1 gofs 3 1 metzger et al 2017 an operational 1 12 data assimilated ocean general circulation modeling ogcm system in addition comparisons with observations are made along the western alaska coast last a parameterization for air sea ice drag is proposed used to simulate three particularly strong winter storms under varying ice conditions and compared to a previously used parameterization the sea level variations here are also compared to the fully ice coupled gofs 3 1 model and the observations at the available western alaska coastal locations we evaluate the accuracy of our model for predicting peak surge and the water level time series throughout a month under each scenario finally limitations of the current model setup are discussed and suggestions for future model improvements are made 2 model description 2 1 adcirc ocean circulation model the alaska tide and storm surge model described in this paper applies the unstructured grid advanced circulation adcirc code as implemented in this model adcirc solves the depth integrated barotropic shallow water equations in spherical coordinates in a continuous galerkin finite element framework to compute water surface elevation and currents westerink et al 2008 adcirc s finite element unstructured grid framework and high computational scalability allows us to apply the alaska tide and storm surge model over a wide range of hydrodynamic scales from the deep ocean to the nearshore into coastal estuaries and onto coastal floodplains a wetting and drying algorithm based on water depths is used to represent both flooding and the recession of water 2 2 model domain definition and development the model domain fig 2 stretches from the north pacific ocean to the arctic ocean including the gulf of alaska bering sea chukchi sea and beaufort sea there are two curved open ocean boundaries in the model the northern boundary is in the arctic ocean with a northernmost point of 80 n and ranges from 190 w in the west to 134 w in the east the longer southern boundary follows across the northern pacific ocean from 204 w in the west to 128 w in the east the southern extent of this boundary is 39 n we chose the open ocean boundaries to be primarily in deep water where the tidal signal is dominated by the major astronomical tidal constituents and nonlinear tidal constituents are minimal the land boundaries of the domain are defined by the russian coastline to the west and the alaskan coastline to the east the minimum resolution of the model is approximately 5 km in the deep ocean the resolution increases to 1 km on the alaskan shelf and to at least 500 m along most of the coast in addition a number of overland regions on the western alaska coast are finely represented in the model to enable the detailed simulation of coastal flooding an aspect that other coastal ocean models of the region have not yet included of particular interest here is the vulnerable low lying deltaic system formed by the yukon and kuskokwim rivers in the bering sea fig 2 the yukon kuskokwim yk delta is home to native alaskan populations who reside in bethel and numerous other small villages the delta has been incorporated into the model in extensive detail with element sizes as small as 25 m other overland areas represented in the model are found north of the bering strait which are resolved using minimum element sizes between 25 m and 50 m this includes the numerous inlets and lagoons on the chukchi sea facing side of the alaskan coastline and the barrier islands lagoons and floodplains of kotzebue sound the grid itself contains 8 060 620

constituents the semidiurnal m 2 n 2 s 2 k 2 and diurnal o 1 k 1 p 1 q 1 along the two curved open ocean boundaries in addition tidal potential functions and the self attraction and load tide are forced at each node within the model domain for the same eight constituents the boundary and self attraction and load tide forcing data has been predominantly extracted from the fes2012 data assimilated global tidal solutions carr√®re et al 2013 the k 1 constituent boundary forcing was extracted from the tpxo8 data assimilated global tidal solutions egbert et al 1994 egbert and erofeeva 2002 based on better agreement with observations for tidal amplitudes with this constituent than fes2012 the nodal factors and equilibrium arguments for the tidal forcing are determined based on the starting time and duration of the simulation a ramping period is used to ensure that any initial transients are minimized prior to times where results are recorded 2 5 atmospheric forcing atmospheric

densities macklin 1983 fujisaki et al 2009 momentum from the wind may be imparted to the ice through form drag c d i f and skin drag c d i s instead of directly to the ocean the ice then transfers this momentum to the ocean through its movement altering the relationship between wind speed and ocean stresses and in turn the resulting storm surge previous adcirc applications in this region chapman et al 2005 2009 used an empirical formulation for c d i c e cf birnbaum and l√ºpkes 2002 garbrecht et al 2002 that was applied as a lower limit on c d under ice coverage i e 5 c d max c d w c

coefficient that integrally combines contributions from both the ice covered and ice free portions of a given element various investigations have shown that an area weighted approach zippel and thompson 2016 l√ºpkes and birnbaum 2005 l√ºpkes et al 2013 that considers both the form and skin drag over the ice floe l√ºpkes and birnbaum 2005 l√ºpkes et al 2013 lu et al 2011 can be used as a

illustrated in fig 3 c d is almost always larger than c d w and maximum 0 0045 at 50 ice coverage this is explained as an effect of the form drag in which there is an interplay between the increased number of ice floe edges and additional sheltering of the atmospheric flow downstream of ice floes with increasing sea ice concentration l√ºpkes et al 2012 this is in contrast to 5 where ice is essentially not considered in high wind speeds as the wind drag coefficient c d w is higher than the ice drag c d i c e under most high wind speed scenarios as the ice coverage percentage increases towards 100 ice skin drag assumed to be constant here becomes the dominant momentum transfer mechanism from air to ocean thus at a high ice coverage a f 90 and relatively high wind speeds c d is less

prediction ncep climate reanalysis project grumbine 1996 2014 are used all meteorological and ice data used in this study is linearly interpolated in space and time onto our model grid 3 tides and model data comparisons the tidal range across the four main basins in the alaskan region varies dramatically fig 4 the macro tidal coast along the gulf of alaska exhibits strong basin edge tidal amplification where the geometry of cook inlet in the western gulf of alaska provides favorable conditions for local amplification of the semi diurnal constituents the major tidal constituents enter the bering sea as a progressive wave from the pacific ocean through the aleutian islands kowalik 1999 as the tide moves through the island chain and over the associated undersea mountain range high currents and associated vertical and lateral eddying through the passes dissipate tidal energy foreman et al 2006 in the bering sea dissipation over the broad and shallow bering sea shelf and the reflections caused by the shape of the partially enclosed basin lead to a complex structure for the main tidal constituents there is relatively little tidal flux through the bering strait from the micro tidal chukchi and beaufort seas into the bering sea the micro tidal environment north of the bering strait is due to weakened tidal potential forcing at high latitudes westerink et al 1994 overall the geometric and bathymetric complexity of the alaskan region coupled with the importance of geostrophic effects at high latitudes results in complex tidal dynamics with strong spatial variability in order to assess the representation of the tidal dynamics in our model we computed a 120 day tide only forced simulation and harmonically analyzed the resulting time history records over the last 90 days a 30 day hyperbolic tangent ramp function was applied to minimize the generation of transients associated with the quiescent initial condition the model results for the four major tidal constituents k 1 o 1 m 2 n 2 spatial distribution of amplitudes and phases are shown in fig 5 are compared regionally against the data assimilated fes2012 tidal solutions fig 6 and locally against 115 noaa water level tide gauges along the alaska coastline https tidesandcurrents noaa gov products html and 6 international association for the physical sciences of the oceans iapso shelf based stations smithson 1992 locations are shown in fig 1 the distribution of the presented model errors at these stations is shown in fig 7 and table 1 shows the modeled to observed error statistics for the both the presented model and the fes2012 global tidal model 3 1 diurnal constituents the amplitudes of the diurnal constituents vary slowly between 0 2 m to 0 5 m in the gulf of alaska here diurnal differences with the fes2012 model are under 2 5 cm except at the back of cook inlet where k 1 differences become large presumably because of insufficient resolution in the fes2012 model indeed adcirc amplitude phase errors with tide gauge data is within 10 10 almost everywhere including at the back of cook inlet for k 1 however the amplitudes are underestimated for o 1 in the bering sea the diurnal constituents are larger and vary more rapidly spatially with amplitudes between 0 m and 1 m there is strong edge amplification along the entire eastern edge of the bering shelf particularly in bristol bay in the southeast bering sea both of the main diurnal constituents exhibit two prominent amphidromic and one degenerate amphidromic points on the southern portion of the bering sea shelf just north of the bering strait and on the northwestern end of norton sound notable differences with the fes2012 model feature along the edge of the yk delta and into norton sound which correspond to some of the larger diurnal phase and amplitude differences of the model with tide gauge observations in particular the under prediction of diurnal amplitudes in the kuskokwim river may correspond to an insufficient description of certain features here the bathymetry is notably difficult to measure with high resolution methods such as lidar due to turbidity in the water additionally no river inflow is included in the model the stations with the largest errors in norton sound such as unalakleet and shaktoolik are found within or in front of inlets and back bays which have not been fully resolved in the model these inlets and other details are important for capturing localized gradients in the tidal amplitudes due to dissipation as the tide propagates into the backbay furthermore the location of a degenerate amphidrome in the westernmost portion of norton sound increases the challenge of modeling the diurnal tide at these stations although differences with the fes2012 model are not largely apparent in the high latitudes where the diurnal amplitudes are small phase lag errors at the tide gauges are large in regions such as the eastern chukchi sea which is approximately 100 degrees out of phase for k 1 such phase lag errors are found near the amphidromic point just north of the bering strait indicating that amphidromic positioning is likely the source of most of the error here since amphidromic points are strongly impacted by the frictional dynamics rienecker and teubner 1980 the error could be attributed to inaccurate representations of the shelf edge sea bed or sea ice friction or otherwise uncertainties in the tidal boundary conditions overall the coefficient of determination or r 2 values for the presented model computed amplitudes of the main diurnal constituents range between 0 845 and 0 962 while the r 2 values for the diurnal phases range between 0 902 and 0 956 the absolute average error for each of the constituents is 3 5 cm and 2 5 cm respectively for the k 1 and o 1 constituents respectively in comparison to the fes2012 global tidal model the presented model performs significantly better for the larger k 1 constituent across all error metrics but the opposite is seen for the o 1 constituent table 1 this discrepancy can be attributed partly to the use of the tpxo8 global tidal model to force the k 1 tidal constituent at the open ocean boundaries 3 2 semidiurnal constituents the two major semidiurnal constituents have an almost identical structure to each other with the m 2 constituent being considerably larger in magnitude basin edge amplification leads to amplitudes of greater than 1 m for the m 2 tide along the gulf of alaska coast resonance in cook inlet leads to strong amplification of the semidiurnal tide similar to the diurnal tides differences with fes2012 in the gulf of alaska only become significant at the back of cook inlet where the m 2 amplitude exceeds 3 5 m however it should be noted that the presented model is in excellent agreement with tide gauge observations here the aleutian islands have a strong effect on the structure of the semidiurnal tides with large gradients in both amplitude and phase across the island chain prior to the addition of parameterized internal tide dissipation to the model the m 2 amplitude was overpredicted by at least 20 at each of the tidal stations found on the north side of the aleutian islands the aleutian islands and related strong bathymetric gradients are conducive to generating internal tides that dissipate the barotropic tide as parameterized by eq 2 moreover tidal currents are strong in this area fig 8 also leading to greater dissipation inclusion of this parameterized baroclinically generated dissipation effectively halved the average error in the semidiurnal amplitudes on the north side of the aleutians although noticeable differences in the m 2 tide with the fes2012 model through some regions of the aleutian islands are observable the presented model is in close agreement at every tide gauge here large gradients in amplitude and phase are seen in the bering sea with strong amplification in bristol bay both semidiurnal constituents have 8 amphidromic points in the domain with five being located on the bering chukchi shelf the partially closed nature of the bering sea which reflects the tide and the breadth and depth of the shallow shelf are the main factors contributing to the complexity of the tide in this area the high level of spatial complexity is more evident in the semidiurnal constituents than the diurnal ones because of the shorter semidiurnal wavelengths the amphidromic system in norton sound leads to small semidiurnal tidal amplitudes there as with the diurnal constituents the greatest differences with fes2012 occur in bristol bay along the yk delta and into norton sound compared with observations the presented model is in close agreement except for in the kuskokwim river and wood river north bristol bay the semidiurnal tide is generally well predicted by the presented model with r 2 values of greater than 0 947 for all amplitudes and greater than 0 953 for the phases the absolute average error is 8 cm for the m 2 tide phase lags at the tide gauges are in excellent agreement with observations including in the vicinity of amphidromic points in the bering sea across all errors statistics for the m 2 tide the presented model performs better than fes2012 at the primarily coastal observation stations table 1 overall in terms of amplitudes the absolute average error is approximately 4 7 cm smaller and the normalized root mean square error rmse is 25 less in the presented model the normalized rmse in the phase is 39 less the differences between the models fig 6 are fairly small in the semidiurnal constituents away from the coast but large differences appear in the nearshore particularly in the m 2 constituent this and the difference in performance between the models at nearshore stations highlight the importance of nearshore model resolution to capture the complexity and amplification of the tide as it interacts with shallow bathymetry in nearshore areas of the 121 data comparison stations only 20 stations used a time series greater than 3 months to derive the harmonic constituents a longer record would be desirable to improve the accuracy of the harmonic decomposition the simulations presented in this paper do not include the effects of sea ice dissipation on the tide which can have large effects on amphidromic positioning kleptsova and pietrzak 2018 many of the comparison constituents are based on ice free records as most of the stations throughout western and northern alaska are short term and were deployed in ice free conditions however intra seasonal variability of tides is expected as large portions of the bering and chukchi sea vary between ice covered and ice free conditions throughout the year thus forcing the northern boundary of the model with stationary constituents from satellite altimetry derived global solutions may also negatively impact amphidromic positioning in the northern region of the domain meteorology is also ignored in this tidal data comparison and may affect total dissipation and or may drive pressure modes on the regional and basin scale 4 storm surge under ice free conditions to assess the performance of the coupled tide and storm surge model without the added complications of ice the model was applied during august 2012 an ice free summer month featuring a notable summer storm event along the coast of western alaska summer storms in the region are typically longer less intense and slower than storms in late fall and winter mesquita et al 2010 with lower mean storm surge heights this month was simulated using a 16 day ramping period and a 31 day simulation period with tidal forcing and the hourly cfsv2 atmospheric forcing applied this simulation was also run without tidal forcing in order to better understand the evolution of storm surges all three noaa stations with data were used to assess the computed water levels along the coast of western and northern alaska nome red dog dock and prudhoe bay nome is located at the head of norton sound red dog dock sits on the chukchi sea to the north of kotzebue sound and prudhoe bay is located in the north of alaska on the beaufort sea fig 1 the event of interest around august 14 18 2012 consisted of predominately southerly winds moving from west to east over the bering sea and led to increased water levels over a large portion of the coastline both north and south of the bering strait fig 9 shows the progression of the storm s wind field and the development of storm surge in general the storm surge component of total water level is focused on the shelves and sounds and amplifies along the eastern shores of the bering and chukchi seas as the storm moved over norton sound in the morning of the 15th over 1 m of surge was built up along the northern portion of the sound the surge entering norton sound was amplified in the eastern portion of the sound particularly norton bay and held against the northern portion by strong winds the storm produced strong mainly southerly currents of up to 1 ms 1 within the bering and chukchi seas and through the bering strait analyses indicate that the modeled elevation and current fields are strongly impacted by geostrophic effects particularly in the west of norton sound and along the north slope where storm surge is increased by up to 0 3 m forcing wind speeds table 2 are both over and underestimated by the cfsv2 forcing during the storm along the alaskan coasts and atmospheric pressure is in strong agreement to observations at the coastal stations table 3 the water surface elevation response at all stations with or without tides is generally well captured fig 10 peak errors in the water surface elevation response are small no more than 6 7 cm and in fact slightly overestimated table 4 the non tidal surge response of the model was also compared to the gofs 3 1 ogcm which does not include tides at the available observation stations right column of fig 10 the general trend is quite comparable between the models however the water level response for the presented model follows the observations more closely in particular the simulated peak surges at nome and red dog dock are in very good agreement to observations while they are underestimated in gofs 3 1 at prudhoe bay in the northern arctic the presented model is able to reproduce the smaller trough on august 15 however neither model could reproduce the significant trough on august 25 statistically correlation coefficients and rmse are comparable between the models except at nome where the presented model performs noticeably better tables 5 and 6 5 storm surge in the presence of sea ice in the winter and late fall there are a higher number of extreme events in the alaska region mesquita et al 2010 storms representative of this trend affected the bering sea in november 2011 february 2011 and january 2017 fig 11 shows the area fraction a f of ice or percent ice coverage over the model domain during these months the november 2011 storm occurred while narrow marginal ice zones were starting to form along the coasts of the chukchi and bering seas with partial 50 area fractions being representative in this proposed parameterization sea ice with these concentrations increases the amount of momentum imparted into the sea under wind forcing in february 2011 the chukchi sea and most of the bering sea north of the shelf break was covered in pack ice with an area fraction between 95 and 100 an ice coverage greater than 90 specifically in strong winds is capable of decreasing the wind stress on the water the zone adjacent to the shelf break was covered in an extensive marginal ice zone with highly variable sea ice area fraction due to a low arctic sea ice extent in january 2017 much of the ice in the bering sea was present in concentrations ranging from 30 near the ice edge to 70 closer to shore which represents a range with the greatest enhancement of air sea momentum transfer in our air sea ice drag parameterization presented in 6 this proposed air sea ice drag parameterization will also be compared to the previously used parameterization shown in 5 all three storms had similar tracks of extremely low atmospheric pressure minimum below 950 960 mbar fig 12 and resulted in more than 1 5 m of surge in western alaska each of the storms were simulated as part of a month long simulation with and without tides a 5 day ramping period was used for tides to quantify the impact that ice coverage had on the resulting surge each storm was also run without considering ice coverage 5 1 november 2011 this extratropical cyclone affected the bering sea and coastal alaska from november 8th to november 11th 2011 the storm entered the model domain late into the day on november 7th with a central low pressure of 943 mbar with a track over the western aleutian islands and a cohesive cyclonic structure and maximum sustained wind speeds reaching 35 ms 1 the progression of the storm in the bering sea and the response in water surface elevation without tides are shown in fig 13 as the storm moved over the bering sea shelf strong shelf currents in excess of 2 ms 1 developed the predominantly southerly and southeasterly winds forced water into and across norton sound with strong cross sound setup and through the bering strait late in the day on november 9th the storm clearly separates into two bands as the first band of strong southeasterly winds passed storm surge was built up in the eastern and northern portion of norton sound and amplified in norton bay this band maintained its strength north of the bering strait causing storm surge to build up along the coastal areas northeast of the bering strait including kotzebue sound and at red dog dock in between these two bands calmer winds allowed for the storm surge to relax and begin to exit norton sound however as the second slightly weaker band of westerly winds moved over norton sound surge was again built up in the eastern and northern portion this second band had weakened significantly traveling north and therefore had much less effect on water levels north of the bering strait during this storm there was significant overland flooding which occurred along the yk delta region the extent of this flooding was estimated by 56 using evidence of snow melt in satellite imagery fig 14 compares this estimated maximum flooding extent to that simulated by the presented model including tidal forcing and the proposed ice drag while certain areas differ the general flooding patterns are in qualitative agreement moreover maximum surge height critical to the estimation of overland flooding is considerably larger than that simulated by gofs 3 1 this is particularly apparent in norton sound most of bristol bay and along the coast of the yk delta with the exception that maximum surge in gofs 3 1 is greatly amplified at the head of bristol bay fig 15 the comparison with satellite observation and gofs 3 1 highlights the ability of the presented model to reasonably represent surge amplification and the kilometers of overland flooding that was caused in this region by the november 2011 bering sea superstorm tables 2 and 3 show that the cfsv2 meteorology at nome red dog dock and prudhoe bay captures most of the details of the wind speed and atmospheric pressure the water surface elevation comparisons throughout the month long period at these same stations are generally in good agreement with observations fig 16 peaks associated with the strongest portion of the storm are underestimated although they are stronger than simulated by the gofs 3 1 model the initial storm surge peak at nome on november 9 around 10 00 gmt is underpredicted by 0 43 m when not considering ice coverage considering the proposed ice drag parameterization enhances the surge matching the peak within 0 02 m a significant improvement the first peak at red dog dock on november 10 around 2 00 gmt of 1 67 m is underpredicted by 0 53 m despite a 0 15 m increase when accounting for ice coverage the ultimate peak surge on november 10 of 2 7 m at nome is underpredicted by 0 89 m despite an increase in the modeled signal due to ice coverage of approximately 0 3 m the second smaller peak at red dog dock of 0 5 m is accurately captured with an approximate 0 1 m increase due to the proposed ice drag parameterization the increase in water levels due to this is focused at the coast particularly along the nearshore marginal ice zone in norton sound where winds were strong fig 17 we also note that the post event drawdown on november 13 at red dog dock is overpredicted by 0 49 m when considering ice while it is in close agreement without ice fig 16 table 4 shows that considering ice coverage using the proposed parameterization generally improves the accuracy of the peak water surface elevation responses while the rmse becomes slightly larger the previous parameterization eq 5 had little to no effect on the peak surge at nome in particular however in all cases the presented adcirc models are able to achieve a higher correlation to the data table 5 and smaller rmse table 6 compared to gofs 3 1 in the bering sea where there is only a small amount of sea ice coverage in the northern portion of the domain at prudhoe bay the presented model performs less well but is still comparable to the fully ice coupled gofs 3 1 model the underprediction of the peak surges in the presented models can be attributed to a variety of possible causes there is clearly some underprediction of the cfsv2 wind speed at both nome and red dog dock associated with the different bands of the storm this may be due to a low bias in the wind forcing of the cfsv2 model furthermore the degree to which uncertainty in the air sea ice interaction as implemented limits the accuracy of the current model is unclear the underlying assumption of a high correlation between ice drift speed relative to the water currents and wind velocity may be violated under marginal ice and certain wind conditions resulting in higher rmse for the month when considering ice effects in particular the drawdown event at red dog dock suggests overprediction when ice effects are considered possibly because ice may be drifting out of kotzebue sound with the surge recession and therefore violating the underlying speed and velocity relation assumption additionally wave effects may also impact the amplification of storm surge measured significant wave heights reached 12 m in the bering sea on november 9 kinsman and deraps 2012 as these waves move onto the shelf and transform due to depth limited breaking within the nearshore and the shore marginal ice zone as it existed the resulting wave radiation stress gradients may add significant shore directed forcing in the shallow and fragmented ice covered nearshore zone given the shallow bathymetry this effect can increase water levels by as much as 0 5 m to 1 m in ice free conditions dietrich et al 2010 2011 2012 5 2 february 2011 the major february 2011 storm event affected the bering sea region from the 22nd until the 25th following two slightly weaker storms during this time the bering shelf and chukchi sea were covered with dense pack ice with a fringe of highly variable sea ice concentration along the bering shelf break fig 11 this storm had a similar track to the november 2011 storm but weakened much farther south over the bering sea the minimum central pressure of the storm reached 955 mbar in the domain and the strongest winds exceeded 30 ms 1 storm surge was built up on the eastern edge of the bering sea basin and amplified greatly on the shelf blocking by st lawrence island directed surge into norton sound although some was also forced to the northwest between the island and the chukotka peninsula and eventually through the bering strait because the wind speeds over the shelf were much weaker than in november 2011 the shelf velocities generated during the storm on the bering shelf were weaker in comparison the storm surge directed into norton sound was amplified in the eastern and northern portion a high pressure system measuring greater than 1050 mbar followed the storm inducing a negative surge the progression of the wind and pressure fields and the development of water levels through the storm are found in fig 18 while the atmospheric pressure of the cfsv2 model matched observations closely table 3 table 2 shows that there is a clear under representation of the storm s wind speed at coastal stations and red dog dock in particular the comparisons for water surface elevation throughout the month long period are generally in good agreement to observations fig 19 the successive storms produce three distinguishable surge events at nome and red dog dock and one on february 26 in prudhoe bay peak water levels for the first on february 18 and third on february 25 surge events are underpredicted by 0 1 to 0 3 m although accounting for ice using the proposed air sea interaction formula enhances surges by up to 0 1 m and brings all peaks into better agreement with the observations the second and smallest surge event on february 21 at both nome and red dock dog are predicted accurately and indicate little effect of ice due to the fact that the surge was locally generated in the norton sound where the ice concentration was high applying the proposed ice drag parameterization to the february ice coverage generally leads to a slight increase in total water levels at the data comparison stations the proposed ice parameterization controls the drag coefficient for stronger winds over the shelf to be between 0 and 20 less for these storms suggesting we would see a reduction in storm surge instead of the increase seen computing the difference in computed maximum water levels with and without ice effects fig 17 suggests that a 0 2 to 0 4 m lift across the entire bering shelf is driven by the significant enhancement of air sea drag in the broad marginal ice zone that spans across the bering sea shelf break the proposed parameterization applied increases the drag coefficient by up to 200 for the wide range of ice concentrations that occur in the marginal ice zone compared to ice free conditions the previous drag parameterization eq 5 has a similar effect to the proposed for the smaller peaks but for the large event led to a decrease in accuracy with respect to the peak water level the addition of ice coverage generally improves the overall water surface elevation accuracy for this storm table 4 this is the case for both ice drag parameterizations two possibly important processes are still missing in these simulations we are not considering momentum imparted to the sea through wave dissipation particularly in the marginal ice that stretches across the bering sea at the pack ice ice free water interface additionally any damping of storm surge and tidally driven currents which may occur under the dense pack ice is not considered overall the dense ice pack case is well modeled however counter intuitive to the idea that it provides a protective cover from storm surge over the ocean during winter it appears that high concentrations of pack ice allow for significant surge events along the western alaskan coast compared to the presented model the ice coupled gofs 3 1 model significantly under represents the peak water level anomalies at the western alaska stations of nome and red dog dock during february 2011 fig 19 even given the dense pack ice coverage over the northern half of the model domain it is noted that the peak water level is more accurately represented by adcirc with or without the effect of ice on air sea drag the proposed model performs better with respect to the data in the bering sea region at nome and red dog dock tables 5 and 6 at prudhoe bay there is a small difference between the water surface elevation errors but the correlation to the data is higher in the gofs 3 1 model 5 3 january 2017 in january 2017 a series of low pressure systems with strong winds followed an extratropical cyclone with a central low under 940 mbar on a similar track to both the february and november 2011 storms ice cover conditions were very fragmented throughout the month in the bering sea fig 11 winds were predominantly southerly and speeds exceeded 35 ms 1 as the increased water levels propagated into the eastern half of the bering sea they were amplified on the shallower portions of the shelf this led to five days of significantly elevated water levels for the entire northern edge of the bering sea and much of western alaska the progression of the wind and pressure fields and the development of water levels without tides through the storm are found in fig 20 by january 2017 a meteorological and water level gauge had been recently installed at unalakleet in the easternmost portion of norton sound the comparison of the cfsv2 meteorology to data at nome unalakleet and red dog dock shows that the major storm features are well captured in terms of wind and pressure tables 2 and 3 the computed and measured water levels are shown at nome unalakleet red dock dock and prudhoe bay in fig 21 three to four well defined peaks appear at the western alaskan stations the comparison between modeled and observed water levels are generally good in non peak surge portions of the record the no ice simulation better matched the record while the with ice simulations often have greater drift in water levels being either too low or too high table 4 shows that the rmse at the observation stations is increased by the proposed ice drag parameterization while the parameterization from eq 5 decreases the rmse during the peak water levels the proposed ice parameterization over predicts some of the peak water levels for example by up to 0 5 m at nome for portions of the storm but accurately captures the ultimate peak regionally the proposed ice drag parameterization changes water level by as much as 0 6 m throughout the simulation fig 17 this increase is coastally focused in the bering sea correlating to the variable ice field there in the chukchi sea the effect is more regional due to the broader and denser ice coverage there the opposite effect is seen at the main peaks when using the previous drag parameterization as the magnitude of all peak errors increased generally in the direction of under prediction clearly the proposed air sea ice momentum transfer parameterization employed in this work imparts too much momentum to the surge in some scenarios particularly the secondary surge events for this storm however the primary surge peak was better represented in comparison to the previous parameterization eq 5 and no ice cases this proposed application assumes that there is a proportional relationship between the wind speed and the ice drift ocean current differential which generates the horizontal stresses at the ice ocean interface this assumption may be particularly flawed in the case of the highly fractured ice fields and variable wind fields additionally the aforementioned ice wave and wave surge interactions may have a substantial effect on these storm surges due to the extensive partial ice field despite these discrepancies the presented model again compares favorably to gofs 3 1 in the bering sea in particular where it appears to capture the major water level trends more accurately fig 21 this is also clear in the error statistics tables 5 and 6 however unlike the other events the presented model with and without ice also outperforms gofs 3 1 at prudhoe bay 6 discussion an important consideration for evaluation of our coastal ocean model in this study is to determine if errors are due to those in the atmospheric forcing the air sea ice drag parameterizations or some deficiency in the model itself e g grid resolution and bathymetry the august 2012 summer storm enabled an evaluation of the model without considering the effect of ice on the air sea drag in this example the cfsv2 wind speeds measured at the stations are fairly accurate slightly overestimated at nome and underestimated at red dog dock and prudhoe bay the resulting peak surges were the most accurate out of any storm evaluated an overestimation by 5 7 cm at the three stations the correlations in water level time series for our model are more accurate than those of gofs 3 1 at nome where the largest surge was measured and comparable at the other two stations overall it can be said that given an accurate representation of the meteorology which appeared to be the case for this storm at least in the coastal zone the presented model is capable of accurately simulating the development of storm surge generated by a summer storm in western alaska in comparison to the summer storm the peak surges are generally underestimated for the more energetic winter storms occurring in the presence of ice cover some of the underprediction may be related to localized underprediction in the cfsv2 winds for example the average error for the cfsv2 wind speeds at the stations during the august 2012 and january 2017 storms are smaller and more positive than those during the february 2011 and november 2011 storms the corresponding peak surge errors during the august 2012 and january 2017 storms are also smaller and tend to be positive it is important to highlight that the build up of surge over a continental shelf strongly depends on the wind stress resio and westerink 2008 which is proportional to the wind velocity squared eq 3 in fact proportional to the velocity cubed taking into account the linear relationship with air sea drag eq 4 thus wind speed is critical to the accurate development of surge typically it is expected that minimum central pressure and wind speeds in a coarse resolution model like cfsv2 will be significantly underestimated in tropical cyclones which are intense and small in scale here the meteorological characteristics of the larger scale extratropical storms that develop in alaska appear to be generally well captured by cfsv2 tables 2 and 3 see also supplementary figures 22 25 however wind speeds particularly at red dog dock and during the february 2011 and november 2011 storms certainly have a tendency to be underestimated compared to the observations importantly the observations shown are at coastal stations where the maximum wind speeds and the minimum pressure of the storm did not generally pass over thus it is unclear if the underestimation in wind speeds is a nearshore transitional effect or this extends more broadly over the bering and chukchi seas although the differences in average errors of cfsv2 wind speeds between the storms may appear small the effect of any wind speed error on surge heights is inflated due to the squared even cubed relationship another important consideration here is the effect of the proposed air sea ice drag parameterization on the surge response maximum water levels for all three winter storms were increased in the coastal zone when considering sea ice in the proposed drag parameterization the largest increases exceeded 0 5 m in norton sound and kotzebue sound during the january 2017 storms and along the yk delta during the november 2011 storm this was a result of the additional air sea momentum input in the fractured sea ice coverage zone regardless if that is located nearshore or not during the february 2011 storms the coastal zone had dense pack ice coverage which would be expected to decrease the surge height but the fracture sea ice zone at the bering sea shelf edge resulted in an overall increase to surge heights overall compared with observations the increase in peak surge due to the proposed consideration of ice in this work resulted in a general decrease in the peak surge error at the stations increase to peak surge model skill in this regard the air sea ice drag parameterization was effective this is particularly the case when compared to the adcirc runs performed using eq 5 which generally lead to a decrease in the model skill with respect to peak surges on the contrary considering the effect of sea ice using the proposed drag parameterization generally resulted in an increased rmse a decrease in the correlation coefficient of the surge response except during the february 2011 storm under dense pack ice where it helped inspection of the time series plots shows that although peak surge is often increased towards observations smaller water level maxima and minima tend to be overestimated during the month under the more variable ice conditions november 2011 and january 2017 storms explaining the additional rmse error computed over that period thus there is an uncertainty in the air sea ice drag parameterization related to the fact that it is assumed that there is a proportional relationship between the wind speed and the ice drift ocean current differential speed which generates the horizontal stresses at the ice ocean interface this assumption may tend to be more accurate for peak surge due to the presence of a strong dominant wind direction furthermore the air sea ice drag formulation does not consider other potentially important factors in the computation of the drag coefficient such as ice floe geometry melt ponds ridges floe separation distance or atmospheric stratification tsamados et al 2014 additionally the presence of ice makes it such that the momentum lost by the air is not necessarily delivered locally to the water some of the momentum can be transported away by advecting ice floes and some can be dissipated in ice ice collisions in general the parameterization in 5 more successfully captures water level trends at the northernmost station of prudhoe bay at the western alaskan stations the rmse differences between the proposed parameterization or the no ice simulations and the simulations using the parameterization in 5 are smaller although it is was not directly considered here wave effects may also impact the amplification of storm surge in western alaska for example significant wave heights as large as 12 m were measured in the bering sea on november 9 kinsman and deraps 2012 under fragmented ice coverage in the nearshore zone these dissipative waves may add significant forcing to the water column driving currents and setup this could help explain why greater correlation with observations in non tidal residual water levels were recorded during february 2011 under dense pack ice in the coastal zone compared to correlations during the november 2011 and january 2017 storms which had more variable nearshore ice conditions 7 conclusions and future work our non asssimilative high resolution tide and storm surge adcirc model for alaska connects all four major basins in the region the gulf of alaska and the bering chukchi and beaufort seas in order to model all pertinent processes across these marginal seas the model represents at scales ranging from 5000 m to 25 m the geometric bathymetric topographic and surface roughness complexity of the alaskan coast tidal constituents from global tidal models are used as boundary conditions in order to simulate tides throughout the domain the climate forecast system version 2 reanalysis wind and pressure fields provide atmospheric forcing ncep s automated sea ice analysis fields and a parameterization of the form and skin drag over the ice aim to account for the effect of ice on surface wind stresses generating surge the presented hydrodynamic model s solutions for the eight dominant astronomical tidal constituents have been compared to data assimilated global tidal solutions fes2012 and 121 mainly coastal tide gauges without considering the impact of the meteorology or sea ice generally our model has smaller tidal errors than fes2012 at the coastal tide gauges because of the high resolution we provide we have simulated the storm surge during an ice free summer storm and during more energetic winter storms under varying ice conditions time series of simulated water elevation response is compared with observations at three to four stations in western and northern alaska the gofs 3 1 data assimilated ocean general circulation modeling ogcm system which is fully coupled to a sea ice model but does not simulate tides was used as a basis for additional comparison and evaluation of our higher resolution depth integrated model that uses a parameterization of air sea ice drag in summary despite some limitations of the presented model underestimated wind speeds in the meteorological forcing during high energy sections of the storms uncertainty in the air sea ice drag related to the correlation of wind speed and ice drift speed and lack of wave surge ice interaction considerable skill at simulating tide and coastal surge is shown across all events with consistently less error than the coarser resolution data assimilated models the fes2012 tide model and the gofs 3 1 ogcm current funded collaborations with noaa are focused towards developing a greater understanding of how ice coverage influences tidal and storm surge processes on the inner shelf and at the coast in order to improve model forecast skill in western alaska this includes coupling long wave hydrodynamics directly to a phase averaged wind wave model which considers sea ice physics and the direct computation of wind and current induced ice ocean stresses through a coupled sea ice model which computes ice motion the inclusion of breaking waves at the coast particularly through the coastal marginal ice zone would allow for wave momentum input over much of the bering sea to be transferred to the surge over the relatively narrow coastal ice zone due to depth limited wave

24021,many three dimensional hydrodynamic models were developed to investigate saltwater intrusion in estuaries however the horizontal grid discretization remains a challenge to achieve high accuracy as well as to reduce the cost in grid generation and computation a three dimensional hydrodynamic simulator fantom refined was developed to address this issue a structured gridding technique which enables a flexible local mesh refinement was used for the horizontal gridding to analyze the multi resolution phenomena from coastal bay to river upstream the model is based on a collocated finite volume method with second or higher order spatial and temporal numerical schemes the model was calibrated and validated using the data measured in a meso macrotidal chikugo river estuary japan the simulated water level and vertical and longitudinal distribution of salinity were reasonably matched with the measured data the salinity intrusion length sil and salinity interface gradient sig calculated from measured and simulated results were in good agreement with r2 value of 0 99 and 0 98 respectively although there were limited studies that reproduced continuous change in mixing condition from well mixed to salt wedge via partially mixed type the present study successfully verified the change with intensive observations the effect of channel meanderings and width on horizontal salinity distribution in the estuary was explained using the model results furthermore the effect of horizontal grid resolution on saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions was investigated with three different grid resolutions and three different bathymetry resolutions the results showed that both of the horizontal grid and bathymetry resolutions have significant effect on the prediction of the salinity distribution as well as the surface level in the estuary keywords fantom refined structured grid lmr grid resolution estuarine mixing chikugo river estuary 1 introduction the saltwater intrusion and mixing in estuaries are very complex and highly dynamic in nature due to the presence of sinuous coastlines the shape of the estuary tidal range and freshwater discharge the spatial and temporal distributions of salinity can significantly affect the residual transport of sediments pollutants and waterborne materials through gravitational and tidal circulations in moderate to weakly stratified estuaries therefore understanding the mechanism of saltwater transport along estuaries is of great importance for coastal engineering aquaculture and water security for example the location and timing of irrigation water intake can be efficiently decided depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of salinity in order to provide the freshwater to the agricultural crops in deep estuaries salinity stratification will lead to the bottom water hypoxia which causes the unavailability of dissolved oxygen for the living benthic organisms depending on the vertical distribution of salinity estuaries are classified as well mixed partially mixed and salt wedge stratified type estuaries they are also classified into microtidal mesotidal macrotidal and hypertidal depending on the tidal range an estuary with strong tidal flow and weak freshwater discharge tends to the well mixed type whereas the estuary with weak tidal flow and strong freshwater discharge tends to the salt wedge type the partially mixed estuary is the transition between the well mixed and salt wedge estuaries however some estuaries have all the three mixing conditions depending on the tidal range azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 found that the chikugo river estuary japan was well mixed during the spring tide and salt wedge during the neap tide and it was partially mixed during the intermediate tide the spatial distribution of the salinity was also different during all those three periods the quantitative study of estuarine dynamics began with the work of pritchard 1952 1954 1956 wherein he analyzed the tidally averaged momentum balance of the james river estuary us and highlighted the importance of the density current since then many researchers investigated the estuarine dynamics using different techniques such as field surveys analytical methods and numerical models for a better understanding of the estuarine circulation field surveys in the estuary normally include the measurement of the vertical distribution of salinity current velocity and water level partch and smith 1978 west and shiono 1985 gong et al 2014 zou et al 2016 saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions in many estuaries around the world are well explained using the field surveys however the knowledge from field surveys tends to be site specific since the saltwater intrusion strongly depends on its geometry discharge and tidal variations additionally there were only a few measurements of high temporal resolution at a particular location and along the estuary bowen and geyer 2003 scully and friedrichs 2007 it is also time consuming and expensive to get the high resolution spatial and temporal data along the estuary analytical models have been developed to overcome the limitations in field measurements and to understand the physical processes that affect the saltwater intrusion in the estuary prandle 1985 savenije 1986 1993 2005 2015 brockway et al 2006 however the modeling of the saltwater intrusion affected by dredging barrier construction etc is generally limited by uncertainties in defining the eddy viscosities and eddy diffusivities for analytical solutions prandle 1985 these limitations of analytical models have led to active developments of numerical models recently numerical models are considered to be the most effective tools to analyze the saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions in the estuaries with high spatial and temporal resolutions since the 1960s many investigations using one dimensional models prandle 1981 simpson et al 1990 1991 krvavica et al 2017 were carried out in the estuarine environment to understand the saltwater intrusion and tidal circulation the comparison between the results of one dimensional models and observations often has high differences due to unresolved variations of the salinity gradient or inaccuracy of turbulence closure nunes vaz and simpson 1994 hence it is difficult to apply the one dimensional model for the estuaries with continuous change in mixing conditions a two dimensional numerical model can be applied to estuaries with vertical or horizontal variations of salinity along estuaries hamilton 1975 liu et al 2001 etemad shahidi et al 2008 qiao et al 2018 generally a two dimensional model can be applied as either depth integrated xy models or width averaged xz models so that we can analyze the horizontal or vertical circulation in the estuary however it is difficult to investigate the influence of spatial variation of bathymetry such as river branch and compound cross section on saltwater intrusion using these two dimensional models to overcome these limitations mentioned above three dimensional numerical models were actively developed such as pom trim3d efdc untrim fvcom roms suntans selfe and delft3d etc blumberg and mellor 1987 developed a three dimensional ocean circulation model pom and the model was successfully used to simulate the estuarine circulation galperin and mellor 1990a b wong et al 2003 mellor 2004 ahumada and cruzado 2007 likewise casulli and cheng 1992 developed a three dimensional model trim3d and applied to san francisco bay to study the saltwater intrusion additionally chen et al 2003 developed an unstructured grid finite volume three dimensional primitive ocean circulation model fvcom and successfully applied to the bohai sea a semi enclosed coastal ocean located in northern coast of china and the satilla river estuary georgia characterized by numerous tidal creeks and inlets further zhang and bapista 2008 developed a three dimensional semi implicit finite element model selfe and applied to the columbia river estuary and plume to simulate the estuarine circulation chua and fringer 2011 applied a three dimensional unstructured grid suntans model fringer et al 2006 to simulate the saltwater intrusion in the san francisco bay as explained above three dimensional models have the ability to resolve the estuarine salinity intrusion and mixing conditions both in spatial and temporal resolutions however the models are facing with the problem of creating an efficient horizontal grid in estuaries because of their extensive spatial scale variations from coastal ocean to river upstream regarding the horizontal gridding rectangular grids are used traditionally due to its simplicity however their major drawbacks include the inability to handle effectively the geometries that are often having high spatial scale variation such as estuarine modeling covering from coastal ocean to river upstream to improve this issue recent models use the structured grids with nesting technique or and boundary fitted coordinate roms pom and delft3d etc or unstructured grids with triangular mesh fvcom suntans selfe and untrim etc for boundary fitted coordinate it is not always possible to fit the coordinate to complex geometries such as interlinked channels that often occur in estuaries jones and davies 2007 sankaranarayanan and spaulding 2003 the other refinement technique for the structured grid is tree based lmr which has no overlapping found in nesting technique for example gerris model developed by popinet 2003 this method can refine the mesh locally and uses the high order advection scheme whereas there is difficulty in this method to specify refinement region and levels as the user wants in addition the levels of the direct neighboring cells cannot differ by more than one popinet 2003 on the contrary the unstructured mesh is reasonable to fit grid to the coastal line as well as to create a non uniform grid to express phenomena which include the wide range of spatial scale however it needs specific software and its knowledge to generate the grid such as sms swmath grummp etc and the accuracy of the model would depend on the quality of the grid created by users in addition it is not straightforward to develop efficient high order advective schemes in the unstructured grid due to high cost in estimating upwind points for the larger stencil recently shintani 2017 developed a three dimensional hydrodynamic model fantom refined and proposed a local mesh refinement lmr technique based on a structured grid which uses rectangular grids like tree based grid this technique employs two different views of a horizontal grid such as macro and micro views the macro view defines the unit of refinement we call this unit as container and each container is independently discretized with arbitrary horizontal resolution in a structured manner micro view the advantage of this technique was confirmed with analytical solutions and laboratory scale phenomena shintani 2017 the present method is a kind of lmr technique such as nesting and tree based techniques and similar to the quad tree methods popinet and rickard 2007 stelling 2012 however the present method allows the rectangular cell structure and it is different from them in the way to realize the lmr the idea of the container which defines the local groups having constant grid resolution in each direction was introduced in this method with this container we realize the simple adjustable lmr as well as straightforward indexing to specify any computational cell in the domain in addition it allows the non rectangle computational domain using the unstructured connections between the cells such as the hydrodynamic model developed by chen 2011 which also uses the cartesian type grid further many studies investigated the saltwater intrusion in partially mixed estuaries li et al 2005 xu et al 2008 and salt wedge estuaries ralston et al 2010 wang et al 2011 additionally a few studies simulated the change from partially mixed to salt wedge conditions in estuaries warner et al 2005 gong and shen 2011 however limited studies have been carried out to verify the continuous change in mixing conditions from well mixed to salt wedge via partially mixed with the measured spatial variation of salinity to the best of authors knowledge in this study the fantom refined was applied to simulate the saltwater intrusion in a real estuary to confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the methodology used in the model and to understand the physics of salinity transport and variations of mixing conditions initially the governing equations grid refinement technique and numerical techniques used in the model were described then the model was calibrated and validated by applying to a meso macrotidal chikugo river estuary japan which experiences all the three mixing conditions during a spring neap tidal cycle finally the effect of channel meanderings and width on horizontal distribution of salinity was analyzed with the computed results and the effect of the grid size on saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions was investigated with different grid resolutions 2 methodology 2 1 model description 2 1 1 governing equations the governing equations used in this model are the three dimensional navier stokes equations with incompressible and boussinesq approximation 1 u t u u x v u y w u z f u 1 œÅ 0 p x x ŒΩ h u x y ŒΩ h u y z ŒΩ v u z 2 v t u v x v v y w v z f v 1 œÅ 0 p y x ŒΩ h v x y ŒΩ

and ŒΩ v are the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity coefficients the free surface evolves according to the depth averaged continuity equation which is given by 5 h t x d h u d z y d h v d z 0 where h is the free surface height and d is the bathymetric depth the transport equations for salinity and temperature are given by 6 s t u s x v s y w s z x k h s x y k h s y z k v s z 7 t t u t x v t y w t z x k h t x y k h t y z k v t z where s is the salinity t is the temperature k h and k v are the horizontal and vertical eddy diffusion coefficients the governing equations were discretized based on a collocated finite volume method ferziger and peric 2002 perot 2000 temporal derivatives were discretized using the second order adams bashforth method for explicit terms such as advection of momentum horizontal diffusion and coriolis force zang et al 1994 surface elevation and vertical diffusion of momentum and scalar were computed semi implicitly using the second order theta method known as trim method casulli 1999 for the momentum and scalars the advection terms were spatially discretized by the third order ultimate quickest scheme leonard 1991 and the horizontal diffusion terms were discretized by the second order central differencing scheme the fantom refined is implemented in c with openmp and used from lua scripting language the domain decomposition is realized by equally grouping the computational cells to the number of omp threads except for the implicit surface solver whose matrix is computed with the viennacl library rupp et al 2016 the model consists of small independent compiled objects such as advection diffusion physical variables computational cells and so on the computational cases are described as simple lua scripts that can modify the structure of the model without recompiling the code users also can add original functions in a lua script to customize the computation for example adding source terms 2 1 2 gridding system a structured grid with a new local mesh refinement lmr technique was used for the horizontal grid structure shintani 2017 the procedure for the present lmr technique was shown in fig 1 first considered the highest resolution structured terrain data that can represent the local topography as shown in fig 1a then the structured groups of the finest cells were considered in a matrix form 3 3 matrix in this case figs 1b and c each group is called a container which is detectable with the cartesian indexing the numbers in the containers in figs 1b and 1c represent the number of grids divided in x and y directions respectively and can be changed to realize lmr with the unit of container size normally the refinement magnitude in x and y directions is kept to be the power of small number such as 2 to match the number of cell edge to be the multiple of that of neighboring containers for example the local resolution in x and y directions could be changed as 1 lowest 2 4 8 16 32 highest finally the horizontal computational grid was generated as shown in fig 1d the containers which contain the water cell were taken into account in the computation while the containers which do not contain water cell were automatically deleted from the memory allocation at code level it computes cell shape and size as well as neighboring cells although it might not follow the estuary boundary shape like the triangular unstructured grid the major advantages of the present lmr technique are that it does not require any specific software outside the model to refine and coarsen grid less time consuming and easy to modify the user can change the local resolution without complicated re meshing procedures simply editing the text file containing x and y refinement information as shown in figs 1b and c for the vertical discretization we employed the z coordinate system suitable for strongly stratified fluid in general the terrain following sigma coordinates are used in ocean modeling to represent smooth bottom topography whereas it is difficult to represent the steep slopes as well as strongly stratified waters like estuary using the sigma coordinates models such as delft3d applied for estuary casulli and zanolli 2002 marshall et al 1997 and suntans fringer et al 2006 are using the z coordinate system for vertical discretization to overcome these problems although there is a disadvantage with the z coordinate system due to step likes topography it was improved in this model using the partial step method proposed by the adcroft et al 1997 the collocated arrangement of variables was employed in the discretization and the location of the variable in the grid is shown in figs 2a and b on the one hand the salinity and temperatures are defined at the cell center on the other hand the momentum was defined both at the cell center u v w and face u v w in the case of advection and diffusion of the momentum the momentum was first interpolated to the center and was advected and diffused the same as the scalar variables perot 2000 then the updated increment of momentum at cell center was interpolated back to the cell face in the case of the unstructured grid it is generally difficult to find the upwind cell for the larger stencil to obtain higher order value however the upwind cells can be easily detected in the proposed grid structure since the containers and computational cells inside a container are indexed in cartesian manner fig 1 and each cell keeps the neighboring information which includes neighboring cells and direction such as north and west the interpolation of the variables is needed where the grid resolution changes and it degrades the order of accuracy however the accuracy inside the container is the same as the structured grid models this is the same as in the case of the nesting techniques although there is no overlapping of the grid in this model there is always a need to have some kinds of compromise in accuracy or usability to realize lmr we choose the simple strategy to realize lmr in user controllable manner figs 2c and d show the interpolation of the surface level for semi implicit scheme and the variables for the high order advection scheme in the case of the connection between the cells of different size the surface level is linearly interpolated inside the larger cell to compute the pressure gradient perpendicular to the cell face the surface interpolation uses the average of the surface of the adjacent small cells and the contribution from these cells are taken into account in constructing the matrix of semi implicit scheme the larger upwind stencil is also realized through the averaging of the small cells in the upwind side for simplicity no interpolation is performed in the larger cell along the upwind stencil as shown in fig 2d 2 1 3 turbulence closure model the vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients were solved using generic length scale gls turbulence closure developed by umlauf and burchard 2003 with ca canuto et al 2001 and kc kantha and clayson 1994 as stability functions this closure is a generalized version of existing two equation turbulence closures and can be used as k Œµ k œâ and k kl closures by changing the two constant parameters the k œâ model with ca stability function was selected in this study the horizontal eddy viscosity and horizontal diffusivity coefficients were used as calibration parameters and were set as constant through each computation 2 1 4 boundary conditions the boundary conditions used in the study were the open boundary at ocean side river freshwater flux boundary free surface lateral and bottom boundaries the weather forcing was applied to the free surface boundary the partially clamped boundary condition blumberg and kantha 1985 with the wave damping time scale of 200 s was used to remove the reflection of the outgoing wave at open ocean boundary at the bottom boundary the shear stress was implicitly computed as a part of vertical diffusion of momentum using the quadratic drag law 8 œÑ b œÅ 0 u 2 œÅ 0 c b u b u b where u is the friction velocity c b is the drag coefficient and u b is the velocity of flow near the bottom the value of c b 0 0026 was taken from the literature for example andrejev et al 2010 at the surface boundary the wind shear stress was applied explicitly as 9 œÑ s œÅ a c d u w u w where œÅ a is the air density c d is the surface drag coefficient which is obtained by the formula proposed by kondo 1975 and u w is the wind speed at 10 m above the water surface short and long wave radiations and sensible and latent heat fluxes were computed from air temperature humidity cloud cover radiation and wind speed using the bulk formula kondo 1975 2 1 5 wet dry treatment in order to simulate the saltwater intrusion with high tidal range it is important to reproduce the wet dry process in the intertidal mud flat cell splitting and merging technique was employed to realize the wet dry process with z coordinate in this process a threshold water level limit depth was applied to ensure positive cell thickness for numerical stability fig 3 illustrates the wet dry treatment of cells the water volume is controlled by the faces surrounding the cell the surface cell which intersects with the water surface changes its thickness by following the surface if the thickness of the surface cell becomes below pre specified minimum thickness then the surface cell is unified with the lower cell during the descending phase of water level fig 3a if the surface cell is a bottom cell and at the same time the cell thickness becomes below the minimum thickness then the cell is considered as dry and all surroundings faces are closed fig 3c for the ascending phase if the thickness of the surface cell exceeds the prescribed maximum thickness then the surface cell splits into two cells and the above cell becomes the surface cell fig 3b if one of the cells surrounding a dry cell is getting wet and its surface level is greater than the dry criteria level of the dry cell then the face between the dry and wet cells is opened and the dry cell is considered as wet cell fig 3d the thickness of the cells is computed in each time iteration after obtaining new surface level by the semi implicit scheme then the wet dry is treated explicitly using the limit depth minimum thickness a minimum thickness limit depth of 0 05 m was used in the present study the tracers are advected explicitly with the semi implicit velocity fields satisfying the consistency with continuity cwc gross et al 2002 2 2 study area the selected study area for the current study is the chikugo river estuary japan fig 4 the chikugo river is the largest river draining into the ariake sea and situated in the kyushu district in southwestern japan the total length of the river is nearly 143 km it ranks as the 22nd largest river in japan with a drainage basin of 2860 km2 a mean discharge of 54 m3 s during the dry season and a mean annual storm discharge of 2800 m3 s azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 2018 the rainy season in japan is for two months from mid may to mid july and some frequent typhoons during august to october which is typically a dry period the period from october to may is usually dry azhikodan and yokoyama 2019 the chikugo river estuary has a width varying from 1000 m at the river mouth to 250 m at 23 km upstream from the river mouth the main estuarine channel has a small branch from 10 to 7 km from the river mouth and a large branch named the hayatsue river forms at 6 5 km upstream and discharges independently into the ariake sea the estuary has a semidiurnal tidal cycle with the tidal amplitude of 5 m during spring tide and 1 5 m during neap tide the tidal currents in the estuary increase over 1 m s during spring tide the tidal discharge in the chikugo river estuary reaches 2000 m3 s and 500 m3 s during spring and neap tides respectively which are by far larger than the mean freshwater discharge therefore the estuary is dominated by tidal conditions during most of the year azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 2018 the average depth of the estuary is approximately 5 m the depth was measured with respect to the mean sea level at tokyo peil tp there are two weirs one at 17 5 km and another at 23 km from the river mouth the weir at 17 5 km is the submerged weir and older than the weir at 23 km the weir at 23 km can be opened during the storm discharge both the weirs limit the saltwater intrusion further upstream the estuary is well mixed during the spring tide salt wedge during the neap tide and partially mixed during the intermediate tide azhikodan et al 2014 azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 2 3 numerical simulation setup the model domain is shown in fig 5 which covers the chikugo river estuary until 23 km upstream from the river mouth and 19 km offshore from the river mouth based on the lmr explained in section 2 1 the grid resolution was gradually increased from ocean boundary to the river mouth the average width at 10 20 km upstream freshwater saltwater mixing zone of chikugo river estuary is about 200 m therefore a grid resolution of 20 m was used in the estuary to reproduce the three dimensional dynamics of the saltwater intrusion accurately the transverse bathymetry of the estuary was measured at 200 m interval along the estuary from the river mouth to upstream and every 500 m in the tidal flat up to 8 km offshore from the river mouth the measured data were interpolated to the cartesian grid with 20 m interval which is corresponding to the finest resolution in this investigation grid resolutions in the ocean were taken as 40 m up to 5 km tidal flat from the river mouth towards the ocean 160 m from 5 to 7 5 km 320 m from 7 5 to 15 2 km 640 m from 15 2 to 16 5 km and 1280 m from 16 5 to 19 km the vertical grid resolution varied from 0 25 to 2 5 m and the sub grid scale bottom height was represented using the partial cell method adcroft et al 1997 a comparative study was carried out in order to investigate the effect of grid resolution on saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions in the estuary the selected grid resolutions in the estuary were 20 40 and 80 m the bathymetry for 40 and 80 m grid was created from 20 m grid and the coarser cell depth was specified from the deepest data locating within the coarse cell the vertical grid resolution initial condition and boundary conditions were kept the same for the three cases the results are discussed in section 3 4 the 20 m grid resolution was used for the calibration and validation of the model further the model was run with 20 m computational grid resolution with the bathymetry of 40 m and 80 m resolutions for a better understanding of the effect of grid and bathymetry resolutions the total number of two dimensional and three dimensional grids in the model domain was 30 750 and 1 392 397 respectively for 20 m grid a time step of 3 s was employed based on courant friedichs lewy cfl condition in order to stabilize numerical simulation which runs as fast as real time on pc xeon e5 2687 w 3 40 ghz 16 cores 64 gb memory the model simulation was run for two days prior to the calibration and validation period spin up period to obtain better results for the initial conditions ocean salinity was set to 31 and the salinity in the estuary was roughly adjusted to the measured data the numerical experiments were started from the rest zero velocity for the boundary conditions measured tidal level of 1 min interval which was converted from 1 h interval data using cubic interpolation measured at ohura which is located 19 km from river mouth in the bay was used as the open ocean boundary the hourly measured discharge at 25 km upstream from the river mouth was specified as the freshwater flux boundary the hourly measured weather data was given as the heat and momentum flux boundaries from the surface for the simulation period 2 4 data for calibration and validation the data used for the calibration and validation are summarized in table 1 the salinity and water level data fig 6a during 20 25th september 2002 was collected for calibration of the model additionally the vertical salinity and water level data fig 6b measured during 9 25th september 2010 was used for the validation the measurements were carried out for every 1 km in the middle of the channel from 0 km to 17 km upstream with 18 measurement stations the vertical salinity profile was measured using a ctd probe the data were recorded at depth intervals of 0 1 m throughout the water column a high speed boat equipped with a differential global positioning system was used for the field survey the details of the field measurement were explained in azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 2016 a gauge station was located at the upstream of the chikugo river barrage 25 km from the river mouth river discharge monitored at the gauge station was collected from the japanese ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2 5 evaluation of results results were evaluated by quantifying the salinity intrusion length and mixing condition in the estuary the salinity intrusion length for salinity of 10 and 5 sil 10 and sil5 is defined as the distance from the river mouth to the tip of the salt wedge at which the salinity has reached 10 and 5 at the bottom respectively salinity interface gradient sig which is defined as the slope of 10 isohaline was used to classify the mixing conditions in the estuary azhikodan et al 2014 azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 10 s i g h x b x s where h is the water depth near the area where salinity is 10 x b and x s are the distance from the river mouth to the position where salinity is 10 at the bottom and surface respectively if sig 0 005 then the condition was defined as well mixed if 0 005 sig 0 001 then the condition in the estuary was defined as partially mixed sig 0 001 was defined as salt wedge stratified azhikodan et al 2014 azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration calibration is the process of adjusting the model parameters to fit the model results with the measured data the calibration of the model was carried out to determine the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients by simulating the estuarine hydrodynamics with different coefficient values 0 5 and 10 m2 s during the spring tide from 23 to 25th september 2002 the model achieved the best results for 5 m2 s of horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity the comparison of temporal variation between the measured and simulated water levels at four different stations of the chikugo river estuary is shown in figs 7a d these stations are located at 7 5 km towards the ocean from the river mouth fig 7a river mouth fig 7b 7 km upstream from river mouth fig 7c and 16 km upstream from the river mouth fig 7d the predicted water levels were reasonably matched with the measured water level at all stations the measured water level at 16 km upstream has nearly 0 5 h lag in phase during high water level and 2 5 h lag in phase during low water level compared to the measured water level in the ocean 7 5 km this tidal asymmetry at 16 km upstream was reasonably reproduced by the model with a little underprediction from the measured water level with the phase error of less than 0 25 and 0 5 h at high and low water levels respectively regression analysis was carried out for the measured and simulated water levels at the four different stations of the chikugo river estuary the r2 values for the calibration period were 0 9989 0 9937 0 9983 and 0 9942 for stations of 7 5 km fig 7e 0 km fig 7f 7 km fig 7g and 16 km fig 7h respectively the model successfully reproduced the water level in the estuary in both amplitude and phases with an r2 value of more than 0 99 at all stations the rmse root mean square error mae mean absolute error and correlation coefficient for the water levels are presented in table 2 the rmse and mae are less than 0 018 and 0 084 and correlation coefficient of more than 0 99 for all the locations respectively indicating that the model produced the water levels with reasonable accuracy the vertical and longitudinal distribution of measured and simulated salinity along the main channel of the estuary during the spring tide is shown in figs 8b c the measured fig 8b distribution of salinity shows that the estuary was well mixed during the spring tide the model successfully reproduced the mixing condition in the estuary fig 8c however the simulated results had slightly higher mixing than the measured mixing in the estuary it can be clearly seen from figs 8b c that the simulated 10 and 20 isohalines fig 8c were vertically straighter than the measured isohalines fig 8b the salinity intrusion lengths sil10 and sil5 for the measured and model simulated were calculated quantitatively based on the location of 10 and 5 isohalines during the calibration period and compared for a better understanding of the effectiveness of the model figs 8e and f both sil10 and sil5 increased from onset of flood tide to high tide and it decreased from ebb tide to low tide the model reproduced this change with a rmse 0 243 mae 0 506 and correlation coefficient of 0 997 for both sil10 and sil5 table 2 temporal variations of measured and simulated salinity surface and bottom at 1 km and 7 km from the river mouth are shown in fig 9 at 1 km from the river mouth the surface salinity was a little overprediction with a mae of 2 46 rmse of 0 72 and correlation coefficient of 0 96 table 2 compared to the measured salinity fig 9a whereas the bottom salinity was underpredicted especially for the peak salinity with a mae of 1 75 rmse of 0 53 and correlation coefficient of 0 98 fig 9b table 2 at 7 km the surface and bottom salinities were a little underpredicted compared to the measured salinity especially for the peak salinities figs 9c and d with a rmse of less than 0 37 mae of less than 1 28 and correlation coefficient higher than 0 98 table 2 3 2 validation validation is the process of verifying the model accuracy after setting the model parameters with the different set of measured data the validation of the model was carried out during a spring neap spring tidal cycle 11 25th september 2010 the temporal variation of water level was compared at three different stations namely 1 7 and 17 km upstream from the river mouth fig 10 further the statistical analysis for the model performance is shown in table 3 the simulated water level was in acceptable agreement with the measured water level for all the stations with a rmse 0 003 and mae 0 062 the correlation coefficients of the simulated water level were more than 0 99 overall the model successfully reproduced the water level during the spring neap tidal cycle temporal variation of measured and simulated salinity surface and bottom at 1 km and 7 km from the river mouth is given in fig 11 the surface salinity was in reasonable agreement with the measured salinity at 1 and 7 km except during the neap tide 192 214 h where there was a little overprediction in surface salinity at both the locations figs 11a and c with a rmse of less than 0 75 and correlation coefficient of higher than 0 88 the simulated bottom salinity was in acceptable agreement with the measured bottom salinity except during the neap tides where it was underpredicted compared to the measured data at both the locations 192 214 h with a rmse and mae 0 75 and 2 9 respectively at 1 km for surface and bottom salinities at all the locations the correlation coefficient for all the locations was more than 0 88 table 3 the comparison of simulated and measured vertical and longitudinal distribution of salinity was given in fig 12 for the spring neap tidal cycle the estuary was well mixed during the spring tide figs 12a c partially mixed during the intermediate tides figs 12d i and salt wedge during the neap tide figs 12j l the model reasonably reproduced the salinity distribution in the estuary for the spring neap tidal cycle the vertical salinity gradient in the simulated results was lower than the measured salinity gradient during spring figs 12a c and intermediate tides figs 12d i whereas the vertical salinity gradient in the simulated results was higher compared to the measured salinity gradient during the neap tide figs 12j l for better understanding of vertical salinity distribution in the estuary the measured and simulated salinity of 10 isohaline over the depth was compared as the saltwater front fig 13 during the spring tide the 10 isohaline was vertically straight fig 13a whereas there was a clear halocline during the intermediate figs 13b and c and neap tides fig 13d it can be clearly seen from fig 13a that the simulated salinity of 10 isohaline was matched reasonably with the measured salinity over the depth during spring tide the location of the simulated salinity of 10 isohaline was underpredicted to some extent compared to the measured during the intermediate tide fig 13b it can be clearly seen from fig 13b that the simulated saltwater front in the surface was reached nearly 4 5 km from the river mouth whereas the measured saltwater front was reached nearly 6 km during the neap tide the location of the simulated saltwater front was overpredicted at the surface and underpredicted at the bottom compared to the measurements fig 13d and the difference was nearly 1 km at the surface and 2 km at the bottom the sig and sil for the measured and simulated salinity distributions were calculated to understand the variation of mixing conditions and saltwater intrusion in detail fig 14 the calculated sig from the model simulations was in acceptable agreement with the measured data during spring and neap tides fig 14b however there was a slight error in sig during intermediate tide the estuary can be classified using sig azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 and it can be clearly seen from fig 14b that the estuary was changed from well mixed sig 0 005 to the salt wedge sig 0 005 as the tide changed from spring to neap tide there was an acceptable agreement between the measured and simulated sil10 during spring and intermediate tides whereas there was a little underprediction of sil10 during the neap tide fig 14c the sil10 was nearly 10 km from the river mouth during the spring tide 51 h for both simulated and measured salinity distributions during the neap tide 192 h the measured sil10 was nearly 16 km whereas the simulated sil10 was nearly 14 km the temporal variation in sil clearly indicates that the saltwater intrusion during the spring and neap tides was higher than the intermediate tide the sil10 was only about 1 km during the intermediate tide 144 h the error between measured and simulated sil10 was less than 5 during the spring and intermediate tides and it was nearly 12 during the neap tide the sil5 also had a similar trend as the sil10 in which the measured and simulated sil5 had reasonable agreement during the spring and intermediate tides and underprediction during the neap tide fig 14d the reason for the underprediction of sil during the neap tide could be high horizontal diffusivity since the calibration of the model was carried out during the spring tide which will be discussed in detail in section 3 5 overall the model successfully reproduced the saltwater intrusion with an rmse value of 0 2 mae of 0 71 and correlation coefficient of more than 0 99 for both the sil values table 3 hence the model can be applied to the estuaries to analyze the problems associated with the saltwater intrusion 3 3 horizontal salinity distribution horizontal distribution of simulated salinity at surface and bottom during spring and neap tides were analyzed to understand the effect of channel bathymetry fig 15 the surface salinity was obtained from the salinity of top layer whereas the bottom salinity was computed at 1 m above the bottom layer to represent the mid depth of the salt wedge as the thickness of salt wedge is 2 to 2 5 m during the neap tide from the bottom the salinity of 5 was assumed as the interface between saltwater and freshwater freshwater interface and the salinity of 25 was taken as the interface between mixed water and pure seawater seawater interface the bottom salinity distribution was the same as the surface salinity due to the well mixed condition in the estuary during the spring tide figs 15a d during the spring high tide the seawater interface was located at river mouth 0 km and the freshwater interface was located at 11 km from the river mouth figs 15a and b there was only a marginal difference in the salinity distribution between the main channel and the branch during the spring low tide the tidal flat was exposed nearly 3 km offshore and thalwegs appeared in the tidal flat which was filled with the freshwater figs 15c and d freshwater mainly flows into the bay through the thalwegs from the main channel and there was low salinity retained in the main channel on the contrary the freshwater flowing through the branch did not reach the tidal flat and freshwater interface was nearly 3 km upstream in the branch figs 15c and d during the neap tide the distribution of the bottom salinity was different from the surface salinity due to the formation of the salt wedge mixing condition in the estuary figs 15e h the location of bottom seawater interface appeared nearly 6 km from river mouth for the main channel while it was nearly 4 km for the branch fig 15f the surface salinity was varied widely over the tidal flats during the neap high tide while the surface salinity during the spring high tide was distributed uniformly over the tidal flat figs 15a and e during neap low tide the surface salinity distribution in the tidal flat was less varied compared to the spring low tide figs 15c and g the surface salinity was the same for both the main channel and branch fig 15g whereas the bottom salinity was high in the main channel compared to the branch during the neap low tide fig 15h the bottom salinity distribution was almost similar during the neap high and low tides figs 15f and h on the contrary the surface salinity was different for the neap high and low tides figs 15e and g as mentioned above the movement of the saltwater is more active in the main channel than the branch the higher salinity in the branch compared to the main channel during the spring low tide could be due to the low freshwater inflow the surface velocity from upstream to downstream in the main channel and branch at 5 5 and 5 8 km from the river mouth was extracted and presented in fig 16 for the spring neap tidal cycle 11 17th september 2010 fig 16b clearly shows that the velocity in the main channel is higher than the branch the flood and ebb velocities were nearly 1 48 and 1 04 m s for the main channel whereas for branch the flood and ebb velocities were 0 76 and 0 68 m s respectively during the spring tide during the neap tide the velocity in the main channel was 0 33 m s for flood tide and 0 72 m s for ebb tide whereas it was 0 14 and 0 62 m s for the branch during flood and ebb tides respectively during the ebb tide the increase in flow velocity flushes out the salinity into the bay from the main channel due to low velocity the salinity in the branch stays longer and is higher than the main channel during the ebb tide 3 4 effect of grid resolution the simulations were carried out with three different grid resolutions and three different bathymetry resolutions to investigate the effect of horizontal grid on salinity intrusion and mixing the description of cases is presented in table 4 fig 17 shows the comparison of the vertical salinity distribution along the main channel for measured data and simulated results using 20 40 and 80 m grid resolutions with the same bathymetry resolution with the grid during spring tide and neap tide which are represented as high grid and bathymetry resolutions case hh medium grid and bathymetry resolutions case mm and low grid and bathymetry resolutions case ll respectively table 4 for the test the grid size was changed only between the river mouth and upstream the total number of grids for the cases of hh mm and ll were 1 392 397 539 397 and 362 947 respectively during the spring tide the model reasonably reproduced mixing condition in all three cases whereas the simulated saltwater intrusion decreased with increase in grid size figs 17a d it can be clearly seen that the salinity of 10 isohaline sil10 was located nearly 10 km from the river mouth for the measured salinity data fig 17a and nearly 9 6 km for the simulated salinity with case hh fig 17b conversely the salinity of 10 isohaline was located nearly 3 km and 0 km for the cases of mm and ll respectively figs 17c and d for the neap tide both the saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions were different with the changes in grid resolution the mixing condition was stratified during the period in the estuary fig 17g which was reproduced successfully by the case hh fig 17h on the contrary the cases of mm and ll produced partially mixed conditions figs 17i and j the sil10 was nearly 16 km for the measured salinity fig 17g and nearly 14 km for the simulated salinity with case hh whereas it was nearly 2 km for case mm resolution and saltwater did not reach the river mouth for case ll resolution further the results from 40 and 80 m resolution bathymetry with 20 m grid resolution namely high grid resolution with medium bathymetry resolution case hm and high grid resolution with low bathymetry resolution case hl table 4 showed that the model with the 20 m bathymetry resolution case hh accurately reproduced the saltwater intrusion compared to those for the cases of hm and hl for the case hm the sil10 was underpredicted nearly 10 fig 17e compared to the case hh whereas underprediction was nearly 20 for case hl fig 17f during spring tide for the neap tide the sil10 was underpredicted nearly 21 and 42 for case hl fig 17l compared to that of the case hh fig 17h and measured salinity fig 17g respectively for the case hm fig 17k sil10 was almost similar with that obtained from the case hh fig 17h for the mixing condition all the cases with 20 m grid resolution hh hm and hl reproduced the measured mixing condition reasonably for both the spring and neap tides the above results suggest that the grid resolution is an important factor that influences the saltwater distribution in the estuary even having the same grid resolution finer bathymetric representation can produce the better results than the coarser ones from the fig 18 it can be seen clearly that at the narrow bending section of the channel 40 and 80 m bathymetry resolutions cannot reproduce the channel curve properly compared to the 20 m bathymetry resolution this could be the reason for the underprediction of sil for the 40 and 80 bathymetric data i e the cases of hm and hl fig 17 however the accuracy of the model with the coarser bathymetry resolutions the cases of mm and ll was clearly improved using 20 m grid the cases of hm and hl this suggests that the reduction of the numerical errors such as numerical diffusion also plays an important role in the accurate prediction of the salinity distribution in the estuary the model was run as fast as real time 17 days for the validation period for the case hh from the number of grids it can be seen that the number of grids reduced by 2 6 times for the case mm and 3 84 times for the case ll compared to the case hh because of the same time step dt of 3 s for all the three grid resolutions the performance of the model was improved 2 6 times for 40 m grid and 5 2 times for the 80 m grid compared to the 20 m grid although the computational time for the model run decreased with increase in grid size the accuracy of the model results decreased rapidly temporal variations of water levels at two locations 1 and 17 km from river mouth were compared to understand the effect of grid and bathymetry resolutions on the surface level prediction figs 19a and b show the comparison of the water levels between the finest case hh and the coarsest case ll grid resolutions the surface level was reasonably matched for the both grid resolutions at 1 km from the river mouth fig 19a whereas the water level at 17 km for the case ll was a little underpredicted compared to the measured water level and the case hh fig 19b further the temporal variation of water level at 17 km is shown for 24 h during the spring and neap tides to reveal the differences between the all computed cases in figs 19c and d respectively for the cases of mm and ll the temporal variation did not show strong anti symmetricity which found in the measured surface level and the amplitude was less compared to the measured data fig 19c the other cases show the anti symmetric variation similar to the measured data although the best prediction of the water level is obtained by the case hh the major improvement is achieved by the grid resolution rather than by the bathymetry resolution for the neap tide the water level shows the similar trend in all cases however again the case hh indicates the best fit with the measured data among the cases using 20 m grid resolution the cases of hm and hl do not show any apparent improvements on the accuracy compared to the cases of mm and ll this suggests that the bathymetry resolution has significant effects on the surface level during the neap tide it is interesting to note that even little improvement on the surface level for the cases of hm and hl the salinity distribution is greatly improved during the neap tide figs 17k and l this means that we should have enough resolution on both grid and bathymetry to obtain accurate results 3 5 model performance the model fantom refined reproduced the water level tidal asymmetry figs 7a d vertical distribution of salinity along the channel mixing condition figs 8a c and saltwater intrusion figs 8d e in the estuary with an acceptable accuracy during the calibration period spring tide 23 25th september 2002 the measured and simulated sil during the validation period showed an acceptable correlation in the spring and intermediate tides fig 12 however there was an underprediction in the sil during the neap tide warner et al 2005 validated the roms model results with along channel vertical distribution of salinity in the hudson river estuary where they also reported that the model results had lower sil compared to the observations during the neap tide due to high vertical diffusivity in the model karna et al 2015 attempted to reproduce the salt wedge in columbia river estuary and they reported that the model results underpredicted the saltwater intrusion compared to the observations during the neap tide the underprediction of salinity distribution during the neap tide would be the limitation of computation with the constant horizontal diffusion coefficient which should change with the flow fields to address this issue the model may need to employ the turbulence model taking account of local horizontal shear stress such as smagorinsky type models however this investigation is left for future studies as there is a less physical background for horizontal turbulence model compared to the vertical turbulence model for example the limitation of smagorinsky is the assumption of isotropic turbulence which limits the physical justification at least for the large scale geophysical flows klingbeil et al 2018 furthermore the spatial distribution of salinity in the estuary can be significantly affected by the narrow meanderings and multi branches fig 15 they reduced the influence of freshwater during the low tide which leads to the more salinity retention in the branch during the flood tide they also reduced the landward movement of the saltwater in the branch the salinity distribution in the tidal flat can be significantly affected by the bathymetry wang et al 2009 found that an average of roughly 0 3 m variation in bathymetric data of snohomish river estuary has a significant effect on the flow dynamics at the bypass junction therefore the accurate bathymetry of the tidal flat is very important to understand the estuarine hydrodynamics the model successfully reproduced the mixing conditions and saltwater intrusion in the estuary with fine grid and bathymetry resolutions compared to the coarser ones hence the horizontal grid and bathymetry resolutions can be regarded as the major factors that influence the model accuracy significantly figs 17 and 19 the higher accuracy with the finer grid is due to the accurate representation of narrow bending channels and could be due to thalweg especially for its connectivity the small grid size also contributes to reduce numerical errors from the numerical scheme and improve the model results 4 conclusions the three dimensional hydrodynamic model fantom refined was developed and applied to investigate the saltwater intrusion in estuaries this model uses the cartesian coordinate system with the lmr technique the horizontal grid resolution can be easily changed with the macro and micro views constructed from the concept of a container the model was calibrated and validated over the measured water level and salinity in the chikugo river estuary japan during the calibration period the model reasonably reproduced the water level with an r2 of 0 99 for the validation period the vertical distribution of along channel salinity was predicted with acceptable accuracy for the spring neap tidal cycle with an overall r2 of 0 98 the simulated sil was in acceptable agreement with measured sil during the spring and intermediate tides whereas there was a little underprediction during the neap tide the simulated sig was in reasonable agreement with the measured sig during the spring and neap tide and a slightly overprediction during the intermediate tides the horizontal distribution of surface and bottom salinity during the spring and neap tides was analyzed using the computed results the distribution of surface and bottom salinity was almost the same in both the channels during the spring high tide whereas the branch had the high salinity during the spring low tide the bottom salinity distribution was almost similar during the neap high and low tides on the contrary the surface salinity was different for the neap high and low tides the channel meanderings and narrow width of the channel affected the movement of both the freshwater and seawater in the branch and significantly reduced the influence of freshwater as well as seawater a comparative study was carried out to understand the effect of horizontal grid resolution on saltwater intrusion and mixing with three different grid resolutions 20 40 and 80 m and with three different bathymetric resolution 20 40 and 80 m bathymetric resolution with 20 m grid during the spring tide the mixing condition was successfully reproduced for all three grid resolutions whereas the salinity intrusion length was decreased with an increase in grid size for the neap tide both saltwater intrusion and mixing condition changed with an increase in grid size further the finer grid with the coarser bathymetry resolution improved the salinity distribution in the estuary compared to the cases of coarser grids with the same bathymetry resolution this means the reduction of the numerical errors such as numerical diffusion also plays an important role in the accurate prediction of the salinity distribution in the estuary however the finer resolution for both grid and bathymetry remains as the best hence the estuary should be discretized with enough resolution for both grid and bathymetry especially in narrow bending sections in order to get highly accurate model

24021,many three dimensional hydrodynamic models were developed to investigate saltwater intrusion in estuaries however the horizontal grid discretization remains a challenge to achieve high accuracy as well as to reduce the cost in grid generation and computation a three dimensional hydrodynamic simulator fantom refined was developed to address this issue a structured gridding technique which enables a flexible local mesh refinement was used for the horizontal gridding to analyze the multi resolution phenomena from coastal bay to river upstream the model is based on a collocated finite volume method with second or higher order spatial and temporal numerical schemes the model was calibrated and validated using the data measured in a meso macrotidal chikugo river estuary japan the simulated water level and vertical and longitudinal distribution of salinity were reasonably matched with the measured data the salinity intrusion length sil and salinity interface gradient sig calculated from measured and simulated results were in good agreement with r2 value of 0 99 and 0 98 respectively although there were limited studies that reproduced continuous change in mixing condition from well mixed to salt wedge via partially mixed type the present study successfully verified the change with intensive observations the effect of channel meanderings and width on horizontal salinity distribution in the estuary was explained using the model results furthermore the effect of horizontal grid resolution on saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions was investigated with three different grid resolutions and three different bathymetry resolutions the results showed that both of the horizontal grid and bathymetry resolutions have significant effect on the prediction of the salinity distribution as well as the surface level in the estuary keywords fantom refined structured grid lmr grid resolution estuarine mixing chikugo river estuary 1 introduction the saltwater intrusion and mixing in estuaries are very complex and highly dynamic in nature due to the presence of sinuous coastlines the shape of the estuary tidal range and freshwater discharge the spatial and temporal distributions of salinity can significantly affect the residual transport of sediments pollutants and waterborne materials through gravitational and tidal circulations in moderate to weakly stratified estuaries therefore understanding the mechanism of saltwater transport along estuaries is of great importance for coastal engineering aquaculture and water security for example the location and timing of irrigation water intake can be efficiently decided depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of salinity in order to provide the freshwater to the agricultural crops in deep estuaries salinity stratification will lead to the bottom water hypoxia which causes the unavailability of dissolved oxygen for the living benthic organisms depending on the vertical distribution of salinity estuaries are classified as well mixed partially mixed and salt wedge stratified type estuaries they are also classified into microtidal mesotidal macrotidal and hypertidal depending on the tidal range an estuary with strong tidal flow and weak freshwater discharge tends to the well mixed type whereas the estuary with weak tidal flow and strong freshwater discharge tends to the salt wedge type the partially mixed estuary is the transition between the well mixed and salt wedge estuaries however some estuaries have all the three mixing conditions depending on the tidal range azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 found that the chikugo river estuary japan was well mixed during the spring tide and salt wedge during the neap tide and it was partially mixed during the intermediate tide the spatial distribution of the salinity was also different during all those three periods the quantitative study of estuarine dynamics began with the work of pritchard 1952 1954 1956 wherein he analyzed the tidally averaged momentum balance of the james river estuary us and highlighted the importance of the density current since then many researchers investigated the estuarine dynamics using different techniques such as field surveys analytical methods and numerical models for a better understanding of the estuarine circulation field surveys in the estuary normally include the measurement of the vertical distribution of salinity current velocity and water level partch and smith 1978 west and shiono 1985 gong et al 2014 zou et al 2016 saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions in many estuaries around the world are well explained using the field surveys however the knowledge from field surveys tends to be site specific since the saltwater intrusion strongly depends on its geometry discharge and tidal variations additionally there were only a few measurements of high temporal resolution at a particular location and along the estuary bowen and geyer 2003 scully and friedrichs 2007 it is also time consuming and expensive to get the high resolution spatial and temporal data along the estuary analytical models have been developed to overcome the limitations in field measurements and to understand the physical processes that affect the saltwater intrusion in the estuary prandle 1985 savenije 1986 1993 2005 2015 brockway et al 2006 however the modeling of the saltwater intrusion affected by dredging barrier construction etc is generally limited by uncertainties in defining the eddy viscosities and eddy diffusivities for analytical solutions prandle 1985 these limitations of analytical models have led to active developments of numerical models recently numerical models are considered to be the most effective tools to analyze the saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions in the estuaries with high spatial and temporal resolutions since the 1960s many investigations using one dimensional models prandle 1981 simpson et al 1990 1991 krvavica et al 2017 were carried out in the estuarine environment to understand the saltwater intrusion and tidal circulation the comparison between the results of one dimensional models and observations often has high differences due to unresolved variations of the salinity gradient or inaccuracy of turbulence closure nunes vaz and simpson 1994 hence it is difficult to apply the one dimensional model for the estuaries with continuous change in mixing conditions a two dimensional numerical model can be applied to estuaries with vertical or horizontal variations of salinity along estuaries hamilton 1975 liu et al 2001 etemad shahidi et al 2008 qiao et al 2018 generally a two dimensional model can be applied as either depth integrated xy models or width averaged xz models so that we can analyze the horizontal or vertical circulation in the estuary however it is difficult to investigate the influence of spatial variation of bathymetry such as river branch and compound cross section on saltwater intrusion using these two dimensional models to overcome these limitations mentioned above three dimensional numerical models were actively developed such as pom trim3d efdc untrim fvcom roms suntans selfe and delft3d etc blumberg and mellor 1987 developed a three dimensional ocean circulation model pom and the model was successfully used to simulate the estuarine circulation galperin and mellor 1990a b wong et al 2003 mellor 2004 ahumada and cruzado 2007 likewise casulli and cheng 1992 developed a three dimensional model trim3d and applied to san francisco bay to study the saltwater intrusion additionally chen et al 2003 developed an unstructured grid finite volume three dimensional primitive ocean circulation model fvcom and successfully applied to the bohai sea a semi enclosed coastal ocean located in northern coast of china and the satilla river estuary georgia characterized by numerous tidal creeks and inlets further zhang and bapista 2008 developed a three dimensional semi implicit finite element model selfe and applied to the columbia river estuary and plume to simulate the estuarine circulation chua and fringer 2011 applied a three dimensional unstructured grid suntans model fringer et al 2006 to simulate the saltwater intrusion in the san francisco bay as explained above three dimensional models have the ability to resolve the estuarine salinity intrusion and mixing conditions both in spatial and temporal resolutions however the models are facing with the problem of creating an efficient horizontal grid in estuaries because of their extensive spatial scale variations from coastal ocean to river upstream regarding the horizontal gridding rectangular grids are used traditionally due to its simplicity however their major drawbacks include the inability to handle effectively the geometries that are often having high spatial scale variation such as estuarine modeling covering from coastal ocean to river upstream to improve this issue recent models use the structured grids with nesting technique or and boundary fitted coordinate roms pom and delft3d etc or unstructured grids with triangular mesh fvcom suntans selfe and untrim etc for boundary fitted coordinate it is not always possible to fit the coordinate to complex geometries such as interlinked channels that often occur in estuaries jones and davies 2007 sankaranarayanan and spaulding 2003 the other refinement technique for the structured grid is tree based lmr which has no overlapping found in nesting technique for example gerris model developed by popinet 2003 this method can refine the mesh locally and uses the high order advection scheme whereas there is difficulty in this method to specify refinement region and levels as the user wants in addition the levels of the direct neighboring cells cannot differ by more than one popinet 2003 on the contrary the unstructured mesh is reasonable to fit grid to the coastal line as well as to create a non uniform grid to express phenomena which include the wide range of spatial scale however it needs specific software and its knowledge to generate the grid such as sms swmath grummp etc and the accuracy of the model would depend on the quality of the grid created by users in addition it is not straightforward to develop efficient high order advective schemes in the unstructured grid due to high cost in estimating upwind points for the larger stencil recently shintani 2017 developed a three dimensional hydrodynamic model fantom refined and proposed a local mesh refinement lmr technique based on a structured grid which uses rectangular grids like tree based grid this technique employs two different views of a horizontal grid such as macro and micro views the macro view defines the unit of refinement we call this unit as container and each container is independently discretized with arbitrary horizontal resolution in a structured manner micro view the advantage of this technique was confirmed with analytical solutions and laboratory scale phenomena shintani 2017 the present method is a kind of lmr technique such as nesting and tree based techniques and similar to the quad tree methods popinet and rickard 2007 stelling 2012 however the present method allows the rectangular cell structure and it is different from them in the way to realize the lmr the idea of the container which defines the local groups having constant grid resolution in each direction was introduced in this method with this container we realize the simple adjustable lmr as well as straightforward indexing to specify any computational cell in the domain in addition it allows the non rectangle computational domain using the unstructured connections between the cells such as the hydrodynamic model developed by chen 2011 which also uses the cartesian type grid further many studies investigated the saltwater intrusion in partially mixed estuaries li et al 2005 xu et al 2008 and salt wedge estuaries ralston et al 2010 wang et al 2011 additionally a few studies simulated the change from partially mixed to salt wedge conditions in estuaries warner et al 2005 gong and shen 2011 however limited studies have been carried out to verify the continuous change in mixing conditions from well mixed to salt wedge via partially mixed with the measured spatial variation of salinity to the best of authors knowledge in this study the fantom refined was applied to simulate the saltwater intrusion in a real estuary to confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the methodology used in the model and to understand the physics of salinity transport and variations of mixing conditions initially the governing equations grid refinement technique and numerical techniques used in the model were described then the model was calibrated and validated by applying to a meso macrotidal chikugo river estuary japan which experiences all the three mixing conditions during a spring neap tidal cycle finally the effect of channel meanderings and width on horizontal distribution of salinity was analyzed with the computed results and the effect of the grid size on saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions was investigated with different grid resolutions 2 methodology 2 1 model description 2 1 1 governing equations the governing equations used in this model are the three dimensional navier stokes equations with incompressible and boussinesq approximation 1 u t u u x v u y w u z f u 1 œÅ 0 p x x ŒΩ h u x y ŒΩ h u y z ŒΩ v u z 2 v t u v x v v y w v z f v 1 œÅ 0 p y x ŒΩ h v x y ŒΩ

and ŒΩ v are the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity coefficients the free surface evolves according to the depth averaged continuity equation which is given by 5 h t x d h u d z y d h v d z 0 where h is the free surface height and d is the bathymetric depth the transport equations for salinity and temperature are given by 6 s t u s x v s y w s z x k h s x y k h s y z k v s z 7 t t u t x v t y w t z x k h t x y k h t y z k v t z where s is the salinity t is the temperature k h and k v are the horizontal and vertical eddy diffusion coefficients the governing equations were discretized based on a collocated finite volume method ferziger and peric 2002 perot 2000 temporal derivatives were discretized using the second order adams bashforth method for explicit terms such as advection of momentum horizontal diffusion and coriolis force zang et al 1994 surface elevation and vertical diffusion of momentum and scalar were computed semi implicitly using the second order theta method known as trim method casulli 1999 for the momentum and scalars the advection terms were spatially discretized by the third order ultimate quickest scheme leonard 1991 and the horizontal diffusion terms were discretized by the second order central differencing scheme the fantom refined is implemented in c with openmp and used from lua scripting language the domain decomposition is realized by equally grouping the computational cells to the number of omp threads except for the implicit surface solver whose matrix is computed with the viennacl library rupp et al 2016 the model consists of small independent compiled objects such as advection diffusion physical variables computational cells and so on the computational cases are described as simple lua scripts that can modify the structure of the model without recompiling the code users also can add original functions in a lua script to customize the computation for example adding source terms 2 1 2 gridding system a structured grid with a new local mesh refinement lmr technique was used for the horizontal grid structure shintani 2017 the procedure for the present lmr technique was shown in fig 1 first considered the highest resolution structured terrain data that can represent the local topography as shown in fig 1a then the structured groups of the finest cells were considered in a matrix form 3 3 matrix in this case figs 1b and c each group is called a container which is detectable with the cartesian indexing the numbers in the containers in figs 1b and 1c represent the number of grids divided in x and y directions respectively and can be changed to realize lmr with the unit of container size normally the refinement magnitude in x and y directions is kept to be the power of small number such as 2 to match the number of cell edge to be the multiple of that of neighboring containers for example the local resolution in x and y directions could be changed as 1 lowest 2 4 8 16 32 highest finally the horizontal computational grid was generated as shown in fig 1d the containers which contain the water cell were taken into account in the computation while the containers which do not contain water cell were automatically deleted from the memory allocation at code level it computes cell shape and size as well as neighboring cells although it might not follow the estuary boundary shape like the triangular unstructured grid the major advantages of the present lmr technique are that it does not require any specific software outside the model to refine and coarsen grid less time consuming and easy to modify the user can change the local resolution without complicated re meshing procedures simply editing the text file containing x and y refinement information as shown in figs 1b and c for the vertical discretization we employed the z coordinate system suitable for strongly stratified fluid in general the terrain following sigma coordinates are used in ocean modeling to represent smooth bottom topography whereas it is difficult to represent the steep slopes as well as strongly stratified waters like estuary using the sigma coordinates models such as delft3d applied for estuary casulli and zanolli 2002 marshall et al 1997 and suntans fringer et al 2006 are using the z coordinate system for vertical discretization to overcome these problems although there is a disadvantage with the z coordinate system due to step likes topography it was improved in this model using the partial step method proposed by the adcroft et al 1997 the collocated arrangement of variables was employed in the discretization and the location of the variable in the grid is shown in figs 2a and b on the one hand the salinity and temperatures are defined at the cell center on the other hand the momentum was defined both at the cell center u v w and face u v w in the case of advection and diffusion of the momentum the momentum was first interpolated to the center and was advected and diffused the same as the scalar variables perot 2000 then the updated increment of momentum at cell center was interpolated back to the cell face in the case of the unstructured grid it is generally difficult to find the upwind cell for the larger stencil to obtain higher order value however the upwind cells can be easily detected in the proposed grid structure since the containers and computational cells inside a container are indexed in cartesian manner fig 1 and each cell keeps the neighboring information which includes neighboring cells and direction such as north and west the interpolation of the variables is needed where the grid resolution changes and it degrades the order of accuracy however the accuracy inside the container is the same as the structured grid models this is the same as in the case of the nesting techniques although there is no overlapping of the grid in this model there is always a need to have some kinds of compromise in accuracy or usability to realize lmr we choose the simple strategy to realize lmr in user controllable manner figs 2c and d show the interpolation of the surface level for semi implicit scheme and the variables for the high order advection scheme in the case of the connection between the cells of different size the surface level is linearly interpolated inside the larger cell to compute the pressure gradient perpendicular to the cell face the surface interpolation uses the average of the surface of the adjacent small cells and the contribution from these cells are taken into account in constructing the matrix of semi implicit scheme the larger upwind stencil is also realized through the averaging of the small cells in the upwind side for simplicity no interpolation is performed in the larger cell along the upwind stencil as shown in fig 2d 2 1 3 turbulence closure model the vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients were solved using generic length scale gls turbulence closure developed by umlauf and burchard 2003 with ca canuto et al 2001 and kc kantha and clayson 1994 as stability functions this closure is a generalized version of existing two equation turbulence closures and can be used as k Œµ k œâ and k kl closures by changing the two constant parameters the k œâ model with ca stability function was selected in this study the horizontal eddy viscosity and horizontal diffusivity coefficients were used as calibration parameters and were set as constant through each computation 2 1 4 boundary conditions the boundary conditions used in the study were the open boundary at ocean side river freshwater flux boundary free surface lateral and bottom boundaries the weather forcing was applied to the free surface boundary the partially clamped boundary condition blumberg and kantha 1985 with the wave damping time scale of 200 s was used to remove the reflection of the outgoing wave at open ocean boundary at the bottom boundary the shear stress was implicitly computed as a part of vertical diffusion of momentum using the quadratic drag law 8 œÑ b œÅ 0 u 2 œÅ 0 c b u b u b where u is the friction velocity c b is the drag coefficient and u b is the velocity of flow near the bottom the value of c b 0 0026 was taken from the literature for example andrejev et al 2010 at the surface boundary the wind shear stress was applied explicitly as 9 œÑ s œÅ a c d u w u w where œÅ a is the air density c d is the surface drag coefficient which is obtained by the formula proposed by kondo 1975 and u w is the wind speed at 10 m above the water surface short and long wave radiations and sensible and latent heat fluxes were computed from air temperature humidity cloud cover radiation and wind speed using the bulk formula kondo 1975 2 1 5 wet dry treatment in order to simulate the saltwater intrusion with high tidal range it is important to reproduce the wet dry process in the intertidal mud flat cell splitting and merging technique was employed to realize the wet dry process with z coordinate in this process a threshold water level limit depth was applied to ensure positive cell thickness for numerical stability fig 3 illustrates the wet dry treatment of cells the water volume is controlled by the faces surrounding the cell the surface cell which intersects with the water surface changes its thickness by following the surface if the thickness of the surface cell becomes below pre specified minimum thickness then the surface cell is unified with the lower cell during the descending phase of water level fig 3a if the surface cell is a bottom cell and at the same time the cell thickness becomes below the minimum thickness then the cell is considered as dry and all surroundings faces are closed fig 3c for the ascending phase if the thickness of the surface cell exceeds the prescribed maximum thickness then the surface cell splits into two cells and the above cell becomes the surface cell fig 3b if one of the cells surrounding a dry cell is getting wet and its surface level is greater than the dry criteria level of the dry cell then the face between the dry and wet cells is opened and the dry cell is considered as wet cell fig 3d the thickness of the cells is computed in each time iteration after obtaining new surface level by the semi implicit scheme then the wet dry is treated explicitly using the limit depth minimum thickness a minimum thickness limit depth of 0 05 m was used in the present study the tracers are advected explicitly with the semi implicit velocity fields satisfying the consistency with continuity cwc gross et al 2002 2 2 study area the selected study area for the current study is the chikugo river estuary japan fig 4 the chikugo river is the largest river draining into the ariake sea and situated in the kyushu district in southwestern japan the total length of the river is nearly 143 km it ranks as the 22nd largest river in japan with a drainage basin of 2860 km2 a mean discharge of 54 m3 s during the dry season and a mean annual storm discharge of 2800 m3 s azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 2018 the rainy season in japan is for two months from mid may to mid july and some frequent typhoons during august to october which is typically a dry period the period from october to may is usually dry azhikodan and yokoyama 2019 the chikugo river estuary has a width varying from 1000 m at the river mouth to 250 m at 23 km upstream from the river mouth the main estuarine channel has a small branch from 10 to 7 km from the river mouth and a large branch named the hayatsue river forms at 6 5 km upstream and discharges independently into the ariake sea the estuary has a semidiurnal tidal cycle with the tidal amplitude of 5 m during spring tide and 1 5 m during neap tide the tidal currents in the estuary increase over 1 m s during spring tide the tidal discharge in the chikugo river estuary reaches 2000 m3 s and 500 m3 s during spring and neap tides respectively which are by far larger than the mean freshwater discharge therefore the estuary is dominated by tidal conditions during most of the year azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 2018 the average depth of the estuary is approximately 5 m the depth was measured with respect to the mean sea level at tokyo peil tp there are two weirs one at 17 5 km and another at 23 km from the river mouth the weir at 17 5 km is the submerged weir and older than the weir at 23 km the weir at 23 km can be opened during the storm discharge both the weirs limit the saltwater intrusion further upstream the estuary is well mixed during the spring tide salt wedge during the neap tide and partially mixed during the intermediate tide azhikodan et al 2014 azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 2 3 numerical simulation setup the model domain is shown in fig 5 which covers the chikugo river estuary until 23 km upstream from the river mouth and 19 km offshore from the river mouth based on the lmr explained in section 2 1 the grid resolution was gradually increased from ocean boundary to the river mouth the average width at 10 20 km upstream freshwater saltwater mixing zone of chikugo river estuary is about 200 m therefore a grid resolution of 20 m was used in the estuary to reproduce the three dimensional dynamics of the saltwater intrusion accurately the transverse bathymetry of the estuary was measured at 200 m interval along the estuary from the river mouth to upstream and every 500 m in the tidal flat up to 8 km offshore from the river mouth the measured data were interpolated to the cartesian grid with 20 m interval which is corresponding to the finest resolution in this investigation grid resolutions in the ocean were taken as 40 m up to 5 km tidal flat from the river mouth towards the ocean 160 m from 5 to 7 5 km 320 m from 7 5 to 15 2 km 640 m from 15 2 to 16 5 km and 1280 m from 16 5 to 19 km the vertical grid resolution varied from 0 25 to 2 5 m and the sub grid scale bottom height was represented using the partial cell method adcroft et al 1997 a comparative study was carried out in order to investigate the effect of grid resolution on saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions in the estuary the selected grid resolutions in the estuary were 20 40 and 80 m the bathymetry for 40 and 80 m grid was created from 20 m grid and the coarser cell depth was specified from the deepest data locating within the coarse cell the vertical grid resolution initial condition and boundary conditions were kept the same for the three cases the results are discussed in section 3 4 the 20 m grid resolution was used for the calibration and validation of the model further the model was run with 20 m computational grid resolution with the bathymetry of 40 m and 80 m resolutions for a better understanding of the effect of grid and bathymetry resolutions the total number of two dimensional and three dimensional grids in the model domain was 30 750 and 1 392 397 respectively for 20 m grid a time step of 3 s was employed based on courant friedichs lewy cfl condition in order to stabilize numerical simulation which runs as fast as real time on pc xeon e5 2687 w 3 40 ghz 16 cores 64 gb memory the model simulation was run for two days prior to the calibration and validation period spin up period to obtain better results for the initial conditions ocean salinity was set to 31 and the salinity in the estuary was roughly adjusted to the measured data the numerical experiments were started from the rest zero velocity for the boundary conditions measured tidal level of 1 min interval which was converted from 1 h interval data using cubic interpolation measured at ohura which is located 19 km from river mouth in the bay was used as the open ocean boundary the hourly measured discharge at 25 km upstream from the river mouth was specified as the freshwater flux boundary the hourly measured weather data was given as the heat and momentum flux boundaries from the surface for the simulation period 2 4 data for calibration and validation the data used for the calibration and validation are summarized in table 1 the salinity and water level data fig 6a during 20 25th september 2002 was collected for calibration of the model additionally the vertical salinity and water level data fig 6b measured during 9 25th september 2010 was used for the validation the measurements were carried out for every 1 km in the middle of the channel from 0 km to 17 km upstream with 18 measurement stations the vertical salinity profile was measured using a ctd probe the data were recorded at depth intervals of 0 1 m throughout the water column a high speed boat equipped with a differential global positioning system was used for the field survey the details of the field measurement were explained in azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 2016 a gauge station was located at the upstream of the chikugo river barrage 25 km from the river mouth river discharge monitored at the gauge station was collected from the japanese ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2 5 evaluation of results results were evaluated by quantifying the salinity intrusion length and mixing condition in the estuary the salinity intrusion length for salinity of 10 and 5 sil 10 and sil5 is defined as the distance from the river mouth to the tip of the salt wedge at which the salinity has reached 10 and 5 at the bottom respectively salinity interface gradient sig which is defined as the slope of 10 isohaline was used to classify the mixing conditions in the estuary azhikodan et al 2014 azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 10 s i g h x b x s where h is the water depth near the area where salinity is 10 x b and x s are the distance from the river mouth to the position where salinity is 10 at the bottom and surface respectively if sig 0 005 then the condition was defined as well mixed if 0 005 sig 0 001 then the condition in the estuary was defined as partially mixed sig 0 001 was defined as salt wedge stratified azhikodan et al 2014 azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration calibration is the process of adjusting the model parameters to fit the model results with the measured data the calibration of the model was carried out to determine the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients by simulating the estuarine hydrodynamics with different coefficient values 0 5 and 10 m2 s during the spring tide from 23 to 25th september 2002 the model achieved the best results for 5 m2 s of horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity the comparison of temporal variation between the measured and simulated water levels at four different stations of the chikugo river estuary is shown in figs 7a d these stations are located at 7 5 km towards the ocean from the river mouth fig 7a river mouth fig 7b 7 km upstream from river mouth fig 7c and 16 km upstream from the river mouth fig 7d the predicted water levels were reasonably matched with the measured water level at all stations the measured water level at 16 km upstream has nearly 0 5 h lag in phase during high water level and 2 5 h lag in phase during low water level compared to the measured water level in the ocean 7 5 km this tidal asymmetry at 16 km upstream was reasonably reproduced by the model with a little underprediction from the measured water level with the phase error of less than 0 25 and 0 5 h at high and low water levels respectively regression analysis was carried out for the measured and simulated water levels at the four different stations of the chikugo river estuary the r2 values for the calibration period were 0 9989 0 9937 0 9983 and 0 9942 for stations of 7 5 km fig 7e 0 km fig 7f 7 km fig 7g and 16 km fig 7h respectively the model successfully reproduced the water level in the estuary in both amplitude and phases with an r2 value of more than 0 99 at all stations the rmse root mean square error mae mean absolute error and correlation coefficient for the water levels are presented in table 2 the rmse and mae are less than 0 018 and 0 084 and correlation coefficient of more than 0 99 for all the locations respectively indicating that the model produced the water levels with reasonable accuracy the vertical and longitudinal distribution of measured and simulated salinity along the main channel of the estuary during the spring tide is shown in figs 8b c the measured fig 8b distribution of salinity shows that the estuary was well mixed during the spring tide the model successfully reproduced the mixing condition in the estuary fig 8c however the simulated results had slightly higher mixing than the measured mixing in the estuary it can be clearly seen from figs 8b c that the simulated 10 and 20 isohalines fig 8c were vertically straighter than the measured isohalines fig 8b the salinity intrusion lengths sil10 and sil5 for the measured and model simulated were calculated quantitatively based on the location of 10 and 5 isohalines during the calibration period and compared for a better understanding of the effectiveness of the model figs 8e and f both sil10 and sil5 increased from onset of flood tide to high tide and it decreased from ebb tide to low tide the model reproduced this change with a rmse 0 243 mae 0 506 and correlation coefficient of 0 997 for both sil10 and sil5 table 2 temporal variations of measured and simulated salinity surface and bottom at 1 km and 7 km from the river mouth are shown in fig 9 at 1 km from the river mouth the surface salinity was a little overprediction with a mae of 2 46 rmse of 0 72 and correlation coefficient of 0 96 table 2 compared to the measured salinity fig 9a whereas the bottom salinity was underpredicted especially for the peak salinity with a mae of 1 75 rmse of 0 53 and correlation coefficient of 0 98 fig 9b table 2 at 7 km the surface and bottom salinities were a little underpredicted compared to the measured salinity especially for the peak salinities figs 9c and d with a rmse of less than 0 37 mae of less than 1 28 and correlation coefficient higher than 0 98 table 2 3 2 validation validation is the process of verifying the model accuracy after setting the model parameters with the different set of measured data the validation of the model was carried out during a spring neap spring tidal cycle 11 25th september 2010 the temporal variation of water level was compared at three different stations namely 1 7 and 17 km upstream from the river mouth fig 10 further the statistical analysis for the model performance is shown in table 3 the simulated water level was in acceptable agreement with the measured water level for all the stations with a rmse 0 003 and mae 0 062 the correlation coefficients of the simulated water level were more than 0 99 overall the model successfully reproduced the water level during the spring neap tidal cycle temporal variation of measured and simulated salinity surface and bottom at 1 km and 7 km from the river mouth is given in fig 11 the surface salinity was in reasonable agreement with the measured salinity at 1 and 7 km except during the neap tide 192 214 h where there was a little overprediction in surface salinity at both the locations figs 11a and c with a rmse of less than 0 75 and correlation coefficient of higher than 0 88 the simulated bottom salinity was in acceptable agreement with the measured bottom salinity except during the neap tides where it was underpredicted compared to the measured data at both the locations 192 214 h with a rmse and mae 0 75 and 2 9 respectively at 1 km for surface and bottom salinities at all the locations the correlation coefficient for all the locations was more than 0 88 table 3 the comparison of simulated and measured vertical and longitudinal distribution of salinity was given in fig 12 for the spring neap tidal cycle the estuary was well mixed during the spring tide figs 12a c partially mixed during the intermediate tides figs 12d i and salt wedge during the neap tide figs 12j l the model reasonably reproduced the salinity distribution in the estuary for the spring neap tidal cycle the vertical salinity gradient in the simulated results was lower than the measured salinity gradient during spring figs 12a c and intermediate tides figs 12d i whereas the vertical salinity gradient in the simulated results was higher compared to the measured salinity gradient during the neap tide figs 12j l for better understanding of vertical salinity distribution in the estuary the measured and simulated salinity of 10 isohaline over the depth was compared as the saltwater front fig 13 during the spring tide the 10 isohaline was vertically straight fig 13a whereas there was a clear halocline during the intermediate figs 13b and c and neap tides fig 13d it can be clearly seen from fig 13a that the simulated salinity of 10 isohaline was matched reasonably with the measured salinity over the depth during spring tide the location of the simulated salinity of 10 isohaline was underpredicted to some extent compared to the measured during the intermediate tide fig 13b it can be clearly seen from fig 13b that the simulated saltwater front in the surface was reached nearly 4 5 km from the river mouth whereas the measured saltwater front was reached nearly 6 km during the neap tide the location of the simulated saltwater front was overpredicted at the surface and underpredicted at the bottom compared to the measurements fig 13d and the difference was nearly 1 km at the surface and 2 km at the bottom the sig and sil for the measured and simulated salinity distributions were calculated to understand the variation of mixing conditions and saltwater intrusion in detail fig 14 the calculated sig from the model simulations was in acceptable agreement with the measured data during spring and neap tides fig 14b however there was a slight error in sig during intermediate tide the estuary can be classified using sig azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 and it can be clearly seen from fig 14b that the estuary was changed from well mixed sig 0 005 to the salt wedge sig 0 005 as the tide changed from spring to neap tide there was an acceptable agreement between the measured and simulated sil10 during spring and intermediate tides whereas there was a little underprediction of sil10 during the neap tide fig 14c the sil10 was nearly 10 km from the river mouth during the spring tide 51 h for both simulated and measured salinity distributions during the neap tide 192 h the measured sil10 was nearly 16 km whereas the simulated sil10 was nearly 14 km the temporal variation in sil clearly indicates that the saltwater intrusion during the spring and neap tides was higher than the intermediate tide the sil10 was only about 1 km during the intermediate tide 144 h the error between measured and simulated sil10 was less than 5 during the spring and intermediate tides and it was nearly 12 during the neap tide the sil5 also had a similar trend as the sil10 in which the measured and simulated sil5 had reasonable agreement during the spring and intermediate tides and underprediction during the neap tide fig 14d the reason for the underprediction of sil during the neap tide could be high horizontal diffusivity since the calibration of the model was carried out during the spring tide which will be discussed in detail in section 3 5 overall the model successfully reproduced the saltwater intrusion with an rmse value of 0 2 mae of 0 71 and correlation coefficient of more than 0 99 for both the sil values table 3 hence the model can be applied to the estuaries to analyze the problems associated with the saltwater intrusion 3 3 horizontal salinity distribution horizontal distribution of simulated salinity at surface and bottom during spring and neap tides were analyzed to understand the effect of channel bathymetry fig 15 the surface salinity was obtained from the salinity of top layer whereas the bottom salinity was computed at 1 m above the bottom layer to represent the mid depth of the salt wedge as the thickness of salt wedge is 2 to 2 5 m during the neap tide from the bottom the salinity of 5 was assumed as the interface between saltwater and freshwater freshwater interface and the salinity of 25 was taken as the interface between mixed water and pure seawater seawater interface the bottom salinity distribution was the same as the surface salinity due to the well mixed condition in the estuary during the spring tide figs 15a d during the spring high tide the seawater interface was located at river mouth 0 km and the freshwater interface was located at 11 km from the river mouth figs 15a and b there was only a marginal difference in the salinity distribution between the main channel and the branch during the spring low tide the tidal flat was exposed nearly 3 km offshore and thalwegs appeared in the tidal flat which was filled with the freshwater figs 15c and d freshwater mainly flows into the bay through the thalwegs from the main channel and there was low salinity retained in the main channel on the contrary the freshwater flowing through the branch did not reach the tidal flat and freshwater interface was nearly 3 km upstream in the branch figs 15c and d during the neap tide the distribution of the bottom salinity was different from the surface salinity due to the formation of the salt wedge mixing condition in the estuary figs 15e h the location of bottom seawater interface appeared nearly 6 km from river mouth for the main channel while it was nearly 4 km for the branch fig 15f the surface salinity was varied widely over the tidal flats during the neap high tide while the surface salinity during the spring high tide was distributed uniformly over the tidal flat figs 15a and e during neap low tide the surface salinity distribution in the tidal flat was less varied compared to the spring low tide figs 15c and g the surface salinity was the same for both the main channel and branch fig 15g whereas the bottom salinity was high in the main channel compared to the branch during the neap low tide fig 15h the bottom salinity distribution was almost similar during the neap high and low tides figs 15f and h on the contrary the surface salinity was different for the neap high and low tides figs 15e and g as mentioned above the movement of the saltwater is more active in the main channel than the branch the higher salinity in the branch compared to the main channel during the spring low tide could be due to the low freshwater inflow the surface velocity from upstream to downstream in the main channel and branch at 5 5 and 5 8 km from the river mouth was extracted and presented in fig 16 for the spring neap tidal cycle 11 17th september 2010 fig 16b clearly shows that the velocity in the main channel is higher than the branch the flood and ebb velocities were nearly 1 48 and 1 04 m s for the main channel whereas for branch the flood and ebb velocities were 0 76 and 0 68 m s respectively during the spring tide during the neap tide the velocity in the main channel was 0 33 m s for flood tide and 0 72 m s for ebb tide whereas it was 0 14 and 0 62 m s for the branch during flood and ebb tides respectively during the ebb tide the increase in flow velocity flushes out the salinity into the bay from the main channel due to low velocity the salinity in the branch stays longer and is higher than the main channel during the ebb tide 3 4 effect of grid resolution the simulations were carried out with three different grid resolutions and three different bathymetry resolutions to investigate the effect of horizontal grid on salinity intrusion and mixing the description of cases is presented in table 4 fig 17 shows the comparison of the vertical salinity distribution along the main channel for measured data and simulated results using 20 40 and 80 m grid resolutions with the same bathymetry resolution with the grid during spring tide and neap tide which are represented as high grid and bathymetry resolutions case hh medium grid and bathymetry resolutions case mm and low grid and bathymetry resolutions case ll respectively table 4 for the test the grid size was changed only between the river mouth and upstream the total number of grids for the cases of hh mm and ll were 1 392 397 539 397 and 362 947 respectively during the spring tide the model reasonably reproduced mixing condition in all three cases whereas the simulated saltwater intrusion decreased with increase in grid size figs 17a d it can be clearly seen that the salinity of 10 isohaline sil10 was located nearly 10 km from the river mouth for the measured salinity data fig 17a and nearly 9 6 km for the simulated salinity with case hh fig 17b conversely the salinity of 10 isohaline was located nearly 3 km and 0 km for the cases of mm and ll respectively figs 17c and d for the neap tide both the saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions were different with the changes in grid resolution the mixing condition was stratified during the period in the estuary fig 17g which was reproduced successfully by the case hh fig 17h on the contrary the cases of mm and ll produced partially mixed conditions figs 17i and j the sil10 was nearly 16 km for the measured salinity fig 17g and nearly 14 km for the simulated salinity with case hh whereas it was nearly 2 km for case mm resolution and saltwater did not reach the river mouth for case ll resolution further the results from 40 and 80 m resolution bathymetry with 20 m grid resolution namely high grid resolution with medium bathymetry resolution case hm and high grid resolution with low bathymetry resolution case hl table 4 showed that the model with the 20 m bathymetry resolution case hh accurately reproduced the saltwater intrusion compared to those for the cases of hm and hl for the case hm the sil10 was underpredicted nearly 10 fig 17e compared to the case hh whereas underprediction was nearly 20 for case hl fig 17f during spring tide for the neap tide the sil10 was underpredicted nearly 21 and 42 for case hl fig 17l compared to that of the case hh fig 17h and measured salinity fig 17g respectively for the case hm fig 17k sil10 was almost similar with that obtained from the case hh fig 17h for the mixing condition all the cases with 20 m grid resolution hh hm and hl reproduced the measured mixing condition reasonably for both the spring and neap tides the above results suggest that the grid resolution is an important factor that influences the saltwater distribution in the estuary even having the same grid resolution finer bathymetric representation can produce the better results than the coarser ones from the fig 18 it can be seen clearly that at the narrow bending section of the channel 40 and 80 m bathymetry resolutions cannot reproduce the channel curve properly compared to the 20 m bathymetry resolution this could be the reason for the underprediction of sil for the 40 and 80 bathymetric data i e the cases of hm and hl fig 17 however the accuracy of the model with the coarser bathymetry resolutions the cases of mm and ll was clearly improved using 20 m grid the cases of hm and hl this suggests that the reduction of the numerical errors such as numerical diffusion also plays an important role in the accurate prediction of the salinity distribution in the estuary the model was run as fast as real time 17 days for the validation period for the case hh from the number of grids it can be seen that the number of grids reduced by 2 6 times for the case mm and 3 84 times for the case ll compared to the case hh because of the same time step dt of 3 s for all the three grid resolutions the performance of the model was improved 2 6 times for 40 m grid and 5 2 times for the 80 m grid compared to the 20 m grid although the computational time for the model run decreased with increase in grid size the accuracy of the model results decreased rapidly temporal variations of water levels at two locations 1 and 17 km from river mouth were compared to understand the effect of grid and bathymetry resolutions on the surface level prediction figs 19a and b show the comparison of the water levels between the finest case hh and the coarsest case ll grid resolutions the surface level was reasonably matched for the both grid resolutions at 1 km from the river mouth fig 19a whereas the water level at 17 km for the case ll was a little underpredicted compared to the measured water level and the case hh fig 19b further the temporal variation of water level at 17 km is shown for 24 h during the spring and neap tides to reveal the differences between the all computed cases in figs 19c and d respectively for the cases of mm and ll the temporal variation did not show strong anti symmetricity which found in the measured surface level and the amplitude was less compared to the measured data fig 19c the other cases show the anti symmetric variation similar to the measured data although the best prediction of the water level is obtained by the case hh the major improvement is achieved by the grid resolution rather than by the bathymetry resolution for the neap tide the water level shows the similar trend in all cases however again the case hh indicates the best fit with the measured data among the cases using 20 m grid resolution the cases of hm and hl do not show any apparent improvements on the accuracy compared to the cases of mm and ll this suggests that the bathymetry resolution has significant effects on the surface level during the neap tide it is interesting to note that even little improvement on the surface level for the cases of hm and hl the salinity distribution is greatly improved during the neap tide figs 17k and l this means that we should have enough resolution on both grid and bathymetry to obtain accurate results 3 5 model performance the model fantom refined reproduced the water level tidal asymmetry figs 7a d vertical distribution of salinity along the channel mixing condition figs 8a c and saltwater intrusion figs 8d e in the estuary with an acceptable accuracy during the calibration period spring tide 23 25th september 2002 the measured and simulated sil during the validation period showed an acceptable correlation in the spring and intermediate tides fig 12 however there was an underprediction in the sil during the neap tide warner et al 2005 validated the roms model results with along channel vertical distribution of salinity in the hudson river estuary where they also reported that the model results had lower sil compared to the observations during the neap tide due to high vertical diffusivity in the model karna et al 2015 attempted to reproduce the salt wedge in columbia river estuary and they reported that the model results underpredicted the saltwater intrusion compared to the observations during the neap tide the underprediction of salinity distribution during the neap tide would be the limitation of computation with the constant horizontal diffusion coefficient which should change with the flow fields to address this issue the model may need to employ the turbulence model taking account of local horizontal shear stress such as smagorinsky type models however this investigation is left for future studies as there is a less physical background for horizontal turbulence model compared to the vertical turbulence model for example the limitation of smagorinsky is the assumption of isotropic turbulence which limits the physical justification at least for the large scale geophysical flows klingbeil et al 2018 furthermore the spatial distribution of salinity in the estuary can be significantly affected by the narrow meanderings and multi branches fig 15 they reduced the influence of freshwater during the low tide which leads to the more salinity retention in the branch during the flood tide they also reduced the landward movement of the saltwater in the branch the salinity distribution in the tidal flat can be significantly affected by the bathymetry wang et al 2009 found that an average of roughly 0 3 m variation in bathymetric data of snohomish river estuary has a significant effect on the flow dynamics at the bypass junction therefore the accurate bathymetry of the tidal flat is very important to understand the estuarine hydrodynamics the model successfully reproduced the mixing conditions and saltwater intrusion in the estuary with fine grid and bathymetry resolutions compared to the coarser ones hence the horizontal grid and bathymetry resolutions can be regarded as the major factors that influence the model accuracy significantly figs 17 and 19 the higher accuracy with the finer grid is due to the accurate representation of narrow bending channels and could be due to thalweg especially for its connectivity the small grid size also contributes to reduce numerical errors from the numerical scheme and improve the model results 4 conclusions the three dimensional hydrodynamic model fantom refined was developed and applied to investigate the saltwater intrusion in estuaries this model uses the cartesian coordinate system with the lmr technique the horizontal grid resolution can be easily changed with the macro and micro views constructed from the concept of a container the model was calibrated and validated over the measured water level and salinity in the chikugo river estuary japan during the calibration period the model reasonably reproduced the water level with an r2 of 0 99 for the validation period the vertical distribution of along channel salinity was predicted with acceptable accuracy for the spring neap tidal cycle with an overall r2 of 0 98 the simulated sil was in acceptable agreement with measured sil during the spring and intermediate tides whereas there was a little underprediction during the neap tide the simulated sig was in reasonable agreement with the measured sig during the spring and neap tide and a slightly overprediction during the intermediate tides the horizontal distribution of surface and bottom salinity during the spring and neap tides was analyzed using the computed results the distribution of surface and bottom salinity was almost the same in both the channels during the spring high tide whereas the branch had the high salinity during the spring low tide the bottom salinity distribution was almost similar during the neap high and low tides on the contrary the surface salinity was different for the neap high and low tides the channel meanderings and narrow width of the channel affected the movement of both the freshwater and seawater in the branch and significantly reduced the influence of freshwater as well as seawater a comparative study was carried out to understand the effect of horizontal grid resolution on saltwater intrusion and mixing with three different grid resolutions 20 40 and 80 m and with three different bathymetric resolution 20 40 and 80 m bathymetric resolution with 20 m grid during the spring tide the mixing condition was successfully reproduced for all three grid resolutions whereas the salinity intrusion length was decreased with an increase in grid size for the neap tide both saltwater intrusion and mixing condition changed with an increase in grid size further the finer grid with the coarser bathymetry resolution improved the salinity distribution in the estuary compared to the cases of coarser grids with the same bathymetry resolution this means the reduction of the numerical errors such as numerical diffusion also plays an important role in the accurate prediction of the salinity distribution in the estuary however the finer resolution for both grid and bathymetry remains as the best hence the estuary should be discretized with enough resolution for both grid and bathymetry especially in narrow bending sections in order to get highly accurate model

24022,the discontinuous galerkin method is used to solve the non linear spherical shallow water equations with coriolis force the numerical method is well balanced and takes wetting drying into account the two fold goal of this work is a comparative study of dynamic and static tsunami generation by seabed displacement and the careful validation of these source models the numerical results show that the impact of the choice of seabed displacement model can be significant and that using a static approach may result in inaccurate results for the validation of the studies we consider measurements from satellites and buoy networks for the 2011 tohoku event and the 2004 sumatra andaman tsunami the results confirm that the method is appropriate for large scale tsunami simulations and early warning systems keywords static and dynamic seabed displacement tsunami modeling shallow water equations well balanced scheme wetting and drying discontinuous galerkin method 1 introduction tsunamis are oceanic gravity waves generated by large sea level surface displacements such displacements can be generated by volcanic eruptions ulvrova et al 2016 landslides de la asunci√≥n et al 2016 asteroid impacts ezzedine et al 2015 or earthquakes bonev et al 2018 tsunamis generated by earthquakes are commonplace and can cause considerable damage to human lives and infrastructures there are various mathematical models which can be used to model and predict the dynamics of tsunami waves such mathematical models should be able to accurately predict the sea surface displacement velocity and arrival times of waves reaching the coastline the resulting inundation area and the overall computational cost can also be of interest the models can be broadly classified as follows 3d models the governing equations are derived without integrating over the depth these are non hydrostatic models for instance the navier stokes or euler equations although these are accurate models their computational cost is substantial and currently not applicable to large scale predictive problems mori et al 2015 oishi et al 2013 saito and furumura 2009 2d models these models are derived by integrating over the depth and can be either non hydrostatic boussinesq type equations baba et al 2017 2015 or hydrostatic shallow water equations brecht et al 2018 rannabauer et al 2018 typically the 3d models are more accurate than the 2d models such as the shallow water equations but their computational cost make them impractical for the purpose of tsunami predictions the computational cost and accuracy of the tsunami simulations not only depend on the mathematical model but also on the numerical method being applied in the context of tsunami simulations various methods have been applied among them are the finite difference fd flouri et al 2013 wang and liu 2007 finite volume fv clain et al 2016 leveque et al 2011 finite element fe takase et al 2016 discontinuous galerkin dg blaise and st cyr 2012 blaise et al 2013 bonev et al 2018 castro et al 2016 seny et al 2014 and hybrid asai et al 2016 olabarrieta et al 2011 methods while all of these methods have their strengths and weaknesses the discontinuous galerkin method stands out in the context of wave problems as it offers high accuracy and efficiency through h p adaptivity and parallelity the effects of the earthquake and the subsequent seabed displacement enter the shallow water equations as a source term this source term can be time independent the passive static approach ortega et al 2011 reckinger et al 2014 suppasri et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2011b or time dependent the active dynamic approach dutykh and dias 2009 dutykh et al 2013 ohmachi et al 2001 ohta et al 2012 suppasri et al 2010 uphoff et al 2007 vogl and leveque 2017 yamazaki et al 2011a in the static approach only the final deformation of the seabed is considered this displacement is introduced into the simulation by displacing the initial sea surface according to the deformation of the seabed several assumptions are made in this static approach first of all the wavelengths of the tsunami waves are assumed to be much larger than the depth of the ocean the vertical acceleration of the water is neglected as it is small in comparison to the gravitational acceleration on the water mass that is lifted which causes a uniform velocity profile in the horizontal direction secondly the vertical seabed displacement is assumed to be instantaneous this is accurate if the timescale of the earthquake rupture is much smaller than the timescale of the tsunami propagation lastly the horizontal displacement of the seabed is usually neglected unless the horizontal displacement is large relative to the vertical displacement the static approach can consist of a single fault ortega et al 2011 reckinger et al 2014 or multiple faults suppasri et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2011b the multi fault case can be used to increase the resolution of the seabed displacement due to an underwater earthquake relative to the single fault in contrast to the static approach in the dynamic approach the full transient motion of the seabed displacement due to an underwater earthquake is considered the transient seabed displacement can be obtained by considering a simple time function for temporal changes dutykh and dias 2009 dutykh et al 2013 ohmachi et al 2001 suppasri et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2011a recovering an initial condition from buoy data blaise et al 2013 a quasi real time fault model ohta et al 2012 or solving the equations of elasticity uphoff et al 2007 vogl and leveque 2017 similar to the static approach the dynamic approach can be modeled as single fault dutykh and dias 2009 or multi fault dutykh et al 2013 ohmachi et al 2001 suppasri et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2011a in this work we consider the depth averaged shallow water equations in cartesian coordinates with coriolis force we employ the numerical algorithm presented in bonev et al 2018 which employs curved elements and dynamic mesh refinement moreover a wetting drying treatment which is also presented in bonev et al 2018 handles dry areas such as continental land masses simulations of the 2011 tohoku and 2004 sumatra andaman tsunamis are considered using both dynamic and static seabad deformation models we wish to investigate the effect of the dynamic seabed displacement model on the accuracy of the numerical results we assess the accuracy of the computed results and the respective source models with the help of real world data which is readily available for both tsunamis the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we discuss the source models that model the generation of tsunamis through an underwater earthquake this includes the discussion of static and dynamic seabed displacement approaches in section 3 we investigate the impact of the static and dynamic approaches on the numerical results to this end the 2011 tohoku and 2004 sumatra andaman tsunamis are investigated we compare results to measurements to assess their accuracy we state our conclusion in section 4 in appendix a we discuss the governing equations appendix b gives an overview of the numerical method bonev et al 2018 comprising the spatial discretization and the time integration finally the wetting drying method as well as the well balanced and positivity preserving properties are given in appendix c 2 tsunami generation for the static seabed displacement approach we assume that fault parameters such as the longitude lon latitude lat depth length width strike dip rake and slip are known using these parameters the okada solution can be computed okada 1985 to recover the seabed displacement caused by the earthquake thrust for a dynamic approach two additional parameters i e the rupture velocity or the rupture initiation time and rise times are needed there is an explicit relation between the rupture velocity and the rupture initiation time if the rupture velocity is considered to be constant in each subfault i then 1 t 0 i 1 l i v i t 0 i i 1 2 n f where l i v i t 0 i are the length rupture velocity rupture initiation time of the i th subfault and n f the total number of subfaults here we assume that t 0 1 0 if a fault has been divided into n f subfaults then the total displacement of the seabed at position r x y z t can be considered as the sum of displacements for each subfault i e 2 Œ¥ r i 1 n o i r i l i w i d i where o i is the okada solution in the i th subfault note that the okada solution computes a static seabed

method dgm for the spherical shallow water equations to understand the effects of the static and dynamic seabed displacement approaches on the tsunami waves we compare the two models using two different tsunami events these two tsunamis are the 2011 tohoku and the 2004 andaman sumatra events the numerical results obtained for these two tsunamis are compared with the available measured data to assess their quality and the performance of the static and dynamic seabed displacement models these two tsunamis are chosen as they are the two largest and most devastating events in recent decades with plenty of data available moreover their character is quite different as the earthquake that caused them have vastly differing fault dimension and rupture speeds 3 1 tohoku event on march 11th 2011 at 2 46 pm jst 05 46 utc a massive earthquake of magnitude m w 9 0 struck near the northeastern coast of japan resulting in massive seafloor displacement and high tsunami waves the first significant waves reached japan only 10 min after the earthquake struck thus leaving very little warning time this tsunami caused thousands of fatalities and financial damage of hundreds of billion dollars the characteristics of this tsunami make it an interesting test case for our purposes to obtain the seabed displacement using the okada model okada 1985 subfault parameters are taken from the university of california santa barbara ucsb database for big earthquakes shao et al 2011 we use the parameters of model iii presented in shao et al 2011 these parameters include both static and dynamic parameters in the aforementioned data the number of subfaults in the strike direction is 19 and in down dip direction 10 which results in the total number of n f 190 subfaults the length of each subfault in the strike direction is 25 km whereas it is 20 km in the down dip direction the fault is situated between 35 74 and 40 09 northern latitude and between 140 91 and 144 42 eastern longitude by inserting the fault parameters into 2 the final displacement of the seabed which is shown in fig 1 is obtained as shown in this figure the maximum lift of the seabed is located on the eastern side of the fault the bathymetry within the subfaults is illustrated in fig 1 apart from the initial displacement an accurate simulation requires accurate bathymetry data note that if the earthquake makes the topography shallower or deeper both the near field and the far field solutions can be affected as this would change the wave speed in the vicinity here the maximum lift of the seabed is in an area where the water is relatively deep so the ratio between the maximum lift and the water depth is small the dynamic rupture can be modeled by 3 the maximum displacement is about 17 m upward and 7 m downward the dynamic rupture is rather short and almost static after 105 s the mesh generated for the tohoku tsunami event is shown in fig 2 the initial mesh is an unrefined icosahedral mesh we define an area of interest which is selected for local refinement of the grid this area is defined by the circle centered at 177 longitude 12 latitude with a radius of 55 the center and radius of the circle as well as the level of refinement are selected to provide an appropriate mesh wide enough to capture waves traveling up to 12 h from the origin of the tsunami the grid in this area is refined locally five times which yields the desired resolution in the area of interest displayed in fig 2 it contains 14235 elements of which most are located in the pacific ocean as shown in fig 2 the mesh is considerably coarser on the opposite side of the sphere which reduces computational cost using this approach regions of interest can be defined and grids that are adapted to this region are generated automatically we restrict ourselves to balanced non conforming grids in which only one hanging node is permitted at each interface a balanced grid is characterized by the property that the difference in refinement levels of two neighboring elements cannot be greater than one in other words there are no more than three elements interfacing at one edge the propagation of the tsunami waves is shown at different times in the left column of fig 3 in this figure we show the results obtained with the static seabed displacement approach and biquartic polynomials n 4 as is clear at initial time the seabed displacement has been transferred to the water height after a while tsunami waves propagate into the pacific ocean and their amplitudes diminish the difference in sea surface height between the static and dynamic approach is also shown in fig 3 in this figure numerical results obtained with the static approach are denoted by h s and for the dynamic approach are denoted by h d in the middle column of the figure contour levels ranging from 0 1 m to 0 1 m are shown while in the right column contour levels between 1 m and 1 m are shown results presented in the right column show that differences between the two seabed displacement models are small when only large wave amplitudes are considered it is clear that big waves affect the near field which only makes up a small portion of the pacific ocean initially the differences between the two approaches are large as expected after 2 h however we can see that differences are small if we consider small amplitudes however then the differences between results remain significant even in the far field this can be seen in the middle column therefore an important factor in choosing the seabed displacement approach is whether the result needs to be accurate and where the zone of interest lies with respect to the tsunami source if the zone of interest is located near the earthquake zone or if high accuracy is needed then the dynamic approach should be considered the comparison presented in fig 3 is qualitative as it only compares the results of the two models therefore it is valuable to present quantitative results to do this results obtained by the dg method are compared with buoy data this buoy is the dart buoy 21418 the buoy data is collected by the dart tsunami monitoring network and are provided online by the national data buoy center ndbc of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa milburn et al 1996 by subtracting the time average from the buoy data we eliminate the effect of tides which are not considered in our model here we have performed numerical simulations using two polynomial degrees n 2 and n 4 to understand effects of the polynomial degree on the numerical results it is expected that using higher degree polynomials results in higher accuracy for the buoy 21418 effects of the polynomial degree are shown in fig 4 as shown in this figure using biquartic polynomials results in a higher accuracy compared to the results obtained with biquadratic polynomials it is also clear that the biquartic polynomials capture the maximum water height more accurately than the biquadratic polynomials this is expected as higher order methods are less dissipative and therefore better suited for large scale solutions where the solution is smooth in large parts of the domain we observe from this figure that the arrival time is correctly computed and the agreement with the buoy data is satisfactory for both the static and dynamic seabed displacement approaches using n 4 results in more accurate results than n 2 the comparison of the static and dynamic seabed displacement approaches is presented in fig 5 the differences are not significant and there is only a slight advantage of the dynamic seabed displacement approach which leads to better agreement in the buoy data we observe that the predicted arrival time is in better agreement with the buoy data if the dynamic seabed displacement approach is used the l 2 norm error calculated based on the differences between the numerical results using the static seabed displacement approach and the buoy data is 0 1357 while for the dynamic one is 0 1198 therefore we observe that the dynamic model performs slightly better than the static model 3 2 sumatra andaman event on december 26th 2004 at 0 59 am utc an earthquake of magnitude m w 9 1 9 3 struck near the west coast of sumatra indonesia resulting in tsunami waves which affected many surrounding nations it is the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph and has the longest ever recorded fault duration of about 10 min this tsunami caused hundreds of thousands of fatalities and financial damage of hundreds of billion dollars its large fault size and the long fault duration as well as its destructive power make it an appropriate yet challenging test scenario to compare the static and dynamic seabed displacement models again subfault parameters are required to calculate the seabed displacement caused by the earthquake since there are uncertainties in the inverted parameters different earthquake parameters have been proposed in the literature ammon et al 2005 chlieh et al 2007 fujii and satake 2007 gopinathan et al 2017 hirata et al 2006 merrifield et al 2005 poisson et al 2011 rhie et al 2007 here the parameters have been taken from hirata et al 2006 moreover for the dynamic rupture parameters such as rise time and rupture initiation time we use the data given by gopinathan et al 2017 to this end the velocity rupture and rise times have been taken from fig 7 in gopinathan et al 2017 and the rupture initiation time is calculated by 1 the fault parameters used in this paper are given in table 1 for this tsunami the total number of subfaults is n f 14 the length of the subfaults in the strike direction is 100 km and 150 km in the dip direction the fault is situated between 2 13 and 13 51 northern latitude and between 91 48 and 95 54 eastern longitude with the fault parameters given in table 1 and using the static rupture approach we use 2 to obtain the displacement shown in fig 6 as shown in this figure the seabed displacement in subfaults 4 6 12 and 13 is much larger than the displacement in other subfaults moreover the figure displays points that are related to jason 1 and topex poseidon satellite data which will be used to examine the numerical results the bathymetry in the subfaults is illustrated in fig 6 as opposed to the tohoku earthquake we observe that the bathymetry at the fault is much shallower as the wave speed is proportional to the square root of the water depth nonlinear effects can change the tsunami behavior if the ratio of seabed displacement to bathymetry depth becomes large in the sumatra andaman case this ratio is larger but remains small enough for these nonlinearities to be negligible the seabed displacement as a function of time is modeled by 3 with maximum upward and downward displacements of 12 and 7 m while the maximum water depth is about 5000 m the changes in the seabed are more complex than in the tohoku case not only is the fault very long but also the rupture time is longer than for the tohoku case these earthquake characteristics make this problem challenging for tsunami simulation as shown in table 1 subfaults are activated sequentially thus capturing the transient motion of the seabed displacement is likely to be important the mesh generated for the sumatra andaman tsunami event is shown in fig 7 similar to the tohoku tsunami simulation the initial mesh is an unrefined icosahedral mesh the area of interest is defined by a circle of radius 40 around the point at 84 longitude and 10 latitude the grid in this area is refined six times resulting in a mesh with 30378 elements located in the indian ocean this mesh has about twice the number of elements compared to the one used in the tohoku tsunami simulation there are small islands near the source so a finer grid in comparison to the tohoku tsunami simulation is required the propagation of the tsunami waves are shown for different times in the left column of fig 8 in this figure changes in water height obtained using the static rupture approach and biquartic polynomial n 4 are shown as illustrated in the figure the seabed displacement has been translated to the water height at the initial time since the static instantaneous approach is used after a while tsunami waves propagate into the indian ocean and waves become smaller the differences in the numerical results between the static and dynamic displacement models are shown in the middle and right columns of fig 8 the results presented in the right column show that the differences between the models are more prevalent in the near field of the tsunami source it can be seen that big waves affect a relatively small area in the vicinity of the source if we consider the smaller differences shown in the middle column it is clear that the differences are significant even in the far field it is also evident that the dynamic model has a more substantial impact in the case of the sumatra case while the large differences between the two models are restricted to a relatively small region in the tohoku case this region is much larger for the sumatra andaman tsunami the use of the dynamic approach can therefore be advantageous even for results in the far field note that for the tohoku earthquake the major seabed displacements are mostly located on the eastern side of the fault whereas they are located in all subfaults in the sumatra andaman case furthermore the rupture time of the sumatra andaman earthquake is much longer than that of the tohoku event so that differences between the static and dynamic approaches are expected to play a bigger role in the former case to examine the accuracy of the numerical results computed with the static and dynamic seabed deformation models we compare the results to satellite altimeter data this data can be used to compute the sea surface height ssh along the trajectory of the satellite here we use the data from two satellites namely jason 1 and topex poseidon which passed over the indian ocean while the tsunami occurred jason 1 captured sshs about 1 9 h after the earthquake it passes from south to north and its altimeter measurement is numbered cycle 109 on pass 129 topex poseidon captured the sshs about 2 0 h after the occurrence of the earthquake it passes from south to north and its altimeter measurement is numbered cycle 452 on pass 129 the pass of these two satellites and their trajectory relative to the fault is shown in fig 6 the altimeter data from these two satellites are available online on the radar altimeter database system web site of the department of earth observation and space systems scharroo et al 2012 the measurements of the ssh from satellites do not only include the tsunami signals but also other oceanographic effects fujii and satake 2007 to obtain tsunami signals the ssh data from previous cycles is used therefore tsunami signals related to jason 1 are obtained by subtracting measurements of cycles 109 and 108 and for topex poseidon it is obtained by subtracting measurements of cycles 452 and 451 since the ssh locations in previous cycles may not be the same as those during the tsunami a linear interpolation is used to estimate the values at the same locations here it is assumed that oceanographic effects are the same in both cycles so the difference between these two cycles gives the tsunami signals fujii and satake 2007 to understand the effect of the polynomial degree on the numerical results polynomial degrees of n 2 and n 4 are used in the simulations and their results are compared with the measurements from jason 1 satellite in fig 9 the arrival time calculated by utilizing n 2 and 4 are acceptable while wave amplitudes are better estimated by applying n 4 the biquartic polynomials have lower numerical dissipation and therefore capture water wave heights in the far field more accurately the numerical results obtained with the static and dynamic seabed displacement models are compared to the satellite data in fig 10 contrary to the tohoku case results obtained for the sumatra andaman tsunami show that there is a substantial difference between the two models this is clear in fig 10 where differences between the static and dynamic approaches are more significant at higher latitudes whereas in lower latitudes there is a relatively small difference between the two models the reason is that the southern subfault is activated first and the last one to be activated is the northern subfault therefore for points that are mainly affected by the southern subfault there is a small difference between both source models while for points that are affected by the northern subfault there is a substantial difference between the two approaches as shown in the figure the dynamic approach outperforms the static one as it predicts maximum amplitudes and widths of waves with improved accuracy fig 11 shows our numerical results in comparison to results obtained by fujii and satake 2007 using a finite difference method for the linearized shallow water equations and numerical results obtained by gopinathan et al 2017 using a finite volume method we observe good agreement of all numerical methods especially for the arriving time and the amplitude of the first peak in the far field however we observe that the proposed method captures amplitudes particularly well while the improvement using the dynamic method seems small we have to keep in mind that the satellite data only provides a one dimensional extract of the wave field to assess the accuracy of the results based on fig 8 however we can expect that this improvement persists throughout the far field as we have seen that smaller differences in amplitudes remain noticeable in the far field considering that wave amplitudes are smaller in the far field this indicates that a dynamic seabed deformation model should be considered if a high accuracy is desired in the far field as indicated by fig 10 this is especially the case for high order methods which are able to capture wave amplitudes accurately in the far field this is further investigated in fig 12 which shows errors based on the absolute difference between the numerical results and the satellite measurements the errors are obtained based on two sequential cycles of the satellites in other words points that only exist in one cycle are not considered for evaluating the errors as they are less reliable from the comparison of the numerical results with jason 1 data presented in fig 10 it can be concluded that within latitudes 1 to 6 the static model yields better results than the dynamic model and in the case of topex poseidon it can be seen that apart from latitudes 2 5 to 1 5 the dynamic model gives more accurate results than the static model this is also reflected by the error plots in fig 12 overall we conclude that the dynamic earthquake model yields more precise and reliable results than the static model this is reflected by the l2 norm of the resulting errors in the topex poseidon data the l2 norm of the resulting errors by applying the static model is 0 2775 and 0 1527 for the dynamic model for the jason 1 data however the errors for both models are 0 2047 and 0 2048 and therefore practically the same this indicates that the dynamical approach can provide better numerical results than the static approach depending on the position of interest 4 conclusion in this paper a discontinuous galerkin method was applied to model the shallow water equations on the rotating sphere with coriolis force to simulate two large scale tsunami events the dg method uses curved elements and takes wetting drying into account while also being well balanced we use two different approaches to model the initial seabed displacement caused by the underwater earthquake these are the static and dynamic displacement models the numerical results were compared to measurements for the 2011 tohoku and the 2004 sumatra andaman tsunami events with the goal of comparing and examining both source models and their impact on the accuracy of the numerical results some conclusions and remarks regarding the presented work are as follows comparison of the numerical results with measurements from satellites and buoy data shows that the presented dg method by utilizing high polynomial degrees can predict key features of the tsunamis such as the arrival time and sea surface heights accurately with satisfactory agreements between numerical results and the measurements both in the far and near field due to the good agreement with data and the high efficiency of the present method it is a suitable candidate for tsunami early warning systems for large scale events this holds especially true if the far field is of interest where the high order method outperformed the lower order method in terms of accuracy the comparison of static and dynamic source models reveals that the impact of the dynamic approach on numerical results can be significant in the near field the differences between both approaches are large however the choice of source did not impact the prediction of arrival times and amplitudes in a significant way but rather the width of the first peak on the other hand effects of the dynamic seabed displacement play a role in the far field especially considering the smaller amplitudes of waves therefore an important factor in choosing the seabed displacement model includes how accurate results need to be and where the zone of interest lies with respect to the tsunami source if the zone of interest is located near the source or if accurate results are required in the far field a dynamic approach should be considered moreover the fault length and the rupture time have a big impact on the near field based on the numerical results long faults with long rupture times require an accurate dynamical source model in this work we have only considered linear activation functions for the dynamic model but an examination of other rise functions or other dynamic source models is essential to understand the effects of the earthquake modeling on the tsunami results moreover there is a lot of uncertainty in the source data and the bottom topography which may affect the accuracy of the numerical results

spherical shallow water equations as presented in giraldo et al 2002 the depth averaged equations are solved in a cartesian frame related to the earth to avoid numerical problems associated with the spherical formulation of the problem this comes at the cost of an additional equation as the velocity vector p u v w t contains three components tangentiality of the velocity vector to the surface of

simulating tsunamis in order to investigate the effect of polynomial degree on the numerical results although it is feasible to use the higher order methods by considering higher n s the fifth order methods n 4 are commonly used for simulating fluid flows in the literature and they provide very accurate numerical results with a reasonable computational cost note that a higher polynomial degree can be used if a coarse grid used in the area of interest which is not the case here finally to complete the numerical scheme the integrals in b 7 have to be computed numerically to this end quadrature rules for the approximation of the volume and the surface integral terms are used thus we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations in the form of b 10 q n t r n q n where r n is the right hand side obtained by applying the quadrature rules in the discontinuous galerkin formulation here a three step third order strong stability preserving runge kutta method is used to solve this semi discrete form gottlieb et al 2011 appendix c wet dry treatment the task of performing tsunami simulations using the shallow water model requires the use of an inundation model this inundation model handles the change in shape and topology of the domain as well as the numerical challenges that arise in drying domains to take care of inundation we follow the method described in bonev et al 2018 we call a node x i dry if the water height œÜ n x i is smaller than a certain tolerance œÜ tol and distinguish between wet dry and semi dry elements the latter contains both wet and dry nodes which pose difficulties in the numerical treatment more specially such difficulties are the appearance of negative water heights artificial pressure gradients and instabilities due to the discontinuity in the derivative of the state variables to guarantee the positivity of the water column height we use the method presented in xing et al 2010 by controlling the timestep Œ¥ t such that c 1 j d j d c Œ¥ t œâ 1 2 is satisfied in each cell we guarantee positivity of the average water height œÜ n avg within each cell here j d j d denote the jacobians of the element and the edge parametrization respectively œâ 1 denotes the first quadrature weight and c denotes the maximum wave speed across the cell interface while this will guarantee positivity of the cell averages it will not guarantee positivity on each node for this purpose we apply a linear scaling if a negative water height occurs within a cell using the scaling factor c 2 Œ∏ min 1 œÜ n avg œÜ n avg œÜ n min the solution is rescaled around the cell average of the solution thus the minimum water height is set to 0 while conserving the mass within the cell although these measures suffice to guarantee positivity they are not sufficient to guarantee the well balanced property of the scheme this is due to artificial pressure gradients which occur in the evaluation of the term œÜ n œÜ n œÑ n if an element contains both wet and dry nodes therefore in these elements we replace the regular differential operator Œæ with the finite difference operator c 3 d Œæ f Œæ i 1 f Œæ i 1 Œæ i 1 Œæ i 1 if Œæ i Œæ i 1 Œæ i 1 are wet f Œæ i 1 f Œæ i Œæ i 1 Œæ i if Œæ i 1 Œæ i are wet and Œæ i 1 is dry or i 1 1 f Œæ i f Œæ i 1 Œæ i Œæ i 1 if Œæ i Œæ i 1 are wet and Œæ i 1 is dry or i 1 n 0 otherwise this operator mitigates the problem of artificial pressure gradients as it switches to a local evaluation of the gradient which ignores dry areas within the element finally a filter is used to guarantee the stability of the scheme we refer the reader to bonev et al 2018 for a more detailed discussion of the inundation model 
24022,the discontinuous galerkin method is used to solve the non linear spherical shallow water equations with coriolis force the numerical method is well balanced and takes wetting drying into account the two fold goal of this work is a comparative study of dynamic and static tsunami generation by seabed displacement and the careful validation of these source models the numerical results show that the impact of the choice of seabed displacement model can be significant and that using a static approach may result in inaccurate results for the validation of the studies we consider measurements from satellites and buoy networks for the 2011 tohoku event and the 2004 sumatra andaman tsunami the results confirm that the method is appropriate for large scale tsunami simulations and early warning systems keywords static and dynamic seabed displacement tsunami modeling shallow water equations well balanced scheme wetting and drying discontinuous galerkin method 1 introduction tsunamis are oceanic gravity waves generated by large sea level surface displacements such displacements can be generated by volcanic eruptions ulvrova et al 2016 landslides de la asunci√≥n et al 2016 asteroid impacts ezzedine et al 2015 or earthquakes bonev et al 2018 tsunamis generated by earthquakes are commonplace and can cause considerable damage to human lives and infrastructures there are various mathematical models which can be used to model and predict the dynamics of tsunami waves such mathematical models should be able to accurately predict the sea surface displacement velocity and arrival times of waves reaching the coastline the resulting inundation area and the overall computational cost can also be of interest the models can be broadly classified as follows 3d models the governing equations are derived without integrating over the depth these are non hydrostatic models for instance the navier stokes or euler equations although these are accurate models their computational cost is substantial and currently not applicable to large scale predictive problems mori et al 2015 oishi et al 2013 saito and furumura 2009 2d models these models are derived by integrating over the depth and can be either non hydrostatic boussinesq type equations baba et al 2017 2015 or hydrostatic shallow water equations brecht et al 2018 rannabauer et al 2018 typically the 3d models are more accurate than the 2d models such as the shallow water equations but their computational cost make them impractical for the purpose of tsunami predictions the computational cost and accuracy of the tsunami simulations not only depend on the mathematical model but also on the numerical method being applied in the context of tsunami simulations various methods have been applied among them are the finite difference fd flouri et al 2013 wang and liu 2007 finite volume fv clain et al 2016 leveque et al 2011 finite element fe takase et al 2016 discontinuous galerkin dg blaise and st cyr 2012 blaise et al 2013 bonev et al 2018 castro et al 2016 seny et al 2014 and hybrid asai et al 2016 olabarrieta et al 2011 methods while all of these methods have their strengths and weaknesses the discontinuous galerkin method stands out in the context of wave problems as it offers high accuracy and efficiency through h p adaptivity and parallelity the effects of the earthquake and the subsequent seabed displacement enter the shallow water equations as a source term this source term can be time independent the passive static approach ortega et al 2011 reckinger et al 2014 suppasri et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2011b or time dependent the active dynamic approach dutykh and dias 2009 dutykh et al 2013 ohmachi et al 2001 ohta et al 2012 suppasri et al 2010 uphoff et al 2007 vogl and leveque 2017 yamazaki et al 2011a in the static approach only the final deformation of the seabed is considered this displacement is introduced into the simulation by displacing the initial sea surface according to the deformation of the seabed several assumptions are made in this static approach first of all the wavelengths of the tsunami waves are assumed to be much larger than the depth of the ocean the vertical acceleration of the water is neglected as it is small in comparison to the gravitational acceleration on the water mass that is lifted which causes a uniform velocity profile in the horizontal direction secondly the vertical seabed displacement is assumed to be instantaneous this is accurate if the timescale of the earthquake rupture is much smaller than the timescale of the tsunami propagation lastly the horizontal displacement of the seabed is usually neglected unless the horizontal displacement is large relative to the vertical displacement the static approach can consist of a single fault ortega et al 2011 reckinger et al 2014 or multiple faults suppasri et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2011b the multi fault case can be used to increase the resolution of the seabed displacement due to an underwater earthquake relative to the single fault in contrast to the static approach in the dynamic approach the full transient motion of the seabed displacement due to an underwater earthquake is considered the transient seabed displacement can be obtained by considering a simple time function for temporal changes dutykh and dias 2009 dutykh et al 2013 ohmachi et al 2001 suppasri et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2011a recovering an initial condition from buoy data blaise et al 2013 a quasi real time fault model ohta et al 2012 or solving the equations of elasticity uphoff et al 2007 vogl and leveque 2017 similar to the static approach the dynamic approach can be modeled as single fault dutykh and dias 2009 or multi fault dutykh et al 2013 ohmachi et al 2001 suppasri et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2011a in this work we consider the depth averaged shallow water equations in cartesian coordinates with coriolis force we employ the numerical algorithm presented in bonev et al 2018 which employs curved elements and dynamic mesh refinement moreover a wetting drying treatment which is also presented in bonev et al 2018 handles dry areas such as continental land masses simulations of the 2011 tohoku and 2004 sumatra andaman tsunamis are considered using both dynamic and static seabad deformation models we wish to investigate the effect of the dynamic seabed displacement model on the accuracy of the numerical results we assess the accuracy of the computed results and the respective source models with the help of real world data which is readily available for both tsunamis the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we discuss the source models that model the generation of tsunamis through an underwater earthquake this includes the discussion of static and dynamic seabed displacement approaches in section 3 we investigate the impact of the static and dynamic approaches on the numerical results to this end the 2011 tohoku and 2004 sumatra andaman tsunamis are investigated we compare results to measurements to assess their accuracy we state our conclusion in section 4 in appendix a we discuss the governing equations appendix b gives an overview of the numerical method bonev et al 2018 comprising the spatial discretization and the time integration finally the wetting drying method as well as the well balanced and positivity preserving properties are given in appendix c 2 tsunami generation for the static seabed displacement approach we assume that fault parameters such as the longitude lon latitude lat depth length width strike dip rake and slip are known using these parameters the okada solution can be computed okada 1985 to recover the seabed displacement caused by the earthquake thrust for a dynamic approach two additional parameters i e the rupture velocity or the rupture initiation time and rise times are needed there is an explicit relation between the rupture velocity and the rupture initiation time if the rupture velocity is considered to be constant in each subfault i then 1 t 0 i 1 l i v i t 0 i i 1 2 n f where l i v i t 0 i are the length rupture velocity rupture initiation time of the i th subfault and n f the total number of subfaults here we assume that t 0 1 0 if a fault has been divided into n f subfaults then the total displacement of the seabed at position r x y z t can be considered as the sum of displacements for each subfault i e 2 Œ¥ r i 1 n o i r i l i w i d i where o i is the okada solution in the i th subfault note that the okada solution computes a static seabed

method dgm for the spherical shallow water equations to understand the effects of the static and dynamic seabed displacement approaches on the tsunami waves we compare the two models using two different tsunami events these two tsunamis are the 2011 tohoku and the 2004 andaman sumatra events the numerical results obtained for these two tsunamis are compared with the available measured data to assess their quality and the performance of the static and dynamic seabed displacement models these two tsunamis are chosen as they are the two largest and most devastating events in recent decades with plenty of data available moreover their character is quite different as the earthquake that caused them have vastly differing fault dimension and rupture speeds 3 1 tohoku event on march 11th 2011 at 2 46 pm jst 05 46 utc a massive earthquake of magnitude m w 9 0 struck near the northeastern coast of japan resulting in massive seafloor displacement and high tsunami waves the first significant waves reached japan only 10 min after the earthquake struck thus leaving very little warning time this tsunami caused thousands of fatalities and financial damage of hundreds of billion dollars the characteristics of this tsunami make it an interesting test case for our purposes to obtain the seabed displacement using the okada model okada 1985 subfault parameters are taken from the university of california santa barbara ucsb database for big earthquakes shao et al 2011 we use the parameters of model iii presented in shao et al 2011 these parameters include both static and dynamic parameters in the aforementioned data the number of subfaults in the strike direction is 19 and in down dip direction 10 which results in the total number of n f 190 subfaults the length of each subfault in the strike direction is 25 km whereas it is 20 km in the down dip direction the fault is situated between 35 74 and 40 09 northern latitude and between 140 91 and 144 42 eastern longitude by inserting the fault parameters into 2 the final displacement of the seabed which is shown in fig 1 is obtained as shown in this figure the maximum lift of the seabed is located on the eastern side of the fault the bathymetry within the subfaults is illustrated in fig 1 apart from the initial displacement an accurate simulation requires accurate bathymetry data note that if the earthquake makes the topography shallower or deeper both the near field and the far field solutions can be affected as this would change the wave speed in the vicinity here the maximum lift of the seabed is in an area where the water is relatively deep so the ratio between the maximum lift and the water depth is small the dynamic rupture can be modeled by 3 the maximum displacement is about 17 m upward and 7 m downward the dynamic rupture is rather short and almost static after 105 s the mesh generated for the tohoku tsunami event is shown in fig 2 the initial mesh is an unrefined icosahedral mesh we define an area of interest which is selected for local refinement of the grid this area is defined by the circle centered at 177 longitude 12 latitude with a radius of 55 the center and radius of the circle as well as the level of refinement are selected to provide an appropriate mesh wide enough to capture waves traveling up to 12 h from the origin of the tsunami the grid in this area is refined locally five times which yields the desired resolution in the area of interest displayed in fig 2 it contains 14235 elements of which most are located in the pacific ocean as shown in fig 2 the mesh is considerably coarser on the opposite side of the sphere which reduces computational cost using this approach regions of interest can be defined and grids that are adapted to this region are generated automatically we restrict ourselves to balanced non conforming grids in which only one hanging node is permitted at each interface a balanced grid is characterized by the property that the difference in refinement levels of two neighboring elements cannot be greater than one in other words there are no more than three elements interfacing at one edge the propagation of the tsunami waves is shown at different times in the left column of fig 3 in this figure we show the results obtained with the static seabed displacement approach and biquartic polynomials n 4 as is clear at initial time the seabed displacement has been transferred to the water height after a while tsunami waves propagate into the pacific ocean and their amplitudes diminish the difference in sea surface height between the static and dynamic approach is also shown in fig 3 in this figure numerical results obtained with the static approach are denoted by h s and for the dynamic approach are denoted by h d in the middle column of the figure contour levels ranging from 0 1 m to 0 1 m are shown while in the right column contour levels between 1 m and 1 m are shown results presented in the right column show that differences between the two seabed displacement models are small when only large wave amplitudes are considered it is clear that big waves affect the near field which only makes up a small portion of the pacific ocean initially the differences between the two approaches are large as expected after 2 h however we can see that differences are small if we consider small amplitudes however then the differences between results remain significant even in the far field this can be seen in the middle column therefore an important factor in choosing the seabed displacement approach is whether the result needs to be accurate and where the zone of interest lies with respect to the tsunami source if the zone of interest is located near the earthquake zone or if high accuracy is needed then the dynamic approach should be considered the comparison presented in fig 3 is qualitative as it only compares the results of the two models therefore it is valuable to present quantitative results to do this results obtained by the dg method are compared with buoy data this buoy is the dart buoy 21418 the buoy data is collected by the dart tsunami monitoring network and are provided online by the national data buoy center ndbc of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa milburn et al 1996 by subtracting the time average from the buoy data we eliminate the effect of tides which are not considered in our model here we have performed numerical simulations using two polynomial degrees n 2 and n 4 to understand effects of the polynomial degree on the numerical results it is expected that using higher degree polynomials results in higher accuracy for the buoy 21418 effects of the polynomial degree are shown in fig 4 as shown in this figure using biquartic polynomials results in a higher accuracy compared to the results obtained with biquadratic polynomials it is also clear that the biquartic polynomials capture the maximum water height more accurately than the biquadratic polynomials this is expected as higher order methods are less dissipative and therefore better suited for large scale solutions where the solution is smooth in large parts of the domain we observe from this figure that the arrival time is correctly computed and the agreement with the buoy data is satisfactory for both the static and dynamic seabed displacement approaches using n 4 results in more accurate results than n 2 the comparison of the static and dynamic seabed displacement approaches is presented in fig 5 the differences are not significant and there is only a slight advantage of the dynamic seabed displacement approach which leads to better agreement in the buoy data we observe that the predicted arrival time is in better agreement with the buoy data if the dynamic seabed displacement approach is used the l 2 norm error calculated based on the differences between the numerical results using the static seabed displacement approach and the buoy data is 0 1357 while for the dynamic one is 0 1198 therefore we observe that the dynamic model performs slightly better than the static model 3 2 sumatra andaman event on december 26th 2004 at 0 59 am utc an earthquake of magnitude m w 9 1 9 3 struck near the west coast of sumatra indonesia resulting in tsunami waves which affected many surrounding nations it is the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph and has the longest ever recorded fault duration of about 10 min this tsunami caused hundreds of thousands of fatalities and financial damage of hundreds of billion dollars its large fault size and the long fault duration as well as its destructive power make it an appropriate yet challenging test scenario to compare the static and dynamic seabed displacement models again subfault parameters are required to calculate the seabed displacement caused by the earthquake since there are uncertainties in the inverted parameters different earthquake parameters have been proposed in the literature ammon et al 2005 chlieh et al 2007 fujii and satake 2007 gopinathan et al 2017 hirata et al 2006 merrifield et al 2005 poisson et al 2011 rhie et al 2007 here the parameters have been taken from hirata et al 2006 moreover for the dynamic rupture parameters such as rise time and rupture initiation time we use the data given by gopinathan et al 2017 to this end the velocity rupture and rise times have been taken from fig 7 in gopinathan et al 2017 and the rupture initiation time is calculated by 1 the fault parameters used in this paper are given in table 1 for this tsunami the total number of subfaults is n f 14 the length of the subfaults in the strike direction is 100 km and 150 km in the dip direction the fault is situated between 2 13 and 13 51 northern latitude and between 91 48 and 95 54 eastern longitude with the fault parameters given in table 1 and using the static rupture approach we use 2 to obtain the displacement shown in fig 6 as shown in this figure the seabed displacement in subfaults 4 6 12 and 13 is much larger than the displacement in other subfaults moreover the figure displays points that are related to jason 1 and topex poseidon satellite data which will be used to examine the numerical results the bathymetry in the subfaults is illustrated in fig 6 as opposed to the tohoku earthquake we observe that the bathymetry at the fault is much shallower as the wave speed is proportional to the square root of the water depth nonlinear effects can change the tsunami behavior if the ratio of seabed displacement to bathymetry depth becomes large in the sumatra andaman case this ratio is larger but remains small enough for these nonlinearities to be negligible the seabed displacement as a function of time is modeled by 3 with maximum upward and downward displacements of 12 and 7 m while the maximum water depth is about 5000 m the changes in the seabed are more complex than in the tohoku case not only is the fault very long but also the rupture time is longer than for the tohoku case these earthquake characteristics make this problem challenging for tsunami simulation as shown in table 1 subfaults are activated sequentially thus capturing the transient motion of the seabed displacement is likely to be important the mesh generated for the sumatra andaman tsunami event is shown in fig 7 similar to the tohoku tsunami simulation the initial mesh is an unrefined icosahedral mesh the area of interest is defined by a circle of radius 40 around the point at 84 longitude and 10 latitude the grid in this area is refined six times resulting in a mesh with 30378 elements located in the indian ocean this mesh has about twice the number of elements compared to the one used in the tohoku tsunami simulation there are small islands near the source so a finer grid in comparison to the tohoku tsunami simulation is required the propagation of the tsunami waves are shown for different times in the left column of fig 8 in this figure changes in water height obtained using the static rupture approach and biquartic polynomial n 4 are shown as illustrated in the figure the seabed displacement has been translated to the water height at the initial time since the static instantaneous approach is used after a while tsunami waves propagate into the indian ocean and waves become smaller the differences in the numerical results between the static and dynamic displacement models are shown in the middle and right columns of fig 8 the results presented in the right column show that the differences between the models are more prevalent in the near field of the tsunami source it can be seen that big waves affect a relatively small area in the vicinity of the source if we consider the smaller differences shown in the middle column it is clear that the differences are significant even in the far field it is also evident that the dynamic model has a more substantial impact in the case of the sumatra case while the large differences between the two models are restricted to a relatively small region in the tohoku case this region is much larger for the sumatra andaman tsunami the use of the dynamic approach can therefore be advantageous even for results in the far field note that for the tohoku earthquake the major seabed displacements are mostly located on the eastern side of the fault whereas they are located in all subfaults in the sumatra andaman case furthermore the rupture time of the sumatra andaman earthquake is much longer than that of the tohoku event so that differences between the static and dynamic approaches are expected to play a bigger role in the former case to examine the accuracy of the numerical results computed with the static and dynamic seabed deformation models we compare the results to satellite altimeter data this data can be used to compute the sea surface height ssh along the trajectory of the satellite here we use the data from two satellites namely jason 1 and topex poseidon which passed over the indian ocean while the tsunami occurred jason 1 captured sshs about 1 9 h after the earthquake it passes from south to north and its altimeter measurement is numbered cycle 109 on pass 129 topex poseidon captured the sshs about 2 0 h after the occurrence of the earthquake it passes from south to north and its altimeter measurement is numbered cycle 452 on pass 129 the pass of these two satellites and their trajectory relative to the fault is shown in fig 6 the altimeter data from these two satellites are available online on the radar altimeter database system web site of the department of earth observation and space systems scharroo et al 2012 the measurements of the ssh from satellites do not only include the tsunami signals but also other oceanographic effects fujii and satake 2007 to obtain tsunami signals the ssh data from previous cycles is used therefore tsunami signals related to jason 1 are obtained by subtracting measurements of cycles 109 and 108 and for topex poseidon it is obtained by subtracting measurements of cycles 452 and 451 since the ssh locations in previous cycles may not be the same as those during the tsunami a linear interpolation is used to estimate the values at the same locations here it is assumed that oceanographic effects are the same in both cycles so the difference between these two cycles gives the tsunami signals fujii and satake 2007 to understand the effect of the polynomial degree on the numerical results polynomial degrees of n 2 and n 4 are used in the simulations and their results are compared with the measurements from jason 1 satellite in fig 9 the arrival time calculated by utilizing n 2 and 4 are acceptable while wave amplitudes are better estimated by applying n 4 the biquartic polynomials have lower numerical dissipation and therefore capture water wave heights in the far field more accurately the numerical results obtained with the static and dynamic seabed displacement models are compared to the satellite data in fig 10 contrary to the tohoku case results obtained for the sumatra andaman tsunami show that there is a substantial difference between the two models this is clear in fig 10 where differences between the static and dynamic approaches are more significant at higher latitudes whereas in lower latitudes there is a relatively small difference between the two models the reason is that the southern subfault is activated first and the last one to be activated is the northern subfault therefore for points that are mainly affected by the southern subfault there is a small difference between both source models while for points that are affected by the northern subfault there is a substantial difference between the two approaches as shown in the figure the dynamic approach outperforms the static one as it predicts maximum amplitudes and widths of waves with improved accuracy fig 11 shows our numerical results in comparison to results obtained by fujii and satake 2007 using a finite difference method for the linearized shallow water equations and numerical results obtained by gopinathan et al 2017 using a finite volume method we observe good agreement of all numerical methods especially for the arriving time and the amplitude of the first peak in the far field however we observe that the proposed method captures amplitudes particularly well while the improvement using the dynamic method seems small we have to keep in mind that the satellite data only provides a one dimensional extract of the wave field to assess the accuracy of the results based on fig 8 however we can expect that this improvement persists throughout the far field as we have seen that smaller differences in amplitudes remain noticeable in the far field considering that wave amplitudes are smaller in the far field this indicates that a dynamic seabed deformation model should be considered if a high accuracy is desired in the far field as indicated by fig 10 this is especially the case for high order methods which are able to capture wave amplitudes accurately in the far field this is further investigated in fig 12 which shows errors based on the absolute difference between the numerical results and the satellite measurements the errors are obtained based on two sequential cycles of the satellites in other words points that only exist in one cycle are not considered for evaluating the errors as they are less reliable from the comparison of the numerical results with jason 1 data presented in fig 10 it can be concluded that within latitudes 1 to 6 the static model yields better results than the dynamic model and in the case of topex poseidon it can be seen that apart from latitudes 2 5 to 1 5 the dynamic model gives more accurate results than the static model this is also reflected by the error plots in fig 12 overall we conclude that the dynamic earthquake model yields more precise and reliable results than the static model this is reflected by the l2 norm of the resulting errors in the topex poseidon data the l2 norm of the resulting errors by applying the static model is 0 2775 and 0 1527 for the dynamic model for the jason 1 data however the errors for both models are 0 2047 and 0 2048 and therefore practically the same this indicates that the dynamical approach can provide better numerical results than the static approach depending on the position of interest 4 conclusion in this paper a discontinuous galerkin method was applied to model the shallow water equations on the rotating sphere with coriolis force to simulate two large scale tsunami events the dg method uses curved elements and takes wetting drying into account while also being well balanced we use two different approaches to model the initial seabed displacement caused by the underwater earthquake these are the static and dynamic displacement models the numerical results were compared to measurements for the 2011 tohoku and the 2004 sumatra andaman tsunami events with the goal of comparing and examining both source models and their impact on the accuracy of the numerical results some conclusions and remarks regarding the presented work are as follows comparison of the numerical results with measurements from satellites and buoy data shows that the presented dg method by utilizing high polynomial degrees can predict key features of the tsunamis such as the arrival time and sea surface heights accurately with satisfactory agreements between numerical results and the measurements both in the far and near field due to the good agreement with data and the high efficiency of the present method it is a suitable candidate for tsunami early warning systems for large scale events this holds especially true if the far field is of interest where the high order method outperformed the lower order method in terms of accuracy the comparison of static and dynamic source models reveals that the impact of the dynamic approach on numerical results can be significant in the near field the differences between both approaches are large however the choice of source did not impact the prediction of arrival times and amplitudes in a significant way but rather the width of the first peak on the other hand effects of the dynamic seabed displacement play a role in the far field especially considering the smaller amplitudes of waves therefore an important factor in choosing the seabed displacement model includes how accurate results need to be and where the zone of interest lies with respect to the tsunami source if the zone of interest is located near the source or if accurate results are required in the far field a dynamic approach should be considered moreover the fault length and the rupture time have a big impact on the near field based on the numerical results long faults with long rupture times require an accurate dynamical source model in this work we have only considered linear activation functions for the dynamic model but an examination of other rise functions or other dynamic source models is essential to understand the effects of the earthquake modeling on the tsunami results moreover there is a lot of uncertainty in the source data and the bottom topography which may affect the accuracy of the numerical results

spherical shallow water equations as presented in giraldo et al 2002 the depth averaged equations are solved in a cartesian frame related to the earth to avoid numerical problems associated with the spherical formulation of the problem this comes at the cost of an additional equation as the velocity vector p u v w t contains three components tangentiality of the velocity vector to the surface of the earth is enforced through a lagrange multiplier the system of conservation laws can be written as a 1 q t f s where q f f x i ÀÜ f y j ÀÜ f z k ÀÜ and s are the solution the flux and the source

where Œ¥ i j is the kronecker delta the nodes Œæ j are chosen to be the legendre gauss lobatto lgl nodes which are defined on the interval 1 1 as a consequence the reference element in computational

respectively due to the discontinuous nature of the solution a suitable numerical flux f must be defined to connect the solution across interfaces we use the local lax friedrichs numerical flux b 8 f

boundary given as b 9 c max n ÀÜ p n œÜ n n ÀÜ p n œÜ n the spatial discretization can be extended to nonconforming meshes as discussed in bonev et al 2018 in this study n 2 and 4 are utilized for simulating tsunamis in order to investigate the effect of polynomial degree on the numerical results although it is feasible to use the higher order methods by considering higher n s the fifth order methods n 4 are commonly used for simulating fluid flows in the literature and they provide very accurate numerical results with a reasonable computational cost note that a higher polynomial degree can be used if a coarse grid used in the area of interest which is not the case here finally to complete the numerical scheme the integrals in b 7 have to be computed numerically to this end quadrature rules for the approximation of the volume and the surface integral terms are used thus we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations in the form of b 10 q n t r n q n where r n is the right hand side obtained by applying the quadrature rules in the discontinuous galerkin formulation here a three step third order strong stability preserving runge kutta method is used to solve this semi discrete form gottlieb et al 2011 appendix c wet dry treatment the task of performing tsunami simulations using the shallow water model requires the use of an inundation model this inundation model handles the change in shape and topology of the domain as well as the numerical challenges that arise in drying domains to take care of inundation we follow the method described in bonev et al 2018 we call a node x i dry if the water height œÜ n x i is smaller than a certain tolerance œÜ tol and distinguish between wet dry and semi dry elements the latter contains both wet and dry nodes which pose difficulties in the numerical treatment more specially such difficulties are the appearance of negative water heights artificial pressure gradients and instabilities due to the discontinuity in the derivative of the state variables to guarantee the positivity of the water column height we use the method presented in xing et al 2010 by controlling the timestep Œ¥ t such that c 1 j d j d c Œ¥ t œâ 1 2 is satisfied in each cell we guarantee positivity of the average water height œÜ n avg within each cell here j d j d denote the jacobians of the element and the edge parametrization respectively œâ 1 denotes the first quadrature weight and c denotes the maximum wave speed across the cell interface while this will guarantee positivity of the cell averages it will not guarantee positivity on each node for this purpose we apply a linear scaling if a negative water height occurs within a cell using the scaling factor c 2 Œ∏ min 1 œÜ n avg œÜ n avg œÜ n min the solution is rescaled around the cell average of the solution thus the minimum water height is set to 0 while conserving the mass within the cell although these measures suffice to guarantee positivity they are not sufficient to guarantee the well balanced property of the scheme this is due to artificial pressure gradients which occur in the evaluation of the term œÜ n œÜ n œÑ n if an element contains both wet and dry nodes therefore in these elements we replace the regular differential operator Œæ with the finite difference operator c 3 d Œæ f Œæ i 1 f Œæ i 1 Œæ i 1 Œæ i 1 if Œæ i Œæ i 1 Œæ i 1 are wet f Œæ i 1 f Œæ i Œæ i 1 Œæ i if Œæ i 1 Œæ i are wet and Œæ i 1 is dry or i 1 1 f Œæ i f Œæ i 1 Œæ i Œæ i 1 if Œæ i Œæ i 1 are wet and Œæ i 1 is dry or i 1 n 0 otherwise this operator mitigates the problem of artificial pressure gradients as it switches to a local evaluation of the gradient which ignores dry areas within the element finally a filter is used to guarantee the stability of the scheme we refer the reader to bonev et al 2018 for a more detailed discussion of the inundation model 
24023,the spindown of a geostrophically balanced density front in an upper ocean mixed layer is simulated with a large eddy simulation les model that resolves o 1000 m down to o 1 m scale our goal is to examine the interaction between the submesoscale and the turbulent finescale and another related goal is to use the turbulence resolving simulation to better characterize vertical transport frontogenesis and dissipative processes the flow passes through symmetric and baroclinic instabilities spawns vortex filaments of o 100 m thickness as well as larger eddies with cross front velocity as large as the along front velocity and develops turbulence that is spatially localized and organized a o 100 m physical space filter is applied to the simulated flow so that the coherent submesoscale is separated from the finescale in a decomposition that preserves the spatial organization of the flow unlike the typical practice of a split into a frontal average and a fluctuation that obscures the coherent submesoscale the energy spectrum exhibits a change of slope at o 100 m with an approximately 5 3 slope over a subrange of the finescale analysis of the submesoscale vertical velocity as large as 5mm s in the upper layer of the front reveals that downwelling is limited to the thin vortex filaments and the junction of the submesoscale eddies with these filaments while upwelling occurs over spatially extensive regions in the eddies conditional averaging shows that heavier lighter fluid is preferentially downwelled upwelled by these coherent submesoscale structures leading to an overall buoyancy flux that is restratifying the submesoscale is unbalanced with local rossby number as large as 5 the kinetic energy ke transport equations are evaluated separately for the submesoscale and the finescale to understand energy pathways in this problem the buoyancy flux associated with coherent motions transfers the potential energy of the front and acts as the primary source of submesoscale ke which is then transported across the front with a fraction transferred to the finescale the transfer limited to thin regions of o 100 m horizontal width is accomplished by primarily horizontal strain in the upper 10 m and by vertical shear in the rest of the 50 m deep mixed layer frontogenetic mechanisms are diagnosed through analysis of the transport equation for squared buoyancy gradient horizontal strain is the primary frontogenetic term that is especially strong in the near surface layer the frontogenesis is counteracted primarily by horizontal diffusion in the top 10 m while further below the balance is with the horizontal gradient of vertical velocity keywords submesoscale turbulence vertical transport frontogenesis instability 1 introduction the mixed layer in the upper ocean contains fronts regions that have sharp density gradient that exhibit lateral density variability at sub 10 km scale e g hosegood et al 2006 timmermans et al 2012 and sengupta et al 2016 submesoscale 0 1 10 km instabilities e g thomas et al 2008 mcwilliams 2016 at frontal regions have the following important consequences for the state of the upper ocean there is restratification that changes the local properties of the mixed layer and influences the upper ocean fluxes that are transmitted through the base of the mixed layer the vertical velocity is enhanced thereby promoting the exchange of heat nutrients and material across the surface layer there are unbalanced motions with o 1 values of rossby number ro l u fl where u is a characteristic horizontal velocity l is a characteristic horizontal length scale and f the coriolis parameter that link the rotationally controlled mesoscale to three dimensional turbulent motions the stratified rotating flow at a front is susceptible to various spontaneous unforced instabilities whose nonlinear evolution leads to multiscale dynamics which will be studied here the canonical eady model eady 1949 of an inviscid geostrophically balanced flow with uniform values for lateral buoyancy gradient m 2 b y buoyancy frequency n and coriolis parameter f is governed by two nondimensional parameters richardson number ri n 2 s 2 with n the buoyancy frequency and s m 2 f the vertical shear and the lateral buoyancy parameter m 2 f 2 the linear evolution is dominated by symmetric instability si when richardson number lies between 0 25 and 0 95 and by baroclinic instability bi when ri 0 95 as shown by stone 1966 the si mode has no along front variability wavenumber k 0 and the bi mode has no cross front variability wavenumber l 0 the slantwise currents that develop during si have vertical shear which becomes unstable to the kelvin helmholtz kh mode as demonstrated in the 2 d simulations of taylor and ferrari 2009 while 3 d simulations arobone and sarkar 2015 exhibit additional mixed modes k 0 l 0 before the kh instability develops bi has received much attention owing to its relation to the growth of deep mesoscale eddies in the strongly stratified interior of the ocean the weaker stratification of the mixed layer allows smaller scale shallower submesoscale eddies to develop through a version of the bi sometimes called the mixed layer instability mli that leads to a potent restratifying buoyancy flux e g boccaletti et al 2007 fox kemper et al 2008 in cases with initial ri between 0 25 and 0 95 si develops preferentially during the initial evolution but eventually ri increases to exceed 0 95 so that bi dominates e g haine and marshall 1998 fox kemper et al 2008 an important aspect of frontal evolution is frontogenesis hoskins and bretherton 1972 hoskins 1982 a process by which the width of a front decreases and there is an increase in horizontal buoyancy gradient vertical velocity and vertical vorticity frontogenesis is particularly strong near the surface lapeyre et al 2006 and spall 1995 suggests that large vertical velocity needed to subduct a fluid parcel to the bottom of the mixed layer can occur through frontogenesis simulations of model fronts e g mahadevan and tandon 2006 boccaletti et al 2007 fox kemper et al 2008 show that submesoscale processes in the surface layer are indeed effective in restratifying the front as is also found in regional scale models e g capet et al 2008a b that resolve the mesoscale submesoscale transition nonhydrostatic high resolution numerical models such as that in the present work are able to access the progression of frontal thinning to the scale of turbulent eddies where frontogenesis is arrested at these scales the dynamics is better described by turbulent thermal wind ttw balance rather than geostrophic balance gula et al 2014 mcwilliams et al 2015 mcwilliams 2016 wenegrat and mcphaden 2016 mcwilliams 2017 sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 our understanding of dynamics at the submesoscale that had progressed primarily by theoretical models and numerical experiments has recently benefited from lagrangian based observations d asaro et al 2018 in a surface drifter study in the northern gulf of mexico desoto canyon region found that some of the drifters cluster in a long thin sharpened front which then rolls up into a cyclonic eddy which is only few kilometers in diameter the drifters also reveal zipper structures where two sharpened fronts merge into one that wraps around the eddy the front and eddy are convergent and have large positive vertical vorticity with values that are particularly strong in the convergent zipper region measurement of vertical velocity by floats reveals downwelling in the convergent region with magnitude as large as 1 2 cm s 1 previously in another observational study performed in the northern gulf of mexico using a large number of surface drifters poje et al 2014 found energetic submesoscale turbulence that had considerable effect on the local dispersion in the submesoscale range in a novel two point synchronized measurement of velocity on two parallel tracks shcherbina et al 2013 found that the overall structure of the vertical vorticity on a horizontal plane is that of strands of strong cyclonic vorticity merged in the background of weak anticyclonic vorticity moreover large positive vertical vorticity was found to be correlated with large strain rate in the present work we explore submesoscale finescale dynamics during the evolution of si and bi in an unforced front our tool is high resolution nonhydrostatic modeling forcing by wind buoyancy and waves in frontal regions lead to additional processes that although of interest are not studied here baroclinic instabilities in the mixed layer are able to develop in the presence of wind surface waves and convection e g mahadevan et al 2010 hamlington et al 2014 callies and ferrari 2018 but their overall importance to vertical exchange lateral stirring and mixing depends on the strength of the forcing the increasing resolution and accuracy of recent 3 d non hydrostatic numerical models has enabled access to dynamics at the smallest submesoscales as well as the finescale turbulence as summarized below for unforced frontal problems skyllingstad and samelson 2012 simulated the evolution of bi in a warm filament double front configuration with lateral and along front periodicity that has Œ¥t 0 08 k across a front width l 1 2 km in a h 80 m deep mixed layer with an les model that was initially run at 6 m resolution with 8 h of surface cooling and then continued without forcing after interpolation on to a 3 m grid in fronts with finite width l in addition to m 0 2 f 2 m 0

evolves from its initial value m 0 in a finite width front there is another independent parameter the rossby number r o u o f l m 0 2 h f 2 l that is introduced by the initial horizontal shear the dimensional parameters given in skyllingstad and samelson 2012 lead to m 0 2 f 2 6 67 ro 0 44 the initially unstratified surface layer develops stratification with ri 2 after the surface cooling a major result of skyllingstad and samelson 2012 is that turbulence develops at isolated small scale features on the sharpening baroclinic wave instead of the classical picture of a continuous energy cascade through intermediate wavenumbers further analysis samelson and skyllingstad 2016 of the model results showed that frontogenesis leads to features with unstable vertical shear ri 0 25 where turbulence is found √∂zg√∂kmen et al 2011 conducted les of bi in a front that is 3 km wide and has a 80m deep mixed layer with a focus on drifter based sampling strategies they considered a ro 0 066

re 2 67 106 and a 2 m isotropic grid in a 4098 m 6146 m 130 m domain the preceding paragraph shows that our knowledge of submesoscale and turbulence dynamics in unforced fronts has progressed owing to the deployment of non hydrostatic 3 d numerical models however the relative contributions of the submesoscale and the finescale turbulence to vertical velocity vorticity dissipation and mixing requires further quantification and the interactions between the submesoscale and the turbulence require improved understanding in particular since turbulence is spatially localized by the coherent submesoscale structures a simple decomposition of the flow between a mean e g along front averaging and a fluctuation is inadequate to understand the interaction between the coherent structures that emerge and the finescale turbulence instead of frontal averaging we apply an explicit spatial filter to the simulation data that as will be demonstrated effectively separates the small scale resolved turbulence the finescale from the coherent submesoscale structures and helps characterize their different roles in vertical transport frontogenesis frontolysis dissipation and mixing the submesoscale finescale decomposition also enables separation of the balance equations between the individual ke components and a quantification local in physical space and nonlocal in wavenumber space of the submesoscale turbulence energy transfer that is better suited to the type of turbulence that develops in this problem the paper is structured as follows the setup of a model front and the numerical model is presented in section 2 section 3 describes the spatial filtering scheme used for separating the submesoscale from the finescale motions the frontal evolution under symmetric and baroclinic instabilities is summarized in section 4 the choice of the length scale for the submesoscale finescale decomposition is also explained section 5 describes the properties of the submesoscale and finescale fields with a focus on the vertical velocity and restratifying fluxes the kinetic energy in the individual submesoscale and finescale components and their transport equations are quantified in section 6 to better understand the energy pathways submesoscale frontogenesis by the finite amplitude baroclinic instability is investigated in section 7 by diagnosing the balance equation for the horizontal buoyancy gradient finally we conclude in section 8 with a summary of the results and discussion in the context of previous work 2 model setup the model consists of a density front that is geostrophically balanced by a surface jet in cartesian coordinates the front and the jet align with the x direction along front and the lateral cross front density variation is in the y direction the

domain is a rectangular box bounded by 0 x 4098 m 3073 m y 3073 m and 130 m z 0 a uniform grid with 2050 3074 66 points provides a grid resolution of 2 m in each direction the use of a fine grid resolution is needed in order to resolve the 3 d overturning motions associated with the vortex filaments that develop during the nonlinear evolution of bi the domain size is chosen to accommodate the growth of the most unstable baroclinic mode stone 1966 whose wavelength l b and the time scale œÑ b are 5 l b 2 œÄ h m 0 2 f 2 1 r i 5 2 œÑ b 54 5 1 r i f with the parameters used in the present study the chosen domain is large enough to accommodate at least two wavelengths of the most unstable baroclinic mode the simulations are run for about 100 h and are terminated when the coherent submesoscale eddies become comparable to the width of the front the boundary condition in the along front x direction is periodic free slip on the velocity and no flux on the temperature are used as the boundary conditions at the surface z 0 and side boundaries at the bottom boundary free slip is used for the velocity and a constant heat flux corresponding to the temperature gradient in the pycnocline is imposed sponge layers are employed at the lateral and bottom boundaries to prevent reflection of spurious waves the sponge layers at the lateral boundaries have a thickness of 64 m the sponge layer at the bottom boundary is 20 m thick the governing equations eq 2 are advanced in time using a mixed third order runge kutta for advective fluxes and crank nicolson for diffusive fluxes second order finite difference discretization is used to compute spatial derivatives the dynamic pressure is obtained by solving the poisson equation with a multi grid iterative method 3 separation into the submesoscale and the finescale the nonlinearly evolving frontal instabilities lead to three dimensional turbulence that is highly local and concentrated at the coherent structures skyllingstad and samelson 2012 stamper and taylor 2017 in order to understand how the three dimensional finescale interacts with the large scale flow a spatial filter is used to decompose the flow between finescale and submesoscale components in the physical space the submesoscale is obtained by applying a low pass spatial filter to the les field 2 2 this low pass filter is an additional explicit spatial filter that has a length scale that is much larger than the grid length scale which is the filter implicit in the les field here we discuss the filtering method and the transport equations for the submesoscale and the finescale the choice of the spatial filter length scale and the dynamics of the submesoscale are discussed later in section 5 the les field variable œï is decomposed into the submesoscale œï and the finescale œï as follows 6 œï œï œï the submesoscale is obtained by the spatial filtering defined as a convolution 7 œï x t g œï g r œï x r t d r where œï u v w p t is a les field variable g r is the filter kernel and r is a position vector measured relative to x the finescale component is obtained by subtracting the submesoscale component from the les field œï œï œï notice that is used to denote the finescale component and is reserved to denote the fluctuation œï œï œï x with respect to the reynolds average where the average is taken to be the along front average œï x 1 l x 0 l x œï x t d x in this study a two dimensional lanczos filter has been used in the horizontal plane the filter kernel in one dimension is given by 8 g 1 d Œ∂ sinc k c Œ∂ sinc k c Œ∂ a sinc k c Œ∂ sin k c Œ∂ k c Œ∂ where a is a non zero positive integer k c is a cutoff wavenumber and Œ∂ is the distance from the position where the filter is applied the extension of the filter kernel to two dimensions is straight forward and is given by 9 g 2 d Œ∂ Œ∑ g 1 d Œ∂ g 1 d Œ∑ where Œ∂ and Œ∑ are distances in the x and y directions respectively the lanczos filter provides the advantage of a sharp cut off in the wavenumber space this filter has been used in previous studies to separate the very large scale flow mesoscale from the submesoscale haza et al 2016 mensa et al 2013 to understand the dynamical consequences of the separation into the submesoscale and finescale it is useful to derive the equations that govern these individual components from the original eq 2 since the filter function is homogeneous continuity is satisfied at both scales i e 10 ≈´ j x j 0 u j x j 0 the momentum and temperature transport equations at the submesoscale become 11 ≈´ i t ≈´ i ≈´ j x

and q j r u j t u j t is the residual heat flux œÑ i j s g s and q i s g s are the model subgrid stress and heat flux respectively at the submesoscale after applying the additional lanczos filter at

the finescale contributions of the model subgrid stress and heat flux respectively 4 evolution of frontal instabilities the temporal evolution of the front under growing instabilities is summarized below before moving to the detailed analysis of the submesoscale and the finescale in the subsequent sections 4 1 symmetric instability the initial potential vorticity is negative at the simulated front fig 1c making the front unstable to symmetric instability si hoskins 1974 the evolution of si is characterized by the formation of convection cells in the perturbation velocity which are nearly aligned with the isopycnals taylor and ferrari 2009 figure 2 shows different stages of the si evolution convection cells are illustrated in fig 2 a by the bands of vertical velocity w with alternating positive and negative signs that are nearly aligned with the isotherms coincident with isopycnals here when the amplitude of si becomes sufficiently large it undergoes secondary kelvin helmholtz kh instability due to large vertical shear v z in the cells and kh billows form along the slanted isotherms taylor and ferrari 2009 subsequently the convection cells undergo an additional tertiary instability which appears as a lateral meandering in the x y plane with wavelength o 100 m relative to the direction in which the cells are aligned not shown here the tertiary instability enhances fluctuations in the cross front vorticity component œâ y and subsequently leads to the breakdown of the flow into 3 d turbulence in a process similar to that noted by arobone and sarkar 2015 that commences at ft 11 t 21 8 h in the present simulation the turbulent stage is illustrated by the broadband multiscale fluctuations of w in fig 2b there are patches of positive and negative w that are o 10 m in both horizontal and vertical directions the subsequent nonlinear evolution of si continues with the strengthening of overturns and w increasing up to 8 mm s 1 in magnitude the growth of si especially the non linear growth leads to restratification of the front the restratification is accompanied by the development of a secondary circulation in the y z plane that is associated with an overall negative light to heavy side cross front velocity v at the surface oppositely directed positive v below and associated upwelling and downwelling limbs figure 3 shows the temporal evolution of v averaged in the homogeneous along front x direction near the surface 10 m depth in fig 3a and near the bottom 40 m depth in fig 3b of the mixed layer although there is spatio temporal variability in v the behavior of v with increasing time indicates that the secondary circulation has overall v 0 at 10 m depth that transports warm water to the colder side of the front in contrast to the oppositely directed flow at 40 m depth with overall v 0 thus the secondary circulation setup by si restratifies the front and the flow becomes stable to si when pv becomes positive 4 2 baroclinic instability as the si subsides baroclinic instability bi emerges to modulate the remnant of si and eventually dominates the frontal instabilities the growth of the bi mode results in the onset of large scale meandering of the isotherms fig 4 a with wavelength comparable to that predicted by the linear theory frontogenesis occurs as can be identified by the tightening of the isotherms in fig 4a vertical vorticity plots fig 4c d show intensification of œâ z in the frontogenetic regions owing to locally enhanced horizontal shear the vertical shear increases as well following the increase in the lateral buoyancy gradient the frontogenetic regions eventually break down into turbulence through processes which will be quantified in later sections the development of finescale flow component in regions undergoing frontogenesis is evident from numerous small scale structures in fig 4 b d and from the enhanced subgrid viscosity in fig 4f which grows to become three orders of magnitude larger than the molecular viscosity the thin regions with concentrated œâ z at the front become elongated as bi grows and transform into vortex filaments fig 4d with lengths comparable to the wavelength of the dominant bi mode the vortex filaments often appear in pairs one coming from the heavier side of the front and another from the lighter side to join near the center line y 0 as the vortex filament pairs advect downstream they roll up and organize into vorticity patches i e the coherent submesoscale eddies in fig 4 b d two developing submesoscale eddies can be noted the overall sense of rotation in the eddies is cyclonic note that the cores of the submesoscale eddies are relatively colder i e heavier than the surrounding fluid due to entrainment of the cold water from the heavier side of the front after forming the submesoscale eddies continue to grow by the supply of vorticity from the filament structures by the end of the simulation the submesoscale eddies had grown to become 1 km in diameter comparable in size to the initial width of the front vertical vorticity is concentrated in the coherent structures i e the vortex filaments and the coherent submesoscale eddies the value of local rossby number r o œâ z f in the coherent structures is as large as 50 fig 4d shows œâ z f 15 15 for better visualization and suggests significant ageostrophy and loss of balance in these structures moreover the concentration of large subgrid viscosity fig 4f indicates strong turbulence in the coherent structures the ageostrophic regions develop large vertical velocity in fig 5 a w is plotted on a horizontal plane at 10 m depth its similarity with the œâ z field fig 4d is apparent with large w regions concentrated within the coherent structures the magnitude of w becomes as large as 0 02 m s 1 or about 0 35u 0 fig 5b shows w on a cross section whose vertical coordinate is the depth and horizontal coordinate is length s along a vortex filament the line l in fig 5a the w field fig 5b within the vortex filament reveals bands of positive and negative w with 20 m characteristic length scale the bi is effective in restratifying the front and the process is facilitated by an asc hoskins 1982 although large patches with coherent w especially upwelling can be identified in fig 5a the finescale of the eddies obscures the asc the probability density function pdf of w shows asymmetry for magnitudes greater than 2 mm s 1 in favor of downwelling motion not shown here however the corresponding probability of these large w regions is quite small and the presence of net downwelling motion in the coherent structures is not obvious indeed separation of the finescale from the submesoscale is necessary to clarify vertical transport as is done in section 5 the growth of bi modifies the frontal jet as can be seen from the velocity contours and vectors of fig 6 the width of the jet near the surface increases and it becomes more energized the initial range of u from 5 10 2 to 0 m s 1 expands with increasing time and notably includes positive u up to 2 10 2 m s 1 the cross front velocity v initially zero becomes as large as u clearly a considerable amount of kinetic energy is transferred to the swirling motion of the submesoscale eddies these eddies speed up the jet on the lighter side of the front and slow it down on the heavier side the eddies span the entire mixed layer depth and the modification of the jet below mid depth is relatively strong since the initial u is small relative to the surface in this paper we use the term front to denote the region where there is significant horizontal velocity gradient the largest density gradients are located mainly in the coherent structures and found to be confined within the front 4 3 a characteristic lateral dimension for the spatially coherent finescale flow visualization shows formation of thin filament structures due to frontogenesis as bi evolves interrogation of the velocity and temperature fields in physical space reveals a characteristic lateral dimension of o 100 m for the spatially coherent finescale that is associated with the vortex filaments the o 100 m scale of frontal arrest also has an imprint on the spectra the power spectra of the along front velocity u cross front velocity v and vertical velocity w at 20 m depth are shown in fig 7 the spectra are computed as follows 13 s u k 1 2 √ª k 2 y s v k 1 2 v k 2 y s w k 1 2 ≈µ k 2 y where k is the wavenumber in the along front direction the caret denotes the fourier transform and y denotes averaging in the lateral y direction over all computational grid lines between 1 2 y 1 2 km the spectra fig 7 show qualitative changes with increasing k at low k the kinetic energy in the vertical motion is much smaller than the energy in the horizontal motions indicating a predominantly two dimensional flow at these scales whereas at higher k the energy in the vertical motion becomes comparable to those in the horizontal motions indicating three dimensional turbulence the spectra s u and s v of the horizontal velocity components also change from a steeper slope to a slope closer to k 5 3 at k corresponding to o 100 m a choice needs to be made for k c the cutoff wavenumber of the filter that determines the split between submesoscale and finescale from the preceding discussion k c corresponds to o 100 m table 1 shows the kinetic energy content e in wavenumber k k c and the distribution of e among the three velocity components for different choices of k c the table shows an increase in the relative contribution of the vertical motion e w with increasing k c at the value k c 0 04 rad m 1 chosen for the decomposition e w becomes more than 20 and further increase of k c leads to relatively gradual change in e w a posteriori we find that our choice of k c leads to a good separation of the submesoscale dynamics from the turbulent finescale a computational restriction is worth noting it is clear that the coherent structures also introduce an important length scale to the problem the width of the filament which is much smaller o 100 m compared to the wavelength of the baroclinic instability mode this length scale restricts the horizontal grid size of submesoscale eddy resolving simulations to be at least o 100 m and of turbulence resolving simulations to o 10 m or less 5 submesoscale the classical decomposition of the flow between an along front mean and a fluctuation is not adequate to understand the role of the coherent submesoscale and its interaction with 3 d turbulence the mean flow computed by averaging the flow in the along front direction would overlook the spatio temporal coherence of the submesoscale as well as its imprint on the finescale here the finescale is separated from the large scale flow by using a low pass filter a two dimensional lanczos filter eq 9 with a 2 and k c 0 04 rad m 1 the lanczos filter successfully extracts the coherent structures as will be shown while providing a sharp cutoff in the wavenumber space structures with k k c are removed while the energy content of the larger structures remains largely unaffected the value of the cutoff wavenumber k c is motivated by the change in flow anisotropy quasi 2d to 3d motions and spectral slopes observed at o 100 m that was discussed in section 4 3 the overall performance of the filter in separating the scales is assessed by the visualization of fig 8 where submesoscale fields denoted by and finescale components denoted by are shown on a horizontal plane qualitatively the filter provides a good representation of the finescale in the flow while preserving the large scale flow features it is clear that there is considerable energy corresponding to the swirling flow that is spread across the submesoscale while the finescale is localized 5 1 vertical transport the front develops large vertical velocities as was shown by fig 5 and the accompanying discussion however the w field does not show distinct regions where upwelling and downwelling motions occur the underlying structure of the vertical transport can be better understood using the submesoscale component of w in fig 8c the submesoscale vertical velocity w is plotted at 10 m depth the w field reveals large patches with predominantly positive and negative values separating regions with upwelling and downwelling motions the downwelling motion as will be shown subsequently transports high density fluid to the interior the organization of the patches with w 0 and w 0 is connected to the coherent structures negative vertical velocity is concentrated along the filaments and the magnitude is relatively stronger in regions where filaments curve into the coherent eddies the solid black contours of w 0 1 m m s 1 estimate the edges of the w 0 regions on the other hand the upwelling regions w 0 are spatially extensive and occupy a much larger frontal area relative to w 0 regions in fig 8c w 0 regions are identified by the black dash dot lines corresponding to w 0 1 m m s 1 thus at the submesoscale the regions with positive and negative vertical velocities become separated exposing the underlying structure of the upwelling and downwelling motions similarly at the submesoscale regions of positive and negative vertical vorticity are well separated fig 8g the figure shows that œâ z is positive cyclonic in the filament structures and in the coherent eddies and has magnitude of 5 7f negative œâ z reaches only 1 2f in magnitude the finescale vorticity œâ z has large magnitude up to 50f which unlike the submesoscale is comparable for both negative and positive components the intertwined positive and negative œâ z values cancel out in the finescale and it is the submesoscale vorticity that dictates the rotation of the turbulent filament structure as it rolls up anticlockwise to form a cyclonic eddy we now take a deeper look into downwelling and upwelling motions through the following decomposition of w w w w w 0 w 0 w 0 w 0 w 0 w 0 thus w represents the negative part of w while w represents the positive part including w 0 the frontal averages of the vertical velocity and the temperature are plotted in fig 9 the average has been calculated over the region most influenced by bi the entire along front length l x and 1 2 y 1 2 km across the front the vertical profiles of fig 9 a show that w x y and w x y are nearly equal in magnitude but opposite in sign the difference in magnitudes is at least one two orders smaller than either in conformity with the continuity requirement at the submesoscale both w x y and w x y which are zero near the surface due to the no penetration boundary condition increase to their maximum values at the depth of 20 m and then decrease with increasing depth however they do not become zero at the mixed layer depth h 50 m the non zero w in the thermocline is due to internal waves and found to have a different spatial structure than that in the mixed layer the overall upwelling and downwelling transport in the mixed layer is dominated by the submesoscale component w fig 9b shows averages of the finescale conditioned on the sign of the submesoscale w in the region with w 0 the net effect of the finescale is downwelling average of w in that region is negative and in the region with w 0 the net effect is upwelling the vertical upwelling and downwelling due to w of the finescale fig 9b is found to be much smaller at least 7 8 times smaller than those by the submesoscale velocity therefore measurement of the submesoscale vertical velocity is sufficient to obtain the net upwelling downwelling the instability correlates temperature density with the vertical velocity fig 9c shows profiles of averaged t conditioned on the sign of w in the regions with positive negative w the conditional mean of temperature is higher lower than the total average thus the submesoscale motions transport high density low t fluid near the surface to the interior of the mixed layer and consequently the front restratifies the correlation not plotted between the density and the vertical velocity is negative indicating the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy comparison of the œâ z and w fields in fig 8 shows a correspondence between the regions with strong positive œâ z and negative w it is tempting to use œâ z 0 as a predictor of downwelling however the computed correlation between œâ z and w is small also the vertical downwelling w computed by conditioning on positive œâ z is found to be substantially smaller than the net w at the front the reason is that the eddy core with positive œâ z has a substantial area of upwelling not downwelling the downwelling and upwelling motions at the front can be considered as parts of an ageostrophic secondary circulation asc in simplified models of fronts where the along front variation is averaged or neglected the asc is a restratifying 2 d y z circulation that is anticlockwise looking in the direction of the jet the asc transports near surface water from the light y 0 to the heavy y 0 side while dense water subducts from the heavy side and moves toward the light side at depth the asc which develops during the evolution of bi is in fact 3 d owing to the along front variability associated with the coherent submesoscale the along front variability of the y z circulation is depicted in fig 10 by contrasting the circulation among three y z cuts whose intersections with z 10 are marked as s1 s2 and s3 in fig 8 of a submesoscale eddy if we define back to front of the eddy to be in the direction negative x of the average jet velocity s3 is at the back s2 is near the center and s1 is at the front of the eddy note that consistent with the anticlockwise x y circulation of the submesoscale eddy surface water is transported in the y direction at s1 fig 10 a and y direction at s3 fig 10c the y z circulation at s1 fig 10 a shows that there is downwelling in the filament 700 y 600 m and predominantly upwelling in the eddying region 300 y 500 m on the other hand the circulation at s3 fig 10c shows substantial downward motion s2 fig 10b is a y z section through the eddy core within the eddy the temperature contours at the bottom of the mixed layer and in the vicinity of y 0 indicate isopycnal doming under the influence of low pressure and the fluid has radially outward horizontal velocity at s2 there is both upwelling and downwelling with the former in the eddy core and the latter at the back of the eddy to summarize the organization of the secondary circulation in the y z plane is associated with the coherent structures at the front with upwelling dominant in the forward and central regions of the submesoscale eddy and downwelling in the aft regions and the filaments 5 2 3d structure of the coherent submesoscale the downwelling of high density water and the upwelling of low density water are three dimensional processes each dominating in different parts of the front and mediated by the coherent structures the three dimensionality of the coherent structure helps shed light on the vertical exchange here the coherent structure is extracted using the q criterion defined as 14 q 1 2 œâ i j 2 s i j 2 œâ i j 1 2 ≈´ i x j ≈´ j x i s i j 1 2 ≈´ i x j ≈´ j x i where œâ i j and s i j are the rotation and strain tensors of the submesoscale respectively q 0 signifies rotation dominated flow while q 0 signifies the domination of strain iso surfaces of q fig 11 show that the coherent structures consist of both rotation and strain dominated regions which are organized in layers around the coherent submesoscale eddies it can also be noted that the filament structure at the heavier side y 0 of the front is shallow at its origin and its depth of influence increases as one moves along this structure toward the eddy very close to the eddy and in the region surrounding the eddy the filaments influence the whole of the mixed layer the filamentary structures at the lighter side y 0 of the front seem to affect the entire mixed layer depth thus the separation of scales of motion into the submesoscale and the finescale provides a better understanding of the vertical velocity organization and the vertical transport at the baroclinic frontal instability the submesoscale vertical velocity field shows well separated regions where either negative or positive w dominates moreover the vertical velocity field is connected to the coherent structures strong downwelling motions develop at vortex filaments and in some portions of the submesoscale eddies that adjoin the filaments 6 kinetic energy of the submesoscale and the finescale in this section we assess the relative contributions of the submesoscale and the finescale to the kinetic energy quantify the dominant balances in the transport equations eqs 11 and 12 for the submesoscale and finescale respectively and make explicit the interaction between turbulence the finescale and the submesoscale the submesoscale velocity as defined here includes the along front x average which at t 0 is the velocity of the initially balanced geostrophic jet in order to focus on the fluctuations we subtract the along front average before computing the ke and contrast the evolution of the overall volume averaged fluctuation energy in the submesoscale and the finescale components in fig 12 initially the mean ke dominates and the ke of the small amplitude broadband fluctuations introduced at t 0 resides mainly in the finescale figure 12 shows that both submesoscale and finescale ke increase during the growth of si when the instability becomes nonlinear at t 15 h the finescale ke saturates but the submesoscale ke keeps increasing at t 40 h the submesoscale ke overtakes the finescale ke the subsequent evolution is dominated by bi which increases the submesoscale ke until it finally saturates at a value comparable to the mean ke although the volume averaged ke of the finescale in the frontal region does not change significantly during the evolution of bi there is substantial spatio temporal variability as the finescale concentrated in the coherent filament structures and eddies interacts with the submesoscale how the submesoscale and finescale flows evolve and interact is investigated here by studying the ke budgets at the two scales an outstanding question is what is the source of the finescale ke that counteracts its dissipation the submesoscale ke equation derived by multiplying eq 11 with ≈´ i is given by 15 t u i u i 2 t j x j b e e s g s e r where t j is the transport term 16 t j ≈´ j ≈´ i ≈´ i 2 ≈´ j p œÅ 0 ŒΩ x j ≈´ i ≈´ i 2 ≈´ i œÑ i j s g s œÑ i j r b Œ± t w g is the submesoscale buoyancy production term e ŒΩ u i x j 2 is the molecular dissipation and e s g s œÑ i j s g s u i x j is the dissipation corresponding to the subgrid stresses the term e r œÑ i j r u i x j that arises from the effect of the submesoscale velocity gradient on the residual stresses will be shown later to act as a loss of submesoscale ke note that the residual stress œÑ i j r u i u j u i u j which arises from the submesoscale finescale decomposition is explicitly computed after applying the lanczos filter and is different from the subgrid stress œÑ i j s g s which is modeled in the les approach similar to the ke budget at the submesoscale the ke budget at the resolved finescale can be derived by multiplying eq 12 with u i the ke transport equation at the finescale is given by 17 t u i u i 2 t j x j t r b e e s g s e r where t j is the transport term 18 t j ≈´ j u i u i 2 u j u i u i 2 p u j œÅ 0 ŒΩ x j u i u i 2 u i œÑ i j s g s œÑ i j r t r u i u j ≈´ i x j is the transfer term that represents the action of submesoscale velocity gradients including shear on the finescale b Œ±t w g is the finescale buoyancy production and e ŒΩ u i x j 2 and e s g s œÑ i j s g s u i x j are the dissipation of finescale ke due to molecular viscosity and subgrid stresses respectively e r œÑ i j r u i x j term arises from the interaction of the residual stresses with the finescale velocity gradient it will be shown later to act as a production term for the finescale ke the dominant terms of submesoscale and finescale ke budgets are frontally averaged i e over the entire along front direction and 1 5 y 1 5 km in the cross front direction and the vertical profiles of the frontal averages are plotted in fig 13 in the following we first discuss terms in the submesoscale ke balance and then the finescale ke budget the submesoscale ke can change due to the buoyancy term b and the dissipation terms namely e e s g s and e r the transport term t represents the transfer of ke between different spatial regions by various processes such as advection pressure work and the work by various stresses molecular subgrid and residual the dominant terms of the submesoscale ke budget eq 16 are plotted in fig 13a as a function of depth at t 79 7 h fig 13a shows that the buoyancy production b is the main source of submesoscale ke in the mixed layer that extends to 50 m depth b represents conversion into ke of the available potential energy associated with the horizontal buoyancy jump across the front below the mixed layer the buoyancy term is negative in the bulk of the mixed layer except for the near surface region from z 0 to approximately 10 m depth the buoyancy production is balanced mainly by the pressure transport computed as ≈´ j œÅ 0 p x j the pressure transport redistributes energy from the 10 40 m depth to both the near surface region and to the region below 40 m depth we find that b is approximately balanced by w œÅ 0 p z over the domain this suggests that the overall horizontally averaged over the front submesoscale is in approximate hydrostatic balance for this moderate strength front the dissipation terms are also plotted in fig 13a the dissipation due to molecular viscosity is relatively small and only the contributions from e s g s and e r are shown the figure shows that both terms are significant in the near surface region above 10 m and have negative values which indicates removal of submesoscale ke note that e s g s is negative everywhere and represents dissipation of submesoscale ke by the les subgrid model on the other hand e r can be either positive or negative and represents exchange of ke between the submesoscale and finescale the role of e r in this exchange can be readily noticed by expressing œÑ i j r in the galilean invariant components as suggested by germano 1986 œÑ i j r l i j o c i j o r i j o where l i j o u i u j u i u j is the leonard stresses c i j o u i u j u i u j u i u j u i u j are the cross stresses and r i j o u i u j u i u j are reynolds stresses consequently corresponding to stresses r i j o u i u j the term t r u i u j u i x j appears which is similar to the transfer term tr in the finescale kinetic energy budget the frontal average of e r however is negative and indicates a net transfer of energy to the finescale in the near surface region transport by the subgrid stresses œÑ i j s g s and residual stresses œÑ i j r are also important the frontal averages of the transports by subgrid and residual stresses are negative and tend to remove the excess energy generated by the significantly large pressure transport in the region the dominant terms of the finescale ke budget are plotted in fig 13b the transfer term tr acts as the main source of finescale ke tr is split into two parts following sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 tr h with all the terms containing horizontal gradients of the submesoscale velocity and tr v with all the terms containing the vertical gradients of the submesoscale velocity thus 19 t r h u 1 u 1 ≈´ 1 x 1 u 1 u 2 ≈´ 1 x 2 u 2 u 1 ≈´ 2 x 1 u 2 u 2 ≈´ 2 x 2 u 3 u 1 ≈´ 3 x 1 u 3 u 2 ≈´ 3 x 2 t r v u 1 u 3 ≈´ 1 x 3 u 2 u 3 ≈´ 2 x 3 u 3 u 3 ≈´ 3 x 3 figure 13b shows that in the near surface region approximately top 10 m of the mixed layer tr h is large in magnitude relative to tr v however further below the free surface tr v is the dominant source term below the mixed layer the transfer terms tr h and tr v are small it can also be observed that below the near surface region tr v and the subgrid dissipation e s g s are the dominant terms and approximately balance each other the velocity gradient tensor ≈´ i x j in the transfer tr between the submesoscale and the finescale has components that can be related to either shear off diagonal terms or strain diagonal terms in the flow the relative importance of the shear and strain components to tr is further explored in fig 14 where front averaged profiles of each component are plotted as a function of depth clearly tr is strongly influenced by t r 11 u 1 u 1 ≈´ 1 x 1 part of tr h and t r 13 u 1 u 3 ≈´ 1 x 3 part of tr v with the former related to horizontal strain and the latter to vertical shear in the top 6 m tr 11 dominates pointing to the importance of the horizontal compressive strain associated with frontogenesis to the enhancement of turbulence below 10 m vertical shear ≈´ 1 x 3 and additionally ≈´ 2 x 3 is important interestingly the frontal mean of t r 12 u 1 u 2 ≈´ 1 x 2 is negative this reverse energy transfer to horizontal eddying motions in physical space is consistent with the notion that in this flow finescale turbulence is organized into the coherent submesoscale in addition to the usual downscale energy transfer to turbulence the sum of all the components of tr is positive i e overall the submesoscale gradients act as a source of the finescale ke among gradients of the vertical velocity only t r 33 u 3 u 3 ≈´ 3 x 3 involving vertical strain is significant however it is smaller than the dominant term tr 13 in addition to tr e r is another dominant source of the finescale kinetic energy mainly near the surface e r represents the interaction of the residual stress with the finescale shear there is only a partial balance between the production of the kinetic energy and dissipation by the subgrid stresses e s g s in this region transport by both the submesoscale and finescale velocity fields is significant and removes energy from the layer the horizontal organization of selected terms that appear in the kinetic energy balance are shown in fig 15 at 10 m depth the local value of submesoscale buoyancy production b fig 15b has both positive regions primarily in the filaments and negative regions primarily in the eddy cores however the horizontal average of b is positive fig 13a and indicates restratification accompanied by the conversion of potential energy in the lateral stratification to submesoscale ke the resemblance between the horizontal structures of submesoscale ke and buoyancy production is apparent in fig 15 a b further reinforcing the importance of b for the submesoscale ke the dissipation of the finescale fig 15c is concentrated in the vortex filaments again pointing to the spatially localized coherent organization of dissipative turbulence in this problem the dominant terms that transfer energy from the submesoscale to the finescale owing to horizontal strain fig 15d and vertical shear fig 15e are also localized in the vortex filaments the gradient richardson number ri g based on vertical shear and stratification of the submesoscale is plotted in fig 15f the regions with subcritical ri g 0 25 are within those where tr 13 is large thus local shear instability is a driver of turbulence at this location 7 frontogenesis the formation of coherent structures i e the vortex filaments and the coherent submesoscale eddies show frontogenesis notably large increase in m 2 f 2 from its initial value the role of the coherent structures in vertical transport was addressed in section 5 in this section the focus is on the processes that are responsible for frontogenesis and those which counteract to balance it we investigate the time rate of change of horizontal buoyancy gradient at the submesoscale h b where h x i y j and i and j are unit vectors in x and y directions respectively e g capet et al 2008b it can be noted that buoyancy is directly related to the temperature deviation b gŒ±t in particular the following dynamical equation is quantified 20 1 2 d d t h b 2 h b q s q w q d h q d v f s f w f d h f d v in the above equation q s and q w denote contributions due to advection by the submesoscale and are given by 21 q s x ≈´ x b x v y b y ≈´ x b y v y b q w x w z b y w z b thus q s corresponds to the straining of the buoyancy field by horizontal motion and q w is an analogous term related to vertical motion the contributions from diabatic processes molecular diffusion and subgrid and residual fluxes are included in q dh and q dv between the two q dh is associated with the horizontal diabatic processes and q dv is associated with the vertical diabatic processes 22 q d h h h Œ∫ h b g Œ± h q h s g s q h r q d v h z Œ∫ z b g Œ± z q v s g s q v r the forcing terms on the right hand side of eq 20 f i where i s w dh dv are obtained by taking the dot product of h b with appropriate q terms in figs 16 and 17 the forcing terms are plotted at depths 10 m and 30 m respectively near the surface f s is predominantly positive in the vortex filaments and is frontogenetic whereas f w is predominantly negative and is frontolytic on the other hand f dh and f dv are both frontogenetic and frontolytic in these regions f dh being frontolytic in the center and frontogenetic at the edges while f dv being frontogenetic at the center and frontolytic at the edges near the mid depth at 30 m the forcing terms f s and f w have both positive and negative values relatively more interspersed at the front the magnitudes of the forcing terms f s and f w as well as f dh and f dv are much smaller compared to those near the surface a qualitative balance between f s and f w and that between f dh and f dv can be observed at both depths the vertical profiles of frontal averaged 0 x l x and 1 2 y 1 2 km forcing terms are shown in fig 18 three distinct regions can be identified upper intermediate and bottom regions in the upper near surface region above 10 m depth f s is balanced by both f w and f dh however very close to the surface f w goes to zero and the balance is provided only by f dh the balance between f s and f dh is partial at the surface i e the frontal averaged value of h b 2 continues to increase with time because the length of the thin o 100 m wide frontal regions continues to increase as bi proceeds in the intermediate region between 10 40 m depth there is a dominant balance between f s and f w f s is predominantly frontogenetic and f w is predominantly frontolytic this can also be observed in figs 16 and 17 finally near the bottom between 40 60 m depth there is relatively weak frontogenesis that arises from f w in all the three regions the frontal averaged f dv is small the balance of the frontal averaged buoyancy gradient described above corresponds to t 79 7 h and reflects the behavior during the time the coherent eddies grow before the growth of bi the forcing terms f i xy remain small as bi starts growing at t 40 h f i begin to develop near the surface when the eddies form and grow f i xy become significantly large fig 18 during this period the submesoscale ke also grows afterwards when the submesoscale ke saturates at t 100 h f i xy remain significant only in the upper region in the intermediate and bottom regions the magnitudes of frontal averaged forcing terms become small 8 discussion and conclusions the spin down of a mixed layer front is studied using a large eddy simulation les model the front of width 1 2 km is initially in geostrophic balance has a moderate rossby number of 0 32 and is confined to a weakly stratified ri 0 26 mixed layer of thickness 50 m that lies above a strongly stratified thermocline the non hydrostatic boussinesq navier stokes equations are numerically solved on a turbulence resolving isotropic grid that discretizes a domain that is 4098 m in the along front 6146 m in the cross front and 130 m in the vertical with resolution of 2 m in all three coordinate directions the high resolution les enables us to simulate submesoscale eddies three dimensional turbulence and their interaction the initial configuration with ri 0 26 is such that the potential vorticity is negative over the front making it unstable to symmetric instability si that then develops secondary kh instability taylor and ferrari 2009 and three dimensional turbulence arobone and sarkar 2015 although si grows initially the baroclinic instability bi soon becomes the dominant mode as ri increases to beyond 0 95 during restratification of the front haine and marshall 1998 fox kemper et al 2008 the growth of bi is frontogenetic hoskins 1982 and results in the formation of thin vortex filaments at the front furthermore long vortex filaments comparable in length to that of the wavelength of the dominant bi mode roll up to produce coherent submesoscale eddies these coherent structures are localized in space and characterized by large values of strain rate vorticity and density gradient the local rossby number in these structures is o 10 indicating local loss of rotational control previous studies of the mixed layer instability with turbulence resolving simulations e g skyllingstad and samelson 2012 stamper and taylor 2017 have found vortex filaments submesoscale eddies and turbulence during the flow evolution in the present simulation of an isolated unforced front the turbulence that develops during bi occurs in localized regions at the sharpening filament structure similar to skyllingstad and samelson 2012 who simulated the evolution of a warm filament double front configuration with lateral periodicity given the sparseness and locality in physical space of the turbulence that develops in this problem we are motivated to examine scale interactions in physical space rather than the classical wavenumber based approach employed by skyllingstad and samelson 2012 therefore unlike previous studies of the mixed layer instability we decompose the flow into a submesoscale field and a finescale field in physical space describe the properties of these two fields and quantify their interaction the classical decomposition into an overall frontal average and a fluctuation would obscure the coherent submesoscale structures and prevent us from elucidating their important role in frontal dynamics the present decomposition enables the direct quantification of how the coherent submesoscale contributes to processes such as transfer of mass momentum and buoyancy to the bottom of the mixed layer and the interaction between the mixed layer and the pycnocline a low pass lanczos spatial filter is used to decompose a given flow variable œï into the sum of a submesoscale component œï and a finescale component œï our finding of a change of kinetic energy spectrum slope and flow anisotropy at o 100 m length scale guides the choice of filter scale as o 100 m we find that the submesoscale component e g left column of fig 8 represents the coherent structures that emerge during the evolution of the mixed layer instability and are distributed throughout the frontal region the finescale component e g right column of fig 8 represents small scale turbulence that is spatially organized and concentrated in filamentary regions where the submesoscale field has large spatial gradients an important feature of submesoscale dynamics in frontal regions is the associated increase in vertical transport the present simulation shows that w exceeds 0 005 m s 1 in several regions and becomes as large as 0 02 m s 1 within vortex filaments regions of positive and negative w are interspersed it is the decomposition of w into the submesoscale w and the finescale w that allows us to separate upwelling from downwelling regions downwelling by w is concentrated at the filaments that curve into the submesoscale vortices while upwelling occurs over more spatially extensive regions in and around these vortices the associated buoyancy flux is restratifying although the instantaneous magnitude of w has an order of magnitude large peak relative to w the additional net contribution by the finescale to the overall transport is small an examination of the submesoscale velocity over y z cross sections at different x along front locations shows significant along front variability thus the secondary ageostrophic circulation taken to be two dimensional in simplified along front averaged models is three dimensional owing to the action of the filaments and vortices in the flow we define back to forward direction as aligned with the jet velocity negative x direction heavier fluid with downwelling velocity is found in the filament structure in the back regions of the eddies while the lighter fluid with upwelling velocity is found in the forward regions the coherent structures have enhanced relative vorticity cold filaments with denser fluid have concentrated positive submesoscale œâ z and roll up into cyclonic submesoscale vortices with vorticity as large as œâ z f 5 in the surface layer similar to the simulations of gula et al 2015 with 150 m horizontal resolution the finescale vorticity œâ z is an order of magnitude larger and is concentrated in the thin filaments the finescale kinetic energy ke is found to increase rapidly during the initial 20 h when si is active and then its frontal average saturates although the local spatio temporal variability is substantial the submesoscale ke continues to increase after 20 h when si becomes nonlinear however the bulk of the increase occurs during bi the turbulent finescale is dissipative and an outstanding question is what maintains the energy of the finescale to answer this question and have a better understanding of the energy pathways to and between the two components we evaluate the ke transport equations separately for the submesoscale and finescale and report vertical profiles of horizontally averaged terms at a late time t 79 7 h during the bi evolution with regards to the submesoscale ke the buoyancy production term which is significant between 10 m and the mixed layer base acts as the main source the pressure transport term redistributes ke spatially from lower in the mixed layer to the 10 m near surface region both the residual stress explicitly computed from the flow field as œÑ i j r u i u j u i u j and the subgrid stress modeled act to dissipate submesoscale ke the dissipation e r by residual stress is larger than the dissipation by subgrid stress e s g s by a factor of about 2 direct molecular dissipation is negligible at the o 100 m scale of the submesoscale the finescale ke is found to be primarily delivered by the transfer term t r u i u j ≈´ i x j which represents the interaction of the finescale with the submesoscale velocity gradients the transfer term tr is further decomposed into tr h which involves horizontal gradients and tr v as in several of the other diagnostics the near surface upper 10 m layer is qualitatively different in that tr h tr 11 is the primary source of finescale ke in contrast to the remainder of the mixed layer where it is tr v tr 13 that dominates the buoyancy flux has a negligible contribution to the ke balance this is in contrast to the submesoscale where it is the buoyancy flux which energizes the submesoscale ke the production of finescale ke by the residual stress œÑ i j r is an important contributor to the budget only in the top 10 m in the present study horizontal strain u x and vertical shear u z of the submesoscale velocity field act as dominant production terms of finescale kinetic energy at different depths in particular in the 6 m near surface region it is the horizontal strain which dominates the transfer while in the remainder of the mixed layer the transfer is mediated by the vertical shear sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 simulated the evolution of a cold dense filament in a background of strong ocean boundary layer obl turbulence bi did not emerge in the mixed layer but there was frontogenesis by the ageostrophic circulation instigated by obl turbulence leading to frontal turbulence they found that in the down front wind case and no wind surface cooling case the horizontal shear was the dominant production term for the tke while in the cross front wind case it was the vertical shear thus there are qualitative differences in frontal turbulence generation between a front undergoing bi with subsequent submesoscale meanders and vortices as in the present case and a front that develops in a pre existing field of strong obl turbulence without exhibiting bi during the evolution of bi horizontal currents u v develop strong variability in the horizontal x y that locally sharpen the front and intensify the buoyancy gradient h b the terms in the balance equation for the square of h b are diagnosed to better understand the frontogenetic mechanisms instantaneous visualizations at 10 m depth shows active frontogenesis by f s which involves horizontal gradients of horizontal velocity mainly at the filaments while f w which involves horizontal gradients of vertical velocity acts to counteract frontogenesis instantaneously the diabatic diffusive terms act to both increase and decrease the local buoyancy gradient an overall picture of the diabatic term emerges after performing horizontal averages in the frontal region horizontal diffusion both resolved and subgrid is the primary process in the upper 10 m that counteracts frontogenesis by f s in the remainder of the mixed layer it is primarily f w which involves horizontal gradients of vertical velocity that counteracts frontogenesis by f s capet et al 2008b in their analysis of frontogenesis during mesoscale submesoscale transition in a simulation with 750 m horizontal resolution found that f dv vertical diffusion modeled by k profile parametrization kpp was the primary term in the model counteracting f s horizontal diffusion f dh could not be calculated separately because it was implicit in the horizontal advection and the horizontal grid resolution was insufficient in the present 2 m resolution les the front thins to o 100 m we find that the contribution from horizontal diffusion f dh calculated explicitly here counteracts frontogenesis by f s in the near surface layer and thus plays an important role in limiting the width of the frontogenetic region in cold filaments that evolve in a turbulent boundary layer surface frontogenesis results from the secondary circulation that occurs under the turbulent thermal wind ttw condition mcwilliams et al 2015 sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 frontal sharpening proceeded to the grid scale of o 10 m in the 2 d numerical simulations mcwilliams et al 2015 that were conducted with the k profile parametrization kpp of vertical mixing while sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 found that frontogenesis was arrested at o 100 m by shear driven turbulence in a simulation that resolved the turbulent boundary layer bi is excluded in the 2 d model of mcwilliams et al 2015 whereas in the model of sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 the filament evolution process is fast and bi remains unimportant during this period although different from the bi driven frontogenesis and localized turbulence of the present study the arrest scale of frontogenesis observed by sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 is close to the value of o 100 m obtained in the present study it is worth noting that features sharper than o 100 m can form in fronts for example pham and sarkar 2018 in their study of a strong front with large m 2 f 2 find sharpening down to o 10 m that precedes the release of a gravity current although the submesoscale dynamics is studied here for a model front without any external influences it exhibits processes which are also observed in the real ocean the study of d asaro et al 2018 using satellite tracked surface drifters in the northern gulf of mexico revealed sharpened fronts which wrap into cyclonic eddies a process that is resembled by the rolling up of the filament structures into cyclonic eddies in the present study the zipper structures which form when two filaments combine into one as they wrap into the eddy are similar to the joining of filaments structures from opposite sides of the front seen here moreover the positive cyclonic vertical vorticity and downwelling at the front as well as their enhanced magnitudes in the convergent zipper region found by d asaro et al 2018 are features that occur in the submesoscale dynamics of the present study similar to the asymmetry in the distribution of the positive and negative vertical vorticity observed in the study of shcherbina et al 2013 we find in the simulation that the anticyconic vertical vorticity is weaker œâ z 1 2f and spatially more extensive than the cyclonic vertical vorticity œâ z 5f that is concentrated in thin filaments furthermore the large strain rate and positive vertical vorticity at the submesoscale are correlated in the simulation both of these properties are characteristic of the filaments the present study underlines the importance of coherent structures i e vortex filaments and coherent submesoscale eddies in the dynamics of the spindown of an unforced front in a mixed layer by elucidating their role in vertical transport frontogenesis and maintenance of fine scale turbulence the analysis was based on eulerian statistics and in future work we hope to shed further light on subduction and mixing by lagrangian tracer analysis surface forcing by wind buoyancy and waves introduces additional complexities into the evolution of the baroclinic instability as has been shown by several recent numerical studies e g mahadevan et al 2010 hamlington et al 2014 whitt and taylor 2017 callies and ferrari 2018 cooling at the surface can compete with the restratifying buoyancy flux generated by bi a downfront wind can create negative buoyancy flux counter restratification and inhibit bi and langmuir turbulence generated by the interaction between the stokes drift by surface waves and the wind can inject kinetic energy directly at small scales and enhance mixing at the front in several numerical models bi is found to grow albeit modified by the forcing and somewhat surprisingly even after the submesoscale is exposed to a storm in the study by whitt and taylor 2017 as discussed previously in this section observational studies reveal submesoscale features and dynamics similar to the findings in the present unforced simulation the net effect of the external forcing on submesoscale processes is dependent on the specifics of the problem and the strength of the forcing it will be of interest to systematically study how the submesoscale finescale properties and their mutual interaction change when other processes influence the mixed layer instability acknowledgments we are pleased to

24023,the spindown of a geostrophically balanced density front in an upper ocean mixed layer is simulated with a large eddy simulation les model that resolves o 1000 m down to o 1 m scale our goal is to examine the interaction between the submesoscale and the turbulent finescale and another related goal is to use the turbulence resolving simulation to better characterize vertical transport frontogenesis and dissipative processes the flow passes through symmetric and baroclinic instabilities spawns vortex filaments of o 100 m thickness as well as larger eddies with cross front velocity as large as the along front velocity and develops turbulence that is spatially localized and organized a o 100 m physical space filter is applied to the simulated flow so that the coherent submesoscale is separated from the finescale in a decomposition that preserves the spatial organization of the flow unlike the typical practice of a split into a frontal average and a fluctuation that obscures the coherent submesoscale the energy spectrum exhibits a change of slope at o 100 m with an approximately 5 3 slope over a subrange of the finescale analysis of the submesoscale vertical velocity as large as 5mm s in the upper layer of the front reveals that downwelling is limited to the thin vortex filaments and the junction of the submesoscale eddies with these filaments while upwelling occurs over spatially extensive regions in the eddies conditional averaging shows that heavier lighter fluid is preferentially downwelled upwelled by these coherent submesoscale structures leading to an overall buoyancy flux that is restratifying the submesoscale is unbalanced with local rossby number as large as 5 the kinetic energy ke transport equations are evaluated separately for the submesoscale and the finescale to understand energy pathways in this problem the buoyancy flux associated with coherent motions transfers the potential energy of the front and acts as the primary source of submesoscale ke which is then transported across the front with a fraction transferred to the finescale the transfer limited to thin regions of o 100 m horizontal width is accomplished by primarily horizontal strain in the upper 10 m and by vertical shear in the rest of the 50 m deep mixed layer frontogenetic mechanisms are diagnosed through analysis of the transport equation for squared buoyancy gradient horizontal strain is the primary frontogenetic term that is especially strong in the near surface layer the frontogenesis is counteracted primarily by horizontal diffusion in the top 10 m while further below the balance is with the horizontal gradient of vertical velocity keywords submesoscale turbulence vertical transport frontogenesis instability 1 introduction the mixed layer in the upper ocean contains fronts regions that have sharp density gradient that exhibit lateral density variability at sub 10 km scale e g hosegood et al 2006 timmermans et al 2012 and sengupta et al 2016 submesoscale 0 1 10 km instabilities e g thomas et al 2008 mcwilliams 2016 at frontal regions have the following important consequences for the state of the upper ocean there is restratification that changes the local properties of the mixed layer and influences the upper ocean fluxes that are transmitted through the base of the mixed layer the vertical velocity is enhanced thereby promoting the exchange of heat nutrients and material across the surface layer there are unbalanced motions with o 1 values of rossby number ro l u fl where u is a characteristic horizontal velocity l is a characteristic horizontal length scale and f the coriolis parameter that link the rotationally controlled mesoscale to three dimensional turbulent motions the stratified rotating flow at a front is susceptible to various spontaneous unforced instabilities whose nonlinear evolution leads to multiscale dynamics which will be studied here the canonical eady model eady 1949 of an inviscid geostrophically balanced flow with uniform values for lateral buoyancy gradient m 2 b y buoyancy frequency n and coriolis parameter f is governed by two nondimensional parameters richardson number ri n 2 s 2 with n the buoyancy frequency and s m 2 f the vertical shear and the lateral buoyancy parameter m 2 f 2 the linear evolution is dominated by symmetric instability si when richardson number lies between 0 25 and 0 95 and by baroclinic instability bi when ri 0 95 as shown by stone 1966 the si mode has no along front variability wavenumber k 0 and the bi mode has no cross front variability wavenumber l 0 the slantwise currents that develop during si have vertical shear which becomes unstable to the kelvin helmholtz kh mode as demonstrated in the 2 d simulations of taylor and ferrari 2009 while 3 d simulations arobone and sarkar 2015 exhibit additional mixed modes k 0 l 0 before the kh instability develops bi has received much attention owing to its relation to the growth of deep mesoscale eddies in the strongly stratified interior of the ocean the weaker stratification of the mixed layer allows smaller scale shallower submesoscale eddies to develop through a version of the bi sometimes called the mixed layer instability mli that leads to a potent restratifying buoyancy flux e g boccaletti et al 2007 fox kemper et al 2008 in cases with initial ri between 0 25 and 0 95 si develops preferentially during the initial evolution but eventually ri increases to exceed 0 95 so that bi dominates e g haine and marshall 1998 fox kemper et al 2008 an important aspect of frontal evolution is frontogenesis hoskins and bretherton 1972 hoskins 1982 a process by which the width of a front decreases and there is an increase in horizontal buoyancy gradient vertical velocity and vertical vorticity frontogenesis is particularly strong near the surface lapeyre et al 2006 and spall 1995 suggests that large vertical velocity needed to subduct a fluid parcel to the bottom of the mixed layer can occur through frontogenesis simulations of model fronts e g mahadevan and tandon 2006 boccaletti et al 2007 fox kemper et al 2008 show that submesoscale processes in the surface

resolution numerical models such as that in the present work are able to access the progression of frontal thinning to the scale of turbulent eddies where frontogenesis is arrested at these scales the dynamics is better described by turbulent thermal wind ttw balance rather than geostrophic balance gula et al 2014 mcwilliams et al 2015 mcwilliams 2016 wenegrat and mcphaden 2016 mcwilliams 2017 sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 our understanding of dynamics at the submesoscale that had progressed primarily by theoretical models and numerical experiments has recently benefited from lagrangian based observations d asaro et al 2018 in a surface drifter study in the northern gulf of mexico desoto canyon region found that some of the drifters cluster in a long thin sharpened front which then rolls up into a cyclonic eddy which is only few kilometers in diameter the drifters also reveal zipper structures where two sharpened fronts merge into one that wraps around the eddy the front and eddy are convergent and have large positive vertical vorticity with values that are particularly strong in the convergent zipper region measurement of vertical velocity by floats reveals downwelling in the convergent region with magnitude as large as 1 2 cm s 1 previously in another observational study performed in the northern gulf of mexico using a large number of surface drifters poje et al 2014 found energetic submesoscale turbulence that had considerable effect on the local dispersion in the submesoscale range in a novel two point synchronized measurement of velocity on two parallel tracks shcherbina et al 2013 found that the overall structure of the vertical vorticity on a horizontal plane is that of strands of strong cyclonic vorticity merged in the background of weak anticyclonic vorticity moreover large positive vertical vorticity was found to be correlated with large strain rate in the present work we explore submesoscale finescale dynamics during the evolution of si and bi in an unforced front our tool is high resolution nonhydrostatic modeling forcing by wind buoyancy and waves in frontal regions lead to additional processes that although of interest are not studied here baroclinic instabilities in the mixed layer are able to develop in the presence of wind surface waves and convection e g mahadevan et al 2010 hamlington et al 2014 callies and ferrari 2018 but their overall importance to vertical exchange lateral stirring and mixing depends on the strength of the forcing the increasing resolution and accuracy of recent 3 d non hydrostatic numerical models has enabled access to dynamics at the smallest submesoscales as well as the finescale turbulence as summarized below for unforced frontal problems skyllingstad and samelson 2012 simulated the evolution of bi in a warm filament double front configuration with lateral and along front periodicity that has Œ¥t 0 08 k across a front width l 1 2 km in a h 80 m deep mixed layer with an les model

major result of skyllingstad and samelson 2012 is that turbulence develops at isolated small scale features on the sharpening baroclinic wave instead of the classical picture of a continuous energy cascade through intermediate wavenumbers further analysis samelson and skyllingstad 2016 of the model results showed that frontogenesis leads to features with unstable vertical shear ri 0 25 where turbulence is found √∂zg√∂kmen et al 2011 conducted les of bi in a front that is 3 km wide and has a 80m deep mixed layer with a focus on drifter based sampling strategies they considered a ro 0 066 front with strong rotational control and dynamics different from our present interest arobone and sarkar 2015 simulated the nonlinear evolution of si into turbulence with ri 0 5 and m 2 f 2 16 on a grid with 1024 1024 256 points and in addition to the 2 d in lateral vertical plane kh instability found by taylor and ferrari 2009 found a tertiary instability in the downfront vertical plane that preceded 3 d turbulence the integration time and domain size were not sufficiently large to allow bi to form stamper and taylor 2017 performed simulations of the eady problem with various ri between 0

transition period between si and bi dominates later when ri exceeds 0 95 and the time integrated buoyancy term dominates the shear production term in all cases the reynolds number r e u 0 h ŒΩ m 0 2 h

stamper and taylor 2017 and is unspecified in skyllingstad and samelson 2012 in the present work we conduct high resolution les of a front at moderate values of ri 0 26 and ro 0 32 a relatively high re 2 67 106 and a 2 m isotropic grid in a 4098 m 6146 m 130 m domain the preceding paragraph shows that our knowledge of submesoscale and turbulence dynamics in unforced fronts has progressed owing to the deployment of non hydrostatic 3 d numerical models however the relative contributions of the submesoscale and the finescale turbulence to vertical velocity vorticity dissipation and mixing requires further quantification and the interactions between the submesoscale and the turbulence require improved understanding in particular since turbulence is spatially localized by the coherent submesoscale structures a simple decomposition of the flow between a mean e g along front averaging and a fluctuation is inadequate to understand the interaction between the coherent structures that emerge and the finescale turbulence instead of frontal averaging we apply an explicit spatial filter to the simulation data that as will be demonstrated effectively separates the small scale resolved turbulence the finescale from the coherent submesoscale structures and helps characterize their different roles in vertical transport frontogenesis frontolysis dissipation and mixing the submesoscale finescale decomposition also enables separation of the balance equations between the individual ke components and a quantification local in physical space and nonlocal in wavenumber space of the submesoscale turbulence energy transfer that is better suited to the type of turbulence that develops in this problem the paper is structured as follows the setup of a model front and the numerical model is presented in section 2 section 3 describes the spatial filtering scheme used for separating the submesoscale from the finescale motions the frontal evolution under symmetric and baroclinic instabilities is summarized in section 4 the choice of the length scale for the submesoscale finescale decomposition is also explained section 5 describes the properties of the submesoscale and finescale fields with a focus on the vertical velocity and restratifying fluxes the kinetic energy in the individual submesoscale and finescale components and their transport equations are quantified in section 6 to better understand the energy pathways submesoscale frontogenesis by the finite amplitude baroclinic instability is investigated in section 7 by diagnosing the balance equation for the horizontal buoyancy gradient finally we conclude in section 8 with a summary of the results and discussion in the context of previous work 2 model setup the model consists of a density front that is geostrophically balanced by a surface jet in cartesian coordinates the front and the jet align with the x direction along front and the lateral cross front density variation is in the y direction the

also note that the rossby number ro u 0 fl based on the initial horizontal shear is 0 32 and the reynolds number re u 0 h ŒΩ is 2 67 106 the subgrid fluxes need parameterization in les following

domain is a rectangular box bounded by 0 x 4098 m 3073 m y 3073 m and 130 m z 0 a uniform grid with 2050 3074 66 points provides a grid resolution of 2 m in each direction the use of a fine grid resolution is needed in order to resolve the 3 d overturning motions associated with the vortex filaments that develop during the nonlinear evolution of bi the domain size is chosen to accommodate the growth of the most unstable baroclinic mode stone 1966 whose wavelength l b and the time scale œÑ b are 5 l b 2 œÄ h m 0 2 f 2 1 r i 5 2 œÑ b 54 5 1 r i f with the parameters used in the present study the chosen domain is large enough to accommodate at least two wavelengths of the most unstable baroclinic mode the simulations are run for about 100 h and are terminated when the coherent submesoscale eddies become comparable to the width of the front the boundary condition in the along front x direction is periodic free slip on the velocity and no flux on the temperature are used as the boundary conditions at the surface z 0 and side boundaries at the bottom boundary free slip is used for the velocity and a constant heat flux corresponding to the temperature gradient in the pycnocline is imposed sponge layers are employed at the lateral and bottom boundaries to prevent reflection of spurious waves the sponge layers at the lateral boundaries have a thickness of 64 m the sponge layer at the bottom boundary is 20 m thick the governing equations eq 2 are advanced in time using a mixed third order runge kutta for advective fluxes and crank nicolson for diffusive fluxes second order finite difference discretization is used to compute spatial derivatives the dynamic pressure is obtained by solving the poisson equation with a multi grid iterative method 3 separation into the submesoscale and the finescale the nonlinearly evolving frontal instabilities lead to three dimensional turbulence that is highly local and concentrated at the coherent structures skyllingstad and samelson 2012 stamper and taylor 2017 in order to understand how the three dimensional finescale interacts with the large scale flow a spatial filter is used to decompose the flow between finescale and submesoscale components in the physical space the submesoscale is obtained by applying a low pass spatial filter to the les field 2 2 this low pass filter is an additional explicit spatial filter that has a length scale that is much larger than the grid length scale which is the filter implicit in the les field here we discuss the filtering method and the transport equations for the submesoscale and the finescale the choice of the spatial filter length scale and the dynamics of the submesoscale are discussed later in section 5 the les field variable œï is decomposed into the submesoscale œï and the finescale œï as follows 6 œï œï œï the submesoscale is obtained by the spatial filtering defined as a convolution 7 œï x t g œï g r œï x r t d r where œï u v w p t is a les field variable g r is the filter kernel and r is a position vector measured relative to x the finescale component is obtained by subtracting the submesoscale component from the les field œï œï œï notice that is used to denote the finescale component and is reserved to denote the fluctuation œï œï œï x with respect to the reynolds average where the average is taken to be the along front average œï x 1 l x 0 l x œï x t d x in this study a two dimensional lanczos filter has been used in the horizontal plane the filter kernel in one dimension is given by 8 g 1 d Œ∂ sinc k c Œ∂ sinc k c Œ∂ a sinc k c Œ∂ sin k c Œ∂ k c Œ∂ where a is a non zero positive integer k c is a cutoff wavenumber and Œ∂ is the distance from the position where the filter is applied the extension of the filter kernel to two dimensions is straight forward and is given by 9 g 2 d Œ∂ Œ∑ g 1 d Œ∂ g 1 d Œ∑ where Œ∂ and Œ∑ are distances in the x and y directions respectively the lanczos filter provides the advantage of a sharp cut off in the wavenumber space this filter has been used in previous studies to separate the very large scale flow mesoscale from the submesoscale haza et al 2016 mensa et al 2013 to understand the dynamical consequences of the separation into the submesoscale and finescale it is useful to derive the equations that govern these individual components from the original eq 2 since the filter function is homogeneous continuity is satisfied at both scales i e 10 ≈´ j x j 0 u j x j 0 the momentum and temperature transport equations at the submesoscale become 11 ≈´ i t ≈´ i ≈´ j x

and q j r u j t u j t is the residual heat flux œÑ i j s g s and q i s g s are the model subgrid stress and heat flux respectively at the submesoscale after applying the additional lanczos filter at

the finescale contributions of the model subgrid stress and heat flux respectively 4 evolution of frontal instabilities the temporal evolution of the front under growing instabilities is summarized below before moving to the detailed analysis of the submesoscale and the finescale in the subsequent sections 4 1 symmetric instability the initial potential vorticity is negative at the simulated front fig 1c making the front unstable to symmetric instability si hoskins 1974 the evolution of si is characterized by the formation of convection cells in the perturbation velocity which are nearly aligned with the isopycnals taylor and ferrari 2009 figure 2 shows different stages of the si evolution convection cells are illustrated in fig 2 a by the bands of vertical velocity w with alternating positive and negative signs that are nearly aligned with the isotherms coincident with isopycnals here when the amplitude of si becomes sufficiently large it undergoes secondary kelvin helmholtz kh instability due to large vertical shear v z in the cells and kh billows form along the slanted isotherms taylor and ferrari 2009 subsequently the convection cells undergo an additional tertiary instability which appears as a lateral meandering in the x y plane with wavelength o 100 m relative to the direction in which the cells are aligned not shown here the tertiary instability enhances fluctuations in the cross front vorticity component œâ y and subsequently leads to the breakdown of the flow into 3 d turbulence in a process similar to that noted by arobone and sarkar 2015 that commences at ft 11 t 21 8 h in the present simulation the turbulent stage is illustrated by the broadband multiscale fluctuations of w in fig 2b there are patches of positive and negative w that are o 10 m in both horizontal and vertical directions the subsequent nonlinear evolution of si continues with the strengthening of overturns and w increasing up to 8 mm s 1 in magnitude the growth of si especially the non linear growth leads to restratification of the front the restratification is accompanied by the development of a secondary circulation in the y z plane that is associated with an overall negative light to heavy side cross front velocity v at the surface oppositely directed positive v below and associated upwelling and downwelling limbs figure 3 shows the temporal evolution of v averaged in the homogeneous along front x direction near the surface 10 m depth in fig 3a and near the bottom 40 m depth in fig 3b of the mixed layer although there is spatio temporal variability in v the behavior of v with increasing time indicates that the secondary circulation has overall v 0 at 10 m depth that transports warm water to the colder side of the front in contrast to the oppositely directed flow at 40 m depth with overall v 0 thus the secondary circulation setup by si restratifies the front and the flow becomes stable to si when pv becomes positive 4 2 baroclinic instability as the si subsides baroclinic instability bi emerges to modulate the remnant of si and eventually dominates the frontal instabilities the growth of the bi mode results in the onset of large scale meandering of the isotherms fig 4 a with wavelength comparable to that predicted by the linear theory frontogenesis occurs as can be identified by the tightening of the isotherms in fig 4a vertical vorticity plots fig 4c d show intensification of œâ z in the frontogenetic regions owing to locally enhanced horizontal shear the vertical shear increases as well following the increase in the lateral buoyancy gradient the frontogenetic regions eventually break down into turbulence through processes which will be quantified in later sections the development of finescale flow component in regions undergoing frontogenesis is evident from numerous small scale structures in fig 4 b d and from the enhanced subgrid viscosity in fig 4f which grows to become three orders of magnitude larger than the molecular viscosity the thin regions with concentrated œâ z at the front become elongated as bi grows and transform into vortex filaments fig 4d with lengths comparable to the wavelength of the dominant bi mode the vortex filaments often appear in pairs one coming from the heavier side of the front and another from the lighter side to join near the center line y 0 as the vortex filament pairs advect downstream they roll up and organize into vorticity patches i e the coherent submesoscale eddies in fig 4 b d two developing submesoscale eddies can be noted the overall sense of rotation in the eddies is cyclonic note that the cores of the submesoscale eddies are relatively colder i e heavier than the surrounding fluid due to entrainment of the cold water from the heavier side of the front after forming the submesoscale eddies continue to grow by the supply of vorticity from the filament structures by the end of the simulation the submesoscale eddies had grown to become 1 km in diameter comparable in size to the initial width of the front vertical vorticity is concentrated in the coherent structures i e the vortex filaments and the coherent submesoscale eddies the value of local rossby number r o œâ z f in the coherent structures is as large as 50 fig 4d shows œâ z f 15 15 for better visualization and suggests significant ageostrophy and loss of balance in these structures moreover the concentration of large subgrid viscosity fig 4f indicates strong turbulence in the coherent structures the ageostrophic regions develop large vertical velocity in fig 5 a w is plotted on a horizontal plane at 10 m depth its similarity with the œâ z field fig 4d is apparent with large w regions concentrated within the coherent structures the magnitude of w becomes as large as 0 02 m s 1 or about 0 35u 0 fig 5b shows w on a cross section whose vertical coordinate is the depth and horizontal coordinate is length s along a vortex filament the line l in fig 5a the w field fig 5b within the vortex filament reveals bands of positive and negative w with 20 m characteristic length scale the bi is effective in restratifying the front and the process is facilitated by an asc hoskins 1982 although large patches with coherent w especially upwelling can be identified in fig 5a the finescale of the eddies obscures the asc the probability density function pdf of w shows asymmetry for magnitudes greater than 2 mm s 1 in favor of downwelling motion not shown here however the corresponding probability of these large w regions is quite small and the presence of net downwelling motion in the coherent structures is not obvious indeed separation of the finescale from the submesoscale is necessary to clarify vertical transport as is done in section 5 the growth of bi modifies the frontal jet as can be seen from the velocity contours and vectors of fig 6 the width of the jet near the surface increases and it becomes more energized the initial range of u from 5 10 2 to 0 m s 1 expands with increasing time and notably includes positive u up to 2 10 2 m s 1 the cross front velocity v initially zero becomes as large as u clearly a considerable amount of kinetic energy is transferred to the swirling motion of the submesoscale eddies these eddies speed up the jet on the lighter side of the front and slow it down on the heavier side the eddies span the entire mixed layer depth and the modification of the jet below mid depth is relatively strong since the initial u is small relative to the surface in this paper we use the term front to denote the region where there is significant horizontal velocity gradient the largest density gradients are located mainly in the coherent structures and found to be confined within the front 4 3 a characteristic lateral dimension for the spatially coherent finescale flow visualization shows formation of thin filament structures due to frontogenesis as bi evolves interrogation of the velocity and temperature fields in physical space reveals a characteristic lateral dimension of o 100 m for the spatially coherent finescale that is associated with the vortex filaments the o 100 m scale of frontal arrest also has an imprint on the spectra the power spectra of the along front velocity u cross front velocity v and vertical velocity w at 20 m depth are shown in fig 7 the spectra are computed as follows 13 s u k 1 2 √ª k 2 y s v k 1 2 v k 2 y s w k 1 2 ≈µ k 2 y where k is the wavenumber in the along front direction the caret denotes the fourier transform and y denotes averaging in the lateral y direction over all computational grid lines between 1 2 y 1 2 km the spectra fig 7 show qualitative changes with increasing k at low k the kinetic energy in the vertical motion is much smaller than the energy in the horizontal motions indicating a predominantly two dimensional flow at these scales whereas at higher k the energy in the vertical motion becomes comparable to those in the horizontal motions indicating three dimensional turbulence the spectra s u and s v of the horizontal velocity components also change from a steeper slope to a slope closer to k 5 3 at k corresponding to o 100 m a choice needs to be made for k c the cutoff wavenumber of the filter that determines the split between submesoscale and finescale from the preceding discussion k c corresponds to o 100 m table 1 shows the kinetic energy content e in wavenumber k k c and the distribution of e among the three velocity components for different choices of k c the table shows an increase in the relative contribution of the vertical motion e w with increasing k c at the value k c 0 04 rad m 1 chosen for the decomposition e w becomes more than 20 and further increase of k c leads to relatively gradual change in e w a posteriori we find that our choice of k c leads to a good separation of the submesoscale dynamics from the turbulent finescale a computational restriction is worth noting it is clear that the coherent structures also introduce an important length scale to the problem the width of the filament which is much smaller o 100 m compared to the wavelength of the baroclinic instability mode this length scale restricts the horizontal grid size of submesoscale eddy resolving simulations to be at least o 100 m and of turbulence resolving simulations to o 10 m or less 5 submesoscale the classical decomposition of the flow between an along front mean and a fluctuation is not adequate to understand the role of the coherent submesoscale and its interaction with 3 d turbulence the mean flow computed by averaging the flow in the along front direction would overlook the spatio temporal coherence of the submesoscale as well as its imprint on the finescale here the finescale is separated from the large scale flow by using a low pass filter a two dimensional lanczos filter eq 9 with a 2 and k c 0 04 rad m 1 the lanczos filter successfully extracts the coherent structures as will be shown while providing a sharp cutoff in the wavenumber space structures with k k c are removed while the energy content of the larger structures remains largely unaffected the value of the cutoff wavenumber k c is motivated by the change in flow anisotropy quasi 2d to 3d motions and spectral slopes observed at o 100 m that was discussed in section 4 3 the overall performance of the filter in separating the scales is assessed by the visualization of fig 8 where submesoscale fields denoted by and finescale components denoted by are shown on a horizontal plane qualitatively the filter provides a good representation of the finescale in the flow while preserving the large scale flow features it is clear that there is considerable energy corresponding to the swirling flow that is spread across the submesoscale while the finescale is localized 5 1 vertical transport the front develops large vertical velocities as was shown by fig 5 and the accompanying discussion however the w field does not show distinct regions where upwelling and downwelling motions occur the underlying structure of the vertical transport can be better understood using the submesoscale component of w in fig 8c the submesoscale vertical velocity w is plotted at 10 m depth the w field reveals large patches with predominantly positive and negative values separating regions with upwelling and downwelling motions the downwelling motion as will be shown subsequently transports high density fluid to the interior the organization of the patches with w 0 and w 0 is connected to the coherent structures negative vertical velocity is concentrated along the filaments and the magnitude is relatively stronger in regions where filaments curve into the coherent eddies the solid black contours of w 0 1 m m s 1 estimate the edges of the w 0 regions on the other hand the upwelling regions w 0 are spatially extensive and occupy a much larger frontal area relative to w 0 regions in fig 8c w 0 regions are identified by the black dash dot lines corresponding to w 0 1 m m s 1 thus at the submesoscale the regions with positive and negative vertical velocities become separated exposing the underlying structure of the upwelling and downwelling motions similarly at the submesoscale regions of positive and negative vertical vorticity are well separated fig 8g the figure shows that œâ z is positive cyclonic in the filament structures and in the coherent eddies and has magnitude of 5 7f negative œâ z reaches only 1 2f in magnitude the finescale vorticity œâ z has large magnitude up to 50f which unlike the submesoscale is comparable for both negative and positive components the intertwined positive and negative œâ z values cancel out in the finescale and it is the submesoscale vorticity that dictates the rotation of the turbulent filament structure as it rolls up anticlockwise to form a cyclonic eddy we now take a deeper look into downwelling and upwelling motions through the following decomposition of w w w w w 0 w 0 w 0 w 0 w 0 w 0 thus w represents the negative part of w while w represents the positive part including w 0 the frontal averages of the vertical velocity and the temperature are plotted in fig 9 the average has been calculated over the region most influenced by bi the entire along front length l x and 1 2 y 1 2 km across the front the vertical profiles of fig 9 a show that w x y and w x y are nearly equal in magnitude but opposite in sign the difference in magnitudes is at least one two orders smaller than either in conformity with the continuity requirement at the submesoscale both w x y and w x y which are zero near the surface due to the no penetration boundary condition increase to their maximum values at the depth of 20 m and then decrease with increasing depth however they do not become zero at the mixed layer depth h 50 m the non zero w in the thermocline is due to internal waves and found to have a different spatial structure than that in the mixed layer the overall upwelling and downwelling transport in the mixed layer is dominated by the submesoscale component w fig 9b shows averages of the finescale conditioned on the sign of the submesoscale w in the region with w 0 the net effect of the finescale is downwelling average of w in that region is negative and in the region with w 0 the net effect is upwelling the vertical upwelling and downwelling due to w of the finescale fig 9b is found to be much smaller at least 7 8 times smaller than those by the submesoscale velocity therefore measurement of the submesoscale vertical velocity is sufficient to obtain the net upwelling downwelling the instability correlates temperature density with the vertical velocity fig 9c shows profiles of averaged t conditioned on the sign of w in the regions with positive negative w the conditional mean of temperature is higher lower than the total average thus the submesoscale motions transport high density low t fluid near the surface to the interior of the mixed layer and consequently the front restratifies the correlation not plotted between the density and the vertical velocity is negative indicating the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy comparison of the œâ z and w fields in fig 8 shows a correspondence between the regions with strong positive œâ z and negative w it is tempting to use œâ z 0 as a predictor of downwelling however the computed correlation between œâ z and w is small also the vertical downwelling w computed by conditioning on positive œâ z is found to be substantially smaller than the net w at the front the reason is that the eddy core with positive œâ z has a substantial area of upwelling not downwelling the downwelling and upwelling motions at the front can be considered as parts of an ageostrophic secondary circulation asc in simplified models of fronts where the along front variation is averaged or neglected the asc is a restratifying 2 d y z circulation that is anticlockwise looking in the direction of the jet the asc transports near surface water from the light y 0 to the heavy y 0 side while dense water subducts from the heavy side and moves toward the light side at depth the asc which develops during the evolution of bi is in fact 3 d owing to the along front variability associated with the coherent submesoscale the along front variability of the y z circulation is depicted in fig 10 by contrasting the circulation among three y z cuts whose intersections with z 10 are marked as s1 s2 and s3 in fig 8 of a submesoscale eddy if we define back to front of the eddy to be in the direction negative x of the average jet velocity s3 is at the back s2 is near the center and s1 is at the front of the eddy note that consistent with the anticlockwise x y circulation of the submesoscale eddy surface water is transported in the y direction at s1 fig 10 a and y direction at s3 fig 10c the y z circulation at s1 fig 10 a shows that there is downwelling in the filament 700 y 600 m and predominantly upwelling in the eddying region 300 y 500 m on the other hand the circulation at s3 fig 10c shows substantial downward motion s2 fig 10b is a y z section through the eddy core within the eddy the temperature contours at the bottom of the mixed layer and in the vicinity of y 0 indicate isopycnal doming under the influence of low pressure and the fluid has radially outward horizontal velocity at s2 there is both upwelling and downwelling with the former in the eddy core and the latter at the back of the eddy to summarize the organization of the secondary circulation in the y z plane is associated with the coherent structures at the front with upwelling dominant in the forward and central regions of the submesoscale eddy and downwelling in the aft regions and the filaments 5 2 3d structure of the coherent submesoscale the downwelling of high density water and the upwelling of low density water are three dimensional processes each dominating in different parts of the front and mediated by the coherent structures the three dimensionality of the coherent structure helps shed light on the vertical exchange here the coherent structure is extracted using the q criterion defined as 14 q 1 2 œâ i j 2 s i j 2 œâ i j 1 2 ≈´ i x j ≈´ j x i s i j 1 2 ≈´ i x j ≈´ j x i where œâ i j and s i j are the rotation and strain tensors of the submesoscale respectively q 0 signifies rotation dominated flow while q 0 signifies the domination of strain iso surfaces of q fig 11 show that the coherent structures consist of both rotation and strain dominated regions which are organized in layers around the coherent submesoscale eddies it can also be noted that the filament structure at the heavier side y 0 of the front is shallow at its origin and its depth of influence increases as one moves along this structure toward the eddy very close to the eddy and in the region surrounding the eddy the filaments influence the whole of the mixed layer the filamentary structures at the lighter side y 0 of the front seem to affect the entire mixed layer depth thus the separation of scales of motion into the submesoscale and the finescale provides a better understanding of the vertical velocity organization and the vertical transport at the baroclinic frontal instability the submesoscale vertical velocity field shows well separated regions where either negative or positive w dominates moreover the vertical velocity field is connected to the coherent structures strong downwelling motions develop at vortex filaments and in some portions of the submesoscale eddies that adjoin the filaments 6 kinetic energy of the submesoscale and the finescale in this section we assess the relative contributions of the submesoscale and the finescale to the kinetic energy quantify the dominant balances in the transport equations eqs 11 and 12 for the submesoscale and finescale respectively and make explicit the interaction between turbulence the finescale and the submesoscale the submesoscale velocity as defined here includes the along front x average which at t 0 is the velocity of the initially balanced geostrophic jet in order to focus on the fluctuations we subtract the along front average before computing the ke and contrast the evolution of the overall volume averaged fluctuation energy in the submesoscale and the finescale components in fig 12 initially the mean ke dominates and the ke of the small amplitude broadband fluctuations introduced at t 0 resides mainly in the finescale figure 12 shows that both submesoscale and finescale ke increase during the growth of si when the instability becomes nonlinear at t 15 h the finescale ke saturates but the submesoscale ke keeps increasing at t 40 h the submesoscale ke overtakes the finescale ke the subsequent evolution is dominated by bi which increases the submesoscale ke until it finally saturates at a value comparable to the mean ke although the volume averaged ke of the finescale in the frontal region does not change significantly during the evolution of bi there is substantial spatio temporal variability as the finescale concentrated in the coherent filament structures and eddies interacts with the submesoscale how the submesoscale and finescale flows evolve and interact is investigated here by studying the ke budgets at the two scales an outstanding question is what is the source of the finescale ke that counteracts its dissipation the submesoscale ke equation derived by multiplying eq 11 with ≈´ i is given by 15 t u i u i 2 t j x j b e e s g s e r where t j is the transport term 16 t j ≈´ j ≈´ i ≈´ i 2 ≈´ j p œÅ 0 ŒΩ x j ≈´ i ≈´ i 2 ≈´ i œÑ i j s g s œÑ i j r b Œ± t w g is the submesoscale buoyancy production term e ŒΩ u i x j 2 is the molecular dissipation and e s g s œÑ i j s g s u i x j is the dissipation corresponding to the subgrid stresses the term e r œÑ i j r u i x j that arises from the effect of the submesoscale velocity gradient on the residual stresses will be shown later to act as a loss of submesoscale ke note that the residual stress œÑ i j r u i u j u i u j which arises from the submesoscale finescale decomposition is explicitly computed after applying the lanczos filter and is different from the subgrid stress œÑ i j s g s which is modeled in the les approach similar to the ke budget at the submesoscale the ke budget at the resolved finescale can be derived by multiplying eq 12 with u i the ke transport equation at the finescale is given by 17 t u i u i 2 t j x j t r b e e s g s e r where t j is the transport term 18 t j ≈´ j u i u i 2 u j u i u i 2 p u j œÅ 0 ŒΩ x j u i u i 2 u i œÑ i j s g s œÑ i j r t r u i u j ≈´ i x j is the transfer term that represents the action of submesoscale velocity gradients including shear on the finescale b Œ±t w g is the finescale buoyancy production and e ŒΩ u i x j 2 and e s g s œÑ i j s g s u i x j are the dissipation of finescale ke due to molecular viscosity and subgrid stresses respectively e r œÑ i j r u i x j term arises from the interaction of the residual stresses with the finescale velocity gradient it will be shown later to act as a production term for the finescale ke the dominant terms of submesoscale and finescale ke budgets are frontally averaged i e over the entire along front direction and 1 5 y 1 5 km in the cross front direction and the vertical profiles of the frontal averages are plotted in fig 13 in the following we first discuss terms in the submesoscale ke balance and then the finescale ke budget the submesoscale ke can change due to the buoyancy term b and the dissipation terms namely e e s g s and e r the transport term t represents the transfer of ke between different spatial regions by various processes such as advection pressure work and the work by various stresses molecular subgrid and residual the dominant terms of the submesoscale ke budget eq 16 are plotted in fig 13a as a function of depth at t 79 7 h fig 13a shows that the buoyancy production b is the main source of submesoscale ke in the mixed layer that extends to 50 m depth b represents conversion into ke of the available potential energy associated with the horizontal buoyancy jump across the front below the mixed layer the buoyancy term is negative in the bulk of the mixed layer except for the near surface region from z 0 to approximately 10 m depth the buoyancy production is balanced mainly by the pressure transport computed as ≈´ j œÅ 0 p x j the pressure transport redistributes energy from the 10 40 m depth to both the near surface region and to the region below 40 m depth we find that b is approximately balanced by w œÅ 0 p z over the domain this suggests that the overall horizontally averaged over the front submesoscale is in approximate hydrostatic balance for this moderate strength front the dissipation terms are also plotted in fig 13a the dissipation due to molecular viscosity is relatively small and only the contributions from e s g s and e r are shown the figure shows that both terms are significant in the near surface region above 10 m and have negative values which indicates removal of submesoscale ke note that e s g s is negative everywhere and represents dissipation of submesoscale ke by the les subgrid model on the other hand e r can be either positive or negative and represents exchange of ke between the submesoscale and finescale the role of e r in this exchange can be readily noticed by expressing œÑ i j r in the galilean invariant components as suggested by germano 1986 œÑ i j r l i j o c i j o r i j o where l i j o u i u j u i u j is the leonard stresses c i j o u i u j u i u j u i u j u i u j are the cross stresses and r i j o u i u j u i u j are reynolds stresses consequently corresponding to stresses r i j o u i u j the term t r u i u j u i x j appears which is similar to the transfer term tr in the finescale kinetic energy budget the frontal average of e r however is negative and indicates a net transfer of energy to the finescale in the near surface region transport by the subgrid stresses œÑ i j s g s and residual stresses œÑ i j r are also important the frontal averages of the transports by subgrid and residual stresses are negative and tend to remove the excess energy generated by the significantly large pressure transport in the region the dominant terms of the finescale ke budget are plotted in fig 13b the transfer term tr acts as the main source of finescale ke tr is split into two parts following sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 tr h with all the terms containing horizontal gradients of the submesoscale velocity and tr v with all the terms containing the vertical gradients of the submesoscale velocity thus 19 t r h u 1 u 1 ≈´ 1 x 1 u 1 u 2 ≈´ 1 x 2 u 2 u 1 ≈´ 2 x 1 u 2 u 2 ≈´ 2 x 2 u 3 u 1 ≈´ 3 x 1 u 3 u 2 ≈´ 3 x 2 t r v u 1 u 3 ≈´ 1 x 3 u 2 u 3 ≈´ 2 x 3 u 3 u 3 ≈´ 3 x 3 figure 13b shows that in the near surface region approximately top 10 m of the mixed layer tr h is large in magnitude relative to tr v however further below the free surface tr v is the dominant source term below the mixed layer the transfer terms tr h and tr v are small it can also be observed that below the near surface region tr v and the subgrid dissipation e s g s are the dominant terms and approximately balance each other the velocity gradient tensor ≈´ i x j in the transfer tr between the submesoscale and the finescale has components that can be related to either shear off diagonal terms or strain diagonal terms in the flow the relative importance of the shear and strain components to tr is further explored in fig 14 where front averaged profiles of each component are plotted as a function of depth clearly tr is strongly influenced by t r 11 u 1 u 1 ≈´ 1 x 1 part of tr h and t r 13 u 1 u 3 ≈´ 1 x 3 part of tr v with the former related to horizontal strain and the latter to vertical shear in the top 6 m tr 11 dominates pointing to the importance of the horizontal compressive strain associated with frontogenesis to the enhancement of turbulence below 10 m vertical shear ≈´ 1 x 3 and additionally ≈´ 2 x 3 is important interestingly the frontal mean of t r 12 u 1 u 2 ≈´ 1 x 2 is negative this reverse energy transfer to horizontal eddying motions in physical space is consistent with the notion that in this flow finescale turbulence is organized into the coherent submesoscale in addition to the usual downscale energy transfer to turbulence the sum of all the components of tr is positive i e overall the submesoscale gradients act as a source of the finescale ke among gradients of the vertical velocity only t r 33 u 3 u 3 ≈´ 3 x 3 involving vertical strain is significant however it is smaller than the dominant term tr 13 in addition to tr e r is another dominant source of the finescale kinetic energy mainly near the surface e r represents the interaction of the residual stress with the finescale shear there is only a partial balance between the production of the kinetic energy and dissipation by the subgrid stresses e s g s in this region transport by both the submesoscale and finescale velocity fields is significant and removes energy from the layer the horizontal organization of selected terms that appear in the kinetic energy balance are shown in fig 15 at 10 m depth the local value of submesoscale buoyancy production b fig 15b has both positive regions primarily in the filaments and negative regions primarily in the eddy cores however the horizontal average of b is positive fig 13a and indicates restratification accompanied by the conversion of potential energy in the lateral stratification to submesoscale ke the resemblance between the horizontal structures of submesoscale ke and buoyancy production is apparent in fig 15 a b further reinforcing the importance of b for the submesoscale ke the dissipation of the finescale fig 15c is concentrated in the vortex filaments again pointing to the spatially localized coherent organization of dissipative turbulence in this problem the dominant terms that transfer energy from the submesoscale to the finescale owing to horizontal strain fig 15d and vertical shear fig 15e are also localized in the vortex filaments the gradient richardson number ri g based on vertical shear and stratification of the submesoscale is plotted in fig 15f the regions with subcritical ri g 0 25 are within those where tr 13 is large thus local shear instability is a driver of turbulence at this location 7 frontogenesis the formation of coherent structures i e the vortex filaments and the coherent submesoscale eddies show frontogenesis notably large increase in m 2 f 2 from its initial value the role of the coherent structures in vertical transport was addressed in section 5 in this section the focus is on the processes that are responsible for frontogenesis and those which counteract to balance it we investigate the time rate of change of horizontal buoyancy gradient at the submesoscale h b where h x i y j and i and j are unit vectors in x and y directions respectively e g capet et al 2008b it can be noted that buoyancy is directly related to the temperature deviation b gŒ±t in particular the following dynamical equation is quantified 20 1 2 d d t h b 2 h b q s q w q d h q d v f s f w f d h f d v in the above equation q s and q w denote contributions due to advection by the submesoscale and are given by 21 q s x ≈´ x b x v y b y ≈´ x b y v y b q w x w z b y w z b thus q s corresponds to the straining of the buoyancy field by horizontal motion and q w is an analogous term related to vertical motion the contributions from diabatic processes molecular diffusion and subgrid and residual fluxes are included in q dh and q dv between the two q dh is associated with the horizontal diabatic processes and q dv is associated with the vertical diabatic processes 22 q d h h h Œ∫ h b g Œ± h q h s g s q h r q d v h z Œ∫ z b g Œ± z q v s g s q v r the forcing terms on the right hand side of eq 20 f i where i s w dh dv are obtained by taking the dot product of h b with appropriate q terms in figs 16 and 17 the forcing terms are plotted at depths 10 m and 30 m respectively near the surface f s is predominantly positive in the vortex filaments and is frontogenetic whereas f w is predominantly negative and is frontolytic on the other hand f dh and f dv are both frontogenetic and frontolytic in these regions f dh being frontolytic in the center and frontogenetic at the edges while f dv being frontogenetic at the center and frontolytic at the edges near the mid depth at 30 m the forcing terms f s and f w have both positive and negative values relatively more interspersed at the front the magnitudes of the forcing terms f s and f w as well as f dh and f dv are much smaller compared to those near the surface a qualitative balance between f s and f w and that between f dh and f dv can be observed at both depths the vertical profiles of frontal averaged 0 x l x and 1 2 y 1 2 km forcing terms are shown in fig 18 three distinct regions can be identified upper intermediate and bottom regions in the upper near surface region above 10 m depth f s is balanced by both f w and f dh however very close to the surface f w goes to zero and the balance is provided only by f dh the balance between f s and f dh is partial at the surface i e the frontal averaged value of h b 2 continues to increase with time because the length of the thin o 100 m wide frontal regions continues to increase as bi proceeds in the intermediate region between 10 40 m depth there is a dominant balance between f s and f w f s is predominantly frontogenetic and f w is predominantly frontolytic this can also be observed in figs 16 and 17 finally near the bottom between 40 60 m depth there is relatively weak frontogenesis that arises from f w in all the three regions the frontal averaged f dv is small the balance of the frontal averaged buoyancy gradient described above corresponds to t 79 7 h and reflects the behavior during the time the coherent eddies grow before the growth of bi the forcing terms f i xy remain small as bi starts growing at t 40 h f i begin to develop near the surface when the eddies form and grow f i xy become significantly large fig 18 during this period the submesoscale ke also grows afterwards when the submesoscale ke saturates at t 100 h f i xy remain significant only in the upper region in the intermediate and bottom regions the magnitudes of frontal averaged forcing terms become small 8 discussion and conclusions the spin down of a mixed layer front is studied using a large eddy simulation les model the front of width 1 2 km is initially in geostrophic balance has a moderate rossby number of 0 32 and is confined to a weakly stratified ri 0 26 mixed layer of thickness 50 m that lies above a strongly stratified thermocline the non hydrostatic boussinesq navier stokes equations are numerically solved on a turbulence resolving isotropic grid that discretizes a domain that is 4098 m in the along front 6146 m in the cross front and 130 m in the vertical with resolution of 2 m in all three coordinate directions the high resolution les enables us to simulate submesoscale eddies three dimensional turbulence and their interaction the initial configuration with ri 0 26 is such that the potential vorticity is negative over the front making it unstable to symmetric instability si that then develops secondary kh instability taylor and ferrari 2009 and three dimensional turbulence arobone and sarkar 2015 although si grows initially the baroclinic instability bi soon becomes the dominant mode as ri increases to beyond 0 95 during restratification of the front haine and marshall 1998 fox kemper et al 2008 the growth of bi is frontogenetic hoskins 1982 and results in the formation of thin vortex filaments at the front furthermore long vortex filaments comparable in length to that of the wavelength of the dominant bi mode roll up to produce coherent submesoscale eddies these coherent structures are localized in space and characterized by large values of strain rate vorticity and density gradient the local rossby number in these structures is o 10 indicating local loss of rotational control previous studies of the mixed layer instability with turbulence resolving simulations e g skyllingstad and samelson 2012 stamper and taylor 2017 have found vortex filaments submesoscale eddies and turbulence during the flow evolution in the present simulation of an isolated unforced front the turbulence that develops during bi occurs in localized regions at the sharpening filament structure similar to skyllingstad and samelson 2012 who simulated the evolution of a warm filament double front configuration with lateral periodicity given the sparseness and locality in physical space of the turbulence that develops in this problem we are motivated to examine scale interactions in physical space rather than the classical wavenumber based approach employed by skyllingstad and samelson 2012 therefore unlike previous studies of the mixed layer instability we decompose the flow into a submesoscale field and a finescale field in physical space describe the properties of these two fields and quantify their interaction the classical decomposition into an overall frontal average and a fluctuation would obscure the coherent submesoscale structures and prevent us from elucidating their important role in frontal dynamics the present decomposition enables the direct quantification of how the coherent submesoscale contributes to processes such as transfer of mass momentum and buoyancy to the bottom of the mixed layer and the interaction between the mixed layer and the pycnocline a low pass lanczos spatial filter is used to decompose a given flow variable œï into the sum of a submesoscale component œï and a finescale component œï our finding of a change of kinetic energy spectrum slope and flow anisotropy at o 100 m length scale guides the choice of filter scale as o 100 m we find that the submesoscale component e g left column of fig 8 represents the coherent structures that emerge during the evolution of the mixed layer instability and are distributed throughout the frontal region the finescale component e g right column of fig 8 represents small scale turbulence that is spatially organized and concentrated in filamentary regions where the submesoscale field has large spatial gradients an important feature of submesoscale dynamics in frontal regions is the associated increase in vertical transport the present simulation shows that w exceeds 0 005 m s 1 in several regions and becomes as large as 0 02 m s 1 within vortex filaments regions of positive and negative w are interspersed it is the decomposition of w into the submesoscale w and the finescale w that allows us to separate upwelling from downwelling regions downwelling by w is concentrated at the filaments that curve into the submesoscale vortices while upwelling occurs over more spatially extensive regions in and around these vortices the associated buoyancy flux is restratifying although the instantaneous magnitude of w has an order of magnitude large peak relative to w the additional net contribution by the finescale to the overall transport is small an examination of the submesoscale velocity over y z cross sections at different x along front locations shows significant along front variability thus the secondary ageostrophic circulation taken to be two dimensional in simplified along front averaged models is three dimensional owing to the action of the filaments and vortices in the flow we define back to forward direction as aligned with the jet velocity negative x direction heavier fluid with downwelling velocity is found in the filament structure in the back regions of the eddies while the lighter fluid with upwelling velocity is found in the forward regions the coherent structures have enhanced relative vorticity cold filaments with denser fluid have concentrated positive submesoscale œâ z and roll up into cyclonic submesoscale vortices with vorticity as large as œâ z f 5 in the surface layer similar to the simulations of gula et al 2015 with 150 m horizontal resolution the finescale vorticity œâ z is an order of magnitude larger and is concentrated in the thin filaments the finescale kinetic energy ke is found to increase rapidly during the initial 20 h when si is active and then its frontal average saturates although the local spatio temporal variability is substantial the submesoscale ke continues to increase after 20 h when si becomes nonlinear however the bulk of the increase occurs during bi the turbulent finescale is dissipative and an outstanding question is what maintains the energy of the finescale to answer this question and have a better understanding of the energy pathways to and between the two components we evaluate the ke transport equations separately for the submesoscale and finescale and report vertical profiles of horizontally averaged terms at a late time t 79 7 h during the bi evolution with regards to the submesoscale ke the buoyancy production term which is significant between 10 m and the mixed layer base acts as the main source the pressure transport term redistributes ke spatially from lower in the mixed layer to the 10 m near surface region both the residual stress explicitly computed from the flow field as œÑ i j r u i u j u i u j and the subgrid stress modeled act to dissipate submesoscale ke the dissipation e r by residual stress is larger than the dissipation by subgrid stress e s g s by a factor of about 2 direct molecular dissipation is negligible at the o 100 m scale of the submesoscale the finescale ke is found to be primarily delivered by the transfer term t r u i u j ≈´ i x j which represents the interaction of the finescale with the submesoscale velocity gradients the transfer term tr is further decomposed into tr h which involves horizontal gradients and tr v as in several of the other diagnostics the near surface upper 10 m layer is qualitatively different in that tr h tr 11 is the primary source of finescale ke in contrast to the remainder of the mixed layer where it is tr v tr 13 that dominates the buoyancy flux has a negligible contribution to the ke balance this is in contrast to the submesoscale where it is the buoyancy flux which energizes the submesoscale ke the production of finescale ke by the residual stress œÑ i j r is an important contributor to the budget only in the top 10 m in the present study horizontal strain u x and vertical shear u z of the submesoscale velocity field act as dominant production terms of finescale kinetic energy at different depths in particular in the 6 m near surface region it is the horizontal strain which dominates the transfer while in the remainder of the mixed layer the transfer is mediated by the vertical shear sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 simulated the evolution of a cold dense filament in a background of strong ocean boundary layer obl turbulence bi did not emerge in the mixed layer but there was frontogenesis by the ageostrophic circulation instigated by obl turbulence leading to frontal turbulence they found that in the down front wind case and no wind surface cooling case the horizontal shear was the dominant production term for the tke while in the cross front wind case it was the vertical shear thus there are qualitative differences in frontal turbulence generation between a front undergoing bi with subsequent submesoscale meanders and vortices as in the present case and a front that develops in a pre existing field of strong obl turbulence without exhibiting bi during the evolution of bi horizontal currents u v develop strong variability in the horizontal x y that locally sharpen the front and intensify the buoyancy gradient h b the terms in the balance equation for the square of h b are diagnosed to better understand the frontogenetic mechanisms instantaneous visualizations at 10 m depth shows active frontogenesis by f s which involves horizontal gradients of horizontal velocity mainly at the filaments while f w which involves horizontal gradients of vertical velocity acts to counteract frontogenesis instantaneously the diabatic diffusive terms act to both increase and decrease the local buoyancy gradient an overall picture of the diabatic term emerges after performing horizontal averages in the frontal region horizontal diffusion both resolved and subgrid is the primary process in the upper 10 m that counteracts frontogenesis by f s in the remainder of the mixed layer it is primarily f w which involves horizontal gradients of vertical velocity that counteracts frontogenesis by f s capet et al 2008b in their analysis of frontogenesis during mesoscale submesoscale transition in a simulation with 750 m horizontal resolution found that f dv vertical diffusion modeled by k profile parametrization kpp was the primary term in the model counteracting f s horizontal diffusion f dh could not be calculated separately because it was implicit in the horizontal advection and the horizontal grid resolution was insufficient in the present 2 m resolution les the front thins to o 100 m we find that the contribution from horizontal diffusion f dh calculated explicitly here counteracts frontogenesis by f s in the near surface layer and thus plays an important role in limiting the width of the frontogenetic region in cold filaments that evolve in a turbulent boundary layer surface frontogenesis results from the secondary circulation that occurs under the turbulent thermal wind ttw condition mcwilliams et al 2015 sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 frontal sharpening proceeded to the grid scale of o 10 m in the 2 d numerical simulations mcwilliams et al 2015 that were conducted with the k profile parametrization kpp of vertical mixing while sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 found that frontogenesis was arrested at o 100 m by shear driven turbulence in a simulation that resolved the turbulent boundary layer bi is excluded in the 2 d model of mcwilliams et al 2015 whereas in the model of sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 the filament evolution process is fast and bi remains unimportant during this period although different from the bi driven frontogenesis and localized turbulence of the present study the arrest scale of frontogenesis observed by sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 is close to the value of o 100 m obtained in the present study it is worth noting that features sharper than o 100 m can form in fronts for example pham and sarkar 2018 in their study of a strong front with large m 2 f 2 find sharpening down to o 10 m that precedes the release of a gravity current although the submesoscale dynamics is studied here for a model front without any external influences it exhibits processes which are also observed in the real ocean the study of d asaro et al 2018 using satellite tracked surface drifters in the northern gulf of mexico revealed sharpened fronts which wrap into cyclonic eddies a process that is resembled by the rolling up of the filament structures into cyclonic eddies in the present study the zipper structures which form when two filaments combine into one as they wrap into the eddy are similar to the joining of filaments structures from opposite sides of the front seen here moreover the positive cyclonic vertical vorticity and downwelling at the front as well as their enhanced magnitudes in the convergent zipper region found by d asaro et al 2018 are features that occur in the submesoscale dynamics of the present study similar to the asymmetry in the distribution of the positive and negative vertical vorticity observed in the study of shcherbina et al 2013 we find in the simulation that the anticyconic vertical vorticity is weaker œâ z 1 2f and spatially more extensive than the cyclonic vertical vorticity œâ z 5f that is concentrated in thin filaments furthermore the large strain rate and positive vertical vorticity at the submesoscale are correlated in the simulation both of these properties are characteristic of the filaments the present study underlines the importance of coherent structures i e vortex filaments and coherent submesoscale eddies in the dynamics of the spindown of an unforced front in a mixed layer by elucidating their role in vertical transport frontogenesis and maintenance of fine scale turbulence the analysis was based on eulerian statistics and in future work we hope to shed further light on subduction and mixing by lagrangian tracer analysis surface forcing by wind buoyancy and waves introduces additional complexities into the evolution of the baroclinic instability as has been shown by several recent numerical studies e g mahadevan et al 2010 hamlington et al 2014 whitt and taylor 2017 callies and ferrari 2018 cooling at the surface can compete with the restratifying buoyancy flux generated by bi a downfront wind can create negative buoyancy flux counter restratification and inhibit bi and langmuir turbulence generated by the interaction between the stokes drift by surface waves and the wind can inject kinetic energy directly at small scales and enhance mixing at the front in several numerical models bi is found to grow albeit modified by the forcing and somewhat surprisingly even after the submesoscale is exposed to a storm in the study by whitt and taylor 2017 as discussed previously in this section observational studies reveal submesoscale features and dynamics similar to the findings in the present unforced simulation the net effect of the external forcing on submesoscale processes is dependent on the specifics of the problem and the strength of the forcing it will be of interest to systematically study how the submesoscale finescale properties and their mutual interaction change when other processes influence the mixed layer instability acknowledgments we are pleased to

24024,meteotsunamis associated with passing squall lines are often observed ahead of cold fronts during the winter in the northern gulf of mexico winter meteotsunamis occur simultaneously with wind speed variations 5 20 m s and sea level atmospheric pressure oscillations 1 6 hpa with periods between several minutes to 2 h in order to enhance understanding of meteotsunami generation and propagation the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst modeling system is applied to one of the most intense winter meteotsunamis measured in the northern gulf of mexico during the decade 2009 2018 the model verified with sea level and atmospheric observations is able to reproduce the timing and intensity of the wind at 10 m elevation and sea level atmospheric pressure fluctuations the mean bias between observed and measured wind speeds and atmospheric pressure are 1 73 m s and 0 63 hpa respectively the maximum meteotsunami elevation and its timing are successfully captured with a 7 underestimation of the maximum elevation the relative effect of atmospheric pressure and wind stress on meteotsunami generation is assessed with different numerical simulations results indicate that both wind stress and atmospheric pressure changes contributed to the generation of the meteotsunami wind stress was the dominant force in shallow waters 15 m in this application while the effects of atmospheric pressure disturbances dominated over areas with froude number close to one 40 m in this application during the passage of the squall line the sea surface became rougher in a sea state characterized by young and steep local ocean waves compared to a purely wind speed dependent roughness scheme the application of a wave dependent roughness parameterization improved the modeled meteotsunami maximum elevation by 37 keywords meteotsunamis squall line coawst wave dependent ocean surface roughness 1 introduction meteotsunamis are atmospherically induced water level oscillations with periods typically ranging from 5 min to 2 h monserrat et al 2006 these waves are generated by propagating atmospheric disturbances which are usually associated with frontal passages squalls pressure jumps and atmospheric gravity waves orliƒá 1980 monserrat et al 2006 until recently meteotsunamis were linked to specific geographic locations around the world however studies by pattiaratchi and wijeratne 2015 vilibiƒá et al 2016 and olabarrieta et al 2017 suggest that meteotsunamis might be more frequent and more widespread than previously thought these ocean waves can produce severe damage to the coastal environment destruction of infrastructure and potentially the loss of human life on june 21st 1978 6 m high waves struck vela luka bay croatia and caused severe flooding with us 7 million damage monserrat et al 2006 vilibiƒá and ≈°epiƒá 2009 ≈°epiƒá et al 2016 in the summer of 1954 7 people were killed by 3 m high meteotsunami waves in lake michigan platzman 1965 bechle and wu 2014 ≈°epiƒá and rabinovich 2014 the most severe event in the southern united states happened at daytona beach florida on july 4th 1992 at least 75 individuals were injured and 100 cars destroyed due to an unexpected 3 m wave churchill et al 1995 similar events have also been reported in the east coast of the united states pasquet et al 2013 pattiaratchi and wijeratne 2015 meteotsunami generation and propagation require 1 persistent atmospheric disturbances in the meteotsunami frequency band propagating over the ocean and 2 a resonant response of the ocean surface tsunamigenic atmospheric disturbances are usually associated with atmospheric gravity waves squall lines frontal passages pressure jumps and tropical cyclones e g tanaka 2010 vilibiƒá and ≈°epiƒá 2017 when atmospheric disturbances propagate in the form of mesoscale gravity waves their energy can be maintained over long distances through two mechanisms wave ducting and wave conditional instability of the second kind cisk e g lindzen 1974 powers and reed 1993 belu≈°iƒá et al 2007 vilibiƒá et al 2016 wave ducting occurs when a stable lower troposphere is capped by an unstable layer of mid troposphere and the energy of atmospheric gravity waves is maintained in the unstable layer ≈°epiƒá et al 2009a b horvath et al 2018 through wave cisk atmospheric gravity wave induced convergence strengthens convection which in turn provides energy for atmospheric gravity waves belu≈°iƒá et al 2007 houze 2004 vilibiƒá and ≈°epiƒá 2009 regarding the resonant response of the ocean surface one of the most well known mechanisms is proudman resonance proudman 1929 1953 that occurs when the traveling speed of the atmospheric disturbance atmospheric pressure or wind stress is close to the phase speed of a shallow water wave other types of resonance processes responsible for meteotsunami generation include greenspan resonance greenspan 1956 bechle and wu 2014 and shelf resonance monserrat et al 2006 vilibiƒá and ≈°epiƒá 2009 greenspan resonance is triggered under the condition that the speed of the atmospheric disturbance is close to one of the modes of edge waves propagating along the shoreline shelf resonance happens when the oscillation period of the atmospheric disturbances is equal to that of the natural period of oscillation of the shelf in most studies of meteotsunami generation the effects of wind stress are considered minor or secondary compared to the effects of atmospheric pressure disturbances gomis et al 1993 ≈°epiƒá et al 2015 ≈°epiƒá et al 2009a b vilibiƒá 2008 vilibiƒá et al 2004 for example orliƒá et al 2010 re investigated the meteotsunami event at vela luka bay in 1978 using atmospheric forcing in the form of a boxcar function their results indicated that atmospheric pressure disturbances were the main meteotsunami triggers wind stress played a secondary role except in shallow areas water depths of o 10 m ≈°epiƒá et al 2015 showed similar results in numerical experiments using idealized bell shaped atmospheric pressure and wind disturbances in the northern adriatic sea however there are several studies suggesting that wind stress might be as important as or even more relevant than atmospheric pressure for example mecking et al 2009 investigated the meteotsunami response to tropical storm helene in eastern canada and showed that wind stress was the dominant factor in the simulated water level response ≈°epiƒá and rabinovich 2014 analyzed the seiche oscillations generated by a derecho that swept over great lakes chesapeake bay and the united states atlantic coast in june 2012 their analysis showed that enhanced wind played a dominant role on the generation of meteotsunamis in chesapeake bay and both wind and pressure were essential to the meteotsunamis in the great lakes similar conclusion was drawn by bechle and wu 2014 in their re investigation of lake michigan meteotsunamis in 1954 in most studies about meteotsunami generation and propagation ocean models are forced with idealized atmospheric pressure disturbances traveling at a constant speed and direction choi et al 2014 horvath and vilibiƒá 2014 mercer 2002 vilibiƒá 2008 coupled atmosphere and ocean numerical models are able to reproduce and successfully simulate the generation and propagation of meteotsunamis in the balearic islands renault et al 2011 in lake michigan linares et al 2016 and in the adriatic sea denamiel et al 2019 nonetheless the numerical simulation and forecast of meteotsunamis remain challenging under realistic conditions in this study we focus on meteotsunamis associated with the passage of cold fronts in the northern gulf of mexico during winter and spring seasons typically from december to april continental polar and arctic air masses frequently reach low latitudes 30 32 n mixing with maritime tropical air masses and leading to enhanced baroclinicity and disturbances within the cold front rohli and vega 2015 these disturbances are manifested by squalls that propagate from west to east along the northern gulf of mexico although there are already descriptions of meteotsunamis triggered by winter mesoscale convective systems in the northern gulf of mexico e g sheremet et al 2016 olabarrieta et al 2017 the specific atmospheric conditions associated with the mechanisms of generation are still unclear olabarrieta et al 2017 identified that cold fronts that are favorable for meteotsunami generation in the northern gulf of mexico are characterized by both atmospheric pressure disturbances and wind stress divergences the relative role of these forces on the generation of meteotsunamis remains elusive air sea momentum exchange depends on the sea surface roughness which is usually considered a function of wind speed several studies based on field measurements e g anctil and donelan 1996 fisher et al 2015 and numerical modeling e g zhang and perrie 2001 bertin et al 2012 olabarrieta et al 2012 suggest that the sea surface becomes rougher with young and steep waves in the case of the generation of meteotsunamis the relevance and effects of the wave dependent ocean surface roughness are still unknown in this study we combine observations of water level and meteorological variables with numerical modeling to analyze 1 the relative role of atmospheric pressure and wind stress and 2 the effects of the wave dependent ocean roughness scheme on the generation of winter meteotsunamis in the northern gulf of mexico in section 2 we describe the observations and

northern gulf of mexico in the decade 2009 2018 to identify meteotsunamis generated by passing squall lines during winter seasons we analyzed available water level and atmospheric measurements wind

analyze the relative importance of surface wind stress and atmospheric pressure disturbances wave effects were inferred by comparing results from scenario 4 to scenario 1 scenarios 5 and 6 were specifically designed to determine the model sensitivity to wave dependent ocean roughness to explore the effects of wave dependent roughness schemes we compared the case with a purely wind speed dependent roughness scheme proposed by charnock charnock 1955 and three cases with wave dependent roughness schemes proposed by oost et al 2002 taylor and yelland 2001 and drennan et al 2005 in the

fig 1 we identified the largest water level anomalies observed yearly in each tide gauge 93 events considered in table sm1 of supplementary materials atmospheric observations were used to determine the strength of the atmospheric perturbations associated with the maximum yearly meteotsunamis water level anomalies with variations from trough to crest between 0 1 and 0 86 m were linked with both atmospheric pressure changes of 1 6 hpa and wind speed fluctuations of 5 20 m s in all stations the highest water level anomalies tended to be associated with the largest wind speed and or pressure anomalies as well as their fastest rates of change however the high variability between stations indicates that the intensities of the atmospheric anomalies and the water level responses varied locally water level anomalies atmospheric perturbations and their maximum rates of change for the 10 most intense events are shown in table 3 the largest meteotsunami with maximum height of 0 86 m was observed in panama city beach on march 28th 2014 a meteotsunami of similar height 0 8 m was measured in freshwater canal locks in 2016 the time series of the meteorological and water level observations of the 3 most intense events marked in red in table 3 are shown in fig 3 a c the atmospheric radar reflectivity mosaics associated with the three events are shown in fig 3 d f these meteotsunami events indicated by the gray boxes in fig 3 a c share similar atmospheric characteristics peaks in water level anomaly are associated with 1 abrupt variations of 10 m sustained wind speed 2 sudden sea level atmospheric pressure jumps 3 rapid 2 m air temperature drops for example the magnitudes of wind speed variation exceeded 10 m s in all of the three events pressure jumps 3 hpa were observed at panama city beach and new canal station fig 3 a c at freshwater canal locks and new canal station the air temperature decreased 5 c fig 3 b c from all the winter meteotsunamis observed in the northern gulf of mexico during the analysis period the panama city beach meteotsunami on march 28th 2014 had the greatest elevation reaching 0 86 m fig 3 a sustained wind speed changes of up to 16 3 m s an atmospheric pressure jump of 3 5 hpa and a drop of 2 c in air temperature were concurrent to the meteotsunami we selected this meteotsunami to further analyze the generation processes the relative role of the wind stress and atmospheric pressure and the effect of wave dependent ocean surface roughness using the coawst modeling system 4 2 numerical modeling of the meteotsunami at panama city beach in march 2014 4 2 1 atmospheric response wrf 4 2 1 1 model verification the major meteotsunami that impacted panama city beach was triggered by atmospheric disturbances generated by a mesoscale convective system mcs traveling along the northeastern coast of the gulf of mexico fig 4 a shows the atmospheric radar reflectivity mosaic at 17 15 gmt on march 28th 2014 the red band near 86 w between 30 and 31 n indicates a region with continuous convection and has an apparent leading edge with radar reflectivity of 60 dbz a trailing stratiform precipitation region which follows in the rear of the squall line is shown with radar reflectivity ranging from 30 to 50 dbz similarly the modeled radar reflectivity from scenario 1 on march 28th 17 18 gmt is illustrated in fig 4 b comparable patterns of an intense convective band and trailing stratiform regions in the same location were simulated by the modeling system the mean speeds and directions of the observed and modeled squall lines were analyzed using an image processing technique described in appendix a results identified mean speed and direction of the squall line as 20 m s and 120 from north simulated 10 m wind speed and sea level atmospheric pressure time series were compared with observations from the tide gauges and wave buoys shown in fig 1 in general modeled surface wind and atmospheric pressure generally agreed with observations at panama city beach modeled wind speeds and atmospheric pressure had root mean square errors rmses of 2 33 m s and 0 91 hpa table 4 most relevant the model reproduced successfully the maximum sustained wind speed 18 3 m s and the atmospheric pressure jump 3 5 hpa associated with the squall line on march 28th 17 18 gtm fig 5 a later in the time series on march 29th 12 00 gtm the model overestimated the wind speed and underestimated the atmospheric pressure model verifications at other stations are shown in fig 5 b errors and biases are included in table 4 fig 5 c shows the comparison of observed and simulated wind speed above the surface boundary layer 300 850 mb from 12 00 to 23 00 on mar 28th observational data were derived from ncep adp global upper air observational weather data which incorporates radiosondes and aircraft reports from the global telecommunications system gts the correlation coefficient derived from linear regression between the observations and model was 0 77 with a mean bias of 3 16 m s the main bias occurred in the region with wind speeds 8 m s overestimation of the relatively weak wind speed could be due to inaccuracies introduced by boundary conditions and different physics schemes in the model the inaccuracy of linear interpolation during data analysis and the inherent bias of measurements overall during the meteotsunami event simulated wind speed and sea level atmospheric pressure in panama city beach agreed well with the observations 4 2 1 2 modeled atmospheric characteristics of the passing squall line the squall line that triggered the meteotsunami event moved ahead of a cold frontal mcs that was associated with an upper level trough extending from the rocky mountains to the gulf of mexico the modeled atmospheric structure in scenario 1 captured the characteristics of the mcs cold and dry air intruded from the wnw and wedged under the warm and moist air of the gulf of mexico a surface cold pool blue region in fig 6 a developed when the squall line propagated toward panama city beach an air temperature difference of 2 c and wind convergence at the sea surface occurred at the squall interface fig 6 a the modeled sea level atmospheric pressure shows a region with a surface depression associated with the passage of the mcs fig 6 b within the convective region squall line the pattern of high low high pressure indicates the presence of atmospheric disturbances in the form of gravity waves a vertical cross section perpendicular to the squall line depicts the vertical structure of the wind and relative humidity fields along the thick red line in fig 4 b the warm and moist air in the gulf of mexico formed a deep layer of low level inflow indicated as llif in fig 7 a and b with relative humidity 90 fig 7 d the low level inflow was lifted up and formed a 2 m s updraft within the squall line fig 7 c and then diverged in the upper troposphere the convective cells within the squall line were triggered and fed by this ascending flow that contained unstable air with relatively high potential temperature a mid level inflow in the mid troposphere indicated as mlif in fig 7 a b exhibited a rear to front direction and took a sudden plunge downward 2 m s in the rear of the squall line fig 7 c the rear inflow contained cold and dry air with relative humidity 40 fig 7 d similar airflow patterns within mcs have been analyzed with radar measurements kingsmill and houze 1999 tanaka and ito 2016 and numerical simulations houze 2004 varlas et al 2018 of winter storms according to these studies the cold and dry air of the rear inflow plays an important role in developing and maintaining the mcs houze 2004 and its divergence on the surface contributes to enhance the cold pool and strengthen the convection within the mcs the atmospheric disturbances traveled with the squall line at around 20 m s over the coastal area where water depths range from 10 to 40 m the traveling speed of atmospheric disturbances approximated the phase speed of shallow water waves which satisfied the key condition for generation of meteotsunamis via the proudman resonance condition 4 2 2 ocean response roms and swan 4 2 2 1 model verification for the event considered water level measurements from noaa s tide gauge at panama city beach were used to verify the modeled oscillations induced by the meteotsunami scenario 1 measured water levels were high pass filtered using a lanczos filter with a cutoff period of 5 h to capture the water level anomalies associated with the passage of the meteotsunami as shown in fig 8 a modeled water level anomalies from scenario 1 agree with observations with a mean bias of 0 05 m table 4 the maximum measured meteotsunami elevation 0 86 m at 17 18 gmt march 28th was reproduced in scenario 1 with no time lag and a 0 06 m underestimation in amplitude on march 29th several water level jumps 0 2 m which were triggered by another less intense mcs not shown were also captured by the model in addition to panama city beach modeled water level anomalies were also compared with observations at pensacola and panama city over which the squall line swept fig 8 b c model errors and biases are shown in table 4 peaks of water level anomaly corresponding to the passing squalls at the considered locations were captured by the model scenario 1 although bias and inaccuracy existed these were possibly due to an imperfect bathymetry within the bays and estuaries fig 8 d f shows the comparisons between observed and simulated time series of wind wave characteristics scenario 1 errors and biases are included in table 4 observed significant wave heights and mean wave directions were derived from the national data buoy center at station 42036 42039 and 42012 the maximum significant wave height reached around 2 m when the squall was passing over the stations which were captured by the model the averaged mean bias over three stations for significant wave height is 0 19 m and 23 53 for mean wave direction calculated from table 4 4 2 2 2 relative importance of surface wind stress and sea level atmospheric pressure disturbances individual effects of wind stress and atmospheric pressure disturbances were inferred by comparing modeled water level anomalies from scenario 1 to those from scenarios 2 and 3 the modeled maximum meteotsunami elevation was 0 38 m high with only wind stress forcing fig 9 b and was 0 24 m with only atmospheric pressure disturbances fig 9 c the simulation with both wind stresses and atmospheric disturbances reproduced the maximum water level anomaly of 0 8 m fig 9 a close to the observations fig 8 a the surface wind stress explained 47 5 of the maximum meteotsunami elevation and the atmospheric pressure disturbances contributed 30 furthermore the linear summation of wind stress and atmospheric pressure contributions 0 62 m is 0 18 m lower than the maximum meteotsunami elevation under combined effects 0 8 m this gap is attributed to the non linear interaction between wind and atmospheric pressure disturbances over shallow regions where waves steepen and increase their asymmetry bechle and wu 2014 vilibiƒá 2008 fig 10 shows snapshots of modeled water level anomaly at 17 18 gmt and locations of maximum meteotsunami elevation from 17 00 to 17 24 gtm in scenarios 1 2 and 3 under the combined effects of atmospheric pressure disturbances and wind stress maximum meteotsunami elevations show a band with values 0 6 m fig 10 a the location of the maximum meteotsunami elevation traveled onshore from 17 00 to 17 24 gtm black dots in fig 10 d however after removing the forcing of atmospheric pressure scenario 2 and wind stress scenario 3 meteotsunami heights reduced in both scenarios and showed different spatial distributions in scenario 2 maximum meteotsunami elevations reduced about 50 the maxima concentrated in relatively shallower areas fig 10 b and decreased offshore in this case the maximum meteotsunami anomalies were observed near the coastline red dots in fig 10 d in scenario 3 maximum values of up to 0 5 m were located offshore and decreased toward the coast fig 10 c maximum meteotsunami elevations were observed offshore blue dots in fig 10 d along the line with froude number close to one comparing scenarios 2 and 3 with scenario 1 both wind stress and atmospheric pressure disturbances contributed to total meteotsunami elevations however the impact of surface wind stress was more relevant in shallow areas while atmospheric pressure disturbances were more prominent offshore the combined effects of wind stress and atmospheric pressure disturbances along with their non linear interactions resulted in the strengthened ocean response 4 2 2 3 effects of wave dependent roughness schemes wind waves can affect the air sea momentum exchange by modifying the sea surface roughness in the case analyzed intense atmospheric disturbances generated young and steep waves in a fetch limited environment which resulted in an increase of the surface roughness this inspired us to investigate the role of wave dependent roughness parameterizations on the numerical simulation of meteotsunamis with that aim a comparison was conducted between scenario 4 table 2 which was applied with a purely wind speed dependent roughness scheme and the reference scenario scenario 1 which used a wave dependent roughness scheme proposed by oost et al 2002 eq 1 modeled maximum meteotsunami elevation from scenario 4 0 43 m was about 50 smaller compared to that of scenario 1 0 8 m and the observation 0 86 m fig 11 a the underestimation of maximum meteotsunami elevation in scenario 4 was associated with the reduced surface wind stress the maximum southward wind stress in scenario 1 was 0 3 n m2 larger than that of scenario 4 and the maximum of eastward wind stress almost doubled due to the wave dependent roughness scheme coare oost fig 11 b previous studies donelan 1990 edson et al 2013 fisher et al 2015 have shown that fully developed sea occurs when u c p 0 03 simulated maximum wave age was 0 09 at the time of meteotsunami appearance fig 12 b which indicates a young sea state by applying eq 1 increased magnitudes of u c p and wind wave wavelength resulted in ocean surface roughness heights up to 0 5 cm fig 12 b overall in such fetch limited environment with complex sea state a wave dependent roughness scheme reproduced maximum meteotsunami elevations better than a purely wind speed dependent roughness scheme compared to a purely wind speed dependent roughness scheme the application of a wave dependent roughness parameterization resulted in a 37 improvement of the modeled maximum meteotsunami elevation in addition to the chnk scenario 4 and coare oost scenario 1 schemes we tested and compared the wave dependent roughness proposed by taylor and yelland 2001 scenario 5 and drennan et al 2005 scenario 6 in these two closure models the ocean surface roughness depends on wave steepness and wave age respectively eqs 3 4 as shown in fig 13 the modeled maximum meteotsunami elevations in scenario 5 and 6 are 0 67 m and 0 70 m at 17 18 gtm march 28th which are smaller than that of scenario 1 however all experiments with wave dependent roughness closures scenario 1 5 6 show better match with the observations compared with that using a pure wind speed dependent roughness scheme scenario 4 for each scenario the difference in ocean response is attributed to the difference in wind stress and roughness height surface roughness parameterization with coare oost scenario 1 provided the best model skill with highest wind stress and roughness height 5 discussion although meteotsunamis are ubiquitous around the world they show local characteristics under different atmospheric and morphological conditions in this study we focused on meteotsunamis generated by passing winter cold fronts in the northern gulf of mexico in this region sufficient heat and moisture sources and a shallow continental shelf provide favorable conditions for generation of meteotsunamis olabarrieta et al 2017 the analysis of water level time series of the past ten years section 4 1 showed that the largest water level anomalies observed during winter are linked to high frequency variations of both wind speed and atmospheric pressure as shown in section 2 the meteotsunami events triggered by winter cold fronts in the northern gulf of mexico share similar characteristics the passage of squalls produces intense atmospheric pressure jumps sudden changes in the sustained wind speed and direction and air temperature changes up to 4 c stronger meteotsunami events tend to be associated with atmospheric disturbances with larger intensity and faster variation rates since meteotsunami amplification depends on the bathymetry and on the speed and direction of the atmospheric disturbances the relation between the strength of the atmospheric disturbances and the elevation of the meteotsunamis is not direct in most of the meteotsunami events described in literature atmospheric pressure disturbances have been considered as the main driving force of meteotsunamis wind stress was typically disregarded because of two main reasons first that wind speeds were too small to create influential wind stress compared to the effects of atmospheric pressure jumps second that water depth close to the coast is not shallow enough for the dynamic effect of wind stress which is inversely proportional to water depth to become comparable to that from atmospheric pressure for example in the case of the meteotsunami at vela luka bay croatia in 1978 the maximum gust speed was around 10 m s with an atmospheric pressure disturbance up to 3 hpa another meteotsunami event in the adriatic sea in 2003 showed an 8 hpa atmospheric pressure jump with a 6 m s peak wind speed monserrat et al 2006 vilibiƒá et al 2004 in such cases wind stress effects were relatively minor compared to those of atmospheric pressure jumps and could be reasonably neglected furthermore due to complex topography in those areas water levels were substantially amplified through harbor resonance the response in panama city beach seems to be different panama city beach is located on a shallow continental shelf there are no featured harbors or islands around for harbor resonance to develop more important frequent squalls sweep over the northern gulf of mexico during winter and spring seasons the peak gust speed associated with these squalls can exceed 20 m s as shown in fig 3 in this study we demonstrate that winter meteotsunami events in the gulf of mexico are triggered by atmospheric pressure and wind stress disturbances while the effects of the atmospheric pressure disturbances are dominant in deeper water depths 40 m wind stress plays a dominant role in shallow 15 m regions mecking et al 2009 obtained similar results in the simulation of meteotsunami response to tropical storm helene they found that when storm helene was traveling toward the nnw intensified northward wind stress played a dominant role in enhancing water level response our numerical results also indicate that the non linear interactions between the wind stress atmospheric pressure and water levels contributed 22 5 to the total meteotsunami elevation in the event analyzed these interactions are still not well understood and require further analysis although the numerical analysis presented in this study focused on one specific event the meteotsunami event observed in panama city beach in march 2014 meteotsunamis generated by the passage of prefrontal squalls share similar characteristics such similar behavior suggests that the processes described here might be consistent with most winter meteotsunamis exceptions may exist in locations of inner bays and estuaries where harbor resonance may become influential in this study because the tidal range at panama city beach is typically 0 3 m and predicted tidal amplitude was 0 11 m at the time when the meteotsunami happened tidal forcing was not included in the simulations however thomson et al 2009 indicated that tides were important when considering the impact of meteotsunamis on coastal british columbia and washington state wijeratne et al 2010 found that meteotsunami amplitudes were slightly related to the phase of the tidal cycle water level tended to be slightly larger when the change in wind direction coincided with high tide the interaction between meteotsunami waves and tides shall be a topic of future study 6 conclusions in this study we analyzed the main physical triggers of winter meteotsunamis in the northern gulf of mexico in particular an intense meteotsunami event at panama city beach in 2014 was investigated with the coawst modeling system mesoscale atmospheric characteristics generation and propagation of meteotsunami waves were captured by the coupled model application to understand the meteotsunami generation mechanisms we analyzed the relative importance of atmospheric pressure disturbances and wind stress results indicated that both forcing mechanisms were relevant wind stress was the dominant driving force over depths from 10 to 40 m atmospheric pressure disturbances dominated over deeper areas along regions of froude numbers close to one the nonlinear interactions between wind stress and atmospheric pressure disturbance also played an important role in enhancing meteotsunami heights in addition we explored the effects of surface waves on the generation of meteotsunamis during the event considered young and steep waves were created by the passing squall which increased frictional coupling between the ocean and atmosphere under such severe weather conditions wave dependent surface roughness schemes improve estimates of maximum meteotsunami elevations than the purely wind speed dependent scheme in the case analyzed a wave dependent ocean roughness scheme was necessary to reproduce the observed maximum meteotsunami elevations in recent years there is growing attention on meteotsunamis in the gulf of mexico and on their potential threats to local environments such as damage to the fragile ecosystem of louisiana s wetlands beach erosion and flooding the present study

24024,meteotsunamis associated with passing squall lines are often observed ahead of cold fronts during the winter in the northern gulf of mexico winter meteotsunamis occur simultaneously with wind speed variations 5 20 m s and sea level atmospheric pressure oscillations 1 6 hpa with periods between several minutes to 2 h in order to enhance understanding of meteotsunami generation and propagation the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst modeling system is applied to one of the most intense winter meteotsunamis measured in the northern gulf of mexico during the decade 2009 2018 the model verified with sea level and atmospheric observations is able to reproduce the timing and intensity of the wind at 10 m elevation and sea level atmospheric pressure fluctuations the mean bias between observed and measured wind speeds and atmospheric pressure are 1 73 m s and 0 63 hpa respectively the maximum meteotsunami elevation and its timing are successfully captured with a 7 underestimation of the maximum elevation the relative effect of atmospheric pressure and wind stress on meteotsunami generation is assessed with different numerical simulations results indicate that both wind stress and atmospheric pressure changes contributed to the generation of the meteotsunami wind stress was the dominant force in shallow waters 15 m in this application while the effects of atmospheric pressure disturbances dominated over areas with froude number close to one 40 m in this application during the passage of the squall line the sea surface became rougher in a sea state characterized by young and steep local ocean waves compared to a purely wind speed dependent roughness scheme the application of a wave dependent roughness parameterization improved the modeled meteotsunami maximum elevation by 37 keywords meteotsunamis squall line coawst wave dependent ocean surface roughness 1 introduction meteotsunamis are atmospherically induced water level oscillations with periods typically ranging from 5 min to 2 h monserrat et al 2006 these waves are generated by propagating atmospheric disturbances which are usually associated with frontal passages squalls pressure jumps and atmospheric gravity waves orliƒá 1980 monserrat et al 2006 until recently meteotsunamis were linked to specific geographic locations around the world however studies by pattiaratchi and wijeratne 2015 vilibiƒá et al 2016 and olabarrieta et al 2017 suggest that meteotsunamis might be more frequent and more widespread than previously thought these ocean waves can produce severe damage to the coastal environment destruction of infrastructure and potentially the loss of human life on june 21st 1978 6 m high waves struck vela luka bay croatia and caused severe flooding with us 7 million damage monserrat et al 2006 vilibiƒá and ≈°epiƒá 2009 ≈°epiƒá et al 2016 in the summer of 1954 7 people were killed by 3 m high meteotsunami waves in lake michigan platzman 1965 bechle and wu 2014 ≈°epiƒá and rabinovich 2014 the most severe event in the southern united states happened at daytona beach florida on july 4th 1992 at least 75 individuals were injured and 100 cars destroyed due to an unexpected 3 m wave churchill et al 1995 similar events have also been reported in the east coast of the united states pasquet et al 2013 pattiaratchi and wijeratne 2015 meteotsunami generation and propagation require 1 persistent atmospheric disturbances in the meteotsunami frequency band propagating over the ocean and 2 a resonant response of the ocean surface tsunamigenic atmospheric disturbances are usually associated with atmospheric gravity waves squall lines frontal passages pressure jumps and tropical cyclones e g tanaka 2010 vilibiƒá and ≈°epiƒá 2017 when atmospheric disturbances propagate in the form of mesoscale gravity waves their energy can be maintained over long distances through two mechanisms wave ducting and wave conditional instability of the second kind cisk e g lindzen 1974 powers and reed 1993 belu≈°iƒá et al 2007 vilibiƒá et al 2016 wave ducting occurs when a stable lower troposphere is capped by an unstable layer of mid troposphere and the energy of atmospheric gravity waves is maintained in the unstable layer ≈°epiƒá et al 2009a b horvath et al 2018 through wave cisk atmospheric gravity wave induced convergence strengthens convection which in turn provides energy for atmospheric gravity waves belu≈°iƒá et al 2007 houze 2004 vilibiƒá and ≈°epiƒá 2009 regarding the resonant response of the ocean surface one of the most well known mechanisms is proudman resonance proudman 1929 1953 that occurs when the traveling speed of the atmospheric disturbance atmospheric pressure or wind stress is close to the phase speed of a shallow water wave other types of resonance processes responsible for meteotsunami generation include greenspan resonance greenspan 1956 bechle and wu 2014 and shelf resonance monserrat et al 2006 vilibiƒá and ≈°epiƒá 2009 greenspan resonance is triggered under the condition that the speed of the atmospheric disturbance is close to one of the modes of edge waves propagating along the shoreline shelf resonance happens when the oscillation period of the atmospheric disturbances is equal to that of the natural period of oscillation of the shelf in most studies of meteotsunami generation the effects of wind stress are considered minor or secondary compared to the effects of atmospheric pressure disturbances gomis et al 1993 ≈°epiƒá et al 2015 ≈°epiƒá et al 2009a b vilibiƒá 2008 vilibiƒá et al 2004 for example orliƒá et al 2010 re investigated the meteotsunami event at vela luka bay in 1978 using atmospheric forcing in the form of a boxcar function their results indicated that atmospheric pressure disturbances were the main meteotsunami triggers wind stress played a secondary role except in shallow areas water depths of o 10 m ≈°epiƒá et al 2015 showed similar results in numerical experiments using idealized bell shaped atmospheric pressure and wind disturbances in the northern adriatic sea however there are several studies suggesting that wind stress might be as important as or even more relevant than atmospheric pressure for example mecking et al 2009 investigated the meteotsunami response to tropical storm helene in eastern canada and showed that wind stress was the dominant factor in the simulated water level response ≈°epiƒá and rabinovich 2014 analyzed the seiche oscillations generated by a derecho that swept over great lakes chesapeake bay and the united states atlantic coast in june 2012 their analysis showed that enhanced wind played a dominant role on the generation of meteotsunamis in chesapeake bay and both wind and pressure were essential to the meteotsunamis in the great lakes similar conclusion was drawn by bechle and wu 2014 in their re investigation of lake michigan meteotsunamis in 1954 in most studies about meteotsunami generation and propagation ocean models are forced with idealized atmospheric pressure disturbances traveling at a constant speed and direction choi et al 2014 horvath and vilibiƒá 2014 mercer 2002 vilibiƒá 2008 coupled atmosphere and ocean numerical models are able to reproduce and successfully simulate the generation and propagation of meteotsunamis in the balearic islands renault et al 2011 in lake michigan linares et al 2016 and in the adriatic sea denamiel et al 2019 nonetheless the numerical simulation and forecast of meteotsunamis remain challenging under realistic conditions in this study we focus on meteotsunamis associated with the passage of cold fronts in the northern gulf of mexico during winter and spring seasons typically from december to april continental polar and arctic air masses frequently reach low latitudes 30 32 n mixing with maritime tropical air masses and leading to enhanced baroclinicity and disturbances within the cold front rohli and vega 2015 these disturbances are manifested by squalls that propagate from west to east along the northern gulf of mexico although there are already descriptions of meteotsunamis triggered by winter mesoscale convective systems in the northern gulf of mexico e g sheremet et al 2016 olabarrieta et al 2017 the specific atmospheric conditions associated with the mechanisms of generation are still unclear olabarrieta et al 2017 identified that cold fronts that are favorable for meteotsunami generation in the northern gulf of mexico are characterized by both atmospheric pressure disturbances and wind stress divergences the relative role of these forces on the generation of meteotsunamis remains elusive air sea momentum exchange depends on the sea surface roughness which is usually considered a function of wind speed several studies based on field measurements e g anctil and donelan 1996 fisher et al 2015 and numerical modeling e g zhang and perrie 2001 bertin et al 2012 olabarrieta et al 2012 suggest that the sea surface becomes rougher with young and steep waves in the case of the generation of meteotsunamis the relevance and effects of the wave dependent ocean surface roughness are still unknown in this study we combine observations of water level and meteorological variables with numerical modeling to analyze 1 the relative role of atmospheric pressure and wind stress and 2 the effects of the wave dependent ocean roughness scheme on the generation of winter meteotsunamis in the northern gulf of mexico in section 2 we describe the observations and

northern gulf of mexico in the decade 2009 2018 to identify meteotsunamis generated by passing squall lines during winter seasons we analyzed available water level and atmospheric measurements wind

specifically designed to determine the model sensitivity to wave dependent ocean roughness to explore the effects of wave dependent roughness schemes we compared the case with a purely wind speed

fig 1 we identified the largest water level anomalies observed yearly in each tide gauge 93 events considered in table sm1 of supplementary materials atmospheric observations were used to determine the strength of the atmospheric perturbations associated with the maximum yearly meteotsunamis water level anomalies with variations from trough to crest between 0 1 and 0 86 m were linked with both atmospheric pressure changes of 1 6 hpa and wind speed fluctuations of 5 20 m s in all stations the highest water level anomalies tended to be associated with the largest wind speed and or pressure anomalies as well as their fastest rates of change however the high variability between stations indicates that the intensities of the atmospheric anomalies and the water level responses varied locally water level anomalies atmospheric perturbations and their maximum rates of change for the 10 most intense events are shown in table 3 the largest meteotsunami with maximum height of 0 86 m was observed in panama city beach on march 28th 2014 a meteotsunami of similar height 0 8 m was measured in freshwater canal locks in 2016 the time series of the meteorological and water level observations of the 3 most intense events marked in red in table 3 are shown in fig 3 a c the atmospheric radar reflectivity mosaics associated with the three events are shown in fig 3 d f these meteotsunami events indicated by the gray boxes in fig 3 a c share similar atmospheric characteristics peaks in water level anomaly are associated with 1 abrupt variations of 10 m sustained wind speed

observed at panama city beach and new canal station fig 3 a c at freshwater canal locks and new canal station the air temperature decreased 5 c fig 3 b c from all the winter meteotsunamis observed in the northern gulf of mexico during the analysis period the panama city beach meteotsunami on march 28th 2014 had the greatest elevation reaching 0 86 m fig 3 a sustained wind speed changes of up to 16 3 m s an atmospheric pressure jump of 3 5 hpa and a drop of 2 c in air temperature were concurrent to the meteotsunami we selected this meteotsunami to further analyze the generation processes the relative role of the wind stress and atmospheric pressure and the effect of wave dependent ocean surface roughness using the coawst modeling system 4 2 numerical modeling of the meteotsunami at panama city beach in march 2014 4 2 1 atmospheric response wrf 4 2 1 1 model verification the major meteotsunami that impacted panama city beach was triggered by atmospheric disturbances generated by a mesoscale convective system mcs traveling along the northeastern coast of the gulf of mexico fig 4 a shows the atmospheric radar reflectivity mosaic at 17 15 gmt on march 28th 2014 the red band near 86 w between 30 and 31 n indicates a region with continuous convection and has an apparent leading edge with radar reflectivity of 60 dbz a trailing stratiform precipitation region which follows in the rear of the squall line is shown with radar reflectivity ranging from 30 to 50 dbz similarly the modeled radar reflectivity from scenario 1 on march 28th 17 18 gmt is illustrated in fig 4 b comparable patterns of an intense convective band and trailing stratiform regions in the same location were simulated by the modeling system the mean speeds and directions of the observed and modeled squall lines were analyzed using an image processing technique described in appendix a results identified mean speed and direction of the squall line as 20 m s and 120 from north simulated 10 m wind speed and sea level atmospheric pressure time series were compared with observations from the tide gauges and wave buoys shown in fig 1 in general modeled surface wind and atmospheric pressure generally agreed with observations at panama city beach modeled wind speeds and atmospheric pressure had root mean square errors rmses of 2 33 m s and 0 91 hpa table 4 most relevant the model reproduced successfully the maximum sustained wind speed 18 3 m s and the atmospheric pressure jump 3 5 hpa associated with the squall line on march 28th 17 18 gtm fig 5 a later in the time series on march 29th 12 00 gtm the model overestimated the wind speed and underestimated the atmospheric pressure model verifications at other stations are shown in fig 5 b errors and biases are included in table 4 fig 5 c shows the comparison of observed and simulated wind speed above the surface boundary layer 300 850 mb from 12 00 to 23 00 on mar 28th observational data were derived from ncep adp global upper air observational weather data which incorporates radiosondes and aircraft reports from the global telecommunications system gts the correlation coefficient derived from linear regression between the observations and model was 0 77 with a mean bias of 3 16 m s the main bias occurred in the region with wind speeds 8 m s overestimation of the relatively weak wind speed could be due to inaccuracies introduced by boundary conditions and different physics schemes in the model the inaccuracy of linear interpolation during data analysis and the inherent bias of measurements overall during the meteotsunami event simulated wind speed and sea level atmospheric pressure in panama city beach agreed well with the observations 4 2 1 2 modeled atmospheric characteristics of the passing squall line the squall line that triggered the meteotsunami event moved ahead of a cold frontal mcs that was associated with an upper level trough extending from the rocky mountains to the gulf of mexico the modeled atmospheric structure in scenario 1 captured the characteristics of the mcs cold and dry air intruded from the wnw and wedged under the warm and moist air of the gulf of mexico a surface cold pool blue region in fig 6 a developed when the squall line propagated toward panama city beach an air temperature difference of 2 c and wind convergence at the sea surface occurred at the squall interface fig 6 a the modeled sea level atmospheric pressure shows a region with a surface depression associated with the passage of the mcs fig 6 b within the convective region squall line the pattern of high low high pressure indicates the presence of atmospheric disturbances in the form of gravity waves a vertical cross section perpendicular to the squall line depicts the vertical structure of the wind and relative humidity fields along the thick red line in fig 4 b the warm and moist air in the gulf of mexico formed a deep layer of low level inflow indicated as llif in fig 7 a and b with relative humidity 90 fig 7 d the low level inflow was lifted up and formed a 2 m s updraft within the squall line fig 7 c and then diverged in the upper troposphere the convective cells within the squall line were triggered and fed by this ascending flow that contained unstable air with relatively high potential temperature a mid level inflow in the mid troposphere indicated as mlif in fig 7 a b exhibited a rear to front direction and took a sudden plunge downward 2 m s in the rear of the squall line fig 7 c the rear inflow contained cold and dry air with relative humidity 40 fig 7 d similar airflow patterns within mcs have been analyzed with radar measurements kingsmill and houze 1999 tanaka and ito 2016 and numerical simulations houze 2004 varlas et al 2018 of winter storms according to these studies the cold and dry air of the rear inflow plays an important role in developing and maintaining the mcs houze 2004 and its divergence on the surface contributes to enhance the cold pool and strengthen the convection within the mcs the atmospheric disturbances traveled with the squall line at around 20 m s over the coastal area where water depths range from 10 to 40 m the traveling speed of atmospheric disturbances approximated the phase speed of shallow water waves which satisfied the key condition for generation of meteotsunamis via the proudman resonance condition 4 2 2 ocean response roms and swan 4 2 2 1 model verification for the event considered water level measurements from noaa s tide gauge at panama city beach were used to verify the modeled oscillations induced by the meteotsunami scenario 1 measured water levels were high pass filtered using a lanczos filter with a cutoff period of 5 h to capture the water level anomalies associated with the passage of the meteotsunami as shown in fig 8 a modeled water level anomalies from scenario 1 agree with observations with a mean bias of 0 05 m table 4 the maximum measured meteotsunami elevation 0 86 m at 17 18 gmt march 28th was reproduced in scenario 1 with no time lag and a 0 06 m underestimation in amplitude on march 29th several water level jumps 0 2 m which were triggered by another less intense mcs not shown were also captured by the model in addition to panama city beach modeled water level anomalies were also compared with observations at pensacola and panama city over which the squall line swept fig 8 b c model errors and biases are shown in table 4 peaks of water level anomaly corresponding to the passing squalls at the considered locations were captured by the model scenario 1 although bias and inaccuracy existed these were possibly due to an imperfect bathymetry within the bays and estuaries fig 8 d f shows the comparisons between observed and simulated time series of wind wave characteristics scenario 1 errors and biases are included in table 4 observed significant wave heights and mean wave directions were derived from the national data buoy center at station 42036 42039 and 42012 the maximum significant wave height reached around 2 m when the squall was passing over the stations which were captured by the model the averaged mean bias over three stations for significant wave height is 0 19 m and 23 53 for mean wave direction calculated from table 4 4 2 2 2 relative importance of surface wind stress and sea level atmospheric pressure disturbances individual effects of wind stress and atmospheric pressure disturbances were inferred by comparing modeled water level anomalies from scenario 1 to those from scenarios 2 and 3 the modeled maximum meteotsunami elevation was 0 38 m high with only wind stress forcing fig 9 b and was 0 24 m with only atmospheric pressure disturbances fig 9 c the simulation with both wind stresses and atmospheric disturbances reproduced the maximum water level anomaly of 0 8 m fig 9 a close to the observations fig 8 a the surface wind stress explained 47 5 of the maximum meteotsunami elevation and the atmospheric pressure disturbances contributed 30 furthermore the linear summation of wind stress and atmospheric pressure contributions 0 62 m is 0 18 m lower than the maximum meteotsunami elevation under combined effects 0 8 m this gap is attributed to the non linear interaction between wind and atmospheric pressure disturbances over shallow regions where waves steepen and increase their asymmetry bechle and wu 2014 vilibiƒá 2008 fig 10 shows snapshots of modeled water level anomaly at 17 18 gmt and locations of maximum meteotsunami elevation from 17 00 to 17 24 gtm in scenarios 1 2 and 3 under the combined effects of atmospheric pressure disturbances and wind stress maximum meteotsunami elevations show a band with values 0 6 m fig 10 a the location of the maximum meteotsunami elevation traveled onshore from 17 00 to 17 24 gtm black dots in fig 10 d however after removing the forcing of atmospheric pressure scenario 2 and wind stress scenario 3 meteotsunami heights reduced in both scenarios and showed different spatial distributions in scenario 2 maximum meteotsunami elevations reduced about 50 the maxima concentrated in relatively shallower areas fig 10 b and decreased offshore in this case the maximum meteotsunami anomalies were observed near the coastline red dots in fig 10 d in scenario 3 maximum values of up to 0 5 m were located offshore and decreased toward the coast fig 10 c maximum meteotsunami elevations were observed offshore blue dots in fig 10 d along the line with froude number close to one comparing scenarios 2 and 3 with scenario 1 both wind stress and atmospheric pressure disturbances contributed to total meteotsunami elevations however the impact of surface wind stress was more relevant in shallow areas while atmospheric pressure disturbances were more prominent offshore the combined effects of wind stress and atmospheric pressure disturbances along with their non linear interactions resulted in the strengthened ocean response 4 2 2 3 effects of wave dependent roughness schemes wind waves can affect the air sea momentum exchange by modifying the sea surface roughness in the case analyzed intense atmospheric disturbances generated young and steep waves in a fetch limited environment which resulted in an increase of the surface roughness this inspired us to investigate the role of wave dependent roughness parameterizations on the numerical simulation of meteotsunamis with that aim a comparison was conducted between scenario 4 table 2 which was applied with a purely wind speed dependent roughness scheme and the reference scenario scenario 1 which used a wave dependent roughness scheme proposed by oost et al 2002 eq 1 modeled maximum meteotsunami elevation from scenario 4 0 43 m was about 50 smaller compared to that of scenario 1 0 8 m and the observation 0 86 m fig 11 a the underestimation of maximum meteotsunami elevation in scenario 4 was associated with the reduced surface wind stress the maximum southward wind stress in scenario 1 was 0 3 n m2 larger than that of scenario 4 and the maximum of eastward wind stress almost doubled due to the wave dependent roughness scheme coare oost fig 11 b previous studies donelan 1990 edson et al 2013 fisher et al 2015 have shown that fully developed sea occurs when u c p 0 03 simulated maximum wave age was 0 09 at the time of meteotsunami appearance fig 12 b which indicates a young sea state by applying eq 1 increased magnitudes of u c p and wind wave wavelength resulted in ocean surface roughness heights up to 0 5 cm fig 12 b overall in such fetch limited environment with complex sea state a wave dependent roughness scheme reproduced maximum meteotsunami elevations better than a purely wind speed dependent roughness scheme compared to a purely wind speed dependent roughness scheme the application of a wave dependent roughness parameterization resulted in a 37 improvement of the modeled maximum meteotsunami elevation in addition to the chnk scenario 4 and coare oost scenario 1 schemes we tested and compared the wave dependent roughness proposed by taylor and yelland 2001 scenario 5 and drennan et al 2005 scenario 6 in these two closure models the ocean surface roughness depends on wave steepness and wave age respectively eqs 3 4 as shown in fig 13 the modeled maximum meteotsunami elevations in scenario 5 and 6 are 0 67 m and 0 70 m at 17 18 gtm march 28th which are smaller than that of scenario 1 however all experiments with wave dependent roughness closures scenario 1 5 6 show better match with the observations compared with that using a pure wind speed dependent roughness scheme scenario 4 for each scenario the difference in ocean response is attributed to the difference in wind stress and roughness height surface roughness parameterization with coare oost scenario 1 provided the best model skill with highest wind stress and roughness height 5 discussion although meteotsunamis are ubiquitous around the world they show local characteristics under different atmospheric and morphological conditions in this study we focused on meteotsunamis generated by passing winter cold fronts in the northern gulf of mexico in this region sufficient heat and moisture sources and a shallow continental shelf provide favorable conditions for generation of meteotsunamis olabarrieta et al 2017 the analysis of water level time series of the past ten years section 4 1 showed that the largest water level anomalies observed during winter are linked to high frequency variations of both wind speed and atmospheric pressure as shown in section 2 the meteotsunami events triggered by winter cold fronts in the northern gulf of mexico share similar characteristics the passage of squalls produces intense atmospheric pressure jumps sudden changes in the sustained wind speed and direction and air temperature changes up to 4 c stronger meteotsunami events tend to be associated with atmospheric disturbances with larger intensity and faster variation rates since meteotsunami amplification depends on the bathymetry and on the speed and direction of the atmospheric disturbances the relation between the strength of the atmospheric disturbances and the elevation of the meteotsunamis is not direct in most of the meteotsunami events described in literature atmospheric pressure disturbances have been considered as the main driving force of meteotsunamis wind stress was typically disregarded because of two main reasons first that wind speeds were too small to create influential wind stress compared to the effects of atmospheric pressure jumps second that water depth close to the coast is not shallow enough for the dynamic effect of wind stress which is inversely proportional to water depth to become comparable to that from atmospheric pressure for example in the case of the meteotsunami at vela luka bay croatia in 1978 the maximum gust speed was around 10 m s with an atmospheric pressure disturbance up to 3 hpa another meteotsunami event in the adriatic sea in 2003 showed an 8 hpa atmospheric pressure jump with a 6 m s peak wind speed monserrat et al 2006 vilibiƒá et al 2004 in such cases wind stress effects were relatively minor compared to those of atmospheric pressure jumps and could be reasonably neglected furthermore due to complex topography in those areas water levels were substantially amplified through harbor resonance the response in panama city beach seems to be different panama city beach is located on a shallow continental shelf there are no featured harbors or islands around for harbor resonance to develop more important frequent squalls sweep over the northern gulf of mexico during winter and spring seasons the peak gust speed associated with these squalls can exceed 20 m s as shown in fig 3 in this study we demonstrate that winter meteotsunami events in the gulf of mexico are triggered by atmospheric pressure and wind stress disturbances while the effects of the atmospheric pressure disturbances are dominant in deeper water depths 40 m wind stress plays a dominant role in shallow 15 m regions mecking et al 2009 obtained similar results in the simulation of meteotsunami response to tropical storm helene they found that when storm helene was traveling toward the nnw intensified northward wind stress played a dominant role in enhancing water level response our numerical results also indicate that the non linear interactions between the wind stress atmospheric pressure and water levels contributed 22 5 to the total meteotsunami elevation in the event analyzed these interactions are still not well understood and require further analysis although the numerical analysis presented in this study focused on one specific event the meteotsunami event observed in panama city beach in march 2014 meteotsunamis generated by the passage of prefrontal squalls share similar characteristics such similar behavior suggests that the processes described here might be consistent with most winter meteotsunamis exceptions may exist in locations of inner bays and estuaries where harbor resonance may become influential in this study because the tidal range at panama city beach is typically 0 3 m and predicted tidal amplitude was 0 11 m at the time when the meteotsunami happened tidal forcing was not included in the simulations however thomson et al 2009 indicated that tides were important when considering the impact of meteotsunamis on coastal british columbia and washington state wijeratne et al 2010 found that meteotsunami amplitudes were slightly related to the phase of the tidal cycle water level tended to be slightly larger when the change in wind direction coincided with high tide the interaction between meteotsunami waves and tides shall be a topic of future study 6 conclusions in this study we analyzed the main physical triggers of winter meteotsunamis in the northern gulf of mexico in particular an intense meteotsunami event at panama city beach in 2014 was investigated with the coawst modeling system mesoscale atmospheric characteristics generation and propagation of meteotsunami waves were captured by the coupled model application to understand the meteotsunami generation mechanisms we analyzed the relative importance of atmospheric pressure disturbances and wind stress results indicated that both forcing mechanisms were relevant wind stress was the dominant driving force over depths from 10 to 40 m atmospheric pressure disturbances dominated over deeper areas along regions of froude numbers close to one the nonlinear interactions between wind stress and atmospheric pressure disturbance also played an important role in enhancing meteotsunami heights in addition we explored the effects of surface waves on the generation of meteotsunamis during the event considered young and steep waves were created by the passing squall which increased frictional coupling between the ocean and atmosphere under such severe weather conditions wave dependent surface roughness schemes improve estimates of maximum meteotsunami elevations than the purely wind speed dependent scheme in the case analyzed a wave dependent ocean roughness scheme was necessary to reproduce the observed maximum meteotsunami elevations in recent years there is growing attention on meteotsunamis in the gulf of mexico and on their potential threats to local environments such as damage to the fragile ecosystem of louisiana s wetlands beach erosion and flooding the present study
