7490,rainfall infiltration on hillslopes is an important issue in hydrology which is related to many environmental problems such as flood soil erosion and nutrient and contaminant transport this study aimed to improve the quantification of infiltration on hillslopes under both steady and unsteady rainfalls starting from darcy s law an analytical integral infiltrability equation was derived for hillslope infiltration by use of the flux concentration relation based on this equation a simple scaling relation linking the infiltration times on hillslopes and horizontal planes was obtained which is applicable for both small and large times and can be used to simplify the solution procedure of hillslope infiltration the infiltrability equation also improved the estimation of ponding time for infiltration under rainfall conditions for infiltration after ponding the time compression approximation tca was applied together with the infiltrability equation to improve the computational efficiency the analytical integral infiltrability equation was approximated with a two term power like function by nonlinear regression procedures of applying this approach to both steady and unsteady rainfall conditions were proposed to evaluate the performance of the new approach it was compared with the green ampt model for sloping surfaces by chen and young 2006 and richards equation the proposed model outperformed the sloping green ampt and both ponding time and infiltration predictions agreed well with the solutions of richards equation for various soil textures slope angles initial water contents and rainfall intensities for both steady and unsteady rainfalls keywords hillslope rainfall infiltration ponding time infiltrability slope angle time compression approximation 1 introduction hillslope rainfall infiltration is related to many environmental problems such as flood soil erosion debris flow and landslides and has received much attention in recent decades kirkby 1978 philip 1991 chen and young 2006 in general the process of infiltration under either steady or unsteady rainfalls can be divided into two parts namely prior to ponding in which infiltration rate equal to rainfall intensity and after ponding in which infiltration rate equal to the infiltrability i e infiltration rate at atmospheric pressure with sufficient water supply hillel 1980 either of them can be absent and they can occur alternately mainly depending on soil properties initial soil moisture as well as the water supply condition if the ponding time and infiltrability curve are known the infiltration process can be easily decided thus the accuracy of the estimation of ponding time and the infiltrability curve is an important issue for hydrological forecasting in most cases research on infiltration mainly focused on local scales under ponded or rainfall conditions ponded infiltration was investigated by early researchers e g green and ampt 1911 horton 1933 philip 1957 and relationships were developed to describe infiltrability as a function of time these studies determined that the infiltrability is a monotonically decreasing function with time and eventually approaches a steady state this function is mainly affected by soil hydraulic properties and initial soil moisture content however ponded infiltration may not always exist in reality infiltration under rainfall conditions usually involves an early period during which ponding does not yet occur this raises a question that how can the approach for ponded infiltration can be extended to infiltration in initially dry soils to solve infiltration under steady rainfall smith 1972 proposed an equation to calculate the infiltration rate based on a large number of numerical simulations in his equation the infiltration was divided into two parts prior to ponding and after ponding the parameters of the latter were confirmed by experiments and influenced by rainfall intensity initial water content and soil type however the relationship between infiltrability and the infiltration rate after ponding was not quantitatively established until mein and larson 1973 they modified the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 to make it applicable under rainfall conditions where soil infiltrability was initially larger than the rainfall intensity and could reduce to below it over time for infiltration under unsteady rainfalls chu 1978 treated the unsteady rainfall as piecewise steady rainfall to apply the modified green ampt mein and larson 1973 which produced results agreeing well with the observed data his method extended the applicability of equations for ponded infiltration to rainfall conditions nevertheless infiltration on hillslopes was not addressed until much later philip 1991 derived a one dimensional richards equation on hillslope by means of coordinate conversion and obtained a modified infiltrability equation accounting for the slope effect compared with philip 1957 to study the slope effect on hortonian runoff generation chen and young 2006 extended the green ampt model to hillslopes which provides a simple approach to estimate infiltration on sloping surfaces these studies added new knowledge and tools for hillslope hydrology previous studies for ponded infiltration have disclosed that the key quantities for determining infiltration without initial ponding are the ponding time and the infiltrability relation i e the relation of infiltrability as a function of time many recent studies focused on these two aspects broadbridge and white 1987 suggested a modified approximation to ponding time with an error no more than 10 for most soils by comparison of analytic quasi analytic and approximate expressions the form of infiltrability relation was also studied by some researchers e g swamee et al 2012 almedeij and esen 2013 vatankhah 2015 ali et al 2016 who approximated the green and ampt model kale and sahoo 2011 explicitly using different approaches nevertheless the infiltration rate after ponding i e the infiltrability as an ubiquitous function of the cumulative infiltration was first applied in the modified green ampt model mein and larson 1973 and assumed in the time compression approximation tca parlange et al 2000 brutsaert 2005 hogarth et al 2011 or the infiltrability depth approximation ida smith et al 2002 which are widely used to predict the infiltration rate after ponding these methods were also extended to complex rainfall patterns i e unsteady or even intermittent rainfalls e g assouline et al 2007 in which ponding can occur and diminish repeatedly as different approximations to actual infiltration processes these models are successful to describe infiltration under different conditions however they are still inadequate in several aspects first estimation of the ponding time is inaccurate in many commonly used infiltration models for example the ponding time was systemically underestimated by smith and parlange 1978 kutilek 1980 in addition almedeij and esen 2013 indicated that the ponding time and the cumulative infiltration by the modified green ampt model mein and larson 1973 were always less than the actual values the errors in the ponding time will likely propagate to the estimate of the infiltration depth second although the process after ponding can be obtained by a parallel shift of the infiltrability curve using tca assouline et al 2007 determining the infiltrability relation is no easy task an accurate infiltrability relation is still needed and is critical in the application of tca for infiltration after ponding third the connection between infiltration on sloping and horizontal surfaces have not been fully understood yet and the procedures for hillslope infiltration under unsteady rainfall are still inadequate finally to reduce the cost of excessive numerical computation in practice simplified approaches are needed in the simulation of hillslope infiltration especially under unsteady rainfall events therefore in this study we intended to develop a theoretical formulation that more precisely describes the ponding time and the infiltrability on hillslope and seek approximation algorithm to simplify the solution procedure and produce a simple but still accurate method for rainfall infiltration on hillslopes infiltration under both steady and unsteady rainfall conditions were investigated and compared with green ampt for sloping surfaces chen and young 2006 and richards equation to validate the accuracy of the new approach 2 theory 2 1 the richards equation for hillslope according to philip 1991 the two dimensional richards equation for a homogenous and isotropical planar hillslope fig 1 can be simplified to the following equation by means of coordinate transformation except for a small region from the crest 1 θ h t z k h h z k h z cos γ where θ is soil moisture content t is time h h is pressure head mm k h is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity mm h which is a function of h z is the spatial coordinate normal to the slope surface mm and is positive downward and γ is the slope angle eq 1 can be numerically solved by solvers such as hydrus 1d simunek et al 2008 with given initial and boundary conditions the soil water retention curve θ h and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function k h are required to solve the equation the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 is the most widely used function for θ h and is adopted in this study it can be expressed in the following form 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 where θr θs are residual soil water content and saturated water content respectively α m n are empirical parameters and the parameters m n satisfy the relationship given by 3 m 1 1 n n 1 the mualem model mualem 1976 for k h in the following form is most often coupled with eq 2 4 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where l is pore connectivity parameter and evaluated to be about 0 5 as an average for many soils ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity se is effective saturation given by 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r the key issue to apply eqs 2 and 4 is to obtain appropriate soil hydraulic parameters θr θs α n ks l 2 2 infiltrability equation on the basis of darcy s law the soil water flow equation can be described as follows 6 d θ θ z k θ i s θ t where is θ t is the flow rate mm h normal to the horizontal plane d θ is soil water diffusivity mm2 h at water content θ defined by 7 d θ k h d θ dh to extend the soil water flow equation to hillslope according to philip 1991 eq 6 can be modified as 8 d θ θ z k θ cos γ i n θ t where z is the coordinate normal to the slope surface mm and is positive downward in θ t is the darcy flux or darcy velocity mm h normal to the sloping surface assuming a uniform distribution of initial soil moisture θi and surface saturation afterward infiltration near the surface is then equal to the infiltrability following sivapalan and milly 1989 a flux concentration relation for sloping surfaces can be defined as 9 f θ t i n θ t k i cos γ i p t k i cos γ in which the ip t is the soil infiltrability mm h normal to the slope surface ki is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity mm h at θ θi and θ is relative moisture content which can be expressed as follows 10 θ θ θ i θ s θ i for the case f 1 the darcy velocity is equal to the soil infiltrability substituting eq 9 into eq 8 yields 11 f i p k i cos γ k θ k i cos γ d θ θ z where f θ t and ip t are donated by f ip respectively integrating this equation with respect to θ from θ to θs yields 12 z θ θ s d ϕ d ϕ f i p k i cos γ k ϕ k i cos γ for clarity the symbol ϕ is used in this and following equations to represent water content in the integral for natural soils the soil water diffusivity d θ is usually close to a delta function sivapalan and milly 1989 which means f θ namely 13 f θ θ i θ s θ i integrating eq 12 with respect to θ from θi to θs yields 14 θ i θ s z d θ θ i θ s θ θ s d ϕ f i p k i cos γ k ϕ k i cos γ d ϕ d θ where f in the integral equation is only related to ϕ and can be calculated by eq 13 in general the left side of integral equation is the cumulative infiltration for hillslope and can be calculated alternatively by the following equation 15 i n 0 t i p k i cos γ dt where in t is the cumulative infiltration normal to the sloping surface mm substituting eqs 15 into 14 and integrating it yields 16 0 t i p k i cos γ dt θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i f i p k i cos γ k ϕ k i cos γ d ϕ this is an integral equation related to ip and t where t can be treated as a function of ip taking the derivative of eq 16 with respect to ip yields 17 i p k i cos γ dt d i p θ i θ s fd ϕ ϕ θ i d ϕ f i p k i cos γ k ϕ k i cos γ 2 rearranging eq 17 and integrating it with respect to t yields 18 t θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i f 0 t 1 i p k i cos γ i p k i k ϕ k i f cos γ 2 di p d ϕ the condition that ip approaches the positive infinity when t is close to 0 is used here denoting n ki k ϕ ki f eq 18 is converted to the following form by calculating the time integral in it 19 t 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i n k i 2 f ln i p n cos γ i p k i cos γ n k i cos γ i p n cos γ d ϕ eq 19 is an approximation for infiltrability by use of the flux concentration relation which is related to the initial soil moisture content soil type and the slope angle and is obtained without considering γ equal to 90 i e a vertical hillslope in particular if the flux concentration relation f 1 applies which means that the flow rate at each point in the profile is equal to infiltrability and the hydraulic conductivity at initial soil moisture ki is negligible eq 19 can be simplified to the following form 20 t 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i k ϕ 2 ln i p k ϕ cos γ i p k ϕ cos γ i p k ϕ cos γ d ϕ in particular this equation is in agreement with equation 3 28 in lei et al 1988 for horizontal planes i e γ 0 note that the latter was obtained by assuming the darcy velocity at all depth is equal to the infiltrability at the soil surface and ignoring the initial unsaturated hydraulic conductivity ki which means it only applies for green ampt type soils with initially dry conditions i e very small ki while the former one is not limited to these conditions eqs 19 or 20 can lead to a scaling relation between infiltration on sloping and horizontal surfaces define iv ip cosγ where iv can be interpreted as a virtual vertical infiltrability use iv to replace ip in eqs 19 and 20 the slope angle terms in the right hand side integral in these equations can be eliminated when iv for a sloping surface and a horizontal plane with the same soil properties reaches the same value the integrals at the right hand side of the equations are equal and following transform relation can be obtained 21 t γ t 0 cos 2 γ for equal i v or i p cos γ where t γ and t 0 are the times for γ angle slopes and horizontal surfaces respectively this means that under ponding conditions the normal infiltration rate on a sloping surface will reduce to the value of cosγ times that on the horizontal plane by taking 1 cos2 γ times of time compared with that for the horizontal plane this transformation relation holds for all times during the infiltration process regardless of early capillary effect dominant or later time gravity dominant although it does not directly link the cumulative infiltration of sloping surfaces and the horizontal plane it can be used to obtain the solution of infiltration for sloping surfaces from the solution for the horizontal plane note that the virtual vertical infiltrability iv is not a real physical quantity but it can be linked to the vertical cumulative infiltration which can be conveniently used for the comparison of cumulative infiltration on different slopes 2 3 ponding time for steady rainfall when ponding occurs the infiltration rate is equal to the rainfall rate and runoff is produced thereafter thus the cumulative infiltration at the ponding time can be obtained from equation 16 by replacing ip and t with constant pcos γ and tp respectively which gives 22 t p 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i p k i f p k i k ϕ k i d ϕ where p is a constant rainfall rate mm h pcos γ represents the effective rainfall intensity for hillslope tp is the ponding time h and f can be calculated according to eq 13 if the flux concentration relation f 1 is adopted and the initial hydraulic conductivity is ignored eq 22 can be simplified to the following form 23 t p 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i p p k ϕ d ϕ in particular for horizontal planes γ 0 the ponding time depicted by eq 22 is consistent with eq 11 in kutilek 1980 while eq 23 is consistent with eq 5 in smith and parlange 1978 similarly the equations depicted in kutilek 1980 and smith and parlange 1978 cannot be used for hillslope calculation without considering slope angle term from the above equations it is easy to find that 24 t p γ t p 0 cos 2 γ where tp γ and tp 0 are the ponding times for slopes of angle γ and 0 i e horizontal surface respectively this is consistent with eq 21 in chen and young 2006 therefore the ponding time for hillslopes can be estimated from that for horizontal planes for very large p compared with ks tp will approach 0 and the infiltration curve will approach the infiltrability curve i e the infiltration curve under ponded conditions 2 4 infiltration after ponding when ponding occurs the upper boundary condition of infiltration converts to a constant concentration boundary condition and the soil surface maintains saturated if the rainfall intensity is larger than the saturated hydraulic conductivity the infiltration process can be determined by using the infiltrability curve for example on sloping surfaces chen and young 2006 extended the green ampt model to obtain the relation between cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate normal to the surface 25 i k s cos γ sm i in which sm is the product of the capillary length scale and the soil moisture deficit mm this equation can also convert to the form in the time domain describing the cumulative infiltration or the infiltration rate as a function of time similar to eqs 19 and 20 same as many other infiltration models this equation defines a one to one relationship between the infiltration rate and the cumulative infiltration after ponding previous studies show that infiltration after ponding can be calculated by using tca this approximation assumes that the infiltration rate and the cumulative infiltration relation is independent of the process before ponding and is applicable for both homogenous and layered soils assouline et al 2007 when tca is applied the actual infiltration rate after ponding can be obtained by a parallel shift of the infiltrability curve thus eqs 19 or 20 can be solved to predict the infiltration process after ponding solving these equations usually requires numerical integration that could be very time consuming considering the complexity involved in the numerical procedure a simple approximate equation replacing these equations is preferable for the convenience of application we develop a simplified approach to approximate the analytical infiltrability relation eqs 19 or 20 that can be used to determine infiltration after ponding to determine the form of the approximate model we refer to the philip infiltration model and the smith 1972 model the philip infiltration model accounting for the slope effect reads philip 1991 26 i p 0 5 st 0 5 k s cos γ where s is the sorptivity mm h0 5 the factor of slope angle can be included in the coefficient of the first term by considering the smith 1972 model in which the exponent and coefficient of the first term in the above equation vary with soils and need to be determined from actual infiltration data the following equation is applied in this study to approximate the infiltrability 27 i p at b k s cos γ where a b are parameters related to initial soil moisture content soil type and rainfall intensity thus the actual infiltration curve after ponding can be obtained from eq 27 by a right parallel shift t0 tp based on assumption of tca and expressed as 28 i a t t p t 0 b k s cos γ where tp t0 is the time shift between the ponded infiltration and rainfall infiltration in which t0 is a virtual time determined by the following equation 29 p cos γ at 0 b k s cos γ to apply eq 28 the parameters a and b should be determined beforehand generally they can be obtained from eq 27 by fitting a series of points retrieved from eqs 19 or 20 more details are provided in the next section thus the infiltration under steady rainfall can be determined with ponding time and eq 28 before ponding the infiltration rate is equal to rainfall intensity while after ponding the infiltration rate can be calculated from eq 28 2 5 infiltration under unsteady rainfall chu 1978 investigated unsteady rainfall by dividing it into piecewise steady rainfall intervals as for a given steady rainfall interval it should satisfy 30 p t p t n p t n 1 t n t n 1 p const where p is cumulative precipitation depth mm n denotes the nth steady rainfall interval tn 1 and tn are the initial and ending times of the interval h if the ponding depth is ignored the water balance equation in the normal direction to the sloping surface is given by 31 p t n 1 cos γ i t n 1 r t n 1 where r is the cumulative runoff depth mm i tn and r tn are defined by 32 r t n r t n 1 t n 1 p cos γ i p t n p cos γ i p dt 33 i t n i t n 1 t n 1 p cos γ i p t n i p dt t n 1 p cos γ i p t n p cos γ dt if the ponding time tnp in the steady rainfall period exists then there may be a function at ponding time given as follows 34 p t np cos γ i t np r t n 1 according to the tca method 35 i t np i p p substituting eq 35 into eq 34 yields 36 p t np cos γ i p p r t n 1 this is the key equation to solve the ponding time under unsteady rainfall in particular when r tn 1 and γ are both equal to zero the eq 36 is the method illustrated in assouline et al 2007 meaning it can be applied for more complex rainall conditions where ponding time can occur alternatively substituting p into eqs 22 or 23 yields the following equation to predict the ponding time tp 37 i p p p k i t p cos γ eq 37 requires that the rainfall intensity is larger than the saturated hydraulic conductivity if this condition is not satisfied the infiltration rate is equal to the rainfall rate and ponding would not occur if ponding occurs in the nth time interval the ponding time tnp can be evaluated by substituting eqs 37 into 36 three different conditions could occur in the estimation of the ponding status 1 the predicted tnp is larger than tn which means the cumulative rainfall at tn is not enough to cause ponding so that the infiltration rate within the period is equal to the rainfall rate 2 the predicted tnp is between tn 1 and tn meaning that ponding occurs during this interval and the infiltration rate after ponding is equal to infiltrability described by eq 28 the parameters can be determined by the method shown in section 2 4 3 the predicted tnp is less than tn 1 which means the cumulative rainfall before this interval is enough to cause ponding thus the infiltration rate is equal to infiltrability and can be calculated by eq 28 in which the parameters are from previous steady rainfall interval i e tn 2 tn 1 3 validation the proposed method was compared with the richards equation solutions to evaluate its performance for this purpose three soils including a loam a sandy loam and a silt loam soil were selected for model evaluation the van genuchten soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 1 the hillslope richards equation illustrated in eq 1 was solved numerically using hydrus 1d simunek et al 2008 to eliminate the boundary effects the soil depth was set to 6 m with dense mesh near the upper boundary and sparse mesh near the lower boundary the upper boundary was considered as atmospheric boundary with no ponding water while the lower one was set to be free drainage the pressure head initial condition was applied to reduce the numerical error radcliffe and simunek 2010 and distributed uniform along with the depth the initial pressure heads corresponding to volumetric water content of 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 for loam were studied hillslope angle from 0 to 60 was evaluated with an increment of 5 the rainfall intensity in the simulation ranged from 2 to 4 times of ks for steady rainfall conditions and piecewise rainfall intensity was set to 4 times of ks for unsteady rainfall at most eqs 19 and 22 were adopted in this paper to obtain the analytical solutions of ponding time and infiltrability eqs 20 and 23 were also applied for comparison to solve the infiltrability equation i e 19 or 20 as well as the ponding time equation i e 22 or 23 a variable step size and variable order adaptive quadrature simpson integration algorithm yang et al 2011 was applied in order to reduce the computational demand for infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration of steady rainfall eq 27 was used to fit the infiltrability curve and the infiltration after ponding can be described by eq 28 the detailed method of nonlinear regression includes the following steps 1 determine two ip t points based on the infiltrability relation 19 or 20 to do this two values of infiltrability ip were selected empirically one is ip equal to 0 125p 0 875ks cosγ to ensure that the approximate infiltrability curve approaches the steady infiltration period as accurately as possible the other is ip equal to p 0 125p 0 875ks 0 5 cosγ representing a medium value of infiltration rate after ponding on the hillslope the times corresponding to these values of infiltrability were calculated by solving eqs 19 or 20 2 determine the parameters a and b in eq 27 using the two ip t points obtained in step 1 for this purpose move ks to the left hand side of eq 27 and apply the logarithmic transformation to both sides and apply the linear regression analysis to obtain the parameters a and b in this way infiltration for steady rainfalls was determined by the ponding time and eq 28 it was found that the number of data points on the infiltrability relation has a minor effect on the final results for simplicity without losing the accuracy only two points as proposed were selected as for unsteady rainfall the hyetograph can be divided into several piecewise steady periods and the approach shown in section 2 5 can be applied to determine the ponding status and ponding time for each interval note that the parameters for unsteady rainfall were obtained using methods depicted in the section of steady rainfall and recalculated if ponding reoccurred at a new time interval of different intensity the reason for such treatment is that the fitting curve cannot completely replace the analytical solution and the errors for infiltration may propagate to the next ponding state richards equation solutions obtained using the hydrus 1d solver radcliffe and simunek 2010 simunek et al 2008 and results of the green ampt model for sloping surfaces with default model parameters chen and young 2006 were used for evaluating the approach of this study comparisons were made against each other under the same slope angle soil properties and rainfall conditions for the ease of comparison all the infiltration and runoff variables defined in the normal direction were converted to the vertical direction i e divided by cosγ while maintaining the properties of mass balance 4 results and discussion 4 1 infiltrability curve the infiltrability curves as well as cumulative infiltration for a loam a sandy loam and a silt loam soil calculated from eqs 19 and 20 were compared with that from hydrus 1d the results are presented in fig 2 the two approaches produced similar infiltrability curves fig 2a d and cumulative infiltration fig 2a d although both eqs 19 and 20 perform well compared with the hydrus 1d results eq 19 fits hydrus 1d slightly better for the loam fig 2a b and silt loam fig 2c while eq 20 fits hydrus 1d slightly better for the sandy loam eq 20 underestimates infiltrability for the loam and silt loam and eqs 19 and 20 slightly overestimate infiltrability for sandy loam in addition the infiltrability predicted by eq 20 is always less than that by eq 19 and the difference between eqs 19 and 20 is smallest for coarse soil i e sandy loam and largest for fine soil i e silt loam which indicates that the difference is smaller for coarser texture soils thus the difference caused by the different flux concentration relations i e function of f and initial unsaturated hydraulic conductivity i e ki is not trivial and cannot be totally ignored especially for fine soils 4 2 ponding time in this study eqs 22 and 23 were used to obtained ponding time and were compared with hydrus 1d the comparison was made for a loam soil and a silt loam under constant rainfalls with various rainfall intensities and initial soil moisture contents and the results are shown in fig 3 it is found that the ponding time increases with slope angle fig 3a c and decreases with increasing rainfall intensity fig 3a c and increasing initial soil water content fig 3b c the trends for the results of eqs 22 and 23 agree with that of hydrus 1d which confirms eq 24 further the results of eq 22 agree well with that of hydrus 1d with only 2 or smaller average relative errors on the contrary the results of eq 23 underestimate the ponding time which leads to 10 or even larger relative errors the ponding time evaluated by eq 23 is substantially less than that by eq 22 and the difference between them is larger for larger slope angles and lower rainfall intensities as well as lower initial soil water contents this indicates that the flux concentration relation f θ is more accurate than f 1 in predicting the ponding time for sloping surfaces also note that eqs 20 and 23 neglect the hydraulic conductivity corresponding to the initial soil moisture this is usually a small quantity for relatively dry soils however when soil moisture is high at the beginning it may have some impact on the result therefore eqs 19 and 22 can find more general use and will provide more accurate results for calculating runoff which is often a small fraction of rainfall but has a substantial impact in flooding 4 3 hillslope infiltration under steady rainfall three soils were used to simulate the infiltration process under given rainfalls the sloping green ampt model with default parameters and hydrus 1d were compared with the method proposed in this paper i e eqs 19 22 and 28 denoting as this paper the results are shown in fig 4 it is found that the method proposed in this paper predicts ponding time successfully while the sloping green ampt overestimates it as a result the infiltration rate after ponding predicted by sloping green ampt is also overestimated fig 4a c the proposed method shows good consistency with hydrus 1d for the three soils compared with the hydrus 1d solution the relative error for the proposed method is much smaller than that of the sloping green ampt model with default parameters fig 4d f the maximum relative errors for the proposed method are all less than 4 for the three soils while that for sloping green ampt exceed 15 however our calculation shows that the relative error for both methods will diminish after a sufficiently long time of rainfall in addition using a different flux concentration relation i e f 1 and ignoring initial unsaturated hydraulic conductivity were also considered i e eqs 20 23 and 28 denoted as reference for comparisons and shown in fig 4d f as analyzed above the results produced from eqs 20 and 23 are always less than that by eqs 21 and 24 thus the ponding time is underestimated and the maximum relative error with a given period is enlarged for the three soils especially for the fine soil i e silt loam with a maximum relative error more than 7 nevertheless the reference method still performs better than the sloping green ampt the results also infer that the reference method is more suitable for coarse soils and long period steady rainfall while the proposed method in this paper is not limited to these conditions further the same results may occur when the eq 23 was replaced by eq 22 or eq 20 was replaced by eq 19 in the reference method 4 4 hillslope infiltration under unsteady rainfall in this study infiltration under two unsteady rainfalls was simulated for two soils fig 5 shows the results of the proposed method compared with that of sloping green ampt with default parameters and hydrus 1d infiltration under unsteady rainfalls showed a more complex behavior than that under steady rainfalls fig 5a d for the case of the loam soil under a rainfall with increasing rainfall intensity after an initial decrease fig 5a ponding occurred twice during the rainfall making the simulating more challenging for the case of the silt loam under a rainfall with step wise increasing intensity ponding occurred only once fig 5d in addition the ponding time is captured accurately by the proposed method compared with the hydrus 1d simulation as a result the results of proposed method for the entire infiltration processes are in good agreement with that of hydrus 1d on the other hand sloping green ampt overestimates the ponding time and the infiltration rate after ponding for which the reason may be related to the model parameterization chen et al 2015 deng and zhu 2016 in the first case the difference between the proposed method and sloping green ampt initiates at the second ponding time fig 5a b moreover the relative error for the proposed method is lower than green ampt and the maximum relative errors for proposed method are no more than 2 while those for green ampt exceed 15 fig 5c f this indicates that the importance of ponding time estimation in complex rainfalls is no less than the infiltrability relation as done in hillslope steady rainfall infiltration the reference method was depicted in fig 5c f the results show the ponding times are underestimated and the relative errors are enlarged when compared to the proposed method in this paper especially for the fine soils the maximum relative error for the reference method is more than 4 and may be greater for fine soils nevertheless the performances of the reference method are much better than the slopping green ampt 4 5 the sensitivity of the solution to the forms of f θ two types of f θ relation were selected for a sensitivity analysis sine and power functions philip 1973 white et al 1979 kutilek 1980 the results for the forms and their impacts on the infiltrability and ponding time are shown in fig 6 it can be found that the infiltrability and ponding time can be accurately predicted by f θ this agrees with sivapalan and milly 1989 who pointed out that f θ was exact for soils with delta diffusivity and thus the tca was exact however the cumulative infiltrability and ponding time were underestimated when using other forms of f θ for cumulative infiltrability the underestimation is negligible for small time but evident for large time which suggests that the soil water profile is independent of the form of f at the early stage of infiltration and the difference becomes prominent at late time for ponding time fig 6c the difference is larger for steeper hillslopes and up to 11 difference was observed when different forms of f were selected nevertheless the f θ may not be the most accurate form of f when the soil water diffusivity is not closely approximated by a delta function but it can describe a wide variety of natural soils and probably is the most useful function for the flux concentration 5 conclusion a new approach quantifying the infiltration for both steady and unsteady rainfall has been developed in this paper the results show that the proposed model outperforms the sloping green ampt model when compared with the richards equation an infiltrability equation was derived by integrating the darcy flux equation for sloping surfaces with considering the flux concentration relation the equation led to a new relation that scales the infiltration time on sloping surfaces based on that on horizontal planes with the same soil and initial moisture conditions the results obtained from the infiltrability equation agreed well with that from hydrus 1d in the proposed approach the ponding time for steady rainfall can be analytically quantified the theory indicates that the ponding time for hillslope can be corrected by a factor of 1 cos2γ to that for horizontal surfaces furthermore the results show that the average relative error of ponding time can be substantially reduced when an appropriate flux concentration function is selected and the impact of initial condition correctly accounted for by applying the tca theory the infiltrability equation was applied to the rainfall conditions to calculate the infiltration rate and depth a simplified approach was developed to approximate the infiltrability equation with much reduced computational demand while still maintained the accuracy of simulation comparison of the proposed approach with hydrus 1d and sloping green ampt show that for both constant and unsteady rainfalls the proposed approach agreed well with richards equation solutions and outperformed the green ampt model in both ponding time and the infiltration rate as wells as the cumulative infiltration different flux concentration relations and the initial condition impact were also considered in the comparisons the results show that a proper flux concentration relation and the consideration of initial moisture condition impact can improve the performance of the hillslope infiltration model acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key research and

7490,rainfall infiltration on hillslopes is an important issue in hydrology which is related to many environmental problems such as flood soil erosion and nutrient and contaminant transport this study aimed to improve the quantification of infiltration on hillslopes under both steady and unsteady rainfalls starting from darcy s law an analytical integral infiltrability equation was derived for hillslope infiltration by use of the flux concentration relation based on this equation a simple scaling relation linking the infiltration times on hillslopes and horizontal planes was obtained which is applicable for both small and large times and can be used to simplify the solution procedure of hillslope infiltration the infiltrability equation also improved the estimation of ponding time for infiltration under rainfall conditions for infiltration after ponding the time compression approximation tca was applied together with the infiltrability equation to improve the computational efficiency the analytical integral infiltrability equation was approximated with a two term power like function by nonlinear regression procedures of applying this approach to both steady and unsteady rainfall conditions were proposed to evaluate the performance of the new approach it was compared with the green ampt model for sloping surfaces by chen and young 2006 and richards equation the proposed model outperformed the sloping green ampt and both ponding time and infiltration predictions agreed well with the solutions of richards equation for various soil textures slope angles initial water contents and rainfall intensities for both steady and unsteady rainfalls keywords hillslope rainfall infiltration ponding time infiltrability slope angle time compression approximation 1 introduction hillslope rainfall infiltration is related to many environmental problems such as flood soil erosion debris flow and landslides and has received much attention in recent decades kirkby 1978 philip 1991 chen and young 2006 in general the process of infiltration under either steady or unsteady rainfalls can be divided into two parts namely prior to ponding in which infiltration rate equal to rainfall intensity and after ponding in which infiltration rate equal to the infiltrability i e infiltration rate at atmospheric pressure with sufficient water supply hillel 1980 either of them can be absent and they can occur alternately mainly depending on soil properties initial soil moisture as well as the water supply condition if the ponding time and infiltrability curve are known the infiltration process can be easily decided thus the accuracy of the estimation of ponding time and the infiltrability curve is an important issue for hydrological forecasting in most cases research on infiltration mainly focused on local scales under ponded or rainfall conditions ponded infiltration was investigated by early researchers e g green and ampt 1911 horton 1933 philip 1957 and relationships were developed to describe infiltrability as a function of time these studies determined that the infiltrability is a monotonically decreasing function with time and eventually approaches a steady state this function is mainly affected by soil hydraulic properties and initial soil moisture content however ponded infiltration may not always exist in reality infiltration under rainfall conditions usually involves an early period during which ponding does not yet occur this raises a question that how can the approach for ponded infiltration can be extended to infiltration in initially dry soils to solve infiltration under steady rainfall smith 1972 proposed an equation to calculate the infiltration rate based on a large number of numerical simulations in his equation the infiltration was divided into two parts prior to ponding and after ponding the parameters of the latter were confirmed by experiments and influenced by rainfall intensity initial water content and soil type however the relationship between infiltrability and the infiltration rate after ponding was not quantitatively established until mein and larson 1973 they modified the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 to make it applicable under rainfall conditions where soil infiltrability was initially larger than the rainfall intensity and could reduce to below it over time for infiltration under unsteady rainfalls chu 1978 treated the unsteady rainfall as piecewise steady rainfall to apply the modified green ampt mein and larson 1973 which produced results agreeing well with the observed data his method extended the applicability of equations for ponded infiltration to rainfall conditions nevertheless infiltration on hillslopes was not addressed until much later philip 1991 derived a one dimensional richards equation on hillslope by means of coordinate conversion and obtained a modified infiltrability equation accounting for the slope effect compared with philip 1957 to study the slope effect on hortonian runoff generation chen and young 2006 extended the green ampt model to hillslopes which provides a simple approach to estimate infiltration on sloping surfaces these studies added new knowledge and tools for hillslope hydrology previous studies for ponded infiltration have disclosed that the key quantities for determining infiltration without initial ponding are the ponding time and the infiltrability relation i e the relation of infiltrability as a function of time many recent studies focused on these two aspects broadbridge and white 1987 suggested a modified approximation to ponding time with an error no more than 10 for most soils by comparison of analytic quasi analytic and approximate expressions the form of infiltrability relation was also studied by some researchers e g swamee et al 2012 almedeij and esen 2013 vatankhah 2015 ali et al 2016 who approximated the green and ampt model kale and sahoo 2011 explicitly using different approaches nevertheless the infiltration rate after ponding i e the infiltrability as an ubiquitous function of the cumulative infiltration was first applied in the modified green ampt model mein and larson 1973 and assumed in the time compression approximation tca parlange et al 2000 brutsaert 2005 hogarth et al 2011 or the infiltrability depth approximation ida smith et al 2002 which are widely used to predict the infiltration rate after ponding these methods were also extended to complex rainfall patterns i e unsteady or even intermittent rainfalls e g assouline et al 2007 in which ponding can occur and diminish repeatedly as different approximations to actual infiltration processes these models are successful to describe infiltration under different conditions however they are still inadequate in several aspects first estimation of the ponding time is inaccurate in many commonly used infiltration models for example the ponding time was systemically underestimated by smith and parlange 1978 kutilek 1980 in addition almedeij and esen 2013 indicated that the ponding time and the cumulative infiltration by the modified green ampt model mein and larson 1973 were always less than the actual values the errors in the ponding time will likely propagate to the estimate of the infiltration depth second although the process after ponding can be obtained by a parallel shift of the infiltrability curve using tca assouline et al 2007 determining the infiltrability relation is no easy task an accurate infiltrability relation is still needed and is critical in the application of tca for infiltration after ponding third the connection between infiltration on sloping and horizontal surfaces have not been fully understood yet and the procedures for hillslope infiltration under unsteady rainfall are still inadequate finally to reduce the cost of excessive numerical computation in practice simplified approaches are needed in the simulation of hillslope infiltration especially under unsteady rainfall events therefore in this study we intended to develop a theoretical formulation that more precisely describes the ponding time and the infiltrability on hillslope and seek approximation algorithm to simplify the solution procedure and produce a simple but still accurate method for rainfall infiltration on hillslopes infiltration under both steady and unsteady rainfall conditions were investigated and compared with green ampt for sloping surfaces chen and young 2006 and richards equation to validate the accuracy of the new approach 2 theory 2 1 the richards equation for hillslope according to philip 1991 the two dimensional richards equation for a homogenous and isotropical planar hillslope fig 1 can be simplified to the following equation by means of coordinate transformation except for a small region from the crest 1 θ h t z k h h z k h z cos γ where θ is soil moisture content t is time h h is pressure head mm k h is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity mm h which is a function of h z is the spatial coordinate normal to the slope surface mm and is positive downward and γ is the slope angle eq 1 can be numerically solved by solvers such as hydrus 1d simunek et al 2008 with given initial and boundary conditions the soil water retention curve θ h and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function k h are required to solve the equation the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 is the most widely used function for θ h and is adopted in this study it can be expressed in the following form 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 where θr θs are residual soil water content and saturated water content respectively α m n are empirical parameters and the parameters m n satisfy the relationship given by 3 m 1 1 n n 1 the mualem model mualem 1976 for k h in the following form is most often coupled with eq 2 4 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where l is pore connectivity parameter and evaluated to be about 0 5 as an average for many soils ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity se is effective saturation given by 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r the key issue to apply eqs 2 and 4 is to obtain appropriate soil hydraulic parameters θr θs α n ks l 2 2 infiltrability equation on the basis of darcy s law the soil water flow equation can be described as follows 6 d θ θ z k θ i s θ t where is θ t is the flow rate mm h normal to the horizontal plane d θ is soil water diffusivity mm2 h at water content θ defined by 7 d θ k h d θ dh to extend the soil water flow equation to hillslope according to philip 1991 eq 6 can be modified as 8 d θ θ z k θ cos γ i n θ t where z is the coordinate normal to the slope surface mm and is positive downward in θ t is the darcy flux or darcy velocity mm h normal to the sloping surface assuming a uniform distribution of initial soil moisture θi and surface saturation afterward infiltration near the surface is then equal to the infiltrability following sivapalan and milly 1989 a flux concentration relation for sloping surfaces can be defined as 9 f θ t i n θ t k i cos γ i p t k i cos γ in which the ip t is the soil infiltrability mm h normal to the slope surface ki is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity mm h at θ θi and θ is relative moisture content which can be expressed as follows 10 θ θ θ i θ s θ i for the case f 1 the darcy velocity is equal to the soil infiltrability substituting eq 9 into eq 8 yields 11 f i p k i cos γ k θ k i cos γ d θ θ z where f θ t and ip t are donated by f ip respectively integrating this equation with respect to θ from θ to θs yields 12 z θ θ s d ϕ d ϕ f i p k i cos γ k ϕ k i cos γ for clarity the symbol ϕ is used in this and following equations to represent water content in the integral for natural soils the soil water diffusivity d θ is usually close to a delta function sivapalan and milly 1989 which means f θ namely 13 f θ θ i θ s θ i integrating eq 12 with respect to θ from θi to θs yields 14 θ i θ s z d θ θ i θ s θ θ s d ϕ f i p k i cos γ k ϕ k i cos γ d ϕ d θ where f in the integral equation is only related to ϕ and can be calculated by eq 13 in general the left side of integral equation is the cumulative infiltration for hillslope and can be calculated alternatively by the following equation 15 i n 0 t i p k i cos γ dt where in t is the cumulative infiltration normal to the sloping surface mm substituting eqs 15 into 14 and integrating it yields 16 0 t i p k i cos γ dt θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i f i p k i cos γ k ϕ k i cos γ d ϕ this is an integral equation related to ip and t where t can be treated as a function of ip taking the derivative of eq 16 with respect to ip yields 17 i p k i cos γ dt d i p θ i θ s fd ϕ ϕ θ i d ϕ f i p k i cos γ k ϕ k i cos γ 2 rearranging eq 17 and integrating it with respect to t yields 18 t θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i f 0 t 1 i p k i cos γ i p k i k ϕ k i f cos γ 2 di p d ϕ the condition that ip approaches the positive infinity when t is close to 0 is used here denoting n ki k ϕ ki f eq 18 is converted to the following form by calculating the time integral in it 19 t 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i n k i 2 f ln i p n cos γ i p k i cos γ n k i cos γ i p n cos γ d ϕ eq 19 is an approximation for infiltrability by use of the flux concentration relation which is related to the initial soil moisture content soil type and the slope angle and is obtained without considering γ equal to 90 i e a vertical hillslope in particular if the flux concentration relation f 1 applies which means that the flow rate at each point in the profile is equal to infiltrability and the hydraulic conductivity at initial soil moisture ki is negligible eq 19 can be simplified to the following form 20 t 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i k ϕ 2 ln i p k ϕ cos γ i p k ϕ cos γ i p k ϕ cos γ d ϕ in particular this equation is in agreement with equation 3 28 in lei et al 1988 for horizontal planes i e γ 0 note that the latter was obtained by assuming the darcy velocity at all depth is equal to the infiltrability at the soil surface and ignoring the initial unsaturated hydraulic conductivity ki which means it only applies for green ampt type soils with initially dry conditions i e very small ki while the former one is not limited to these conditions eqs 19 or 20 can lead to a scaling relation between infiltration on sloping and horizontal surfaces define iv ip cosγ where iv can be interpreted as a virtual vertical infiltrability use iv to replace ip in eqs 19 and 20 the slope angle terms in the right hand side integral in these equations can be eliminated when iv for a sloping surface and a horizontal plane with the same soil properties reaches the same value the integrals at the right hand side of the equations are equal and following transform relation can be obtained 21 t γ t 0 cos 2 γ for equal i v or i p cos γ where t γ and t 0 are the times for γ angle slopes and horizontal surfaces respectively this means that under ponding conditions the normal infiltration rate on a sloping surface will reduce to the value of cosγ times that on the horizontal plane by taking 1 cos2 γ times of time compared with that for the horizontal plane this transformation relation holds for all times during the infiltration process regardless of early capillary effect dominant or later time gravity dominant although it does not directly link the cumulative infiltration of sloping surfaces and the horizontal plane it can be used to obtain the solution of infiltration for sloping surfaces from the solution for the horizontal plane note that the virtual vertical infiltrability iv is not a real physical quantity but it can be linked to the vertical cumulative infiltration which can be conveniently used for the comparison of cumulative infiltration on different slopes 2 3 ponding time for steady rainfall when ponding occurs the infiltration rate is equal to the rainfall rate and runoff is produced thereafter thus the cumulative infiltration at the ponding time can be obtained from equation 16 by replacing ip and t with constant pcos γ and tp respectively which gives 22 t p 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i p k i f p k i k ϕ k i d ϕ where p is a constant rainfall rate mm h pcos γ represents the effective rainfall intensity for hillslope tp is the ponding time h and f can be calculated according to eq 13 if the flux concentration relation f 1 is adopted and the initial hydraulic conductivity is ignored eq 22 can be simplified to the following form 23 t p 1 cos 2 γ θ i θ s d ϕ ϕ θ i p p k ϕ d ϕ in particular for horizontal planes γ 0 the ponding time depicted by eq 22 is consistent with eq 11 in kutilek 1980 while eq 23 is consistent with eq 5 in smith and parlange 1978 similarly the equations depicted in kutilek 1980 and smith and parlange 1978 cannot be used for hillslope calculation without considering slope angle term from the above equations it is easy to find that 24 t p γ t p 0 cos 2 γ where tp γ and tp 0 are the ponding times for slopes of angle γ and 0 i e horizontal surface respectively this is consistent with eq 21 in chen and young 2006 therefore the ponding time for hillslopes can be estimated from that for horizontal planes for very large p compared with ks tp will approach 0 and the infiltration curve will approach the infiltrability curve i e the infiltration curve under ponded conditions 2 4 infiltration after ponding when ponding occurs the upper boundary condition of infiltration converts to a constant concentration boundary condition and the soil surface maintains saturated if the rainfall intensity is larger than the saturated hydraulic conductivity the infiltration process can be determined by using the infiltrability curve for example on sloping surfaces chen and young 2006 extended the green ampt model to obtain the relation between cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate normal to the surface 25 i k s cos γ sm i in which sm is the product of the capillary length scale and the soil moisture deficit mm this equation can also convert to the form in the time domain describing the cumulative infiltration or the infiltration rate as a function of time similar to eqs 19 and 20 same as many other infiltration models this equation defines a one to one relationship between the infiltration rate and the cumulative infiltration after ponding previous studies show that infiltration after ponding can be calculated by using tca this approximation assumes that the infiltration rate and the cumulative infiltration relation is independent of the process before ponding and is applicable for both homogenous and layered soils assouline et al 2007 when tca is applied the actual infiltration rate after ponding can be obtained by a parallel shift of the infiltrability curve thus eqs 19 or 20 can be solved to predict the infiltration process after ponding solving these equations usually requires numerical integration that could be very time consuming considering the complexity involved in the numerical procedure a simple approximate equation replacing these equations is preferable for the convenience of application we develop a simplified approach to approximate the analytical infiltrability relation eqs 19 or 20 that can be used to determine infiltration after ponding to determine the form of the approximate model we refer to the philip infiltration model and the smith 1972 model the philip infiltration model accounting for the slope effect reads philip 1991 26 i p 0 5 st 0 5 k s cos γ where s is the sorptivity mm h0 5 the factor of slope angle can be included in the coefficient of the first term by considering the smith 1972 model in which the exponent and coefficient of the first term in the above equation vary with soils and need to be determined from actual infiltration data the following equation is applied in this study to approximate the infiltrability 27 i p at b k s cos γ where a b are parameters related to initial soil moisture content soil type and rainfall intensity thus the actual infiltration curve after ponding can be obtained from eq 27 by a right parallel shift t0 tp based on assumption of tca and expressed as 28 i a t t p t 0 b k s cos γ where tp t0 is the time shift between the ponded infiltration and rainfall infiltration in which t0 is a virtual time determined by the following equation 29 p cos γ at 0 b k s cos γ to apply eq 28 the parameters a and b should be determined beforehand generally they can be obtained from eq 27 by fitting a series of points retrieved from eqs 19 or 20 more details are provided in the next section thus the infiltration under steady rainfall can be determined with ponding time and eq 28 before ponding the infiltration rate is equal to rainfall intensity while after ponding the infiltration rate can be calculated from eq 28 2 5 infiltration under unsteady rainfall chu 1978 investigated unsteady rainfall by dividing it into piecewise steady rainfall intervals as for a given steady rainfall interval it should satisfy 30 p t p t n p t n 1 t n t n 1 p const where p is cumulative precipitation depth mm n denotes the nth steady rainfall interval tn 1 and tn are the initial and ending times of the interval h if the ponding depth is ignored the water balance equation in the normal direction to the sloping surface is given by 31 p t n 1 cos γ i t n 1 r t n 1 where r is the cumulative runoff depth mm i tn and r tn are defined by 32 r t n r t n 1 t n 1 p cos γ i p t n p cos γ i p dt 33 i t n i t n 1 t n 1 p cos γ i p t n i p dt t n 1 p cos γ i p t n p cos γ dt if the ponding time tnp in the steady rainfall period exists then there may be a function at ponding time given as follows 34 p t np cos γ i t np r t n 1 according to the tca method 35 i t np i p p substituting eq 35 into eq 34 yields 36 p t np cos γ i p p r t n 1 this is the key equation to solve the ponding time under unsteady rainfall in particular when r tn 1 and γ are both equal to zero the eq 36 is the method illustrated in assouline et al 2007 meaning it can be applied for more complex rainall conditions where ponding time can occur alternatively substituting p into eqs 22 or 23 yields the following equation to predict the ponding time tp 37 i p p p k i t p cos γ eq 37 requires that the rainfall intensity is larger than the saturated hydraulic conductivity if this condition is not satisfied the infiltration rate is equal to the rainfall rate and ponding would not occur if ponding occurs in the nth time interval the ponding time tnp can be evaluated by substituting eqs 37 into 36 three different conditions could occur in the estimation of the ponding status 1 the predicted tnp is larger than tn which means the cumulative rainfall at tn is not enough to cause ponding so that the infiltration rate within the period is equal to the rainfall rate 2 the predicted tnp is between tn 1 and tn meaning that ponding occurs during this interval and the infiltration rate after ponding is equal to infiltrability described by eq 28 the parameters can be determined by the method shown in section 2 4 3 the predicted tnp is less than tn 1 which means the cumulative rainfall before this interval is enough to cause ponding thus the infiltration rate is equal to infiltrability and can be calculated by eq 28 in which the parameters are from previous steady rainfall interval i e tn 2 tn 1 3 validation the proposed method was compared with the richards equation solutions to evaluate its performance for this purpose three soils including a loam a sandy loam and a silt loam soil were selected for model evaluation the van genuchten soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 1 the hillslope richards equation illustrated in eq 1 was solved numerically using hydrus 1d simunek et al 2008 to eliminate the boundary effects the soil depth was set to 6 m with dense mesh near the upper boundary and sparse mesh near the lower boundary the upper boundary was considered as atmospheric boundary with no ponding water while the lower one was set to be free drainage the pressure head initial condition was applied to reduce the numerical error radcliffe and simunek 2010 and distributed uniform along with the depth the initial pressure heads corresponding to volumetric water content of 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 for loam were studied hillslope angle from 0 to 60 was evaluated with an increment of 5 the rainfall intensity in the simulation ranged from 2 to 4 times of ks for steady rainfall conditions and piecewise rainfall intensity was set to 4 times of ks for unsteady rainfall at most eqs 19 and 22 were adopted in this paper to obtain the analytical solutions of ponding time and infiltrability eqs 20 and 23 were also applied for comparison to solve the infiltrability equation i e 19 or 20 as well as the ponding time equation i e 22 or 23 a variable step size and variable order adaptive quadrature simpson integration algorithm yang et al 2011 was applied in order to reduce the computational demand for infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration of steady rainfall eq 27 was used to fit the infiltrability curve and the infiltration after ponding can be described by eq 28 the detailed method of nonlinear regression includes the following steps 1 determine two ip t points based on the infiltrability relation 19 or 20 to do this two values of infiltrability ip were selected empirically one is ip equal to 0 125p 0 875ks cosγ to ensure that the approximate infiltrability curve approaches the steady infiltration period as accurately as possible the other is ip equal to p 0 125p 0 875ks 0 5 cosγ representing a medium value of infiltration rate after ponding on the hillslope the times corresponding to these values of infiltrability were calculated by solving eqs 19 or 20 2 determine the parameters a and b in eq 27 using the two ip t points obtained in step 1 for this purpose move ks to the left hand side of eq 27 and apply the logarithmic transformation to both sides and apply the linear regression analysis to obtain the parameters a and b in this way infiltration for steady rainfalls was determined by the ponding time and eq 28 it was found that the number of data points on the infiltrability relation has a minor effect on the final results for simplicity without losing the accuracy only two points as proposed were selected as for unsteady rainfall the hyetograph can be divided into several piecewise steady periods and the approach shown in section 2 5 can be applied to determine the ponding status and ponding time for each interval note that the parameters for unsteady rainfall were obtained using methods depicted in the section of steady rainfall and recalculated if ponding reoccurred at a new time interval of different intensity the reason for such treatment is that the fitting curve cannot completely replace the analytical solution and the errors for infiltration may propagate to the next ponding state richards equation solutions obtained using the hydrus 1d solver radcliffe and simunek 2010 simunek et al 2008 and results of the green ampt model for sloping surfaces with default model parameters chen and young 2006 were used for evaluating the approach of this study comparisons were made against each other under the same slope angle soil properties and rainfall conditions for the ease of comparison all the infiltration and runoff variables defined in the normal direction were converted to the vertical direction i e divided by cosγ while maintaining the properties of mass balance 4 results and discussion 4 1 infiltrability curve the infiltrability curves as well as cumulative infiltration for a loam a sandy loam and a silt loam soil calculated from eqs 19 and 20 were compared with that from hydrus 1d the results are presented in fig 2 the two approaches produced similar infiltrability curves fig 2a d and cumulative infiltration fig 2a d although both eqs 19 and 20 perform well compared with the hydrus 1d results eq 19 fits hydrus 1d slightly better for the loam fig 2a b and silt loam fig 2c while eq 20 fits hydrus 1d slightly better for the sandy loam eq 20 underestimates infiltrability for the loam and silt loam and eqs 19 and 20 slightly overestimate infiltrability for sandy loam in addition the infiltrability predicted by eq 20 is always less than that by eq 19 and the difference between eqs 19 and 20 is smallest for coarse soil i e sandy loam and largest for fine soil i e silt loam which indicates that the difference is smaller for coarser texture soils thus the difference caused by the different flux concentration relations i e function of f and initial unsaturated hydraulic conductivity i e ki is not trivial and cannot be totally ignored especially for fine soils 4 2 ponding time in this study eqs 22 and 23 were used to obtained ponding time and were compared with hydrus 1d the comparison was made for a loam soil and a silt loam under constant rainfalls with various rainfall intensities and initial soil moisture contents and the results are shown in fig 3 it is found that the ponding time increases with slope angle fig 3a c and decreases with increasing rainfall intensity fig 3a c and increasing initial soil water content fig 3b c the trends for the results of eqs 22 and 23 agree with that of hydrus 1d which confirms eq 24 further the results of eq 22 agree well with that of hydrus 1d with only 2 or smaller average relative errors on the contrary the results of eq 23 underestimate the ponding time which leads to 10 or even larger relative errors the ponding time evaluated by eq 23 is substantially less than that by eq 22 and the difference between them is larger for larger slope angles and lower rainfall intensities as well as lower initial soil water contents this indicates that the flux concentration relation f θ is more accurate than f 1 in predicting the ponding time for sloping surfaces also note that eqs 20 and 23 neglect the hydraulic conductivity corresponding to the initial soil moisture this is usually a small quantity for relatively dry soils however when soil moisture is high at the beginning it may have some impact on the result therefore eqs 19 and 22 can find more general use and will provide more accurate results for calculating runoff which is often a small fraction of rainfall but has a substantial impact in flooding 4 3 hillslope infiltration under steady rainfall three soils were used to simulate the infiltration process under given rainfalls the sloping green ampt model with default parameters and hydrus 1d were compared with the method proposed in this paper i e eqs 19 22 and 28 denoting as this paper the results are shown in fig 4 it is found that the method proposed in this paper predicts ponding time successfully while the sloping green ampt overestimates it as a result the infiltration rate after ponding predicted by sloping green ampt is also overestimated fig 4a c the proposed method shows good consistency with hydrus 1d for the three soils compared with the hydrus 1d solution the relative error for the proposed method is much smaller than that of the sloping green ampt model with default parameters fig 4d f the maximum relative errors for the proposed method are all less than 4 for the three soils while that for sloping green ampt exceed 15 however our calculation shows that the relative error for both methods will diminish after a sufficiently long time of rainfall in addition using a different flux concentration relation i e f 1 and ignoring initial unsaturated hydraulic conductivity were also considered i e eqs 20 23 and 28 denoted as reference for comparisons and shown in fig 4d f as analyzed above the results produced from eqs 20 and 23 are always less than that by eqs 21 and 24 thus the ponding time is underestimated and the maximum relative error with a given period is enlarged for the three soils especially for the fine soil i e silt loam with a maximum relative error more than 7 nevertheless the reference method still performs better than the sloping green ampt the results also infer that the reference method is more suitable for coarse soils and long period steady rainfall while the proposed method in this paper is not limited to these conditions further the same results may occur when the eq 23 was replaced by eq 22 or eq 20 was replaced by eq 19 in the reference method 4 4 hillslope infiltration under unsteady rainfall in this study infiltration under two unsteady rainfalls was simulated for two soils fig 5 shows the results of the proposed method compared with that of sloping green ampt with default parameters and hydrus 1d infiltration under unsteady rainfalls showed a more complex behavior than that under steady rainfalls fig 5a d for the case of the loam soil under a rainfall with increasing rainfall intensity after an initial decrease fig 5a ponding occurred twice during the rainfall making the simulating more challenging for the case of the silt loam under a rainfall with step wise increasing intensity ponding occurred only once fig 5d in addition the ponding time is captured accurately by the proposed method compared with the hydrus 1d simulation as a result the results of proposed method for the entire infiltration processes are in good agreement with that of hydrus 1d on the other hand sloping green ampt overestimates the ponding time and the infiltration rate after ponding for which the reason may be related to the model parameterization chen et al 2015 deng and zhu 2016 in the first case the difference between the proposed method and sloping green ampt initiates at the second ponding time fig 5a b moreover the relative error for the proposed method is lower than green ampt and the maximum relative errors for proposed method are no more than 2 while those for green ampt exceed 15 fig 5c f this indicates that the importance of ponding time estimation in complex rainfalls is no less than the infiltrability relation as done in hillslope steady rainfall infiltration the reference method was depicted in fig 5c f the results show the ponding times are underestimated and the relative errors are enlarged when compared to the proposed method in this paper especially for the fine soils the maximum relative error for the reference method is more than 4 and may be greater for fine soils nevertheless the performances of the reference method are much better than the slopping green ampt 4 5 the sensitivity of the solution to the forms of f θ two types of f θ relation were selected for a sensitivity analysis sine and power functions philip 1973 white et al 1979 kutilek 1980 the results for the forms and their impacts on the infiltrability and ponding time are shown in fig 6 it can be found that the infiltrability and ponding time can be accurately predicted by f θ this agrees with sivapalan and milly 1989 who pointed out that f θ was exact for soils with delta diffusivity and thus the tca was exact however the cumulative infiltrability and ponding time were underestimated when using other forms of f θ for cumulative infiltrability the underestimation is negligible for small time but evident for large time which suggests that the soil water profile is independent of the form of f at the early stage of infiltration and the difference becomes prominent at late time for ponding time fig 6c the difference is larger for steeper hillslopes and up to 11 difference was observed when different forms of f were selected nevertheless the f θ may not be the most accurate form of f when the soil water diffusivity is not closely approximated by a delta function but it can describe a wide variety of natural soils and probably is the most useful function for the flux concentration 5 conclusion a new approach quantifying the infiltration for both steady and unsteady rainfall has been developed in this paper the results show that the proposed model outperforms the sloping green ampt model when compared with the richards equation an infiltrability equation was derived by integrating the darcy flux equation for sloping surfaces with considering the flux concentration relation the equation led to a new relation that scales the infiltration time on sloping surfaces based on that on horizontal planes with the same soil and initial moisture conditions the results obtained from the infiltrability equation agreed well with that from hydrus 1d in the proposed approach the ponding time for steady rainfall can be analytically quantified the theory indicates that the ponding time for hillslope can be corrected by a factor of 1 cos2γ to that for horizontal surfaces furthermore the results show that the average relative error of ponding time can be substantially reduced when an appropriate flux concentration function is selected and the impact of initial condition correctly accounted for by applying the tca theory the infiltrability equation was applied to the rainfall conditions to calculate the infiltration rate and depth a simplified approach was developed to approximate the infiltrability equation with much reduced computational demand while still maintained the accuracy of simulation comparison of the proposed approach with hydrus 1d and sloping green ampt show that for both constant and unsteady rainfalls the proposed approach agreed well with richards equation solutions and outperformed the green ampt model in both ponding time and the infiltration rate as wells as the cumulative infiltration different flux concentration relations and the initial condition impact were also considered in the comparisons the results show that a proper flux concentration relation and the consideration of initial moisture condition impact can improve the performance of the hillslope infiltration model acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key research and

7491,trends in flow discharge temperature and rainfall from the qom rood watershed iran for a period of 1979 2016 were analyzed at monthly and annual time scales trend analyses were conducted using the mann kendall test the double mass curve of mean annual discharge versus rainfall and rainfall runoff relationship before and after the 15 khordad dam operation multiple regression of flow discharge against rainfall and temperature was used to determine the residual trend at four meteorological and hydrological stations located upstream and downstream of the qom rood watershed results showed that the temperature at the upstream and downstream stations did not have any significant trend but a significant decreasing trend p 05 in rainfall was detected only in may z 1 66 at the downstream stations there was a significant positive trend p 05 in rainfall in february z 2 22 and july z 2 15 at the upstream stations and in october z 2 3 and november z 1 8 at the downstream stations however there was a noticeable decrease in monthly and annual flow discharge and residual trend at 99 significance level at the downstream stations at the upstream stations the flow discharges had significant p 05 declining trend in all months but annual flow discharge did not change significantly analysis of double mass curve between runoff and rainfall at the downstream stations showed an inconsistency in the line slope concordant with the time of 15 khordad dam operation annual mean discharge at the upstream stations did not show a significant change before and after 15 khordad dam operation however annual flow magnitude decreased significantly by 87 5 and 81 7 in shad abad and koohsefid respectively these results confirmed that natural driving forces did not affect flow discharge changes and the observed decreasing tendency in flow discharge at the downstream stations was due to 15 khordad dam and at the upstream stations due to diversion storage dams

lin et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2017 serago and vogel 2018 a major challenge for dam management is the determination of the acceptable alteration degree without impairing ecological health and ecosystem services accordingly the best option for the management of downstream flows is mimicking natural conditions as much as possible shirangi et al 2008 fantin cruz et al 2015 for water managers and decision makers it is necessary to know the role of climate and anthropogenic forces in flow discharge presently iran suffers from many soil and water related issues although studies e g abbaspour et al 2009 gorjian and ghobadian 2015 shahnidanesh et al 2016 have reported that water crisis in iran is mainly caused by climatic factors kousari and asadizarch 2011 found that the trend in rainfall in semi arid regions of iran did not significantly change in addition abtahi and safe 2014 did not discern any trend in rainfall in the namak lake basin other researchers i e khalighisigaroodi and ebrahimi 2010 hosseini et al 2012 hosseini and ashraf 2015 zeinoddini et al 2015 madani et al 2016 rahmati et al 2016 found that anthropogenic factors caused hydrological imbalances in iran these disparities call for a comprehensive evaluation of the hydrologic regimes countrywide with high spatial and temporal resolutions literature shows that the relationship between natural and regulated flow regimes in arid areas is challenging to ascertain the role of climate change and anthropogenic forces is therefore essential for better management of water at the watershed scale hence the objective of this study was to discriminate the effects of dam construction and climate changes on the alternation in streamflow at monthly and annual bases the qom rood watershed with many important cities industries and endangering ecosystems was selected for the study human interventions in natural resources have markedly intensified in recent decades in this watershed spatial and temporal variations of temperature rainfall and flow discharge were analyzed using data from 1979 to 2016 despite many studies on changes in climatic variables worldwide as well as in iran debate on the role of climate change in hydrological behavior has continued this study therefore attempted to quantify the role of climate change and anthropogenic influence in the alternation of streamflow which may help formulate regional strategies for water resources management which has not been undertaken in central iran the present study is different from other studies in that it considers the effect of dam construction in changing flow discharge at different time scales four different methods of mann kendall test double mass curve of mean annual discharge versus rainfall and rainfall runoff relationship pre and post dam operation and residual trend were applied the findings of this study will provide insights into the linkage between climate change and hydrological cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qom rood watershed was chosen as a study area because of increasing water related issues and the availability of quality data for pre and post dam construction the qom rood watershed 32 50 34 50 n and 49 30 51 20 e with an area of some 16 000 km2 is located in central iran the study watershed and geographical positions of the selected stations are presented in fig 1 the watershed with rainfall from 126 5 to 506 9 mm and an average of 200 mm is characterized by arid bw and semi arid bs climates based on the de marton climate classification for this study we divided the watershed into two sections viz the upstream of the 15 khordad dam and the downstream area between the 15 khordad dam and the namak lake estuary is a habitat for many endangered fauna and flora species hajirostamloo 2009 human activities and climate change have disturbed the hydrological behavior of the qom rood watershed hence it has become as one of the most fragile watersheds in iran ghorbani 2013 we tried to dissect the impacts of 15 khordad dam construction and climate factors on river flow in the qom rood watershed at different time scales 2 2 datasets the maximum available and common datasets of temperature rainfall and flow discharge with a record length of 456 months or 38 years from 1979 to 2016 were utilized at monthly and annual scales the datasets included 21 years since the 15 khordad dam came into operation it may be noted that 1995 was the time when 15 khordad dam with 96 8 m height 2 108 m3 storage capacity and 1 3 104 m2 surface area with the maximum level was impounded the amount of water which is annually released evaporates and drains from 15 khordad dam is 54 8 106 12 2 106 and 3 4 106 m3 respectively the data were obtained from ministry of energy of iran collected at four hydrological and meteorological stations throughout the qom rood watershed fig 1 two of the hydrological stations i e bagher abad and doodehak and meteorological stations i e ahmad abad and hossein abad are located upstream of the dam and the other two hydrological stations i e shad abad and koohsefid and meteorological stations i e salarieh and massileh are located downstream of the dam 2 3 time series analyses trend analysis was applied to determine temporal alternations i e increasing or decreasing of temperature rainfall and flow discharge delvi and goswami 2015 since most of the hydrological and meteorological series in arid and semi arid areas are expected to have significant skew the non parametric mann kendall m k test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was applied to analyze trends jhajharia et al 2012 2014 niazi et al 2014 sadeghi and hazbavi 2015 gajbhiye et al 2016 this test has been widely used to detect trends in various environmental meteorological and hydrological variables and related indicator data yu et al 2002 hamed 2008 liang et al 2011 liu et al 2008 sadeghi and hazbavi 2015 yang et al 2017 two tailed confidence 95 levels were used for the mann kendall test for detecting trends however the limits of 95 and 99 are shown in the relevant figures to provide more detailed information in addition we developed a multiple regression of flow discharge against temperature and rainfall and analyzed the trend of discharge residuals in time discharge residuals illustrate the differences between observed and predicted discharges significant trends in residuals emphasize the existence one or more variables which significantly affected flow discharge chen and grasby 2014 ibrahim et al 2015 chen et al 2016 2 4 correlation and regression analyses regression analysis between runoff as the dependent and rainfall as the independent variable for two data subsets of pre period i e 1979 1995 and post period i e 1995 2016 of 15 khordad dam operation was carried out xu et al 2010 the regressions were developed for hydrological and metrological stations located upstream and downstream of the dam to allow for diagnosing any probable change that occurred in the rainfall runoff relationship 2 5 double mass curve analysis to determine the change points in the rainfall outflow relationship the double mass curve as a visual effective practical and widely applied method was used mu et al 2007 liu et al 2013 wagesho 2014 breaks in the slope were applied to detect changing trends a break in the slope was insignificant if it persisted for 5 years whereas it was considered a trend if it prolonged for more than 5 years albert 2004 the double mass curve of mean annual discharge versus rainfall during the study period was applied to further ascertain the role of dam operation in the changing hydrologic behavior of the qom rood watershed 2 6 paired student s t tests for determination of changes in flow discharge student s paired t test was also utilized meitzen 2016 significant differences between the two periods for monthly and annual mean discharge were measured in order to represent the alternation between the two periods the alternation percentage was calculated from one period to the next according to the changes in significant percentages the flow discharge was classified into four classes the 25 difference threshold was selected as an indicator decreasing flow with more than 25 change between the two periods refers to the drier term between 0 and 25 refers to the drier condition but within the normal range of variation and between 0 and 25 increase illustrates the wetter condition but within the normal range of change and greater than 25 increase points to the wetter condition kennard et al 2010 meitzen 2016 more than 25 change emphasized that the external control factors significantly affected flow discharge meitzen 2016 3 results the present study was conducted to analyze trends in temperature and rainfall and flow discharge in the qom rood central large watershed of iran to determine climatic and man made effects on flow discharge variations the study was conducted at monthly and annual scales 3 1 temperature rainfall flow discharge and flow discharge residual trend trends in monthly temperature are plotted in fig 2 that verify significant trends at 95 and 99 levels as shown from fig 2 the trends in mean temperature at both monthly and annual scales were small and statistically insignificant at 95 level upstream and downstream of the dam the alternation in monthly temperature was overwhelmingly positive but a negative insignificant pattern was detected in january february october november and december at all four meteorological stations fig 3 also shows positive statistical significant trends in rainfall the increase in rainfall trends in july november december and february was statistically significant at ahmad abad massileh salarieh and hossein abad stations respectively a negative trend at 95 significant level was observed in rainfall at massileh station in may the annual rainfall trend at all stations except ahmad abad was insignificantly positive despite insignificant changes in temperature and an increase in rainfall trend significant negative trends were noticed in flow discharge as shown in fig 4 downstream of the dam declining trends were statistically significant at 99 level in all cases discharge decreased significantly at 95 level in the upstream watershed hence flow discharge decreased insignificantly at bagher abad station in may and june at doodehak station in june and july and also in other months at both stations annual trends in the upstream watershed did not have a significant decline trends in flow discharge in the pre and post 15 khordad dam construction period at downstream stations are depicted in fig 5 it is clearly seen from the figure that the discharge trend in the two periods did not significantly change at monthly and annual scales the results of multiple regression between flow discharge against temperature and rainfall are demonstrated in fig 6 as was already explained regression was established using the data series for 1979 1995 before the main operation of the 15 khordad dam and then it was used to predict discharge monthly and annual residual trends decreased significantly downstream of the dam the difference between observed and predicted discharges during the study period had a significant declining trend monthly trends were negative and declined insignificantly in the upstream watershed for all months except june july and august at bagher abad and in july and august at doodehak stations where flow discharge increased insignificantly at this section annual and monthly residual discharge trends declined insignificantly the discharge residual trends before and after 15 khordad dam operation periods and for downstream stations are charted in fig 7 it is seen that at both stations the trends of discharge residual were insignificant in pre and post dam construction periods at monthly and annul scales 3 2 rainfall runoff relationships the variations of flow discharge at study stations over the data length are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 a d flow discharge in the downstream watershed declined dramatically in the late 1990 s fig 8c and d in the upstream watershed flow discharge showed a normal fluctuation during the whole study period therefore for understanding these changes the relationship between annual rainfall and annual runoff was analyzed using linear regression and assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 results for both pre and post periods of 15 khordad dam impoundments and stations situated in the downstream watershed are shown in fig 9 fig 9 illustrates a good relationship r2 0 5 between annual discharge and rainfall at all stations before the 15 khordad dam operation period hence this relationship remained for the upstream stations after dam operation period the relationship were drastically changed towards very low slopes one for the post period at the downstream stations of the 15 khordad dam due to the effect of dam construction on the changing flow discharge the flow regime in the downstream watershed therefore varied and the relationship between rainfall and flow discharge changed between the pre and post dam periods greatly indicating that there was no definable relationship for the downstream stations after dam operation 3 3 double mass curve double mass curves were also developed between mean annual discharge and rainfall at all four stations before and after 15 khordad dam construction and results are demonstrated in fig 10 according to fig 10 a d points of changes in discharge were identified by eliminating the effect of rainfall after 15 khordad dam operations in the downstream watershed these change points provided another evidence of decreasing flow discharge and influence of dam on discharge trend in the downstream watershed the slopes of regression lines for before and after15 khordad dam operations periods at the downstream stations varied from 0 06 and 0 01 to 0 008 and 0 0008 respectively but remained unchanged at the upstream stations 3 4 paired student s t test table 1 illustrates the paired t test statistics for the two study periods 1979 1995 and 1995 2016 the pattern of change in flow at bagher abad station was complex and insignificant at all monthly and annual scales doodehak station in may experienced flow with a 7 1 magnitude increase but in january and february flow decreased by 20 4 and 21 8 respectively the greatest and the least amounts of significant changes at the downstream stations were associated with koohsefid station in february and shad abad station in november by 90 0 and 53 2 respectively at this section results showed a significant decrease for all months expect june through december at khoohsefid station where flow discharge experienced a significant decreasing trend 4 discussion 4 1 trend analyses of temperature rainfall discharge and discharge residual time series undesirable ecological impacts of dam often are associated with hydrological flow alterations poff and zimmerman 2010 rasanen et al 2017 climate factors control discharge in normal rivers in which both predictor hydrological variables simultaneously change and reservoirs have a little influence on annual discharge nevertheless in deficit rivers anthropogenic interferences noticeably affect discharge and the recorded discharge is significantly less than the estimated one milliman et al 2008 results of the study show that an increasing trend in temperature would lead to more evaporation transpiration which might be expected to influence the discharge trend to decrease yang et al 2015 however evaporation and transpiration rate are not controlled by temperature only di baldassarre and montanari 2009 and therefore an insignificant positive trend in temperature could not necessarily explain a significant decrease in discharge trend results of this study agreed with chen et al 2016 in yangtze river china who found that a temperature increase did not have any detectable impact on discharge trend complex patterns of change were detected in the rainfall trend only in one case massileh station in may the trend declined significantly and discharge trend did not follow monthly and annual rainfall trends figs 3 and 4 in the upstream watershed monthly flow discharge significantly decreased in all months expect may and june at bagher abad and june and july at doodehak stations the flow discharge in these months was controlled by water released from some diversion storage dams e g koch e ray khansar kahriz abbas abad ghido and khoghan with a total storage capacity of some 2 2 108 m3 water releases from diversion dams help these sections of watershed become more similar to the natural condition in these months with an almost one month delay in between the 15 khordad dam with a 2 0 108 m3 reservoir storage significantly changed the river flow discharge downstream at both annual and monthly scales results fig 5 clearly illustrated that at the downstream stations in the pre and post periods of 15 khordad dam impoundments there was no additional effective driver for flow discharge according to fig 6 as a result of limited water release from diversion storage dams in june july and august at bagher abad station and in july and august at doodehak station discharge residuals from multiple regression of discharge against temperature and rainfall were insignificantly positive however in other months and at the annual scale in this watershed section the difference between observed and predicted discharge was influenced insignificantly by diversion storage dams and illustrated a negative trend the residuals illustrated a significant declining trend in all cases with different levels 95 and 99 at the downstream stations since observed discharges were significantly less than predicted discharges by contrast according to fig 7 in the two study periods i e pre and post dam operation at the downstream stations there was no additional variable with a significant influence on the discharge residual comparison between the results of figs 6 and 7 emphasized the role of 15 khordad dam as an additional variable that significantly affected discharge and therefore altered the residual trend therefore natural factors did not explain the discharge and anthropogenic activates overtaking natural parameters as reported by modarres and silva 2007 mei et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 and chen et al 2016 before and after 15 khordad dam operation no significant change in the relationship between temperature rainfall and discharge was detected results quantified the alteration from natural conditions caused by the reservoir construction and operation mathews and richter 2007 the flow discharge in the downstream watershed was controlled by 15 khordad dam and water entering the downstream area was only annual rainfall annual flow discharge release from 15 khordad dam was about 54 8 106 m3 of which about 30 8 106 m3 was allocated for domestic use and the rest was consumed by the irrigation sector it means that annual flow discharge now was about 85 less than the flow that was used to reach from the qom rood river before dam operation rahmatizadeh and jafari 2014 according to these results in the downstream watershed unlike normal rivers the hydrological regime was dramatically influenced by dam construction whilst the hydrological condition in the upstream watershed was determined to be as a normal river and was completely different from the downstream condition in this area despite the construction of some diversion storage dams over the study period and regulating the hydrological regime and flow the human activates did not significantly affect the annual flow discharge the effect of dam operation on flow discharge regulation has been reported by many researchers throughout the globe e g richter et al 1996 magilligan and nislow 2005 lu and siew 2006 xu et al 2010 mcmanamay et al 2012 žganec 2012 piman et al 2013 cochrane et al 2014 fan et al 2015 räsänen et al 2017 these results are contrary to what was reported by xu et al 2007 in southern china regarding the little impact of human activates on river discharge these findings are also different from the results obtained by chen et al 2016 who detected despite the intensive dam building in the yangtze watershed that annual discharge did not seem to exhibit a significant change modarres and silva 2007 who found that during 1965 2000 at 79 climatologically stations in arid and semi arid regions of iran annual rainfall trend at more than 60 of stations did not change significantly also reported similar results yang et al 2015 found that in yangtze river water and sediment flow discharges were influenced 60 70 and 30 40 from natural and anthropogenic changes respectively 4 2 rainfall runoff relationships in pre and post dam construction year 1995 was the time when the operation of 15 khordad dam commenced this time was the point of abrupt decline of stream flow downstream of the qom rood river fig 8 in this case the time point of 1995 was accepted as the change point for stream flow and flow data were subdivided into two periods i e pre and post the flow regime downstream varied and the relationship between rainfall and runoff greatly changed between the pre and post dam periods indicating that there was no correct relationship for downstream stations after the dam operation fig 9 this means that the runoff at the downstream stations was controlled by dam operation these results are in agreement with zhao et al 2012 who showed the effect of dam construction on runoff in lancang river china during the period of 1957 2000 their results were based on comparing actual observed monthly runoff with simulated monthly runoff after dam construction 1993 2000 they further found that monthly runoff was disturbed by dam construction however the present finding was dissimilar to lu 2004 who obtained that between the 1950 s and the 1970 s in both northern and southern china rivers rainfall and runoff had the same correlation and were altered by dam construction lin et al 2017 also showed the effect of reservoir operation in the yujiang river in china on changing hydrological regime 4 3 analysis of double mass curve between annual discharge and rainfall the break in the slope of the regression line in double mass curve of annual discharge versus rainfall illustrated that 15 khordad dam operation regulated water discharge downstream this is in agreement with wagesho 2014 in rift valley lakes basin of ethiopia and li et al 2016 who in a karst region of southwest china determined the time effect of human activates and climate change on the hydrological regime by slope break in mass curve 4 4 analysis of flow discharge in pre and post dam construction according to table 1 paired t test statistics for the two periods verified a significant discharge change at doodehak in january february toward a drier condition and in may toward a wetter condition referring to normal sources of variation at all downstream stations the magnitude change was significant and the drier condition was experienced which refers to the 15 khordad dam effect on discharge regulation discharge at the upstream stations was not modified by major dams compared to shad abad and koohsefid stations and stream flow changes were influenced by some diversion storage dams constructed over the period data sets these results are in agreement with meitzen 2016 who showed that major dams and population modified the discharge magnitude in north carolina usa the operation of 15 khordad dam altered the hydrological regime with direct impacts on the downstream flow leading to the potential influence on biological and physical components of fauna and flora species as reported by meitzen 2016 the alternation in flow discharge without paying attention to standard monthly flow discharge led to the logout interaction between upstream and downstream sections in the qom rood watershed the loss of flow associated with ecological impacts causes a huge stress on the downstream ecosystem due to the lack of floods to wash soil the salt concentration in the soil surface layers has increased the vegetation roots have lost access to water and natural vegetation type has turned to the aggressive plants and ultimately has replaced this region as a productive agricultural area by real desert rahmatizadeh and jafari 2014 results emphasize the importance of optimizing the regulated flow according to the characteristics and causes of alterations as well as their influence on river and floodplain environments for sustainable management of the downstream watershed gao et al 2012 it must be emphasized that before storage dam construction environmental flows relative to other competing demands must be guaranteed environmental flows contain flows that consider nutrient cycle geomorphic and biological processes and provide a habitable wetted area for foraging and survival and the equilibrium between nature s and people s water requirements as a sustainable development goal meitzen 2016 5 conclusions the present research analyzed trends in annual and monthly temperature rainfall and flow discharge in the qom rood watershed over the period from 1979 to 2016 results revealed that temperature has remained virtually unchanged over the period of record so the temperature could not have any detectable impact on the change of flow discharge rainfall trends were also very complex upstream and downstream of 15 khordad dam over this period significant and insignificant increasing trends in rainfall occurred widely across the watershed but only a significant declining trend was observed in may a significant decrease in flow discharge in the lower watershed was observed after the completion of the 15 khordad dam in 1995 downstream of 15 khordad dam annual and monthly discharge trends changed dramatically due to the impoundment of 15 khordad dam but upstream of 15 khordad dam monthly flow discharge altered due to the role of diversion dams however the annual discharge flow did not change significantly the correlation between flow discharge and rainfall in the upper and lower parts of the watershed were not alike with a very low dependency of flow discharge on rainfall in the downstream area owing to the dam regulation the developments in the qom rood watershed have stopped river flow into the plain of shad abad koohsefid and ultimately the namak lake the deficit qom rood river has a fragile balance between environment and human needs of natural resources whose sustainable management has become an important issue the final ecological consequence would evidently be anthropogenic desertification if these ecosystems not to be understood completely ultimately in the qom rood watershed human activities are a critical factor and have more effect on the hydrologic cycles than climate factors it is further concluded from the results that the hydrological models without considering man made interferences must be used with caution in the simulation of watershed behavior however further monitoring for a longer period with more crucial attention to environmental flow is needed to allow

7491,trends in flow discharge temperature and rainfall from the qom rood watershed iran for a period of 1979 2016 were analyzed at monthly and annual time scales trend analyses were conducted using the mann kendall test the double mass curve of mean annual discharge versus rainfall and rainfall runoff relationship before and after the 15 khordad dam operation multiple regression of flow discharge against rainfall and temperature was used to determine the residual trend at four meteorological and hydrological stations located upstream and downstream of the qom rood watershed results

downstream stations there was a significant positive trend p 05 in rainfall in february z 2 22 and july z 2 15 at the upstream stations and in october z 2 3 and november z 1 8 at the downstream

discharges had significant p 05 declining trend in all months but annual flow discharge did not change significantly analysis of double mass curve between runoff and rainfall at the downstream stations showed an inconsistency in the line slope concordant with the time of 15 khordad dam operation annual mean discharge at the upstream stations did not show a significant change before and after 15 khordad dam operation however annual flow magnitude decreased significantly by 87 5 and 81 7 in shad abad and koohsefid respectively these results confirmed that natural driving forces did not affect flow discharge changes and the observed decreasing tendency in flow discharge at the downstream stations was due to 15 khordad dam and at the upstream stations due to diversion storage dams

hydrological series of different rivers from around the world that occurred in response to climate change in some arid and semi arid areas anthropogenic driving forces have intensified and have

serago and vogel 2018 construction and operation of dams are one of the important anthropogenic forces poff et al 2007 macmanamy et al 2012 nearly 45 000 large dams have been constructed around the

et al 2011 massuel et al 2014 storage dams have been constructed for multipurposes although hydropower and flood control are the common main dam function in these regions many dams operate as storage

lin et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2017 serago and vogel 2018 a major challenge for dam management is the determination of the acceptable alteration degree without impairing ecological health and ecosystem services accordingly the best option for the management of downstream flows is mimicking natural conditions as much as possible shirangi et al 2008 fantin cruz et al 2015 for water managers and decision makers it is necessary to know the role of climate and anthropogenic forces in flow discharge presently iran suffers from many soil and water related issues although studies e g abbaspour et al 2009 gorjian and ghobadian 2015 shahnidanesh et al 2016 have reported that water crisis in iran is mainly caused by climatic factors kousari and asadizarch 2011 found that the trend in rainfall in semi arid regions of iran did not significantly change in addition abtahi and safe 2014 did not discern any trend in rainfall in the namak lake basin other researchers i e khalighisigaroodi and ebrahimi 2010 hosseini et al 2012 hosseini and ashraf 2015 zeinoddini et al 2015 madani et al 2016 rahmati et al 2016 found that anthropogenic factors caused hydrological imbalances in iran these disparities call for a comprehensive evaluation of the hydrologic regimes countrywide with high spatial and temporal resolutions literature shows that the relationship between natural and regulated flow regimes in arid areas is challenging to ascertain the role of climate change and anthropogenic forces is therefore essential for better management of water at the watershed scale hence the objective of this study was to discriminate the effects of dam construction and climate changes on the alternation in streamflow at monthly and annual bases the qom rood watershed with many important cities industries and endangering ecosystems was selected for the study human interventions in natural resources have markedly intensified in recent decades in this watershed spatial and temporal variations of temperature rainfall and flow discharge were analyzed using data from 1979 to 2016 despite many studies on changes in climatic variables worldwide as well as in iran debate on the role of climate change in hydrological behavior has continued this study therefore attempted to quantify the role of climate change and anthropogenic influence in the alternation of streamflow which may help formulate regional strategies for water resources management which has not been undertaken in central iran the present study is different from other studies in that it considers the effect of dam construction in changing flow discharge at different time scales four different methods of mann kendall test double mass curve of mean annual discharge versus rainfall and rainfall runoff relationship pre and post dam operation and residual trend were applied the findings of this study will provide insights into the linkage between climate change and hydrological cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qom rood watershed was chosen as a study area because of increasing water related issues and the availability of quality data for pre and post dam construction the qom rood watershed 32 50 34 50 n and 49 30 51 20 e with an area of some 16 000 km2 is located in central iran the study watershed and geographical positions of the selected stations are presented in fig 1 the watershed with rainfall from 126 5 to 506 9 mm and an average of 200 mm is characterized by arid bw and semi arid bs climates based on the de marton climate classification for this study we divided the watershed into two sections viz the upstream of the 15 khordad dam and the downstream area between the 15 khordad dam and the namak lake estuary is a habitat for many endangered fauna and flora species hajirostamloo 2009 human activities and climate change have disturbed the hydrological behavior of the qom rood watershed hence it has become as one of the most fragile watersheds in iran ghorbani 2013 we tried to dissect the impacts of 15 khordad dam construction and climate factors on river flow in the qom rood watershed at different time scales 2 2 datasets the maximum available and common datasets of temperature rainfall and flow discharge with a record length of 456 months or 38 years from 1979 to 2016 were utilized at monthly and annual scales the datasets included 21 years since the 15 khordad dam came into operation it may be noted that 1995 was the time when 15 khordad dam with 96 8 m height 2 108 m3 storage capacity and 1 3 104 m2 surface area with the maximum level was impounded the amount of water which is annually released evaporates and drains from 15 khordad dam is 54 8 106 12 2 106 and 3 4 106 m3 respectively the data were obtained from ministry of energy of iran collected at four hydrological and meteorological stations throughout the qom rood watershed fig 1 two of the hydrological stations i e bagher abad and doodehak and meteorological stations i e ahmad abad and hossein abad are located upstream of the dam and the other two hydrological stations i e shad abad and koohsefid and meteorological stations i e salarieh and massileh are located downstream of the dam 2 3 time series analyses trend analysis was applied to determine temporal alternations i e increasing or decreasing of temperature rainfall and flow discharge delvi and goswami 2015 since most of the hydrological and meteorological series in arid and semi arid areas are expected to have significant skew the non parametric mann kendall m k test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was applied to analyze trends jhajharia et al 2012 2014 niazi et al 2014 sadeghi and hazbavi 2015 gajbhiye et al 2016 this test has been widely used to detect trends in various environmental meteorological and hydrological variables and related indicator data yu et al 2002 hamed 2008 liang et al 2011 liu et al 2008 sadeghi and hazbavi 2015 yang et al 2017 two tailed confidence 95 levels were used for the mann kendall test for detecting trends however the limits of 95 and 99 are shown in the relevant figures to provide more detailed information in addition we developed a multiple regression of flow discharge against temperature and rainfall and analyzed the trend of discharge residuals in time discharge residuals illustrate the differences between observed and predicted discharges significant trends in residuals emphasize the existence one or more variables which significantly affected flow discharge chen and grasby 2014 ibrahim et al 2015 chen et al 2016 2 4 correlation and regression analyses regression analysis between runoff as the dependent and rainfall as the independent variable for two data subsets of pre period i e 1979 1995 and post period i e 1995 2016 of 15 khordad dam operation was carried out xu et al 2010 the regressions were developed for hydrological and metrological stations located upstream and downstream of the dam to allow for diagnosing any probable change that occurred in the rainfall runoff relationship 2 5 double mass curve analysis to determine the change points in the rainfall outflow relationship the double mass curve as a visual effective practical and widely applied method was used mu et al 2007 liu et al 2013 wagesho 2014 breaks in the slope were applied to detect changing trends a break in the slope was insignificant if it persisted for 5 years whereas it was considered a trend if it prolonged for more than 5 years albert 2004 the double mass curve of mean annual discharge versus rainfall during the study period was applied to further ascertain the role of dam operation in the changing hydrologic behavior of the qom rood watershed 2 6 paired student s t tests for determination of changes in flow discharge student s paired t test was also utilized meitzen 2016 significant differences between the two periods for monthly and annual mean discharge were measured in order to represent the alternation between the two periods the alternation percentage was calculated from one period to the next according to the changes in significant percentages the flow discharge was classified into four classes the 25 difference threshold was selected as an indicator decreasing flow with more than 25 change between the two periods refers to the drier term between 0 and 25 refers to the drier condition but within the normal range of variation and between 0 and 25 increase illustrates the wetter condition but within the normal range of change and greater than 25 increase points to the wetter condition kennard et al 2010 meitzen 2016 more than 25 change emphasized that the external control factors significantly affected flow discharge meitzen 2016 3 results the present study was conducted to analyze trends in temperature and rainfall and flow discharge in the qom rood central large watershed of iran to determine climatic and man made effects on flow discharge variations the study was conducted at monthly and annual scales 3 1 temperature rainfall flow discharge and flow discharge residual trend trends in monthly temperature are plotted in fig 2 that verify significant trends at 95 and 99 levels as shown from fig 2 the trends in mean temperature at both monthly and annual scales were small and statistically insignificant at 95 level upstream and downstream of the dam the alternation in monthly temperature was overwhelmingly positive but a negative insignificant pattern was detected in january february october november and december at all four meteorological stations fig 3 also shows positive statistical significant trends in rainfall the increase in rainfall trends in july november december and february was statistically significant at ahmad abad massileh salarieh and hossein abad stations respectively a negative trend at 95 significant level was observed in rainfall at massileh station in may the annual rainfall trend at all stations except ahmad abad was insignificantly positive despite insignificant changes in temperature and an increase in rainfall trend significant negative trends were noticed in flow discharge as shown in fig 4 downstream of the dam declining trends were statistically significant at 99 level in all cases discharge decreased significantly at 95 level in the upstream watershed hence flow discharge decreased insignificantly at bagher abad station in may and june at doodehak station in june and july and also in other months at both stations annual trends in the upstream watershed did not have a significant decline trends in flow discharge in the pre and post 15 khordad dam construction period at downstream stations are depicted in fig 5 it is clearly seen from the figure that the discharge trend in the two periods did not significantly change at monthly and annual scales the results of multiple regression between flow discharge against temperature and rainfall are demonstrated in fig 6 as was already explained regression was established using the data series for 1979 1995 before the main operation of the 15 khordad dam and then it was used to predict discharge monthly and annual residual trends decreased significantly downstream of the dam the difference between observed and predicted discharges during the study period had a significant declining trend monthly trends were negative and declined insignificantly in the upstream watershed for all months except june july and august at bagher abad and in july and august at doodehak stations where flow discharge increased insignificantly at this section annual and monthly residual discharge trends declined insignificantly the discharge residual trends before and after 15 khordad dam operation periods and for downstream stations are charted in fig 7 it is seen that at both stations the trends of discharge residual were insignificant in pre and post dam construction periods at monthly and annul scales 3 2 rainfall runoff relationships the variations of flow discharge at study stations over the data length are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 a d flow discharge in the downstream watershed declined dramatically in the late 1990 s fig 8c and d in the upstream watershed flow discharge showed a normal fluctuation during the whole study period therefore for understanding these changes the relationship between annual rainfall and annual runoff was analyzed using linear regression and assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 results for both pre and post periods of 15 khordad dam impoundments and stations situated in the downstream watershed are shown in fig 9 fig 9 illustrates a good relationship r2 0 5 between annual discharge and rainfall at all stations before the 15 khordad dam operation period hence this relationship remained for the upstream stations after dam operation period the relationship were drastically changed towards very low slopes one for the post period at the downstream stations of the 15 khordad dam due to the effect of dam construction on the changing flow discharge the flow regime in the downstream watershed therefore varied and the relationship between rainfall and flow discharge changed between the pre and post dam periods greatly indicating that there was no definable relationship for the downstream stations after dam operation 3 3 double mass curve double mass curves were also developed between mean annual discharge and rainfall at all four stations before and after 15 khordad dam construction and results are demonstrated in fig 10 according to fig 10 a d points of changes in discharge were identified by eliminating the effect of rainfall after 15 khordad dam operations in the downstream watershed these change points provided another evidence of decreasing flow discharge and influence of dam on discharge trend in the downstream watershed the slopes of regression lines for before and after15 khordad dam operations periods at the downstream stations varied from 0 06 and 0 01 to 0 008 and 0 0008 respectively but remained unchanged at the upstream stations 3 4 paired student s t test table 1 illustrates the paired t test statistics for the two study periods 1979 1995 and 1995 2016 the pattern of change in flow at bagher abad station was complex and insignificant at all monthly and annual scales doodehak station in may experienced flow with a 7 1 magnitude increase but in january and february flow decreased by 20 4 and 21 8 respectively the greatest and the least amounts of significant changes at the downstream stations were associated with koohsefid station in february and shad abad station in november by 90 0 and 53 2 respectively at this section results showed a significant decrease for all months expect june through december at khoohsefid station where flow discharge experienced a significant decreasing trend 4 discussion 4 1 trend analyses of temperature rainfall discharge and discharge residual time series undesirable ecological impacts of dam often are associated with hydrological flow alterations poff and zimmerman 2010 rasanen et al 2017 climate factors control discharge in normal rivers in which both predictor hydrological variables simultaneously change and reservoirs have a little influence on annual discharge nevertheless in deficit rivers anthropogenic interferences noticeably affect discharge and the recorded discharge is significantly less than the estimated one milliman et al 2008 results of the study show that an increasing trend in temperature would lead to more evaporation transpiration which might be expected to influence the discharge trend to decrease yang et al 2015 however evaporation and transpiration rate are not controlled by temperature only di baldassarre and montanari 2009 and therefore an insignificant positive trend in temperature could not necessarily explain a significant decrease in discharge trend results of this study agreed with chen et al 2016 in yangtze river china who found that a temperature increase did not have any detectable impact on discharge trend complex patterns of change were detected in the rainfall trend only in one case massileh station in may the trend declined significantly and discharge trend did not follow monthly and annual rainfall trends figs 3 and 4 in the upstream watershed monthly flow discharge significantly decreased in all months expect may and june at bagher abad and june and july at doodehak stations the flow discharge in these months was controlled by water released from some diversion storage dams e g koch e ray khansar kahriz abbas abad ghido and khoghan with a total storage capacity of some 2 2 108 m3 water releases from diversion dams help these sections of watershed become more similar to the natural condition in these months with an almost one month delay in between the 15 khordad dam with a 2 0 108 m3 reservoir storage significantly changed the river flow discharge downstream at both annual and monthly scales results fig 5 clearly illustrated that at the downstream stations in the pre and post periods of 15 khordad dam impoundments there was no additional effective driver for flow discharge according to fig 6 as a result of limited water release from diversion storage dams in june july and august at bagher abad station and in july and august at doodehak station discharge residuals from multiple regression of discharge against temperature and rainfall were insignificantly positive however in other months and at the annual scale in this watershed section the difference between observed and predicted discharge was influenced insignificantly by diversion storage dams and illustrated a negative trend the residuals illustrated a significant declining trend in all cases with different levels 95 and 99 at the downstream stations since observed discharges were significantly less than predicted discharges by contrast according to fig 7 in the two study periods i e pre and post dam operation at the downstream stations there was no additional variable with a significant influence on the discharge residual comparison between the results of figs 6 and 7 emphasized the role of 15 khordad dam as an additional variable that significantly affected discharge and therefore altered the residual trend therefore natural factors did not explain the discharge and anthropogenic activates overtaking natural parameters as reported by modarres and silva 2007 mei et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 and chen et al 2016 before and after 15 khordad dam operation no significant change in the relationship between temperature rainfall and discharge was detected results quantified the alteration from natural conditions caused by the reservoir construction and operation mathews and richter 2007 the flow discharge in the downstream watershed was controlled by 15 khordad dam and water entering the downstream area was only annual rainfall annual flow discharge release from 15 khordad dam was about 54 8 106 m3 of which about 30 8 106 m3 was allocated for domestic use and the rest was consumed by the irrigation sector it means that annual flow discharge now was about 85 less than the flow that was used to reach from the qom rood river before dam operation rahmatizadeh and jafari 2014 according to these results in the downstream watershed unlike normal rivers the hydrological regime was dramatically influenced by dam construction whilst the hydrological condition in the upstream watershed was determined to be as a normal river and was completely different from the downstream condition in this area despite the construction of some diversion storage dams over the study period and regulating the hydrological regime and flow the human activates did not significantly affect the annual flow discharge the effect of dam operation on flow discharge regulation has been reported by many researchers throughout the globe e g richter et al 1996 magilligan and nislow 2005 lu and siew 2006 xu et al 2010 mcmanamay et al 2012 žganec 2012 piman et al 2013 cochrane et al 2014 fan et al 2015 räsänen et al 2017 these results are contrary to what was reported by xu et al 2007 in southern china regarding the little impact of human activates on river discharge these findings are also different from the results obtained by chen et al 2016 who detected despite the intensive dam building in the yangtze watershed that annual discharge did not seem to exhibit a significant change modarres and silva 2007 who found that during 1965 2000 at 79 climatologically stations in arid and semi arid regions of iran annual rainfall trend at more than 60 of stations did not change significantly also reported similar results yang et al 2015 found that in yangtze river water and sediment flow discharges were influenced 60 70 and 30 40 from natural and anthropogenic changes respectively 4 2 rainfall runoff relationships in pre and post dam construction year 1995 was the time when the operation of 15 khordad dam commenced this time was the point of abrupt decline of stream flow downstream of the qom rood river fig 8 in this case the time point of 1995 was accepted as the change point for stream flow and flow data were subdivided into two periods i e pre and post the flow regime downstream varied and the relationship between rainfall and runoff greatly changed between the pre and post dam periods indicating that there was no correct relationship for downstream stations after the dam operation fig 9 this means that the runoff at the downstream stations was controlled by dam operation these results are in agreement with zhao et al 2012 who showed the effect of dam construction on runoff in lancang river china during the period of 1957 2000 their results were based on comparing actual observed monthly runoff with simulated monthly runoff after dam construction 1993 2000 they further found that monthly runoff was disturbed by dam construction however the present finding was dissimilar to lu 2004 who obtained that between the 1950 s and the 1970 s in both northern and southern china rivers rainfall and runoff had the same correlation and were altered by dam construction lin et al 2017 also showed the effect of reservoir operation in the yujiang river in china on changing hydrological regime 4 3 analysis of double mass curve between annual discharge and rainfall the break in the slope of the regression line in double mass curve of annual discharge versus rainfall illustrated that 15 khordad dam operation regulated water discharge downstream this is in agreement with wagesho 2014 in rift valley lakes basin of ethiopia and li et al 2016 who in a karst region of southwest china determined the time effect of human activates and climate change on the hydrological regime by slope break in mass curve 4 4 analysis of flow discharge in pre and post dam construction according to table 1 paired t test statistics for the two periods verified a significant discharge change at doodehak in january february toward a drier condition and in may toward a wetter condition referring to normal sources of variation at all downstream stations the magnitude change was significant and the drier condition was experienced which refers to the 15 khordad dam effect on discharge regulation discharge at the upstream stations was not modified by major dams compared to shad abad and koohsefid stations and stream flow changes were influenced by some diversion storage dams constructed over the period data sets these results are in agreement with meitzen 2016 who showed that major dams and population modified the discharge magnitude in north carolina usa the operation of 15 khordad dam altered the hydrological regime with direct impacts on the downstream flow leading to the potential influence on biological and physical components of fauna and flora species as reported by meitzen 2016 the alternation in flow discharge without paying attention to standard monthly flow discharge led to the logout interaction between upstream and downstream sections in the qom rood watershed the loss of flow associated with ecological impacts causes a huge stress on the downstream ecosystem due to the lack of floods to wash soil the salt concentration in the soil surface layers has increased the vegetation roots have lost access to water and natural vegetation type has turned to the aggressive plants and ultimately has replaced this region as a productive agricultural area by real desert rahmatizadeh and jafari 2014 results emphasize the importance of optimizing the regulated flow according to the characteristics and causes of alterations as well as their influence on river and floodplain environments for sustainable management of the downstream watershed gao et al 2012 it must be emphasized that before storage dam construction environmental flows relative to other competing demands must be guaranteed environmental flows contain flows that consider nutrient cycle geomorphic and biological processes and provide a habitable wetted area for foraging and survival and the equilibrium between nature s and people s water requirements as a sustainable development goal meitzen 2016 5 conclusions the present research analyzed trends in annual and monthly temperature rainfall and flow discharge in the qom rood watershed over the period from 1979 to 2016 results revealed that temperature has remained virtually unchanged over the period of record so the temperature could not have any detectable impact on the change of flow discharge rainfall trends were also very complex upstream and downstream of 15 khordad dam over this period significant and insignificant increasing trends in rainfall occurred widely across the watershed but only a significant declining trend was observed in may a significant decrease in flow discharge in the lower watershed was observed after the completion of the 15 khordad dam in 1995 downstream of 15 khordad dam annual and monthly discharge trends changed dramatically due to the impoundment of 15 khordad dam but upstream of 15 khordad dam monthly flow discharge altered due to the role of diversion dams however the annual discharge flow did not change significantly the correlation between flow discharge and rainfall in the upper and lower parts of the watershed were not alike with a very low dependency of flow discharge on rainfall in the downstream area owing to the dam regulation the developments in the qom rood watershed have stopped river flow into the plain of shad abad koohsefid and ultimately the namak lake the deficit qom rood river has a fragile balance between environment and human needs of natural resources whose sustainable management has become an important issue the final ecological consequence would evidently be anthropogenic desertification if these ecosystems not to be understood completely ultimately in the qom rood watershed human activities are a critical factor and have more effect on the hydrologic cycles than climate factors it is further concluded from the results that the hydrological models without considering man made interferences must be used with caution in the simulation of watershed behavior however further monitoring for a longer period with more crucial attention to environmental flow is needed to allow

7492,stochastic dynamic programming sdp has been widely used to derive operating policies for reservoirs considering streamflow uncertainties in sdp there is a need to calculate the transition probability matrix more accurately and efficiently in order to improve the economic benefit of reservoir operation in this study we proposed a stochastic optimization model for hydropower generation reservoirs in which 1 the transition probability matrix was calculated based on copula functions and 2 the value function of the last period was calculated by stepwise iteration firstly the marginal distribution of stochastic inflow in each period was built and the joint distributions of adjacent periods were obtained using the three members of the archimedean copulas based on which the conditional probability formula was derived then the value in the last period was calculated by a simple recursive equation with the proposed stepwise iteration method and the value function was fitted with a linear regression model these improvements were incorporated into the classic sdp and applied to the case study in ertan reservoir china the results show that the transition probability matrix can be more easily and accurately obtained by the proposed copula function based method than conventional methods based on the observed or synthetic streamflow series and the reservoir operation benefit can also be increased keywords stochastic dynamic programming sdp copula function reservoir operation uncertainty value function 1 introduction the reservoir hydropower operation is generally formulated as a nonlinear stochastic optimization problem to guide the reservoir operation efficiently the reservoir operators usually predefine an operating policy in the design stage and use it in the real time operation according to the methods used to deal with stochastic inflow the operating policy can be obtained by 1 implicit stochastic optimization chandramouli and deka 2005 chandramouli and raman 2001 mehta and jain 2009 mousavi et al 2005 panigrahi and mujumdar 2000 willis et al 1984 young 1967 which can convert a stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one to operate the reservoir under several equally likely inflow scenarios and then extract the operating rules from the resulting set of optimal operating data 2 parameterization simulation optimization koutsoyiannis and economou 2003 koutsoyiannis et al 2010 momtahen and dariane 2007 nalbantis and koutsoyiannis 1997 oliveira and loucks 1997 tan et al 2017a which first predefines a shape for the rule curve based on some parameters and then use heuristic strategies to look for the combination of parameters that provide the best reservoir operating performance under possible inflow scenarios and 3 explicit stochastic optimization chou et al 2016 harboe 1993 which converts the inflow with different probabilities directly into the optimization problem stochastic dynamic programming sdp is one of the most popular explicit stochastic optimization methods celeste and billib 2009 previous studies on sdp have focused mainly on the inflow uncertainties and the curse of dimensionality the classical sdp model loucks et al 1981 does not take into account the forecast information in addressing the inflow uncertainties in reservoir operation given the significant effect of the forecast uncertainty on the reservoir operation it is explicitly incorporated into some reservoir operation models karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 mujumdar and nirmala 2007 stedinger et al 1984 xu et al 2014 kim and palmer 1997 karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 proposed a bayesian sdp bsdp model in which a bayesian approach was incorporated within the sdp formulation bsdp is different from the classical sdp in choosing state variables bayesian decision theory can easily incorporate new information by updating prior probabilities to posterior probabilities thus reducing the effect of natural and forecast uncertainties on the model kim and palmer 1997 proposed a bsdp model to investigate the value of seasonal inflow forecasts in hydropower generation based on which the monthly operating policies were derived for skagit hydropower system mujumdar and nirmala 2007 used the bsdp model to derive an operating policy for a multi reservoir hydropower generation system xu et al 2014 proposed a new two stage bsdp ts bsdp model for real time operation of cascaded hydropower systems to handle varying uncertainty of flow forecasts from quantitative precipitation forecasts in the last decades a number of aggregation disaggregation models have been proposed to solve the curse of dimensionality mujumdar and nirmala 2007 aggregated individual inflows of reservoirs in a cascaded hydropower system and used a bsdp model to represent the forecast uncertainty of the aggregate inflow tejada guibert et al 2010 and mujumdar and nirmala 2007 proposed sdp models in which only the inflows of individual reservoirs were aggregated and the storage of individual reservoirs and the aggregate flow were taken as state variables xu et al 2014 proposed a ts bsdp model with aggregate flow and storage of individual reservoirs as state variables to reduce the complexity of the optimal problem the curse of dimensionality can also be avoided by approximating the value function by the iteration method cervellera et al 2006 drouin et al 1996 gal 1979 lee and lee 2006 although the previous researches about sdp have made great improvements there are two aspects the previous study does not pay enough attention on the one hand the transition probability matrix is usually based on observed or synthetic streamflow series in which the probability is replaced with the frequency consequently the precision of the transition probability matrix depends critically on the representativeness and size of the sample or the reliability of the synthetic streamflow series the transition probability matrix can be distorted in the case that the observation occurs by chance or the synthetic streamflow series cannot well characterize the original data on the other hand the value function in the last stage is ignored in most previous studies that is to say there is no difference in future value no matter where the ending water storage of the last period is this is obviously conflicting with the actual situation as we all know different carryover storages will bring different future benefits the copula function has been widely used in hydrology and water resources fields due to its ability to set up the joint distribution of multiple variables favre et al 2004 jenq tzong et al 2010 karmakar and simonovic 2009 singh and zhang 2006 reddy and ganguli 2012 tan et al 2017b in this study a new method based on copula function to calculate the transition probability matrix was proposed and the results were compared with the conventional statistical method meanwhile the value in the last stage was calculated from a simple recursive equation by stepwise iteration and the value function was fitted with a linear regression model these improvements were incorporated into the classic sdp and then applied to guide the hydropower operation of ertan reservoir china the next section introduces the proposed method a case study is presented in section 3 and the conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 development of recursive equation 2 1 1 objective function and constraints this study focuses on the reservoir whose main purpose is to maximize the total hydropower generation thus the objective function is as follows 1 f s t 1 q t max t 1 t e q t b t s t 1 q t s t δ t where f s t 1 q t is the maximum expected hydropower generation from period t to the entire planning horizon t in which t 1 2 t b t s t 1 q t s t is the hydropower output in period t in which s t 1 and s t are the beginning and ending storages and q t is the inflow e q t is the expectation operator and δ t is the decision interval the following constraints should be included in the model 1 water balance constraint 2 s t s t 1 q t r t δ t 2 water storage constraint 3 s t min s t s t max 3 flow constraint 4 r t min r t r

electric output in period t and the installed capacity kw h z t z dr t the ending and tail water levels of the reservoir in period t m f the function between reservoir water level and its water storage g the function between tail water level and its generation discharge 2 1 2 recursive equation considering the expected future value in the classical sdp the optimal reservoir decision can be derived by solving the following recursive equation tejada guibert et al 2010 8 f t h t max s t e q t h t b t s t 1 q t s t e q t h t e h t 1 q t h t f t 1 h t 1 where e q t h t is the conditional expectation operator for the inflow q t in period t for a specific state h t and e h t 1 q t h t is the conditional expectation operator for the state in the next stage which is depended on the state and decision in period t in this study the inflow and the beginning storage of period t q t and s t 1 are taken as the state variables and the ending storage of period t s t is taken as the decision variable therefore the recursive equation is defined as 9 f t s t 1 q t max s t b t s t 1 j q t s t j p t 1 j q t 1 q t f t 1 s t q t 1 where j is the inflow class index p t 1 j q t 1 q t is the conditional probability of q t 1 j based on q t in the last period the recursive equation is 10 f t s t 1 q t max s t b t s t 1 j q t s t j p t 1 j q t 1 q t f t 1 s t q t 1 in previous studies the value beyond period t hereafter referred to as future value function is often ignored and thus defaulting f t 1 s t q t 1 0 it means that there is no difference in future value no matter where the ending water storage of period t is this is obviously conflicting with the actual situation in fact different carryover storages will bring different future benefits in this study the expected future value is simplified as a function of the storage 11 j p t 1 j q t 1 q t f t 1 s t q t 1 e q t 1 f t 1 s t q t 1 g t 1 s t the long term inflow is a typical periodic markov process with a known period t accordingly the reservoir operation is a controlled markov process su and deininger 1972 have proved that the recursive calculation results in a constant difference between the values of adjacent cycles at the same period and state which is the optimal expected benefit of the cycle since the discrete state of the beginning storage in the first period is the same as that of the ending storage in the last period the following equation can be obtained 12 g 1 s 0 g t 1 s t c i 1 2 n where i is the storage discrete index n is the dispersion number and c is a constant which is the optimal expected benefit of the cycle based on the characteristics of the periodic markov process the expected future value function can be calculated by the following steps see fig 1 step 1 assuming that the decision ending storage in period t only depends on the beginning storage in period t and develop the following recursive equation 13 g t s t 1 max s t j p t j q t b t s t 1 j q t s t g t 1 s t step 2 disperse the beginning and ending storages in each period into n points between the upper and the lower limits of the water storage step 3 assuming that the expected future value in each storage state is 0 that is g t 1 s t i 0 i 1 2 n step 4 calculate recursively using eq 13 to obtain the value in each beginning state of period 1 thus obtaining the g 1 s 0 i i 1 2 n step 5 given the convergence criterion 14 g 1 s 0 i g t 1 s t i c i 1 2 n if the convergence criterion is met go to step 6 otherwise let g t 1 s t i g 1 s 0 i and return to step 4 step 6 calculate the minimal expected future value g t 1 min by eq 15 15 g t 1 min min i g t 1 s t i i 1 2 n step 7 update g t 1 s t i i 1 2 n by minus the g t 1 min step 8 fit the relationship between s t i and g t 1 s t i and obtain the value function g t 1 s t finally the recursive equation of the last period considering the expected future value is 16 f t s t 1 q t max s t b t s t 1 j q t s t g t 1 s t as the iteration number increases the expected future value will accumulate accordingly for sdp it is the difference between expected future values in different ending storage states rather than the values themselves that can have an effect on the operating results therefore the step 6 and step 7 are used to avoid too large expected future values without changing its role in stochastic optimal operation 2 2 transition probability matrix based on copula functions 2 2 1 conditional probability expression assuming that the marginal distribution of inflows q t and q t 1 are f q t and f q t 1 respectively according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 their joint distribution f q t q t 1 q t q t 1 is 17 f q t q t 1 q t q t 1 c u v c f q t f q t 1 18 u f q t 19 v f q t 1 given x 1 q t x 2 the conditional probability of q t 1 y 2

distributions of q t and q t 1 u i f x i and v i f y i i 1 2 given the inflow interval q t x 1 x 2 in the period t the condition probability of q t 1 y 1 y 2 can be calculated by using eq 21 21 p y 1 q t 1 y 2 x 1 q t x 2 p q t 1 y 2 x 1 q t x 2 p q t 1 y 1 x 1 q t x 2 2 2 2 joint distribution based on archimedean copulas the copula function c is a bivariate archimedean copula if it satisfies the following condition 22 c u v φ 1 φ u φ v u v 0 1 where φ is the generator function of the copula and φ 1 is its inverse function the φ is a continuously decreasing convex function whose φ 1 0 and φ 0 in this study three widely used archimedean copula functions are applied including gumbel hougaard hereafter referred to as gumbel clayton and frank copulas the explicit expression of these copula functions and their generator functions are listed in table 1 there is one dependence structure parameter in the archimedean copulas nelsen 2006 has shown that if x and y are the random variables with a archimedean copula c generated by φ t the population version of kendall s tau τ for x and y can be given by 23 τ 1 4 0 1 φ t φ t dt the relationship between the dependence structure parameter θ and kendall s τ of the three copulas can be derived from eq 23 see table 1 let x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 be independent and identically distributed random vectors each with joint distribution function c then the kendall s τ is defined as the probability of concordance minus that of discordance 24 τ τ x y p x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 0 p x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 0 the kendall s τ can be calculated using observation samples and then the copula parameter can be estimated by using its functional relationship with kendall s τ 2 2 3 selection of an appropriate copula three indexes are used to evaluate the appropriateness of the hypothesized copulas including cramer von mises statistic sn p value p and akaike information criterion aic cramer von mises statistic can be calculated by the following equation 25 s n i 1 n c n

following expression 27 aic n ln s n n 2 k the smaller the aic and sn values are and the higher the p value is the more strongly the assumed copula is accepted 3 case study 3 1 ertan reservoir ertan reservoir is a key project for sichuan power grid in china which is located in the lower reaches of the yalong river basin in sichuan province of southern china fig 2 the main purpose of ertan reservoir is to maximize the total power generation by rational utilization of the water resources in order to ensure the safety of the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river in flood season it is required to reserve 16 billion m3 flood control capacity in june and july the water level in these two months should be maintained lower than 1192 m the main characteristic parameters of ertan reservoir are listed in table 2 the 55 year observed inflows from 1958 to 2012 collected on ten days 1 in china a month is divided into three periods the first 10 day early the middle 10 day mid and the rest day late of the month taking may as an example the first 10 day of may is denoted by early may the middle 10 day of may is mid may and the last 10 day of may is late may 1 and monthly basis is used to calculate state transition matrix and simulate the operation of ertan reservoir during the low flow period from november to march the reservoir is mainly recharged by groundwater with low uncertainty while during the high flow period from april to october the reservoir is mainly recharged by rainfall with relatively higher uncertainty thus in this study each year is divided into 26 periods with each period corresponding to a month in the low flow period from november to march whereas to approximately 10 days in the high flow period from april to october 3 2 results and discussions 3 2 1 marginal distribution in china pearson type iii ptiii distribution is commonly used to characterize the distribution of hydrologic variables yun and singh 2008 in this study the ptiii distribution is assumed to fit the marginal distribution and then the kolmogorov smirnov ks test massey 1951 is used to evaluate the goodness of fit the k s statistic is defined as 28 d max max f x g x where f x and g x are the theoretical and empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs respectively given the significance level α the critical value of ks test d α can be obtained the assumption is valid only when d max d α the smaller the d max is the better the fit will be table 3 shows the parameters and goodness of fit statistics of the marginal distributions the parameters of ptiii distribution including x c v and c s are optimized by genetic algorithm ga whose objective is to minimize the sum of squares of deviations between the theoretical and empirical frequencies given α 0 05 the critical value d 0 05 0 1831 table 3 shows that d max d 0 05 for all periods indicating that the ptiii distributions are satisfactory 3 2 2 joint distribution the joint distribution of inflows in adjacent periods is established by the above three copula functions gumbel clayton and frank copulas the dependence structure parameter θ is estimated based on its functional relationship with kendall s tau see table 1 based on the three selection criteria the final copula function for each period is selected see table 4 goumbel copula can be selected for 11 periods clayton copula for 3 periods and frank copula for 12 periods respectively however it is noted that frank copula can also achieve satisfactory performance for the 3 periods selected clayton copula thus the clayton copula seems to be not as effective as the other two copulas in this study while the performance of goumbel copula is as good as that of clayton copula both of which have relatively low sn and aic values and high p value thus we can use either goumbel or frank copula for each period in this study we use the selected copula for each period 3 2 3 transition probability matrix the inflow in each period is divided into 11 classes according to the cdf thresholds 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 and the following three schemes are used to calculate the transition probability matrix scheme i conventional method based on measured streamflow series hereafter referred to as con mi scheme ii conventional method based on synthetic streamflow series hereafter referred to as con mii in which the synthetic streamflow series are generated and then the conventional method is used scheme iii copula function method based on measured streamflow series hereafter referred to as copula m in which the joint distribution of adjacent periods is established and then the conditional probability formula is derived to calculate the transition probability matrix in con mii to characterize the nonstationary properties and the periodic dependence structure of the seasonal hydrologic time series the periodic auto regression moving average parma models are used to generate the synthetic streamflow series the parma p q model can be expressed as salas 1993 29 y v τ i 1 p ϕ i τ y v τ i ε v τ j 1 q α j τ ε v τ j where y v τ represents the streamflow process for year v and season τ and it is normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ τ 2 y for each season τ the ε ν τ is the uncorrelated noise term which is also normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ τ 2 ε for each season τ ϕ 1 τ ϕ p τ are the periodic autoregressive parameters and α 1 τ α q τ are the periodic moving average parameters if the number of seasons or periods is ω then a parma p q model consists of ω numbers of individual arma p q models where the dependence is across seasons instead of years in this study the parma 1 1 model is used to simulate the inflow of ertan reservoir for 5000 years and the least squares ls method is used to estimate its parameters fig 3 shows the main parameters of the observed and synthetic streamflow series the inflow in dry season is relatively stable and thus the synthetic streamflow series can hold the statistical properties of the original series while the inflow in flood season has higher uncertainty resulting in a larger difference in the average standard deviation and variation coefficient between the two series especially from periods 6 to 23 on the whole the synthetic streamflow series can well characterize the statistical properties of the original series fig 4 shows the transition probability matrices obtained in dry january and november and wet late june and mid september periods by the three schemes respectively because the inflows in dry periods are mainly recharged by groundwater with lower uncertainty there is an significant autocorrelation of inflows between adjacent periods and thus the transition probabilities are centered on the one of the diagonal while the inflows in flood periods are mainly recharged by rainfall with relatively higher uncertainty the transition probabilities are distributed in a wider region for con mii and copula m schemes the transition probabilities are centered on the one of the diagonal and decrease along with the other diagonal due to the autocorrelation of inflows the transition probabilities for inflows of adjacent periods to fall into the same class are higher and the larger the inflow class differences between two adjacent periods the smaller the transition probabilities will be the advantage of con mi is that it does not relay on a specific parametric form of the joint distribution or a simulation model to generate the synthetic streamflow series however as its transition probability is calculated based on the assumption that the frequency is equal to the probability the representation errors cannot be avoided due to the limited number of observed samples on the one hand many values in its transition probability matrices are zeros some of which appear to be unreasonable for example when the inflow of middle september is in class 8 the inflow of late september just has two situations with a probability of 0 6 falling into class 7 and a probability of 0 4 falling into class 11 however due to the stochastic and fuzzy nature of hydrological phenomena the inflow of late september is also likely to fall into other classes especially class 8 10 maybe the inflows in these classes happened in the past but due to the limited age of the hydrological stations they were not recorded on the other hand the transition probability cannot be calculated when there is no observed inflow data in some classes fig 4 d whose transition probability is represented by 0 5 let p q t 1 q t i represent the conditional probability of q t 1 when q t is in class i if there is no data meeting q t i p q t 1 q t i cannot be calculated by the con mi scheme in this study p q 7 q 6 1 p q 15 q 14 1 p q 19 q 18 1 p q 21 q 20 6 and p q 23 q 22 8 cannot be calculated by generating the synthetic streamflow series or building the marginal distributions to interpolate and extrapolate the inflows con mii and copula m can avoid the representation errors of con mi the behavior of copula m and con mii looks similar both of them can avoid the representation errors of con mi on the one hand their transition probabilities are distributed more uniformly with less zero values meanwhile the situation that the transition probabilities are unable to be calculated does not happen however it should be noted that copula m has three advantages over con mii 1 calculation is much simpler than the conventional methods as it only needs to calculate the structure parameters of the joint distribution between adjacent periods then the explicit expression for calculating the transition probability can be obtained the structure parameter θ of the archimedean copulas can be estimated based on kendall s τ using some simple equations see table 1 then the transition probability matrices can be obtained easily using eqs 20 and 21 however for con mii after generating the synthetic streamflow series the transition probability is still calculated using the conventional method 2 generation of synthetic streamflow series can be avoided the use of ptiii distribution as the marginal distribution allows for the implicit interpolation and extrapolation of the inflows without depending on other synthetic streamflow generating models this is consistent with the inflow class division which also relies on the ptiii distribution thus the uncertainty resulting from the simulation model can be reduced in addition in the bsdp model we should consider uncertainties resulting from both natural streamflow and forecast it is very difficult to generate the synthetic natural and forecasted inflow series at the same time without changing the characteristics of the original ones due to the complicated correlation relationship between them the copula m can avoid the generation of synthetic streamflow series and thus it can be directly used in bsdp 3 data storage can be reduced obviously for con mii the transition probability matrices in each period need to be stored and thus the data storage grows exponentially with the number of the inflow class however for copula m only the parameters of marginal and joint distributions x c v c s and θ in each period need to be stored 3 2 4 future value function the beginning and ending storages in each period are dispersed into 20 points and then a sample set of s t 1 i g t 1 s t i i 1 2 20 is obtained by the stepwise iteration method introduced in section 2 1 2 through a simple linear fitting the final future value function is 30 g s t 1 0 0041 s t 1 9 7383 with the increase of the carryover storage the future value increases gradually see fig 5 it means that the more water is stored in the reservoir the more hydropower generation may win in the future due to the higher water head or more release as is shown in fig 5 when the reservoir is at dead water level with a carryover storage of 2400 million m3 the expected future value is 0 while when the reservoir is at normal water level with a carryover storage of 5793 million m3 it can generate more 14 1734 10 8 kw h hydropower however the more water stores in the reservoir the less water is released that may result in a decrease of hydropower generation in the current year the problem of how much water to withhold from immediately beneficial deliveries retaining that water in storage is known as hedging for water supply operating problem the operating benefit has a relatively simple relationship with water volume some analytical hedging rules considering the balance between beneficial release and carried over storage value have been derived draper and lund 2004 shiau 2011 you and cai 2008a b zhao et al 2010 however due to the coupling relation of water head and release the future value function is much complicated for hydropower generation operation in this study the expected future value function is obtained by a simple stepwise iteration method and used in sdp to balance the benefit between the current year and the future this function not only can be used in sdp but also in deterministic dynamic programming algorithm ddp for example in making an annual hydropower generation schedule the year end water level can be controlled dynamically using eq 30 according to the inflow of the year which is especially important for reservoirs with multi year regulation performance 3 2 5 operating policy based on the transition probability matrices obtained by the three schemes the operating policy can be obtained by backward recursion in this study the sdp based on the three schemes are referred to as sdp con mi sdp con mii and sdp copula m respectively for the transition probabilities that are unable to be calculated using con mi we assume that they occur in each class with the same probability just as the traditional treatment just for example fig 6 shows the operating policy in january dry season and late june flood season obtained by sdp copula m when the beginning storage of the reservoir and the class of the inflow are known the ending storage can be obtained using the operating policy it is found that the operating policy is more sensitive to inflow class division in flood season than that in dry season in this study we set the same number of inflow class division according to the frequency thresholds in fact the inflow can be dispersed with a larger step in dry season to avoid the curse of dimensionality but with a smaller step in flood season to provide a more detailed operating policy and reduce the effect of inflow uncertainty 3 2 6 simulation operation results the operating policies are used to guide the operation of inflows from 1959 to 2012 and the performance of the hydropower system is evaluated using two indicators including average annual hydropower generation aahg and average annual spillage aas table 5 con mii can overcome the representation errors of con mi by generating the synthetic streamflow series as a results the aahg of the whole year can be improved from 168 67 10 8 kw h to 168 94 10 8 kw h with an increase of 0 27 10 8 kw h copula m can solve the representation errors of con mi without depending on some other simulation models by building a continuous marginal distribution of inflows the hydropower generation of sdp copula m is increased by 0 34 10 8 and 0 07 10 8 kw h compared with that of sdp con mi and sdp con mii respectively and this increase is observed mainly in flood season fig 3 shows that the synthetic streamflow series can hardly hold the characteristics of the original series in flood season and thus the transition probability matrices obtained by con mii in flood season have relatively larger errors and the corresponding power generation of sdp is lower than that of copula m fig 7 shows the average storage process of the ertan reservoir guided by the three operating policies as the transition probability matrices of copula m and con mii are quite similar the storage processes of sdp copula m and sdp con mii are quite close in this study p q 7 q 6 1 p q 15 q 14 1 p q 19 q 18 1 p q 21 q 20 6 and p q 23 q 22 8 are assumed to occur in any inflow class with the same probability however this assumption may have an effect on the final operating decision the storage of sdp con mi is lower than that of sdp copula m and sdp con mii especially from periods 15 to 23 which can explain why the aas of the sdp con mi is lower than that of the other schemes see table 5 to further analyze the difference of operating results obtained by sdp copula m and sdp con mi fig 8 shows the ratio of the storage and output obtained by sdp copula m to that obtained by sdp con mi as we can see the storage of the sdp copula m is always higher than that of sdp con mi in flood season a higher storage results in a higher hydropower water head and thus the output of sdp copula m is higher in the most periods of the flood season except in periods 7 and 13 and the aas is relatively higher see table 5 in period 7 the reservoir storage declines see fig 7 the storage of sdp con mi falls sharply resulting in a higher release and output in this period however in the following periods 8 to 12 as the storage of sdp copula m is higher its output is higher than that of sdp con mi in period 13 the reservoir is impounding see fig 7 the sdp copula m can guide the reservoir to store water as soon as possible and thus the release and output are lower than that of sdp con mi in this period from periods 15 to 23 the reservoir storage of sdp copula m is obviously higher than that of sdp con mi in these periods the reservoir storage is high and the output is mainly controlled by the reservoir hydropower water head therefore the output of sdp copula m is always higher than that of sdp con mi in a short the sdp copula m can reduce the release speed in the decline stage while speed up to store water in the impounding stage making it possible for the reservoir to use the high hydropower water head to generate more hydropower similarly fig 9 shows the ratio of the ending storage and output obtained by sdp copula m to that obtained by sdp con mii the storage of sdp copula m is always higher than that of sdp con mii in flood season resulting in a relative higher aas see table 5 meanwhile the output of sdp copula m is higher than that of sdp con mii due to the higher hydropower water head except in periods 7 10 17 and 19 in these four periods the release is decreased to store more water for future use thus the ending storage ratio increases while the hydropower generation decreases 4 conclusions in this study we proposed a stochastic optimization operation model for hydropower generation reservoirs in which the copula function was used to calculate the transition probability matrices and a stepwise iterative method was used to calculate the expected future value function the transition probability matrices obtained by copula function method were compared with that obtained by the conventional method based on observed and synthetic streamflow series respectively then the transition probability matrices were incorporated into sdp to obtain the operating polices the following are the conclusions drawn from the present study 1 both the copula m and con mii can avoid the representative error of the con mi in calculating the transition probability meanwhile in some special case where the transition probability is unable to be calculated due to the lack of measured samples the assumption that the inflow occurs in any class with the same probability will reduce the operating benefit 2 compared with con mii there are three advantages of using copula m to calculate the transition probability the calculation process is much simpler the generation of synthetic streamflow series can be avoided and the data storage can be reduced obviously 3 sdp copula m can improve the hydropower generation of sdp con mii and sdp con mi especially in flood season this study is based on the assumption of perfect prediction of the runoff in the current period and thus the actual operating performance is closely related to the prediction ability considering the forecast error and the non stationarity of the future inflow the obtained operating policy may not be as effective as expected much work has been done about considering the forecast uncertainty into sdp karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 mujumdar and nirmala 2007 stedinger et al 1984 xu et al 2014 in this study we choose the simplest recursive equation and focus on a single reservoir to avoid too much complicated situations but it has proven that the copula m is effective to calculate the transition probability matric and can lead to a hydropower increase so it can be directly used in other more complicated situations acknowledgement this paper was jointly supported by national key research and development project

7492,stochastic dynamic programming sdp has been widely used to derive operating policies for reservoirs considering streamflow uncertainties in sdp there is a need to calculate the transition probability matrix more accurately and efficiently in order to improve the economic benefit of reservoir operation in this study we proposed a stochastic optimization model for hydropower generation reservoirs in which 1 the transition probability matrix was calculated based on copula functions and 2 the value function of the last period was calculated by stepwise iteration firstly the marginal distribution of stochastic inflow in each period was built and the joint distributions of adjacent periods were obtained using the three members of the archimedean copulas based on which the conditional probability formula was derived then the value in the last period was calculated by a simple recursive equation with the proposed stepwise iteration method and the value function was fitted with a linear regression model these improvements were incorporated into the classic sdp and applied to the case study in ertan reservoir china the results show that the transition probability matrix can be more easily and accurately obtained by the proposed copula function based method than conventional methods based on the observed or synthetic streamflow series and the reservoir operation benefit can also be increased keywords stochastic dynamic programming sdp copula function reservoir operation uncertainty value function 1 introduction the reservoir hydropower operation is generally formulated as a nonlinear stochastic optimization problem to guide the reservoir operation efficiently the reservoir operators usually predefine an operating policy in the design stage and use it in the real time operation according to the methods used to deal with stochastic inflow the operating policy can be obtained by 1 implicit stochastic optimization chandramouli and deka 2005 chandramouli and raman 2001 mehta and jain 2009 mousavi et al 2005 panigrahi and mujumdar 2000 willis et al 1984 young 1967 which can convert a stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one to operate the reservoir under several equally likely inflow scenarios and then extract the operating rules from the resulting set of optimal operating data 2 parameterization simulation optimization

curve based on some parameters and then use heuristic strategies to look for the combination of parameters that provide the best reservoir operating performance under possible inflow scenarios and 3 explicit stochastic optimization chou et al 2016 harboe 1993 which converts the inflow with different probabilities directly into the optimization problem stochastic dynamic programming sdp is one of the most popular explicit stochastic optimization methods celeste and billib 2009 previous studies on sdp have focused mainly on the inflow uncertainties and the curse of dimensionality the classical sdp model loucks et al 1981 does not take into account the forecast information in addressing the inflow uncertainties in reservoir operation given the significant effect of the forecast uncertainty on the reservoir operation it is explicitly incorporated into some reservoir operation models karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 mujumdar and nirmala 2007 stedinger et al 1984 xu et al 2014 kim and palmer 1997 karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 proposed a bayesian sdp bsdp model in which a bayesian approach was incorporated within the sdp formulation bsdp is different from the classical sdp in choosing state variables bayesian decision theory can easily incorporate new information by updating prior probabilities to posterior probabilities thus reducing the effect of natural and forecast uncertainties on the model kim and palmer 1997 proposed a bsdp model to investigate the value of seasonal inflow forecasts in hydropower generation based on which the monthly operating policies were derived for skagit hydropower system mujumdar and nirmala 2007 used the bsdp model to derive an operating policy for a multi reservoir hydropower generation system xu et al 2014 proposed a new two stage bsdp ts bsdp model for real time operation of cascaded hydropower systems to handle varying uncertainty of flow forecasts from quantitative precipitation forecasts in the last decades a number of aggregation disaggregation models have been proposed to solve the curse of dimensionality mujumdar and nirmala 2007 aggregated individual inflows of reservoirs in a cascaded hydropower system and used a bsdp model to represent the forecast uncertainty of the aggregate inflow tejada guibert et al 2010 and mujumdar and nirmala 2007 proposed sdp models in which only the inflows of individual reservoirs were aggregated and the storage of individual reservoirs and the aggregate flow were taken as state variables xu et al 2014 proposed a ts bsdp model with aggregate flow and storage of individual reservoirs as state variables to reduce the complexity of the optimal problem the curse of dimensionality can also be avoided by approximating the value function by the iteration method cervellera et al 2006 drouin et al 1996 gal 1979 lee and lee 2006 although the previous researches about sdp have made great improvements there are two aspects the previous study does not pay enough attention on the one hand the transition probability matrix is usually based on observed or synthetic streamflow series in which the probability is replaced with the frequency consequently the precision of the transition probability matrix depends critically on the representativeness and size of the sample or the reliability of the synthetic streamflow series the transition probability matrix can be distorted in the case that the observation occurs by chance or the synthetic streamflow series cannot well characterize the original data on the other hand the value function in the last stage is ignored in most previous studies that is to say there is no difference in future value no matter where the ending water storage of the last period is this is obviously conflicting with the actual situation as we all know different carryover storages will bring different future benefits the copula function has been widely used in hydrology and water resources fields due to its ability to set up the joint distribution of multiple variables favre et al 2004 jenq tzong et al 2010 karmakar and simonovic 2009 singh and zhang 2006 reddy and ganguli 2012 tan et al 2017b in this study a new method based on copula function to calculate the transition probability matrix was proposed and the results were compared with the conventional statistical method meanwhile the value in the last stage was calculated from a simple recursive equation by stepwise iteration and the value function was fitted with a linear regression model these improvements were incorporated into the classic sdp and then applied to guide the hydropower operation of ertan reservoir china the next section introduces the proposed method a case study is presented in section 3 and the conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 development of recursive equation 2 1 1 objective function and constraints this study focuses on the reservoir whose main purpose is to maximize the total hydropower generation thus the objective function is as follows 1 f s t 1 q t max t 1 t e q t b t s t 1 q t s t δ t where f s t 1 q t is the maximum expected hydropower generation from period t to the entire planning horizon t in which t 1 2 t b t s t 1 q t s t is the hydropower output in period t in which s t 1 and s t are the beginning and ending storages and q t is the inflow e q t is the expectation operator and δ t is the decision interval the following constraints should be included in the model 1 water balance constraint 2 s t s t 1 q t r t δ t 2 water storage constraint 3 s t min s t s t max 3 flow constraint 4 r t min r t r t max q t q max 4 hydropower output constraint 5 n t n max 5 relationship curves between reservoir water storage and its water level 6 z t f v t and v t f 1 z t 6 relationship curves between tail water level and its generation discharge 7 q t g z dr t and z dr t g 1 q t where r t the water release of the reservoir in period t m3 s r t max r t min the upper and lower limits of the reservoir release in period t m3 s s t max s t min the upper and lower limits of the reservoir storage in period t m3 q t q max the generation discharge and its upper limit in period t m3 s n t n max the electric output in period t and the installed capacity kw h z t z dr t the ending and tail water levels of the reservoir in period t m f the function between reservoir water level and its water storage g the function between tail water level and its generation discharge 2 1 2 recursive equation considering the expected future value in the classical sdp the optimal reservoir decision can be derived by solving the following recursive equation tejada guibert et al 2010 8 f t h t max s t e q t h t b t s t 1 q t s t e q t h t e h t 1 q t h t f t 1 h t 1 where e q t h t is the conditional expectation operator for the inflow q t in period t for a specific state h t and e h t 1 q t h t is the conditional expectation operator for the state in the next stage which is depended on the state and decision in period t in this study the inflow and the beginning storage of period t q t and s t 1 are taken as the state variables and the ending storage of period t s t is taken as the decision variable therefore the recursive equation is defined as 9 f t s t 1 q t max s t b t s t 1 j q t s t j p t 1 j q t 1 q t f t 1 s t q t 1 where j is the inflow class index p t 1 j q t 1 q t is the conditional probability of q t 1 j based on q t in the last period the recursive equation is 10 f t s t 1 q t max s t b t s t 1 j q t s t j p t 1 j q t 1 q t f t 1 s t q t 1 in previous studies the value beyond period t hereafter referred to as future value function is often ignored and thus defaulting f t 1 s t q t 1 0 it means that there is no difference in future value no matter where the ending water storage of period t is this is obviously conflicting with the actual situation in fact different carryover storages will bring different future benefits in this study the expected future value is simplified as a function of the storage 11 j p t 1 j q t 1 q t f t 1 s t q t 1 e q t 1 f t 1 s t q t 1 g t 1 s t the long term inflow is a typical periodic markov process with a known period t accordingly the reservoir operation is a controlled markov process su and deininger 1972 have proved that the recursive calculation results in a constant difference between the values of adjacent cycles at the same period and state which is the optimal expected benefit of the cycle since the discrete state of the beginning storage in the first period is the same as that of the ending storage in the last period the following equation can be obtained 12 g 1 s 0 g t 1 s t c i 1 2 n where i is the storage discrete index n is the dispersion number and c is a constant which is the optimal expected benefit of the cycle based on the characteristics of the periodic markov process the expected future value function can be calculated by the following steps see fig 1 step 1 assuming that the decision ending storage in period t only depends on the beginning storage in period t and develop the following recursive equation 13 g t s t 1 max s t j p t j q t b t s t 1 j q t s t g t 1 s t step 2 disperse the beginning and ending storages in each period into n points between the upper and the lower limits of the water storage step 3 assuming that the expected future value in each storage state is 0 that is g t 1 s t i 0 i 1 2 n step 4 calculate recursively using eq 13 to obtain the value in each beginning state of period 1 thus obtaining the g 1 s 0 i i 1 2 n step 5 given the convergence criterion 14 g 1 s 0 i g t 1 s t i c i 1 2 n if the convergence criterion is met go to step 6 otherwise let g t 1 s t i g 1 s 0 i and return to step 4 step 6 calculate the minimal expected future value g t 1 min by eq 15 15 g t 1 min min i g t 1 s t i i 1 2 n step 7 update g t 1 s t i i 1 2 n by minus the g t 1 min step 8 fit the relationship between s t i and g t 1 s t i and obtain the value function g t 1 s t finally the recursive equation of the last period considering the expected future value is 16 f t s t 1 q t max s t b t s t 1 j q t s t g t 1 s t as the iteration number increases the expected future value will accumulate accordingly for sdp it is the difference between expected future values in different ending storage states rather than the values themselves that can have an effect on the operating results therefore the step 6 and step 7 are used to avoid too large expected future values without changing its role in stochastic optimal operation 2 2 transition probability matrix based on copula functions 2 2 1 conditional probability expression assuming that the marginal distribution of inflows q t and q t 1 are f q t and f q t 1 respectively according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 their joint distribution f q t q t 1 q t q t 1 is 17 f q t q t 1 q t q t 1 c u v c f q t f q t 1 18 u f q t 19 v f q t 1 given x 1 q t x 2 the conditional probability of q t 1 y 2

distributions of q t and q t 1 u i f x i and v i f y i i 1 2 given the inflow interval q t x 1 x 2 in the period t the condition probability of q t 1 y 1 y 2 can be calculated by using eq 21 21 p y 1 q t 1 y 2 x 1 q t x 2 p q t 1 y 2 x 1 q t x 2 p q t 1 y 1 x 1 q t x 2 2 2 2 joint distribution based on archimedean copulas the copula function c is a bivariate archimedean copula if it satisfies the following condition 22 c u v φ 1 φ u φ v u v 0 1 where φ is the generator function of the copula and φ 1 is its inverse function the φ is a continuously decreasing convex function whose φ 1 0 and φ 0 in this study three widely used archimedean copula functions are applied including gumbel hougaard hereafter referred to as gumbel clayton and frank copulas the explicit expression of these copula functions and their generator functions are listed in table 1 there is one dependence structure parameter in the archimedean copulas nelsen 2006 has shown that if x and y are the random variables with a archimedean copula c generated by φ t the population version of kendall s tau τ for x and y can be given by 23 τ 1 4 0 1 φ t φ t dt the relationship between the dependence structure parameter θ and kendall s τ of the three copulas can be derived from eq 23 see table 1 let x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 be independent and identically distributed random vectors each with joint distribution function c then the kendall s τ is defined as the probability of concordance minus that of discordance 24 τ τ x y p x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 0 p x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 0 the kendall s τ can be calculated using observation samples and then the copula parameter can be estimated by using its functional relationship with kendall s τ 2 2 3 selection of an appropriate copula three indexes are used to evaluate the appropriateness of the hypothesized copulas including cramer von mises statistic sn p value p and akaike information criterion aic cramer von mises statistic can be calculated by the following equation 25 s n i 1 n c n u i n v i n c θ n u i n v i n 2 where n is the number of observation sample u i n v i n is the marginal distribution function value of the observation sample x i n y i n c n u i n v i n is the

following expression 27 aic n ln s n n 2 k the smaller the aic and sn values are and the higher the p value is the more strongly the assumed copula is accepted 3 case study 3 1 ertan reservoir ertan reservoir is a key project for sichuan power grid in china which is located in the lower reaches of the yalong river basin in sichuan province of southern china fig 2 the main purpose of ertan reservoir is to maximize the total power generation by rational utilization of the water resources in order to ensure the safety of the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river in flood season it is required to reserve 16 billion m3 flood control capacity in june and july the water level in these two months should be maintained lower than 1192 m the main characteristic parameters of ertan reservoir are listed in table 2 the 55 year observed inflows from 1958 to 2012 collected on ten days 1 in china a month is divided into three periods the first 10 day early the middle 10 day mid and the rest day late of the month taking may as an example the first 10 day of may is denoted by early may the middle 10 day of may is mid may and the last 10 day of may is late may 1 and monthly basis is used to calculate state transition matrix and simulate the operation of ertan reservoir during the low flow period from november to march the reservoir is mainly recharged by groundwater with low uncertainty while during the high flow period from april to october the reservoir is mainly recharged by rainfall with relatively higher uncertainty thus in this study each year is divided into 26 periods with each period corresponding to a month in the low flow period from november to march whereas to approximately 10 days in the high flow period from april to october 3 2 results and discussions 3 2 1 marginal distribution in china pearson type iii ptiii distribution is commonly used to characterize the distribution of hydrologic variables yun and singh 2008 in this study the ptiii distribution is assumed to fit the marginal distribution and then the kolmogorov smirnov ks test massey 1951 is used to evaluate the goodness of fit the k s statistic is defined as 28 d max max f x g x where f x and g x are the theoretical and empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs respectively given the significance level α the critical value of ks test d α can be obtained the assumption is valid only when d max d α the smaller the d max is the better the fit will be table 3 shows the parameters and goodness of fit statistics of the marginal distributions the parameters of ptiii distribution including x c v and c s are optimized by genetic algorithm ga whose objective is to minimize the sum of squares of deviations between the theoretical and empirical frequencies given α 0 05 the critical value d 0 05 0 1831 table 3 shows that d max d 0 05 for all periods indicating that the ptiii distributions are satisfactory 3 2 2 joint distribution the joint distribution of inflows in adjacent periods is established by the above three copula functions gumbel clayton and frank copulas the dependence structure parameter θ is estimated based on its functional relationship with kendall s tau see table 1 based on the three selection criteria the final copula function for each period is selected see table 4 goumbel copula can be selected for 11 periods clayton copula for 3 periods and frank copula for 12 periods respectively however it is noted that frank copula can also achieve satisfactory performance for the 3 periods selected clayton copula thus the clayton copula seems to be not as effective as the other two copulas in this study while the performance of goumbel copula is as good as that of clayton copula both of which have relatively low sn and aic values and high p value thus we can use either goumbel or frank copula for each period in this study we use the selected copula for each period 3 2 3 transition probability matrix the inflow in each period is divided into 11 classes according to the cdf thresholds 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 and the following three schemes are used to calculate the transition probability matrix scheme i conventional method based on measured streamflow series hereafter referred to as con mi scheme ii conventional method based on synthetic streamflow series hereafter referred to as con mii in which the synthetic streamflow series are generated and then the conventional method is used scheme iii copula function method based on measured streamflow series hereafter referred to as copula m in which the joint distribution of adjacent periods is established and then the conditional probability formula is derived to calculate the transition probability matrix in con mii to characterize the nonstationary properties and the periodic dependence structure of the seasonal hydrologic time series the periodic auto regression moving average parma models are used to generate the synthetic streamflow series the parma p q model can be expressed as salas 1993 29 y v τ i 1 p ϕ i τ y v τ i ε v τ j 1 q α j τ ε v τ j where y v τ represents the streamflow process for year v and season τ and it is normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ τ 2 y for each season τ the ε ν τ is the uncorrelated noise term which is also normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ τ 2 ε for each season τ ϕ 1 τ ϕ p τ are the periodic autoregressive parameters and α 1 τ α q τ are the periodic moving average parameters if the number of seasons or periods is ω then a parma p q model consists of ω numbers of individual arma p q models where the dependence is across seasons instead of years in this study the parma 1 1 model is used to simulate the inflow of ertan reservoir for 5000 years and the least squares ls method is used to estimate its parameters fig 3 shows the main parameters of the observed and synthetic streamflow series the inflow in dry season is relatively stable and thus the synthetic streamflow series can hold the statistical properties of the original series while the inflow in flood season has higher uncertainty resulting in a larger difference in the average standard deviation and variation coefficient between the two series especially from periods 6 to 23 on the whole the synthetic streamflow series can well characterize the statistical properties of the original series fig 4 shows the transition probability matrices obtained in dry january and november and wet late june and mid september periods by the three schemes respectively because the inflows in dry periods are mainly recharged by groundwater with lower uncertainty there is an significant autocorrelation of inflows between adjacent periods and thus the transition probabilities are centered on the one of the diagonal while the inflows in flood periods are mainly recharged by rainfall with relatively higher uncertainty the transition probabilities are distributed in a wider region for con mii and copula m schemes the transition probabilities are centered on the one of the diagonal and decrease along with the other diagonal due to the autocorrelation of inflows the transition probabilities for inflows of adjacent periods to fall into the same class are higher and the larger the inflow class differences between two adjacent periods the smaller the transition probabilities will be the advantage of con mi is that it does not relay on a specific parametric form of the joint distribution or a simulation model to generate the synthetic streamflow series however as its transition probability is calculated based on the assumption that the frequency is equal to the probability the representation errors cannot be avoided due to the limited number of observed samples on the one hand many values in its transition probability matrices are zeros some of which appear to be unreasonable for example when the inflow of middle september is in class 8 the inflow of late september just has two situations with a probability of 0 6 falling into class 7 and a probability of 0 4 falling into class 11 however due to the stochastic and fuzzy nature of hydrological phenomena the inflow of late september is also likely to fall into other classes especially class 8 10 maybe the inflows in these classes happened in the past but due to the limited age of the hydrological stations they were not recorded on the other hand the transition probability cannot be calculated when there is no observed inflow data in some classes fig 4 d whose transition probability is represented by 0 5 let p q t 1 q t i represent the conditional probability of q t 1 when q t is in class i if there is no data meeting q t i p q t 1 q t i cannot be calculated by the con mi scheme in this study p q 7 q 6 1 p q 15 q 14 1 p q 19 q 18 1 p q 21 q 20 6 and p q 23 q 22 8 cannot be calculated by generating the synthetic streamflow series or building the marginal distributions to interpolate and extrapolate the inflows con mii and copula m can avoid the representation errors of con mi the behavior of copula m and con mii looks similar both of them can avoid the representation errors of con mi on the one hand their transition probabilities are distributed more uniformly with less zero values meanwhile the situation that the transition probabilities are unable to be calculated does not happen however it should be noted that copula m has three advantages over con mii 1 calculation is much simpler than the conventional methods as it only needs to calculate the structure parameters of the joint distribution between adjacent periods then the explicit expression for calculating the transition probability can be obtained the structure parameter θ of the archimedean copulas can be estimated based on kendall s τ using some simple equations see table 1 then the transition probability matrices can be obtained easily using eqs 20 and 21 however for con mii after generating the synthetic streamflow series the transition probability is still calculated using the conventional method 2 generation of synthetic streamflow series can be avoided the use of ptiii distribution as the marginal distribution allows for the implicit interpolation and extrapolation of the inflows without depending on other synthetic streamflow generating models this is consistent with the inflow class division which also relies on the ptiii distribution thus the uncertainty resulting from the simulation model can be reduced in addition in the bsdp model we should consider uncertainties resulting from both natural streamflow and forecast it is very difficult to generate the synthetic natural and forecasted inflow series at the same time without changing the characteristics of the original ones due to the complicated correlation relationship between them the copula m can avoid the generation of synthetic streamflow series and thus it can be directly used in bsdp 3 data storage can be reduced obviously for con mii the transition probability matrices in each period need to be stored and thus the data storage grows exponentially with the number of the inflow class however for copula m only the parameters of marginal and joint distributions x c v c s and θ in each period need to be stored 3 2 4 future value function the beginning and ending storages in each period are dispersed into 20 points and then a sample set of s t 1 i g t 1 s t i i 1 2 20 is obtained by the stepwise iteration method introduced in section 2 1 2 through a simple linear fitting the final future value function is 30 g s t 1 0 0041 s t 1 9 7383 with the increase of the carryover storage the future value increases gradually see fig 5 it means that the more water is stored in the reservoir the more hydropower generation may win in the future due to the higher water head or more release as is shown in fig 5 when the reservoir is at dead water level with a carryover storage of 2400 million m3 the expected future value is 0 while when the reservoir is at normal water level with a carryover storage of 5793 million m3 it can generate more 14 1734 10 8 kw h hydropower however the more water stores in the reservoir the less water is released that may result in a decrease of hydropower generation in the current year the problem of how much water to withhold from immediately beneficial deliveries retaining that water in storage is known as hedging for water supply operating problem the operating benefit has a relatively simple relationship with water volume some analytical hedging rules considering the balance between beneficial release and carried over storage value have been derived draper and lund 2004 shiau 2011 you and cai 2008a b zhao et al 2010 however due to the coupling relation of water head and release the future value function is much complicated for hydropower generation operation in this study the expected future value function is obtained by a simple stepwise iteration method and used in sdp to balance the benefit between the current year and the future this function not only can be used in sdp but also in deterministic dynamic programming algorithm ddp for example in making an annual hydropower generation schedule the year end water level can be controlled dynamically using eq 30 according to the inflow of the year which is especially important for reservoirs with multi year regulation performance 3 2 5 operating policy based on the transition probability matrices obtained by the three schemes the operating policy can be obtained by backward recursion in this study the sdp based on the three schemes are referred to as sdp con mi sdp con mii and sdp copula m respectively for the transition probabilities that are unable to be calculated using con mi we assume that they occur in each class with the same probability just as the traditional treatment just for example fig 6 shows the operating policy in january dry season and late june flood season obtained by sdp copula m when the beginning storage of the reservoir and the class of the inflow are known the ending storage can be obtained using the operating policy it is found that the operating policy is more sensitive to inflow class division in flood season than that in dry season in this study we set the same number of inflow class division according to the frequency thresholds in fact the inflow can be dispersed with a larger step in dry season to avoid the curse of dimensionality but with a smaller step in flood season to provide a more detailed operating policy and reduce the effect of inflow uncertainty 3 2 6 simulation operation results the operating policies are used to guide the operation of inflows from 1959 to 2012 and the performance of the hydropower system is evaluated using two indicators including average annual hydropower generation aahg and average annual spillage aas table 5 con mii can overcome the representation errors of con mi by generating the synthetic streamflow series as a results the aahg of the whole year can be improved from 168 67 10 8 kw h to 168 94 10 8 kw h with an increase of 0 27 10 8 kw h copula m can solve the representation errors of con mi without depending on some other simulation models by building a continuous marginal distribution of inflows the hydropower generation of sdp copula m is increased by 0 34 10 8 and 0 07 10 8 kw h compared with that of sdp con mi and sdp con mii respectively and this increase is observed mainly in flood season fig 3 shows that the synthetic streamflow series can hardly hold the characteristics of the original series in flood season and thus the transition probability matrices obtained by con mii in flood season have relatively larger errors and the corresponding power generation of sdp is lower than that of copula m fig 7 shows the average storage process of the ertan reservoir guided by the three operating policies as the transition probability matrices of copula m and con mii are quite similar the storage processes of sdp copula m and sdp con mii are quite close in this study p q 7 q 6 1 p q 15 q 14 1 p q 19 q 18 1 p q 21 q 20 6 and p q 23 q 22 8 are assumed to occur in any inflow class with the same probability however this assumption may have an effect on the final operating decision the storage of sdp con mi is lower than that of sdp copula m and sdp con mii especially from periods 15 to 23 which can explain why the aas of the sdp con mi is lower than that of the other schemes see table 5 to further analyze the difference of operating results obtained by sdp copula m and sdp con mi fig 8 shows the ratio of the storage and output obtained by sdp copula m to that obtained by sdp con mi as we can see the storage of the sdp copula m is always higher than that of sdp con mi in flood season a higher storage results in a higher hydropower water head and thus the output of sdp copula m is higher in the most periods of the flood season except in periods 7 and 13 and the aas is relatively higher see table 5 in period 7 the reservoir storage declines see fig 7 the storage of sdp con mi falls sharply resulting in a higher release and output in this period however in the following periods 8 to 12 as the storage of sdp copula m is higher its output is higher than that of sdp con mi in period 13 the reservoir is impounding see fig 7 the sdp copula m can guide the reservoir to store water as soon as possible and thus the release and output are lower than that of sdp con mi in this period from periods 15 to 23 the reservoir storage of sdp copula m is obviously higher than that of sdp con mi in these periods the reservoir storage is high and the output is mainly controlled by the reservoir hydropower water head therefore the output of sdp copula m is always higher than that of sdp con mi in a short the sdp copula m can reduce the release speed in the decline stage while speed up to store water in the impounding stage making it possible for the reservoir to use the high hydropower water head to generate more hydropower similarly fig 9 shows the ratio of the ending storage and output obtained by sdp copula m to that obtained by sdp con mii the storage of sdp copula m is always higher than that of sdp con mii in flood season resulting in a relative higher aas see table 5 meanwhile the output of sdp copula m is higher than that of sdp con mii due to the higher hydropower water head except in periods 7 10 17 and 19 in these four periods the release is decreased to store more water for future use thus the ending storage ratio increases while the hydropower generation decreases 4 conclusions in this study we proposed a stochastic optimization operation model for hydropower generation reservoirs in which the copula function was used to calculate the transition probability matrices and a stepwise iterative method was used to calculate the expected future value function the transition probability matrices obtained by copula function method were compared with that obtained by the conventional method based on observed and synthetic streamflow series respectively then the transition probability matrices were incorporated into sdp to obtain the operating polices the following are the conclusions drawn from the present study 1 both the copula m and con mii can avoid the representative error of the con mi in calculating the transition probability meanwhile in some special case where the transition probability is unable to be calculated due to the lack of measured samples the assumption that the inflow occurs in any class with the same probability will reduce the operating benefit 2 compared with con mii there are three advantages of using copula m to calculate the transition probability the calculation process is much simpler the generation of synthetic streamflow series can be avoided and the data storage can be reduced obviously 3 sdp copula m can improve the hydropower generation of sdp con mii and sdp con mi especially in flood season this study is based on the assumption of perfect prediction of the runoff in the current period and thus the actual operating performance is closely related to the prediction ability considering the forecast error and the non stationarity of the future inflow the obtained operating policy may not be as effective as expected much work has been done about considering the forecast uncertainty into sdp karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 mujumdar and nirmala 2007 stedinger et al 1984 xu et al 2014 in this study we choose the simplest recursive equation and focus on a single reservoir to avoid too much complicated situations but it has proven that the copula m is effective to calculate the transition probability matric

7493,dissolution and precipitation of rock matrix are one of the most important processes of geological co2 sequestration in reservoirs they change connections of pore channels and properties of matrix such as bulk density microporosity and hydraulic conductivity this study builds on a recently developed multi layer model to account for dynamic changes of microporous matrix that can accurately predict variations in hydraulic properties and reaction rates due to dynamic changes in matrix porosity and pore connectivity we apply the model to simulate the dissolution and precipitation processes of rock matrix in heterogeneous porous media to quantify 1 the effect of the reaction rate on dissolution and matrix porosity 2 the effect of microporous matrix diffusion on the overall effective diffusion and 3 the effect of heterogeneity on hydraulic conductivity the results show the co2 storage influenced by factors including the matrix porosity change reaction front movement velocity and initial properties we also simulated dissolution induced permeability enhancement as well as effects of initial porosity heterogeneity the matrix with very low permeability which can be unresolved on x ray ct do contribute to flow patterns and dispersion the concentration of reactant h increases along the main fracture paths where the flow velocity increases the product ca shows the inversed distribution pattern against the h concentration this demonstrates the capability of this model to investigate the complex co2 reactive transport in real 3d heterogeneous porous media keywords co2 reactive transport heterogeneous microporosity microporous matrix 3d porous media 1 introduction geological sequestration of carbon dioxide co2 is one of the most promising approaches for mitigating the co2 contribution to global climate change however effective permeability of rock materials like carbonate rocks may vary by several orders of magnitude the risks associated with geological co2 sequestration requires a better understanding of co2 injection into geologic reservoirs and the subsequent interactions with groundwater resources benson and cole 2008 ipcc 2005 supercritical co2 and water are not merely injected into pore spaces between the matrix but may diffuse in microporous matrix that exhibit trapped retention of co2 complex physical and chemical processes at the micro and pore scale control the component adsorption desorption dissolution and precipitation gaus 2010 spycher et al 2003 jun et al 2013 the capacity of co2 permeability and storage through unsaturated matrix is affected by changes of matrix porosity due to dissolution precipitation and properties of reactive minerals the co2 storage in pore and matrix should include at least three main aspects of reactive transport processes 1 adsorption and desorption in the matrix 2 dynamic variation of pore space and matrix porosity and 3 diffusion and reaction front driven by the concentration gradients between pore and matrix therefore mechanism understanding of the interaction among water co2 matrix and average effective reaction rates is an essential prerequisite in order to quantify co2 transport and storage mathematical and numerical models at the pore scale can be a powerful tool to understand the relevant physical and chemical processes and transfer laboratory results to the field scale various numerical models have been developed for reactive transport of multi component flow in porous media these models can be classified into three areas 1 lattice boltzmann model liu et al 2015 wang et al 2005 gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2016a b 2 continuum scale reactive transport equation sahimi 1995 wang et al 2004 christakis et al 2006 li et al 2007 li 2011 ding et al 2013 and 3 pore network models kim et al 2011 raoof et al 2013 the continuum scale reactive transport equation is traditionally used for simulations of fluid flow and component transport based on the existence of a representative elemental volume rev on a volume average at spatial scales much larger than typical pore and mineral grain sizes therefore this approach may be inadequate to predict solute transport in the subsurface and reservoir because variations in solute concentration and mineral reaction rates at the pore scale do not necessarily imply that a rev does not exist lichtner and kang 2007 several studies ding et al 2013 levy and berkowitz 2003 have shown discrepancies between predictions using the continuum scale models and laboratory studies the pore network model is based on a topological representation of the pore network as wide pores connected by throats the mass and momentum in fluid pores are conserved by kirchoff s current law and the flow along each bond is assumed to be a one dimensional poiseuille flow prat 2002 in advanced network models navier stokes equation can be solved directly by coupling the pore network structure and non slip boundary condition raoof et al 2013 a main drawback is that the contribution of matrix to transport is totally neglected the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a numerical method based on kinetic theory to simulate fluid dynamics and reactive transports the macroscopic pressure velocity and concentration can be recovered from their distribution function the lbm has the advantage of addressing the multi component reactive flow in porous media and therefore lbm has been used for studying the co2 reactive transport in complex porous media kang et al 2010 kang et al 2014 tian et al 2014 tian et al 2016 it is the most common approach to separate components of the carbonate rock system into dual domains representing macropores and fractures and the rock matrix in both lbm and pore network models kim et al 2011 raoof et al 2013 kang et al 2010 kang et al 2014 based on their developed multi component reactive transport lbm model kang et al 2006 kang et al kang et al 2010 numerically investigated the macropore and permeability change due to dissolution of the matrix surface which was then applied in simulating the injection processes of co2 water in carbon capture and storage ccs while their models account for the change of pore volume due to the matrix surface dissolution kang et al 2014 the contribution of rock matrix to co2 storage has been neglected however in most natural fractured carbonate rock systems both the macropore and matrix systems affect co2 storage in the reservoir moreover both of them are dynamically changing due to dissolution and precipitation depending on the reaction rates and mineral properties during co2 sequestration such changes in pore volume and pore size distribution result in the change of permeability retention and dissolution rate in particular the heterogeneity of matrix properties such as porosity has not yet been considered in all the existing 3d models therefore the relationships proposed in those models seem to lack physical consistency resulting in potential uncertainties when predicting reactive transport through dissolved rock matrix to remedy the above shortcomings the lbm or pore network models need to resolve the changes of both pore morphology and its inner porosity of solid matrix with time which can involve scales much smaller than the lattice or pore size used in the simulations in this paper we will further develop the three dimensional model through coupling the dardis s porous lbm model dardis and mccloskey 1998a b for real porous media generated by x ray ct after describing the lbm we propose an approach for modelling heterogeneous matrix porosity and the change of matrix porosity by investigating how both the pore geometry and the porosity in matrix cells change with time the lbm considers the size and properties of the fracture and matrix materials to be varying in both time and space the following parts are organized as follows in section 2 the geochemical reaction model is developed incorporating species transport matrix dissolution dissolution induced porosity and permeability increase in section 3 the lbm flow and multi component models are extended to the 3d model in section 4 the reactive transport properties in the 3d homogeneous and real media are analyzed and discussed and conclusions are drawn in the final section 2 governing equations 2 1 incompressible flow in porous media incompressible flow in porous media is usually based on the darcy brinkman forchheimer equations guo and zhao 2002 1 u t 1 ε u u 1 ρ ε p ν e 2 u ε ν k u ε f ε k u u where k is the

refers to the brinkman term accounting for the presence of a solid boundary the third to the linear darcy term and the fourth terms to the nonlinear forchheimer term representing the drag forces the geometric function f ε is described by vafai 1984 and ergun 1952 2 f ε 1 75 150 ε 3 2 2 transport equations for species for the jth species the mass conservation equation describing transport and reaction can be written in the general form 3 y j t u y j d j 2 y j r j where yj is the jth species concentration dj the jth species diffusion coefficient and rj the rate at which the jth species is produced or consumed by chemical reactions 2 3 co2 reactive kinetics in reservoir when the supercritical co2 is injected into a reservoir it reacts with water brine on the surface of rocks to produce carbonic acid gaus et al 2008 yin et al 2012 4 co 2 h 2 o h 2 co 3 h hco 3 because carbonic acid is a weak acid the ph of the brine is decreased for the carbonate rock caco3 could be the main reactant mineral in the matrix with the carbonic acid thus as the carbonate matrix reacts with the acid brine the rock matrix dissolve gradually and pore connections and matrix porosity change over time the reactive kinetics of caco3 can be established with a co2 water reaction as 5 caco 3 h ca hco 3 the total reaction rate for co2 geological reactions can be described as chou et al 1989 plummer et al 1978 and pokrovsky et al 2005 2009 6 r k 1 α h k 2 α h 2 co 3 k 3 1 q k eq where k i are the reaction rate constants k eq the equilibrium constant and q the ion activity product iap that relates to the activities of ca and hco 3 q α ca α hco 3 α h and α h 2 co 3 are the activities of h and h 2 co 3 respectively the geochemical parameters k1 k2 and k3 are 8 9 10 5 5 0 10 8 and 6 5 10 11 mol cm 2

f i x c i δ t t where i is the opposite direction of i and n s x is a factor controlling the portion of bounce back in the matrix in geological reservoirs co2 will react inevitably with minerals in pores and matrix co2 cannot be treated as a simple surface reaction with minerals only resulting in dissolution of the matrix surfaces the process of dissolutions of matrix surfaces and the matrix itself should be resolved in the present model through a rule of the processes of co2 under deep reservoir conditions thus we develop a model of multi layer partial bound back processes unlike the existing bound back of fluid solid interface the present model is partial bound back from the matrix since the matrix is not a pure solid but a substance with small porosities fig 2 shows the role of n s x and the interface treatment of a portion of bounce back on the matrix surface and within the matrix n s x can be described as the function n s x 1 ε ψ where ε is the porosity of the matrix and ψ represents its mineral properties for different minerals ψ takes the different value from 0 to 1 in this paper ε 0 3 and ψ 0 5 for the mineral calcite it should be noted that the porosity here represents the local cell when ε 1 the node is full fluid pore therefore no particle is bounced back and n s x 0 on the other hand when ε 0 the node is full solid therefore the particle bounced back will be determined by the interface mineral properties and n s x ψ because the matrix porosity and mineral properties are varied at different locations the stream particles will be bounced back partially the partially bounce back can be illustrated in fig 2b the matrix nodes are marked in yellow e g x 1 and x 2 they have the bounced back function parameter n s x 1 and n s x 2 respectively when the distribution function f i streams to the matrix node x 1 the portion of 1 n s x 1 f i passes through the node x 1 and the residual portion n s x 1 f i will be bounced back for the next matrix node x 2 the less part of 1 n s x 2 1 n s x 1 f i reaches to the node x 2 and the rest part bounce back thus the portion of the particles which pass through matrix reduces step by step along the deep matrix nodes a semi empirical relationship between permeability k and n s can be derived as dardis and mccloskey 1998a 12 k ν 2 n s its physical meaning is that the permeability is inversely proportional to fraction of particle bound back the fluid density and the macro velocity are defined as 13 ρ i f i ρ u i c i f i thus eq 1 can be recovered through the chapman enskog multi scale expansion to eqs 7 13 3 2 multi component reactive transport 3 2 1 reactive model for transport species the lbm evolution equations for transport species distribution are expressed guo and zhao 2002 14 g y j i x c i δ t t δ t g y j i x t 1 τ j g y j i x t g y j i eq x t ω i r j δ t where g y j i is the i th distribution function for the j th species τ j the dimensionless relaxation time for the j

term and can be calculated as 16 r j c j r where r is the total reaction rate calculated by using eq 6 and c j the reaction coefficient for the j th species according to the eq 5 c j 1 0 for the reactant h and c j 1 0 for the products ca and hco 3 we define the j th species diffusion coefficient d j as 17 d j τ j 0 5 c s 2 δ t and the j th species concentration y j in terms of their distribution function 18 y j i g y j i 3 2 2 solid phase dissolution reaction all the species concentration in eq 3 can be recovered from the above except the solid phase caco 3 the reaction rate of caco 3 with porosity and permeability change can be expressed as yin et al 2012 19 y c t m c r where y c is the mass of calcium carbonate m c the caco 3 molecular weight and r the total reaction rate the volume of the matrix decreases and the porosity increases as the solid phase caco 3 dissolves the porosity can be calculated as 20 ε 1 0 1 0 ε 0 y c y c 0 where y c y c 0 is the mass ratio of the transient caco 3 to its initial one the local porosity at every node will be updated for the whole domain at every timestep the permeability change can be obtained from the porosity at each timestep by using kozeny carman equation as 21 k k 0 ε ε 0 3 1 0 ε 0 1 0 ε 2 the matrix porosity and pore connection change due to matrix dissolution will change the geometry of the porous media and flow variables therefore the geometry and porosity of the porous media will be updated at each timestep and couple processes of fluid and solute reaction transport solid porosity and permeability 4 results and discussion 3d cases are investigated numerically we verify darcy forchheimer d f drag in two specific cases against the published data jeong et al 2006 ergun 1952 and examine co2 reactive transport in simple homogeneous 3d porous media then the lbm of the reactive transport processes is used for simulation of dissolution induced changes in permeability and porosity in a 3d porous media generated by x ray ct 4 1 verification of 3d reactive transport model firstly 3d flows in a series of in line cubes and staggered spheres arrangements fig 3 were used for the validation of the proposed model two cases were selected to represent the cube case and the sphere one the porosity of the cubes case is 0 4523 and the sphere case is 0 4334 respectively it is well known that their permeability and drag in these porous media are calculated by using ergun correlation ergun 1952 22 d 2 k f re d 150 1 ε 2 ε 3 1 75 1 ε ε 3 re d where the left terms of eq 22 are referred to as darcy forchheimer drag a comparison between our results and eq 22 are shown in fig 3c in both cases our results are in good overall agreement with ergun correlation over a wide range of reynolds number some slight discrepancies can be found with high red this may be because the surfaces of the simulated cube in the sphere in porous media were not smooth these comparison results show the flow simulation capacity in complex media for the second test case we investigate the 3d reactive transport properties the computational grids for the 3d homogeneous case are 41 41 41 the co2 with water is injected from the left inlet x 0 to the right outlet x 1 0 the initial concentration of h at the inlet is set as 1 0 10 4 mol l while those of ca and hco3 are both 0 0 all concentration thereafter is normalized by the initial h concentration the ph can be obtained by using the relationship formula ph log h in fig 4 the reaction rate and porosity distributions at different timesteps are plotted and compared it can be seen that the maximum dimensionless reaction rate is 0 188 with the highest concentration of h at the inlet when the initial porosity is 0 3 fig 4a then the reaction rate decreases as the reaction front moves to the downstream fig 4b at 1 106 timesteps the reaction front is at x 0 125 the peak reaction rate is of 0 115 which is 61 1 of its highest value 0 188 the porosity at the inlet surface increases over time and reaches 0 72 at 3 105 timesteps fig 4c with the further reaction the calcite at the inlet is totally dissolved at 5 105 timesteps and its porosity increases to 1 0 as the reaction front moves forward the volume with a porosity of 1 0 increases fig 4d the effects of different initial porosity are also examined when ε0 0 1 and 0 5 fig 5 the reaction rate for ε0 0 5 is much higher than that when ε0 0 1 and 0 3 at 1 105 timesteps at 3 6 105 timesteps the matrix at the inlet has been totally dissolved and the reaction front moves downstream when ε0 0 5 it can also be found that the reaction rate at centerline increases as the initial matrix porosity increases the centerline is defined as along the x direction at y 0 5 and z 0 5 in particular their reaction fronts are significantly influenced by the initial matrix porosity for example its reaction front for ε0 0 5 is at about x 0 25 at 5 105 timesteps in fig 5b while the reaction rates remain similar for the initial porosity of 0 1 and 0 3 fig 5c shows that the matrix at inlet are dissolved in all cases at 7 105 timesteps their reaction fronts with the porosity of 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 are at x 0 025 0 075 and 0 75 respectively however the maximum reaction rate seems complicated for the porosity of 0 5 the maximum reaction rate is the highest while it is lowest for the porosity of 0 3 this can be explained that the reaction is controlled by the kinetics of a higher or smaller porosity but the reaction by transport for the middle porosity therefore there is a porosity threshold to enhance the reactive transport after serial numerical experiments we find the threshold porosity is approximately 0 43 under the present conditions 4 2 3d study in real porous media 4 2 1 sample of porous media for many natural carbonate rocks there always exists very low permeable matrix that cannot be resolved by current x ray ct fig 6 a shows a real porous media sample acquired from x ray ct with the total voxels 256 256 256 the density values of its voxels are represented as a grayscale profile of an image from x ray ct fig 6b because voxels of porous sample by x ray ct scans are usually used for the computational grid a pore voxel is active and a matrix voxel is a non active solid thus it is common that a voxel is defined as either a pore or a solid once a threshold is selected sahimi 1995 prat 2002 fig 6a shows a structure of the porous media at its threshold of 123 a voxel is defined as a pore fracture when the grayscale value is higher than 123 using the grayscale threshold we can extract large pores from 3d x ray ct data and pore connectivity among heterogeneous macro pore structures throughout the strongly anisotropic rock samples however the real matrix porosity may vary from 0 02 to 0 5 as shown in its grayscale profile fig 6b except for solid voxels the porosity for many matrix cells is not confined to pore or solid microporous matrix therefore these matrix cells can also contribute to flow and diffusion as well as adsorption and desorption since their grayscale may vary in space the porosity at every voxel can be determined by their grayscale thus the matrix porosity at each voxel will vary over the domain and their spatial heterogeneity can be resolved directly through their grayscale the moderate and low grayscale regions can be assigned correspondingly with moderate and high microporous matrix without loss of the generality of this model we can assume its initial matrix porosity of 0 1 0 3 for a given carbonate rock with the total voxels of 81 81 81 the matrix porosity can be related to their voxel grayscale as table 1 the microporous matrix heterogeneity is shown on fig 6c we define the porosity of the whole domain as the total porosity to distinguish the local matrix porosity 4 2 2 porosity change with reaction rate fig 7 a shows the porosity distribution change at 5 105 timesteps in our 3d cases one timestep represents 0 6 s in real time therefore 1 105 timesteps is 16 67 h approximately its sliced surfaces at y 0 5 and z 0 5 are shown in fig 7b the main porosity change occurs near the entrance region it can be found that porosity changes along the fracture edges till outlet fig 7b due to the higher transport ability of species in fractures this can be explained that the co2 concentration at the inlet is the highest and decreases along the fractures its corresponding reaction rate distribution is shown in fig 7c and d the regions of porosity increase matched well with its reaction rate distribution 4 2 3 species transport properties h concentration distribution has also been compared at different timesteps at the starting stage h moves mainly along the fractures the h concentration is still almost zero in the downstream matrix region at 5 104 timestep fig 8 a and b with further reactive transport process the h spreads over the whole domain and reaches the minimum h concentration of about 0 32 at 5 105 timesteps however it should be noted that the main h transport paths are along the fractures according to its higher concentration the centerline h concentration is also plotted at different timesteps in fig 8c the h concentration gradually increases till 1 105 timesteps after that its concentration remains almost stable there are two concentration peaks at around x 0 2 and 0 8 because these are at the fracture areas before these two peak areas the concentration decreases due to the matrix and form the valley areas at x 0 1 and 0 5 this shows that the reaction is controlled by transport along the fractures ca concentration increases over time due to the reaction fig 9 at 5 104 timesteps the ca ion mostly concentrates in the upstream region its concentration peaks appear in the region x 0 4 the ca ion increases at the downstream and the concentration peaks appear fig 9c shows profiles of centerline ca concentration at different timesteps it can be found that two ca concentration peaks occur in the upstream region before 2 104 timesteps while the ca concentration is very low in the downstream region fig 9c then the downstream ca concentration increases gradually as the reaction continues at 5 104 timesteps the peaks of the ca concentration distribution move to the downstream after 1 105 timesteps the ca concentration becomes almost stable this means the reaction has already reached equilibrium fig 9d shows the maximum ca concentration changes over time as the reaction continues the maximum concentration increases quickly until 5 104 timesteps then increases very little until becoming stable after 1 105 timesteps in fig 10 we compare the h and ca concentration with the porosity distribution at the centerline the two peaks of h concentration appear in the fracture areas while its corresponding ca concentration is at the valley value it can be seen that there are there are two valleys of h concentration in the matrix area before the two fracture areas this can be explained in that the production of h are in the inversed tendency to that of ca as a result they have inversed profiles 4 2 4 effects of velocities in fractures 2d sliced x y planes of porosity and reaction rate with velocity vectors are plotted in fig 11 at z 0 4625 at 5 105 timesteps it can be seen that the velocity is much higher in the fracture region than in the matrix the reaction mainly occurs at the surface of matrix at the inlet area the reaction rate decreases along the main fracture paths in the downstream matrix because the co2 concentration decreases in the downstream matrix x 0 75 1 0 y 0 5 0 8 the velocity vectors are still relatively high resulting in high reaction rates because they locate at the intersection of the two fracture paths with high h concentration due to three dimensional effects in this irregular matrix array the velocity increases and some reaction can occur in the backwind areas of the matrix at the region x 0 55 0 6 and y 0 6 0 8 the velocity decreases at x 0 0 35 and y 0 0 5 because the fracture becomes wider due to dissolution of matrix in fig 11 a for a nozzle fracture the velocity usually increases during the throat and then decreases the region x 0 7 1 0 and y 0 75 0 85 in fig 11 a however the velocity decreases in the throat of a nozzle fracture at x 0 3 0 6 and y 0 4 0 6 this is because of the three dimensional effects table 2 shows the effect of three dimensional velocity components the u v and w velocity represent the velocity components along the x y and z direction respectively the u velocity decreases and then increases and the v velocity keeps almost at the same magnitude while the w velocity not shown in the 2d sliced plane changes the most from the negative to the positive the three dimensional effects change the usual velocity distribution in this throat region in fig 12 we compared the porosity and reaction rate distribution at two different positions y 0 5 and y 0 75 this high reaction rate can also be observed in fig 12b the second matrix region generally the matrix porosity increase matched well with the reaction rate distribution the higher the reaction rate the more the matrix porosity increase for y 0 5 fig 12a the inlet region is at the matrix and the inlet reaction rate is the highest the maximum matrix porosity is 0 475 at inlet after which the reaction rate drops down in the matrix in the second matrix region x 0 25 0 5 approximately the reaction rate is only about 16 24 of the maximum value at the inlet while at y 0 75 fig 12b the inlet region is fracture and the reaction rate starts at about x 0 15 where the first matrix is located the second matrix region with reaction is x 0 8 0 95 approximately the highest reaction rate along y 0 75 is only about 70 of that in the case of y 0 5 this is because the downstream h concentration is lower than that at the inlet and the maximum matrix porosity is 0 413 at x 0 15 fig 13 shows the centerline u velocity at 5 105 timesteps and before reaction different velocity increases can be found along the centerline their corresponding velocity values and increasing rates are given in table 3 the increasing rate varies at different positions and the maximum is over 30 this is because the fracture structure changes as matrix dissolves furthermore the velocity increase means the permeability is enhanced we compare the flow flux through the whole outlet cross section and found a 24 permeability enhancement after 5 105 timesteps fig 14 shows the concentration distribution of h in 2d slice with velocity vectors it can be seen that the h transports along the two fractures where the velocity is also higher than that in matrix therefore the regions of high h concentration and high velocity almost coincide in fig 15 a the two peak areas of the u velocity and h concentration along the centerline y 0 5 matches well with each other in the fracture region similarly along y 0 75 the main valley areas of the u velocity and h concentration are matched in the matrix region fig 15b and the second valley area at about x 0 8 0 9 is not very distinct because it locates along the upper edge of the matrix fig 16 shows the concentration contour of the ca it can be seen that there are low ca concentration along the fracture paths which is the inversed pattern with that of the h in fig 17 we can also find the inversed distribution between the ca concentration and u velocity along y 0 5 and y 0 75 respectively generally the h concentration is high along the main fracture paths and u velocity is high while the ca concentration is low 4 2 5 effects of heterogeneous matrix porosity the influences of heterogeneous matrix porosity are also investigated natural rock usually has heterogeneous porosity distribution therefore we investigated the heterogeneous porous media with a variation of porosity from 0 1 to 0 3 ε0 1 0 for pore fracture according to the matrix grayscales fig 6c centerline reaction rate distribution is compared with that of the homogeneous porosity 0 3 in fig 18 a it can be seen that the reaction rate in the heterogeneous porosity is lower than that in the homogeneous one this can be explained that the average heterogeneous porosity is lower than the homogeneous one while after x 0 5 their difference is not so distinct because the reaction rate primarily stays at 0 0 where it locates a fracture this may be explained that the reactants have not diffused to the matrix region fig 18b shows a comparison of centerline porosity in the upstream matrix areas the heterogeneous matrix porosity is obviously smaller than the homogeneous one while the porosity distribution is almost identical in downstream region coinciding with the distribution pattern of the reaction rate the porosity changes at different positions are compared in table 4 three positions are at the edges of matrix x 0 15 0 2125 and 0 525 with the same initial porosity 0 3 in the homogeneous case and the other two are in the middle of matrix x 0 and 0 4 with the different initial porosity 0 15 and 0 14 the increasing rate of porosity decreases as x increases in both cases at the matrix edge the rate of increase in heterogeneous case is lower than that in homogeneous case while in the middle of matrix it is inversed because of the lower initial porosity the heterogeneity of the matrix porosity does affect the reaction rates since the heterogeneous matrix porosity is different from the homogeneous one for the h concentration distribution they keep a similar trend in both cases fig 18c while it is lower in most regions than that in the heterogeneous case the h concentration stays almost the same only at around x 0 75 where the two main path fractures are confluent before the matrix 4 3 discussion geological co2 sequestration processes involve different trapping mechanisms according to the reservoir conditions three main trapping processes of co2 storage are 1 physical 2 chemical and 3 biological the physical storage is hydrodynamic as a free phase i e gas liquid or supercritical co2 in structural or stratigraphic traps such as solubility the chemical storage consists of reaction dissolution precipitation adsorption and desorption of co2 as aqueous carbonated and mineral phases in formation water all of these storages depend on permeability and reaction rates therefore permeability and reaction rates appear as two of the most important parameters as they ensure a permanent and secure sequestration of co2 the heterogeneous microporosity of carbonate rocks occurs in natural reservoirs lin et al 2016 cantrel and hagerty 1999 it affect the fluid flow properties such as permeability and saturation water signature therefore the permeability and reaction rates are heterogeneous in space and time they are the most noticeable feature in carbonate reservoirs they greatly control fluid flow solute transport and mineralization while its lack of representation in traditional hydrogeological models cause much uncertainty in model predictions in lieu of their heterogeneities the present models adopt an effective multi layer partial bound back approach to account for the heterogeneity of unresolved matrix porosity for the simulation of the bulk flow and component transport behaviors and reactions to address the important heterogeneity problems 5 conclusions we have developed an lbm to build a multi domain varying permeability model that can accurately predict variations in heterogeneous matrix porosity and hydraulic connectivity due to dynamic dissolution and precipitation our lbm model for co2 reactive transport has been coupled with 3d porous morphology generated by ct scan we also explicitly treat the fracture matrix interaction using our multi layer partial bounce back model within the microporous matrix to resolve dynamic processes of matrix porosity and permeability changes microporous heterogeneity and unsaturated reaction front our coupled model was verified against analytical solutions of the permeability in 3d homogeneous media the results show the co2 storage influenced by factors including the matrix porosity change reaction front movement velocity and initial properties there is a porosity threshold of about 0 43 which enhances the reactive transport the reaction rate distribution and porosity increase show the similar pattern the porosity increases in the area with a higher reaction rate a higher porosity increases near the entrance region along the fracture paths the higher concentration areas of reactant h are found along the fracture paths with higher u velocity profiles the product ca shows the inverse distribution pattern with that of the h furthermore there are the dissolution induced porosity and permeability changes in the real 3d porous media after 5 105 timesteps reaction about 24 permeability enhancement can be obtained by calculating the outlet flow flux in particular it is found that the microporosity in the matrix that cannot be resolved by x ray ct does contribute to the dissolution and co2 storage given the abundance of brine reservoirs for ccs these results imply that co2 injection induced dissolution can have an important impact on porosity and permeability as well as consequences on geological co2 sequestration including determining residual saturation flow patterns and reaction fronts this represents a successful attempt to simulate how the porosity changes cause dynamic variations in the hydraulic properties of matrices and that the solid matrix does contribute to reactive transport as such this model can be used as a tool to simulate the co2 reactive transport

7493,dissolution and precipitation of rock matrix are one of the most important processes of geological co2 sequestration in reservoirs they change connections of pore channels and properties of matrix such as bulk density microporosity and hydraulic conductivity this study builds on a recently developed multi layer model to account for dynamic changes of microporous matrix that can accurately predict variations in hydraulic properties and reaction rates due to dynamic changes in matrix porosity and pore connectivity we apply the model to simulate the dissolution and precipitation processes of rock matrix in heterogeneous porous media to quantify 1 the effect of the reaction rate on dissolution and matrix porosity 2 the effect of microporous matrix diffusion on the overall effective diffusion and 3 the effect of heterogeneity on hydraulic conductivity the results show the co2 storage influenced by factors including the matrix porosity change reaction front movement velocity and initial properties we also simulated dissolution induced permeability enhancement as well as effects of initial porosity heterogeneity the matrix with very low permeability which can be unresolved on x ray ct do contribute to flow patterns and dispersion the concentration of reactant h increases along the main fracture paths where the flow velocity increases the product ca shows the inversed distribution pattern against the h concentration this demonstrates the capability of this model to investigate the complex co2 reactive transport in real 3d heterogeneous porous media keywords co2 reactive transport heterogeneous microporosity microporous matrix 3d porous media 1 introduction geological sequestration of carbon dioxide co2 is one of the most promising approaches for mitigating the co2 contribution to global climate change however effective permeability of rock materials like carbonate rocks may vary by several orders of magnitude the risks associated with geological co2 sequestration requires a better understanding of co2 injection into geologic reservoirs and the subsequent interactions with groundwater resources benson and cole 2008 ipcc 2005 supercritical co2 and water are not merely injected into pore spaces between the matrix but may diffuse in microporous matrix that exhibit trapped retention of co2 complex physical and chemical processes at the micro and pore scale control the component adsorption desorption dissolution and precipitation gaus 2010 spycher et al 2003 jun et al 2013 the capacity of co2 permeability and storage through unsaturated matrix is affected by changes of matrix porosity due to dissolution precipitation and properties of reactive minerals the co2 storage in pore and matrix should include at least three main aspects of reactive transport processes 1 adsorption and desorption in the matrix 2 dynamic variation of pore space and matrix porosity and 3 diffusion and reaction front driven by the concentration gradients between pore and matrix therefore mechanism understanding of the interaction among water co2 matrix and average effective reaction rates is an essential prerequisite in order to quantify co2 transport and storage mathematical and numerical models at the pore scale can be a powerful tool to understand the relevant physical and chemical processes and transfer laboratory results to the field scale various numerical models have been developed for reactive transport of multi component flow in porous media these models can be classified into three areas 1 lattice boltzmann model liu et al 2015 wang et al 2005 gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2016a b 2 continuum scale reactive transport equation sahimi 1995 wang et al 2004 christakis et al 2006 li et al 2007 li 2011 ding et al 2013 and 3 pore network models kim et al 2011 raoof et al 2013 the continuum scale reactive transport equation is traditionally used for simulations of fluid flow and component transport based on the existence of a representative elemental volume rev on a volume average at spatial scales much larger than typical pore and mineral grain sizes therefore this approach may be inadequate to predict solute transport in the subsurface and reservoir because variations in solute concentration and mineral reaction rates at the pore scale do not necessarily imply that a rev does not exist lichtner and kang 2007 several studies ding et al 2013 levy and berkowitz 2003 have shown discrepancies between predictions using the continuum scale models and laboratory studies the pore network model is based on a topological representation of the pore network as wide pores connected by throats the mass and momentum in fluid pores are conserved by kirchoff s current law and the flow along each bond is assumed to be a one dimensional poiseuille flow prat 2002 in advanced network models navier stokes equation can be solved directly by coupling the pore network structure and non slip boundary condition raoof et al 2013 a main drawback is that the contribution of matrix to transport is totally neglected the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a numerical method based on kinetic theory to simulate fluid dynamics and reactive transports the macroscopic pressure velocity and concentration can be recovered from their distribution function the lbm has the advantage of addressing the multi component reactive flow in porous media and therefore lbm has been used for studying the co2 reactive transport in complex porous media kang et al 2010 kang et al 2014 tian et al 2014 tian et al 2016 it is the most common approach to separate components of the carbonate rock system into dual domains representing macropores and fractures and the rock matrix in both lbm and pore network models kim et al 2011 raoof et al 2013 kang et al 2010 kang et al 2014 based on their developed multi component reactive transport lbm model kang et al 2006 kang et al kang et al 2010 numerically investigated the macropore and permeability change due to dissolution of the matrix surface which was then applied in simulating the injection processes of co2 water in carbon capture and storage ccs while their models account for the change of pore volume due to the matrix surface dissolution kang et al 2014 the contribution of rock matrix to co2 storage has been neglected however in most natural fractured carbonate rock systems both the macropore and matrix systems affect co2 storage in the reservoir moreover both of them are dynamically changing due to dissolution and precipitation depending on the reaction rates and mineral properties during co2 sequestration such changes in pore volume and pore size distribution result in the change of permeability retention and dissolution rate in particular the heterogeneity of matrix properties such as porosity has not yet been considered in all the existing 3d models therefore the relationships proposed in those models seem to lack physical consistency resulting in potential uncertainties when predicting reactive transport through dissolved rock matrix to remedy the above shortcomings the lbm or pore network models need to resolve the changes of both pore morphology and its inner porosity of solid matrix with time which can involve scales much smaller than the lattice or pore size used in the simulations in this paper we will further develop the three dimensional model through coupling the dardis s porous lbm model dardis and mccloskey 1998a b for real porous media generated by x ray ct after describing the lbm we propose an approach for modelling heterogeneous matrix porosity and the change of matrix porosity by investigating how both the pore geometry and the porosity in matrix cells change with time the lbm considers the size and properties of the fracture and matrix materials to be varying in both time and space the following parts are organized as follows in section 2 the geochemical reaction model is developed incorporating species transport matrix dissolution dissolution induced porosity and permeability increase in section 3 the lbm flow and multi component models are extended to the 3d model in section 4 the reactive transport properties in the 3d homogeneous and real media are analyzed and discussed and conclusions are drawn in the final section 2 governing equations 2 1 incompressible flow in porous media incompressible flow in porous media is usually based on the darcy brinkman forchheimer equations guo and zhao 2002 1 u t 1 ε u u 1 ρ ε p ν e 2 u ε ν k u ε f ε k u u where k is the permeability t the time ε the porosity p the pressure ρ the density and u the velocity ν e and ν are the effective viscosity and the kinematic viscosity respectively the second term on the right side refers to the brinkman term accounting for the presence of a solid boundary the third to the linear darcy term and the fourth terms to the nonlinear forchheimer term representing the drag forces the geometric function f ε is described by vafai 1984 and ergun 1952 2 f ε 1 75 150 ε 3 2 2 transport equations for species for the jth species the mass conservation equation describing transport and reaction can be written in the general form 3 y j t u y j d j 2 y j r j where yj is the jth species concentration dj the jth species diffusion coefficient and rj the rate at which the jth species is produced or consumed by chemical reactions 2 3 co2 reactive kinetics in reservoir when the supercritical co2 is injected into a reservoir it reacts with water brine on the surface of rocks to produce carbonic acid gaus et al 2008 yin et al 2012 4 co 2 h 2 o h 2 co 3 h hco 3 because carbonic acid is a weak acid the ph of the brine is decreased for the carbonate rock caco3 could be the main reactant mineral in the matrix with the carbonic acid thus as the carbonate matrix reacts with the acid brine the rock matrix dissolve gradually and pore connections and matrix porosity change over time the reactive kinetics of caco3 can be established with a co2 water reaction as 5 caco 3 h ca hco 3 the total reaction rate for co2 geological reactions can be described as chou et al 1989 plummer et al 1978 and pokrovsky et al 2005 2009 6 r k 1 α h k 2 α h 2 co 3 k 3 1 q k eq where k i are the reaction rate constants k eq the equilibrium constant and q the ion activity product iap that relates to the activities of ca and hco 3 q α ca α hco 3 α h and α h 2 co 3 are the activities of h and h 2 co 3 respectively the geochemical parameters k1 k2 and k3 are 8 9 10 5 5 0 10 8 and 6 5 10 11 mol cm 2 s respectively and k eq 3 47 10 9 determined from the typical experimental data in chou et al 1989 and plummer et al 1978 3 lattice boltzmann model 3 1 3d fluid flow a generalized lbm for incompressible fluid flow in porous media was proposed by guo et al for a constant or variable porosity of a medium guo and zhao 2002 7 f i x t δ t f i x c i δ t t 1 τ f i x c i δ t t f i eq x c i δ t

eq 7 δ f i pm x t is the force term used to represent the effect of the force and porous media and was given in terms of its solid density by dardis and mccloskey 1998a b 11 δ f i pm x t n s x f i x t f i x c i δ t t where i is the opposite direction of i and n s x is a factor controlling the portion of bounce back in the matrix in geological reservoirs co2 will react inevitably with minerals in pores and matrix co2 cannot be treated as a simple surface reaction with minerals only resulting in dissolution of the matrix surfaces the process of dissolutions of matrix surfaces and the matrix itself should be resolved in the present model through a rule of the processes of co2 under deep reservoir conditions thus we develop a model of multi layer partial bound back processes unlike the existing bound back of fluid solid interface the present model is partial bound back from the matrix since the matrix is not a pure solid but a substance with small porosities fig 2 shows the role of n s x and the interface treatment of a portion of bounce back on the matrix surface and within the matrix n s x can be described as the function n s x 1 ε ψ where ε is the porosity of the matrix and ψ represents its mineral properties for different minerals ψ takes the different value from 0 to 1 in this paper ε 0 3 and ψ 0 5 for the mineral calcite it should be noted that the porosity here represents the local cell when ε 1 the node is full fluid pore therefore no particle is bounced back and n s x 0 on the other hand when ε 0 the node is full solid therefore the particle bounced back will be determined by the interface mineral properties and n s x ψ because the matrix porosity and mineral properties are varied at different locations the stream particles will be bounced back partially the partially bounce back can be illustrated in fig 2b the matrix nodes are marked in yellow e g x 1 and x 2 they have the bounced back function parameter n s x 1 and n s x 2 respectively when the distribution function f i streams to the matrix node x 1 the portion of 1 n s x 1 f i passes through the node x 1 and the residual portion n s x 1 f i will be bounced back for the next matrix node x 2 the less part of 1 n s x 2 1 n s x 1 f i reaches to the node x 2 and the rest part bounce back thus the portion of the particles which pass through matrix reduces step by step along the deep matrix nodes a semi empirical relationship between permeability k and n s can be derived as dardis and mccloskey 1998a 12 k ν 2 n s its physical meaning is that the permeability is inversely proportional to fraction of particle bound back the fluid density and the macro velocity are defined as 13 ρ i f i ρ u i c i f i thus eq 1 can be recovered through the chapman enskog multi scale expansion to eqs 7 13 3 2 multi component reactive transport 3 2 1 reactive model for transport species the lbm evolution equations for transport species distribution are expressed guo and zhao 2002 14 g y j i x c i δ t t δ t g y j i x t 1 τ j g y j i x t g y j i eq x t ω i r j δ t where g y j i is the i th distribution function for the j th species τ j the dimensionless relaxation time for the j

term and can be calculated as 16 r j c j r where r is the total reaction rate calculated by using eq 6 and c j the reaction coefficient for the j th species according to the eq 5 c j 1 0 for the reactant h and c j 1 0 for the products ca and hco 3 we define the j th species diffusion coefficient d j as 17 d j τ j 0 5 c s 2 δ t and the j th species concentration y j in terms of their distribution function 18 y j i g y j i 3 2 2 solid phase dissolution reaction all the species concentration in eq 3 can be recovered from the above except the solid phase caco 3 the reaction rate of caco 3 with porosity and permeability change can be expressed as yin et al 2012 19 y c t m c r where y c is the mass of calcium carbonate m c the caco 3 molecular weight and r the total reaction rate the volume of the matrix decreases and the porosity increases as the solid phase caco 3 dissolves the porosity can be calculated as 20 ε 1 0 1 0 ε 0 y c y c 0 where y c y c 0 is the mass ratio of the transient caco 3 to its initial one the local porosity at every node will be updated for the whole domain at every timestep the permeability change can be obtained from the porosity at each timestep by using kozeny carman equation as 21 k k 0 ε ε 0 3 1 0 ε 0 1 0 ε 2 the matrix porosity and pore connection change due to matrix dissolution will change the geometry of the porous media and flow variables therefore the geometry and porosity of the porous media will be updated at each timestep and couple processes of fluid and solute reaction transport solid porosity and permeability 4 results and discussion 3d cases are investigated numerically we verify darcy forchheimer d f drag in two specific cases against the published data jeong et al 2006 ergun 1952 and examine co2 reactive transport in simple homogeneous 3d porous media then the lbm of the reactive transport processes is used for simulation of dissolution induced changes in permeability and porosity in a 3d porous media generated by x ray ct 4 1 verification of 3d reactive transport model firstly 3d flows in a series of in line cubes and staggered spheres arrangements fig 3 were used for the validation of the proposed model two cases were selected to represent the cube case and the sphere one the porosity of the cubes case is 0 4523 and the sphere case is 0 4334 respectively it is well known that their permeability and drag in these porous media are calculated by using ergun correlation ergun 1952 22 d 2 k f re d 150 1 ε 2 ε 3 1 75 1 ε ε 3 re d where the left terms of eq 22 are referred to as darcy forchheimer drag a comparison between our results and eq 22 are shown in fig 3c in both cases our results are in good overall agreement with ergun correlation over a wide range of reynolds number some slight discrepancies can be found with high red this may be because the surfaces of the simulated cube in the sphere in porous media were not smooth these comparison results show the flow simulation capacity in complex media for the second test case we investigate the 3d reactive transport properties the computational grids for the 3d homogeneous case are 41 41 41 the co2 with water is injected from the left inlet x 0 to the right outlet x 1 0 the initial concentration of h at the inlet is set as 1 0 10 4 mol l while those of ca and hco3 are both 0 0 all concentration thereafter is normalized by the initial h concentration the ph can be obtained by using the relationship formula ph log h in fig 4 the reaction rate and porosity distributions at different timesteps are plotted and compared it can be seen that the maximum dimensionless reaction rate is 0 188 with the highest concentration of h at the inlet when the initial porosity is 0 3 fig 4a then the reaction rate decreases as the reaction front moves to the downstream fig 4b at 1 106 timesteps the reaction front is at x 0 125 the peak reaction rate is of 0 115 which is 61 1 of its highest value 0 188 the porosity at the inlet surface increases over time and reaches 0 72 at 3 105 timesteps fig 4c with the further reaction the calcite at the inlet is totally dissolved at 5 105 timesteps and its porosity increases to 1 0 as the reaction front moves forward the volume with a porosity of 1 0 increases fig 4d the effects of different initial porosity are also examined when ε0 0 1 and 0 5 fig 5 the reaction rate for ε0 0 5 is much higher than that when ε0 0 1 and 0 3 at 1 105 timesteps at 3 6 105 timesteps the matrix at the inlet has been totally dissolved and the reaction front moves downstream when ε0 0 5 it can also be found that the reaction rate at centerline increases as the initial matrix porosity increases the centerline is defined as along the x direction at y 0 5 and z 0 5 in particular their reaction fronts are significantly influenced by the initial matrix porosity for example its reaction front for ε0 0 5 is at about x 0 25 at 5 105 timesteps in fig 5b while the reaction rates remain similar for the initial porosity of 0 1 and 0 3 fig 5c shows that the matrix at inlet are dissolved in all cases at 7 105 timesteps their reaction fronts with the porosity of 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 are at x 0 025 0 075 and 0 75 respectively however the maximum reaction rate seems complicated for the porosity of 0 5 the maximum reaction rate is the highest while it is lowest for the porosity of 0 3 this can be explained that the reaction is controlled by the kinetics of a higher or smaller porosity but the reaction by transport for the middle porosity therefore there is a porosity threshold to enhance the reactive transport after serial numerical experiments we find the threshold porosity is approximately 0 43 under the present conditions 4 2 3d study in real porous media 4 2 1 sample of porous media for many natural carbonate rocks there always exists very low permeable matrix that cannot be resolved by current x ray ct fig 6 a shows a real porous media sample acquired from x ray ct with the total voxels 256 256 256 the density values of its voxels are represented as a grayscale profile of an image from x ray ct fig 6b because voxels of porous sample by x ray ct scans are usually used for the computational grid a pore voxel is active and a matrix voxel is a non active solid thus it is common that a voxel is defined as either a pore or a solid once a threshold is selected sahimi 1995 prat 2002 fig 6a shows a structure of the porous media at its threshold of 123 a voxel is defined as a pore fracture when the grayscale value is higher than 123 using the grayscale threshold we can extract large pores from 3d x ray ct data and pore connectivity among heterogeneous macro pore structures throughout the strongly anisotropic rock samples however the real matrix porosity may vary from 0 02 to 0 5 as shown in its grayscale profile fig 6b except for solid voxels the porosity for many matrix cells is not confined to pore or solid microporous matrix therefore these matrix cells can also contribute to flow and diffusion as well as adsorption and desorption since their grayscale may vary in space the porosity at every voxel can be determined by their grayscale thus the matrix porosity at each voxel will vary over the domain and their spatial heterogeneity can be resolved directly through their grayscale the moderate and low grayscale regions can be assigned correspondingly with moderate and high microporous matrix without loss of the generality of this model we can assume its initial matrix porosity of 0 1 0 3 for a given carbonate rock with the total voxels of 81 81 81 the matrix porosity can be related to their voxel grayscale as table 1 the microporous matrix heterogeneity is shown on fig 6c we define the porosity of the whole domain as the total porosity to distinguish the local matrix porosity 4 2 2 porosity change with reaction rate fig 7 a shows the porosity distribution change at 5 105 timesteps in our 3d cases one timestep represents 0 6 s in real time therefore 1 105 timesteps is 16 67 h approximately its sliced surfaces at y 0 5 and z 0 5 are shown in fig 7b the main porosity change occurs near the entrance region it can be found that porosity changes along the fracture edges till outlet fig 7b due to the higher transport ability of species in fractures this can be explained that the co2 concentration at the inlet is the highest and decreases along the fractures its corresponding reaction rate distribution is shown in fig 7c and d the regions of porosity increase matched well with its reaction rate distribution 4 2 3 species transport properties h concentration distribution has also been compared at different timesteps at the starting stage h moves mainly along the fractures the h concentration is still almost zero in the downstream matrix region at 5 104 timestep fig 8 a and b with further reactive transport process the h spreads over the whole domain and reaches the minimum h concentration of about 0 32 at 5 105 timesteps however it should be noted that the main h transport paths are along the fractures according to its higher concentration the centerline h concentration is also plotted at different timesteps in fig 8c the h concentration gradually increases till 1 105 timesteps after that its concentration remains almost stable there are two concentration peaks at around x 0 2 and 0 8 because these are at the fracture areas before these two peak areas the concentration decreases due to the matrix and form the valley areas at x 0 1 and 0 5 this shows that the reaction is controlled by transport along the fractures ca concentration increases over time due to the reaction fig 9 at 5 104 timesteps the ca ion mostly concentrates in the upstream region its concentration peaks appear in the region x 0 4 the ca ion increases at the downstream and the concentration peaks appear fig 9c shows profiles of centerline ca concentration at different timesteps it can be found that two ca concentration peaks occur in the upstream region before 2 104 timesteps while the ca concentration is very low in the downstream region fig 9c then the downstream ca concentration increases gradually as the reaction continues at 5 104 timesteps the peaks of the ca concentration distribution move to the downstream after 1 105 timesteps the ca concentration becomes almost stable this means the reaction has already reached equilibrium fig 9d shows the maximum ca concentration changes over time as the reaction continues the maximum concentration increases quickly until 5 104 timesteps then increases very little until becoming stable after 1 105 timesteps in fig 10 we compare the h and ca concentration with the porosity distribution at the centerline the two peaks of h concentration appear in the fracture areas while its corresponding ca concentration is at the valley value it can be seen that there are there are two valleys of h concentration in the matrix area before the two fracture areas this can be explained in that the production of h are in the inversed tendency to that of ca as a result they have inversed profiles 4 2 4 effects of velocities in fractures 2d sliced x y planes of porosity and reaction rate with velocity vectors are plotted in fig 11 at z 0 4625 at 5 105 timesteps it can be seen that the velocity is much higher in the fracture region than in the matrix the reaction mainly occurs at the surface of matrix at the inlet area the reaction rate decreases along the main fracture paths in the downstream matrix because the co2 concentration decreases in the downstream matrix x 0 75 1 0 y 0 5 0 8 the velocity vectors are still relatively high resulting in high reaction rates because they locate at the intersection of the two fracture paths with high h concentration due to three dimensional effects in this irregular matrix array the velocity increases and some reaction can occur in the backwind areas of the matrix at the region x 0 55 0 6 and y 0 6 0 8 the velocity decreases at x 0 0 35 and y 0 0 5 because the fracture becomes wider due to dissolution of matrix in fig 11 a for a nozzle fracture the velocity usually increases during the throat and then decreases the region x 0 7 1 0 and y 0 75 0 85 in fig 11 a however the velocity decreases in the throat of a nozzle fracture at x 0 3 0 6 and y 0 4 0 6 this is because of the three dimensional effects table 2 shows the effect of three dimensional velocity components the u v and w velocity represent the velocity components along the x y and z direction respectively the u velocity decreases and then increases and the v velocity keeps almost at the same magnitude while the w velocity not shown in the 2d sliced plane changes the most from the negative to the positive the three dimensional effects change the usual velocity distribution in this throat region in fig 12 we compared the porosity and reaction rate distribution at two different positions y 0 5 and y 0 75 this high reaction rate can also be observed in fig 12b the second matrix region generally the matrix porosity increase matched well with the reaction rate distribution the higher the reaction rate the more the matrix porosity increase for y 0 5 fig 12a the inlet region is at the matrix and the inlet reaction rate is the highest the maximum matrix porosity is 0 475 at inlet after which the reaction rate drops down in the matrix in the second matrix region x 0 25 0 5 approximately the reaction rate is only about 16 24 of the maximum value at the inlet while at y 0 75 fig 12b the inlet region is fracture and the reaction rate starts at about x 0 15 where the first matrix is located the second matrix region with reaction is x 0 8 0 95 approximately the highest reaction rate along y 0 75 is only about 70 of that in the case of y 0 5 this is because the downstream h concentration is lower than that at the inlet and the maximum matrix porosity is 0 413 at x 0 15 fig 13 shows the centerline u velocity at 5 105 timesteps and before reaction different velocity increases can be found along the centerline their corresponding velocity values and increasing rates are given in table 3 the increasing rate varies at different positions and the maximum is over 30 this is because the fracture structure changes as matrix dissolves furthermore the velocity increase means the permeability is enhanced we compare the flow flux through the whole outlet cross section and found a 24 permeability enhancement after 5 105 timesteps fig 14 shows the concentration distribution of h in 2d slice with velocity vectors it can be seen that the h transports along the two fractures where the velocity is also higher than that in matrix therefore the regions of high h concentration and high velocity almost coincide in fig 15 a the two peak areas of the u velocity and h concentration along the centerline y 0 5 matches well with each other in the fracture region similarly along y 0 75 the main valley areas of the u velocity and h concentration are matched in the matrix region fig 15b and the second valley area at about x 0 8 0 9 is not very distinct because it locates along the upper edge of the matrix fig 16 shows the concentration contour of the ca it can be seen that there are low ca concentration along the fracture paths which is the inversed pattern with that of the h in fig 17 we can also find the inversed distribution between the ca concentration and u velocity along y 0 5 and y 0 75 respectively generally the h concentration is high along the main fracture paths and u velocity is high while the ca concentration is low 4 2 5 effects of heterogeneous matrix porosity the influences of heterogeneous matrix porosity are also investigated natural rock usually has heterogeneous porosity distribution therefore we investigated the heterogeneous porous media with a variation of porosity from 0 1 to 0 3 ε0 1 0 for pore fracture according to the matrix grayscales fig 6c centerline reaction rate distribution is compared with that of the homogeneous porosity 0 3 in fig 18 a it can be seen that the reaction rate in the heterogeneous porosity is lower than that in the homogeneous one this can be explained that the average heterogeneous porosity is lower than the homogeneous one while after x 0 5 their difference is not so distinct because the reaction rate primarily stays at 0 0 where it locates a fracture this may be explained that the reactants have not diffused to the matrix region fig 18b shows a comparison of centerline porosity in the upstream matrix areas the heterogeneous matrix porosity is obviously smaller than the homogeneous one while the porosity distribution is almost identical in downstream region coinciding with the distribution pattern of the reaction rate the porosity changes at different positions are compared in table 4 three positions are at the edges of matrix x 0 15 0 2125 and 0 525 with the same initial porosity 0 3 in the homogeneous case and the other two are in the middle of matrix x 0 and 0 4 with the different initial porosity 0 15 and 0 14 the increasing rate of porosity decreases as x increases in both cases at the matrix edge the rate of increase in heterogeneous case is lower than that in homogeneous case while in the middle of matrix it is inversed because of the lower initial porosity the heterogeneity of the matrix porosity does affect the reaction rates since the heterogeneous matrix porosity is different from the homogeneous one for the h concentration distribution they keep a similar trend in both cases fig 18c while it is lower in most regions than that in the heterogeneous case the h concentration stays almost the same only at around x 0 75 where the two main path fractures are confluent before the matrix 4 3 discussion geological co2 sequestration processes involve different trapping mechanisms according to the reservoir conditions three main trapping processes of co2 storage are 1 physical 2 chemical and 3 biological the physical storage is hydrodynamic as a free phase i e gas liquid or supercritical co2 in structural or stratigraphic traps such as solubility the chemical storage consists of reaction dissolution precipitation adsorption and desorption of co2 as aqueous carbonated and mineral phases in formation water all of these storages depend on permeability and reaction rates therefore permeability and reaction rates appear as two of the most important parameters as they ensure a permanent and secure sequestration of co2 the heterogeneous microporosity of carbonate rocks occurs in natural reservoirs lin et al 2016 cantrel and hagerty 1999 it affect the fluid flow properties such as permeability and saturation water signature therefore the permeability and reaction rates are heterogeneous in space and time they are the most noticeable feature in carbonate reservoirs they greatly control fluid flow solute transport and mineralization while its lack of representation in traditional hydrogeological models cause much uncertainty in model predictions in lieu of their heterogeneities the present models adopt an effective multi layer partial bound back approach to account for the heterogeneity of unresolved matrix porosity for the simulation of the bulk flow and component transport behaviors and reactions to address the important heterogeneity problems 5 conclusions we have developed an lbm to build a multi domain varying permeability model that can accurately predict variations in heterogeneous matrix porosity and hydraulic connectivity due to dynamic dissolution and precipitation our lbm model for co2 reactive transport has been coupled with 3d porous morphology generated by ct scan we also explicitly treat the fracture matrix interaction using our multi layer partial bounce back model within the microporous matrix to resolve dynamic processes of matrix porosity and permeability changes microporous heterogeneity and unsaturated reaction front our coupled model was verified against analytical solutions of the permeability in 3d homogeneous media the results show the co2 storage influenced by factors including the matrix porosity change reaction front movement velocity and initial properties there is a porosity threshold of about 0 43 which enhances the reactive transport the reaction rate distribution and porosity increase show the similar pattern the porosity increases in the area with a higher reaction rate a higher porosity increases near the entrance region along the fracture paths the higher concentration areas of reactant h are found along the fracture paths with higher u velocity profiles the product ca shows the inverse distribution pattern with that of the h furthermore there are the dissolution induced porosity and permeability changes in the real 3d porous media after 5 105 timesteps reaction about 24 permeability enhancement can be obtained by calculating the outlet flow flux in particular it is found that the microporosity in the matrix that cannot be resolved by x ray ct does contribute to the dissolution and co2 storage given the abundance of brine reservoirs for ccs these results imply that co2 injection induced dissolution can have an important impact on porosity and permeability as well as consequences on geological co2 sequestration including determining residual saturation flow patterns and reaction fronts this represents a successful attempt to simulate how the porosity changes cause dynamic variations in the hydraulic properties of matrices and that the solid matrix does contribute to reactive transport as such this model can be used as a tool to simulate the co2 reactive transport

7494,hydrological model parameters are typically calibrated by observed streamflow data this calibration strategy is questioned when the simulated hydrological variables of interest are not limited to streamflow well performed streamflow simulations do not guarantee the reliable reproduction of other hydrological variables one of the reasons is that hydrological model parameters are not reasonably identified the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived total water storage change twsc data provide an opportunity to constrain hydrological model parameterizations in combination with streamflow observations in this study a multi objective calibration scheme based on grace derived twsc and streamflow observations was compared with the traditional single objective calibration scheme based on only streamflow simulations two hydrological models were employed on 22 catchments in china with different climatic conditions the model evaluations were performed using observed streamflows grace derived twsc and actual evapotranspiration et estimates from flux towers and from the water balance approach results showed that the multi objective calibration scheme provided more reliable twsc and et simulations without significant deterioration in the accuracy of streamflow simulations than the single objective calibration the improvement in twsc and et simulations was more significant in relatively dry catchments than in relatively wet catchments in addition hydrological models calibrated using grace derived twsc data alone cannot obtain accurate runoff simulations in ungauged catchments this study highlights the importance of including additional constraints in addition to streamflow observations to improve performances of hydrological models keywords grace hydrological model parameterization hydrological simulations 1 introduction the water cycle is a highly complex dynamic process involving energy exchange and material transfer between the land surface and the atmosphere miao et al 2016 trancoso et al 2016 as simplified representations of complex hydrological processes hydrological models are fundamental tools for simulating the stores and fluxes of water near land surfaces and predicting future water availability famiglietti and rodell 2013 the simplified representations in hydrological models inevitably cause some hydrological processes to be improperly represented or even ignored beven 1989 clark et al 2015 in addition to the uncertainties in process representations hydrological models suffer from uncertainties in model structures and forcing data those uncertainties in hydrological models indicate that parameter calibration is necessary to achieve reliable hydrological modeling gupta et al 1998 duan et al 2006 hydrological models are typically calibrated against streamflow observations which are the most common and readily available hydrological observations globally in addition streamflow observations reflect the integrated responses of catchment hydrological systems to climate landscape and anthropogenic disturbances güntner 2008 zaitchik et al 2010 rakovec et al 2016a therefore streamflow data have long been used as the observations to calibrate hydrological models duan et al 2006 werth et al 2009 liu et al 2017 in recent years applications of hydrological models have been greatly extended in addition to streamflow simulations hydrological models were also used to simulate snow cover soil moisture actual evapotranspiration et and groundwater level gilfedder et al 2012 cai et al 2014a liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b chen et al 2017 for those practices hydrological models are required to produce reasonable estimates of hydrological variables other than streamflow in these cases calibration of hydrological models using streamflow data alone is likely insufficient because model parameters can be falsely adjusted to maximize the streamflow simulation performances without considering the simulation accuracy of other hydrological variables beven and freer 2001 clark et al 2016 guo et al 2017 several studies have found that well performed streamflow simulations do not warrant reliable reproductions of other hydrological variables minville et al 2014 bai et al 2016a girotto et al 2016 rakovec et al 2016b for example a hydrological model that produces an overestimation of et could be compensated for by an underestimation of soil moisture resulting in accurate streamflow simulations rakovec et al 2016b concluded that calibration of hydrological models using streamflow data alone does not guarantee reasonable estimates of et soil moisture and twsc similar results have also been found by parajka and blöschl 2008 werth et al 2009 lo et al 2010 minville et al 2014 and zhuo and han 2016 simulations of hydrological variables other than runoff based on hydrological models are commonly improved in two ways one way is improving the process representations of hydrological models by making better use of existing hydrological theory zhang et al 2008 clark et al 2016 kim and mohanty 2016 trancoso et al 2017 this can be achieved by 1 replacing the empirical equations in hydrological models with physically based ones e g zhang et al 2008 and 2 including hydrological processes which are ignored in current models e g kim and mohanty 2016 another way is calibrating hydrological models with data complementary to streamflow observations güntner 2008 lee et al 2011 kumar et al 2016 rakovec et al 2016a chen et al 2017 the complementary data for multi objective calibration include et soil moisture groundwater level and twsc such complementary data were mainly obtained from two sources ground based observations and remotely sensed retrievals compared to the ground based observations remotely sensed data are generally more easily accessible and have higher spatial and temporal resolutions though they are often not direct measurements of the hydrological variables of interest van dijk and renzullo 2011 thus remotely sensed data are widely used for calibration of hydrological models along with streamflow observations the grace satellites provide the unprecedented opportunity to quantify spatial temporal variations of the earth s surface mass which largely reflect changes in total water storage on the surface through groundwater swenson et al 2003 tapley et al 2004 although grace data have shortcomings in spatial resolution 300 km and temporal resolution monthly they offer candidate complementary data to better constrain parameterizations of hydrological models in conjunction with streamflow observations table 1 presents a summary of relevant literature including grace data for model parameterization previous studies have reached inconsistent conclusions regarding the effects on streamflow simulations from including grace data for model calibration for example zaitchik et al 2008 werth et al 2009 kumar et al 2016 and chen et al 2017 found positive impacts whereas negative impacts were reported by livneh and lettenmaier 2012 rakovec et al 2016a and tangdamrongsub et al 2017 the objective of this study is to test whether incorporating grace derived twsc data during model parameterizations can improve hydrological model performances to accomplish this purpose the multi objective calibration scheme using streamflow observations and grace data was compared with the traditional single objective calibration scheme using streamflow observations alone two monthly water balance models were employed to reduce the dependence of simulation results on single model behavior section 2 the two hydrological models were applied on 22 basins in china with different climatic conditions section 3 the models were evaluated against the observed streamflow grace derived twsc and et estimates from the water balance approach and from two flux towers section 4 we also investigated the potentials of using grace data alone for streamflow predictions in ungauged basins finally we compared our findings with other relevant research and discussed the uncertainties in the evaluation results section 5 the paper ends with conclusion in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 hydrological models in this study two lumped monthly hydrological models namely the abcd model thomas 1981 and the wm model wang and zhang 2005 were used with the expectation of obtaining robust results the main reason for selecting the two models was that they have relative low complexities and provide clear physical descriptions of the dominant hydrological processes in addition both models explicitly simulate total water storage tws and the model outputs share the same temporal resolution with the grace data this facilitates the simulated water storage changes directly comparable with grace derived twsc data the abcd model has been successfully applied to a large number of basins with different hydro meteorological conditions alley 1984 martinez and gupta 2010 steinschneider et al 2012 the model has four parameters and consists of four routines et water storage quick runoff and base flow two cascaded storage layers are used in the abcd model the upper layer represents soil water storage and the lower layer represents groundwater storage detailed descriptions of the model formulation can be found in fernandez et al 2000 and martinez and gupta 2010 the model structure of the wm model is quite different from that of the abcd model the wm model possesses lower complexity and fewer free parameters three than the abcd model four to maintain model parsimony the wm model uses a series of linear functions to simulate et and runoff a single water storage unit is used in the wm model to partition precipitation into et residual water storage and runoff the et estimates in the wm model are treated as the function of potential evapotranspiration and relative water storage the two hydrological models were forced using the same monthly inputs and tested over the same time periods detailed information regarding the model structures and key equations of the two hydrological models can be found in fig 1 descriptions of model parameters and variables are listed in table 2 2 2 parameter calibration schemes in this study two calibration cases were examined to test whether incorporating grace data into the parameter calibration of hydrological models can improve model performances the first calibration case involved calibration with runoff data alone hereafter referred to as the case q in the second calibration case hydrological models were calibrated using both runoff and grace data hereafter referred to as the case q twsc unlike the case q the case q twsc is a multi objective optimization involving two conflicting objective functions to be optimized simultaneously gupta et al 1998 solving the multi objective optimization problem is not as straightforward as solving the single objective one it requires the different and contradictory objectives to be optimized simultaneously gill et al 2006 yang et al 2016 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is a commonly used multi objective optimization approach srinivas and deb 1994 deb et al 2002 this algorithm solves the multi objective optimization problems using the concept of evolutionary parameter variation and produces a number of solution candidates werth et al 2009 in this study the optimal solutions were selected based on the principle of shortest distances between each candidate solution and ideal solution an ideal solution denotes a perfect fit between observations and simulations for both objectives see fig 2 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was utilized as the objective function which is a modified version of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kge reweights three independent statistical criteria i e linear correlation γ relative variability α and bias ratio β used in the nse and integrates them into a single multi objective criterion this modification avoids the limitation of nse which overemphasizes the match of high flows and sacrifices the match of low flows pechlivanidis et al 2010 guse et al 2017 the kge is expressed as 1 kge 1 1 γ 2 1 α 2 1 β 2 with α σ s σ o and β μ s μ o where μs and μo are the averages for the simulations and observations respectively and σs and σo are the standard deviations for the simulations and observations respectively during model evaluations the kge is typically used as a comprehensive assessment criterion to measure the agreement between observed and simulated values bai et al 2016b rakovec et al 2016b the kge ranges from negative infinity to 1 and kge 1 indicates a perfect agreement between observed and simulated values gupta et al 2009 the classical split sample test scheme klemeš 1986 was employed for model calibration and validation for each catchment the available monthly data from april 2002 to december 2012 were split into two parts of similar lengths and both were used for model calibration and validation by reversing calibration and validation the first year of each part of data was used for model warm up to reduce the impact of initial values on the model calibration 2 3 model assessment criteria in addition to the kge two other statistics were also used to assess the model performances the coefficient of determination r 2 and the percent bias pbias the r 2 represents how much variation in the observations can be explained by the simulations krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 yang et al 2017b the pbias indicates the average tendency of the simulated values to be larger or smaller than the observations gupta et al 1999 with pbias 0 0 being optimal the r 2 is expressed as 2 r 2 i 1 n y obs i y obs y sim i y sim i 1 n y sim i y sim 2 i 1 n y obs i y obs 2 2 the pbias is expressed as 3 pbias i 1 n y obs i y sim i i 1 n y obs i 100 where y sim and y obs are the simulated and observed values respectively y sim and y obs are the average simulated and observed values respectively and n is the total number of months of the data time series 3 study area and data used 3 1 study area the test catchments were selected based on the following three principles first catchments with the drainage areas 10 000 km2 were excluded because their drainage areas are less than a grid cell area of the grace data one degree 10 000 km2 second snow dominated catchments were not selected because the hydrological models used in this study have no snowmelt modules see section 3 1 below third the selected catchments must be relatively unimpaired catchments that are not subject to large impacts of human activities on the river discharge this was necessary because the hydrological models used in this study only simulated natural hydrological processes through catchment screening over china 22 catchments were used in this study most of which are located in the yellow river and yangtze river basins fig 3 the catchments cover a wide range of hydro meteorological conditions and landscape characteristics according to the statistics from 1960 to 2012 the annual precipitation varies between 394 and 1852 mm year aridity index ranges from 0 52 to 2 25 and drainage area from 10 009 to 156 736 km2 see table 3 note that the aridity index used here is defined as the ratio of average annual potential evaporation pet to precipitation p unep 1992 monthly runoff and meteorological data from 2002 to 2012 are available for each catchment the runoff data were provided by the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china the meteorological data were provided by the china meteorological administration including precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration http data cma cn the precipitation data were extracted from a 0 5 degree resolution grid dataset covering the whole of china which was generated by spatial interpolation from 2472 meteorological stations fig 3 li et al 2014 shen and xiong 2016 the other meteorological data were mainly used to calculate pet based on the physically based penman equation penman 1948 donohue et al 2010 the basin average pet data were produced using kriging interpolation based on the available meteorological stations in and around each catchment 3 2 model evaluation data the model evaluations were conducted using the observed runoff data grace derived twsc and et estimates from flux towers and from the water balance approach the latest release of grace data rl05 provided by the university of texas center for space research csr were used in this study http www2 csr utexas edu grace the dataset cover the period from april 2002 to december 2012 with the spatial resolution of 1 0 1 0 although the grace data offer an opportunity to constrain the water balance equation the coarse spatial resolution impedes their applications in small catchments longuevergne et al 2010 long et al 2015 to obtain more reliable twsc estimates the grace data were corrected by restoring signal losses and downscaling grace data to finer resolution signal losses stemming from the sampling and post processing of grace data are among the sources of error in grace data swenson et al 2003 long et al 2015 and can be corrected by scaling factor approach save et al 2016 long et al 2017 the scaling factor approach utilizes the tws output from land surface models lsms to generate scaling factors for correcting the errors in grace data long et al 2017 in this study the global scaling factors were generated based on a lsm in global land data assimilation system gldas i e variable infiltration capacity vic long et al 2015 in addition we employed a model based downscaling approach proposed by wan et al 2015 to obtain a finer resolution 0 25 0 25 time series of twsc over the test catchments the approach combines the advantages of grace data and lsm in twsc estimates specifically the grace based twsc data are reliable when the area of interest is larger than the grace footprint 4 0 4 0 degree longuevergne et al 2010 long et al 2015 lsm can provide better spatial pattern of twsc than grace data while values of lsm simulated twsc have uncertainties in this study a 0 25 degree dataset of hydrological variables including tws estimates simulated by the variable infiltration capacity vic model over china were employed to downscale grace data this dataset adopted high density meteorological observations as forcing data and multi gauge runoff observations for model calibration zhang et al 2014 the vic simulated 0 25 degree twsc was first aggregated to 4 0 degree to match the 4 0 degree grace grid data the 4 0 degree twsc data were then downscaled to 0 25 degree this downscaling approach ensures that the sum of the downscaled twsc value in each 4 0 degree grid cell is equal to the corresponding 4 0 degree grace twsc value the original and downscaled trends of the grace derived twsc during the period 2003 2012 were shown in fig 4 the downscaled grace data presented similar spatial patterns but at a finer resolution than the original grace data detailed descriptions of downscaling the grace data are presented in wan et al 2015 the et fluxes obtained from the hydrological models were evaluated against the et estimates from two flux towers fig 3 and from the water balance approach the et estimates from two flux stations changwu and qianyanzhou were provided by the chinese flux observation and research network http www chinaflux org yu et al 2006 the land use around the changwu gauging station hereafter cw station is dominated by farmland and apple orchard brutsaert et al 2017 and the land use around the qianyanzhou gauging station hereafter qyz station is dominated by mixed evergreen coniferous forests tang et al 2016 the flux data cover the period 2004 2007 for the cw station and 2003 2005 for the qyz station to make the simulated and measured et comparable the grid based modeling 0 05 0 05 was performed in the catchments where the flux stations are located with the aim of producing spatially variable et outputs the et evaluations for hydrological models are typically performed against eddy covariance flux measurements cai et al 2014b long et al 2014 however such measurements can only reflect the local et conditions and flux stations are very sparse globally the ability of grace satellites to observe water storage changes over the entire river basin allows et to be evaluated in a water balance framework rodell et al 2004 zeng et al 2012 famiglietti and rodell 2013 wan et al 2015 in this study the water balance based et estimates were also used as benchmark values for basin scale et evaluations the water balance approach calculates the basin scale et as 4 et p q twsc where p is basin average precipitation mm month q is net runoff depth mm month and twsc is the monthly water storage changes derived from grace satellites mm month the twsc cannot be neglected on the monthly time scale especially for those catchments with relatively low et values zeng et al 2012 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a one disadvantage of the water balance approach is that it only provides the basin average et fluxes and cannot estimate the spatial distribution of et for a catchment rodell et al 2004 4 results 4 1 model evaluations simulation results of runoff twsc and et for the two calibration cases i e the case q and the case q twsc were compared in this section for runoff simulations the two hydrological models successfully simulated the monthly runoff over the test catchments with a median kge exceeding 0 80 and a median r 2 exceeding 0 82 fig 5 in both calibration cases the runoff simulation accuracy in the calibration period is greater than that in the validation period given that the model performances in the validation period better reflects the actual predictive abilities of hydrological models hereafter we only compare model performances in the validation period for the two calibration cases overall hydrological models calibrated with the two cases had similar runoff simulation accuracy the differences in the median kge values of the two cases were 0 02 from 0 84 to 0 82 for the abcd model and 0 01 from 0 85 to 0 84 for the wm model r2 and pbias also exhibited negligible differences between the two cases fig 5 the results indicate that the calibrated parameters from the case q and the case q twsc are equally good for runoff simulations over the test catchments for twsc simulations the two hydrological models produced consistent results and the case q twsc significantly outperformed the case q the median kge increased by 0 64 from 0 22 to 0 42 for the abcd model and 0 49 from 0 12 to 0 37 for the wm model the median r2 increased by 0 12 from 0 41 to 0 53 and 0 14 from 0 34 to 0 48 and the median pbias decreased by 34 from 48 to 14 and 37 from 69 to 32 for the two models respectively fig 6 the et simulations for the two calibration cases were compared with the et benchmark values from the water balance approach fig 7 the et simulations from the case q twsc exhibited better performance than that from the case q for the abcd model the median kge increased from 0 31 to 0 44 the median r2 increased from 0 45 to 0 57 and the median pbias decreased from 33 to 15 similar performance statistics were also found for the wm model in addition the et simulations for the two cases were compared with the et measurements at two flux stations fig 8 compared with the case q significant improvements in et simulations were achieved for the case q twsc at both flux stations the differences in median kge at the cw station between the two cases were 0 05 from 0 85 to 0 80 for the abcd model and 0 07 from 0 84 to 0 77 for the wm model r2 and pbias from the case q twsc also exhibited large improvement compared with that from the case q at the qyz station significant improvement in et simulations was also found the results further confirm that et estimates can be improved by incorporating grace derived twsc data into model calibration 4 2 catchment performance differences when incorporating grace data into model calibration the relationships between catchment characteristics and model performance differences were analyzed in this study two independent catchment characteristics were considered catchment area and aridity index the catchment area is an important physical characteristic of a catchment while the aridity index reflects the climatic condition of a catchment the relatively dry catchments generally have relatively large aridity indices the kge differences between the two cases i e kgeq twsc kgeq were used to represent the magnitudes of improvement deterioration when incorporating grace data into model calibration the values of kgeq twsc kgeq for all three variables runoff twsc and et against the normalized area index and aridity index were shown in fig 9 the values of kgeq twsc kgeq for all three variables were not significantly correlated with the catchment area based on a t test analysis r 2 0 005 p 05 fig 9a c however a significant positive correlation between the aridity index and the values of kgeq twsc kgeq can be found for the twsc r 2 0 40 p 01 and et r 2 0 38 p 01 simulations fig 9d f this implies that the improvement magnitudes of twsc and et increased toward the relatively dry catchments however for the runoff simulations the kgeq twsc kgeq values appeared to be independent of the aridity index r 2 0 09 p 05 indicating that there were no significant differences of runoff simulation improvements under different climatic conditions 4 3 calibration of hydrological models using grace data alone some basins in the world are ungauged or poorly gauged runoff simulations in ungauged catchments have long been a challenge for hydrologists sivapalan et al 2003 hrachowitz et al 2013 jarihani et al 2015b one of the difficulties is the lack of observations for hydrological model calibrations sivapalan 2003 mcintyre et al 2004 the grace satellites provide the potential for calibrating hydrological models in ungauged basins in this study the potential was tested by comparing four different parameterization experiments i model parameters were calibrated using observed runoff data alone denoted sq hereafter ii model parameters were calibrated using grace derived twsc data alone denoted stwsc hereafter iii model parameters were set to random values within the ranges of parameters denoted sr hereafter and iv model parameters were set to the averages of the upper and lower limits of parameters denoted sm hereafter model performances for the runoff simulations using the four parameterization experiments were shown in fig 10 sq resulted in the best performances with the median kge being 0 42 0 46 larger than that of other three parameterization experiments the other three parameterization experiments have similar performances for runoff simulations for example in terms of the median kge values the differences between the stwsc sr and sm were 0 06 for the abcd model and 0 10 for the wm model therefore the calibration of hydrological models using grace data alone cannot obtain accurate runoff simulations in ungauged catchments 5 discussion 5 1 model evaluations the streamflow records have long been used as the only observations to calibrate hydrological models werth et al 2009 this study tested whether including grace data into model calibration can improve hydrological simulations than the traditional model calibration results indicated that including grace data into model calibration produced similar runoff simulations to the traditional model calibration the conclusion is in line with the findings of the previous studies by livneh and lettenmaier 2012 rakovec et al 2016a and tangdamrongsub et al 2017 one possible reason is the non uniqueness of optimal parameters i e equifinality beven 1993 beven and freer 2001 savenije 2001 the model parameters identified from the two calibration cases were equally effective in reproducing observed runoff the evaluation results also showed that including grace data into calibration significantly improved the et and twsc simulations compared with the traditional model calibration according to the water balance equation q is regarded as the difference between p and et twsc see eq 4 constraining model parameterizations against q alone allows hydrological models to reproduce the sum of et and twsc well but leaves a large degree of freedom in adjusting the ratio between et and twsc bai et al 2016a rakovec et al 2016a the freedom degree of hydrological models if not constrained properly can result in poor model performances for et and twsc simulations yassin et al 2017 several studies also found that grace data can be used to constrain model parameterizations and improve the estimates of hydrological variables leading to better hydrological simulations zaitchik et al 2008 lo et al 2010 sun et al 2012 kumar et al 2016 rakovec et al 2016a cai et al 2017 tangdamrongsub et al 2017 the better hydrological simulations are crucial for improving our understanding of hydrological responses to environmental changes predicting the future water availability and extending the applications of hydrological models beyond the streamflow simulations in addition the results showed that calibration of hydrological models using grace data alone cannot improve the runoff simulations compared with the simple parameter estimates see section 4 3 the primary reason could be that tws in hydrological models is a state variable while the runoff is an output variable model calibration using grace data alone improved the parameterization associated with state variables such as soil moisture storage or ground water storage but did not improve the parameterization associated with runoff generation and or routing streamflow observations are still important for model calibration when expecting to obtain accurate streamflow simulations 5 2 uncertainty and research prospects there are several uncertainties in the evaluation results first et benchmark values derived from the water balance approach is a potential source of uncertainty in the water balance equation eq 4 et is calculated as the residual of precipitation p runoff q and twsc the grace derived twsc data may have some degree of uncertainty though bias correlation and downscaling approach were carried out for grace data second the evaluation results are obtained from two parsimonious models and there might be differences if future researches are going to perform similar studies with more physically based models the hydrological models used in this study do not simulate anthropogenic influences and are only suitable for simulating natural hydrological processes they may not well represent the complex hydrological processes under changing environment cai et al 2016 clark et al 2016 yang et al 2017a for example the two models do not consider the hydrological effects of vegetation and thus are incapable to describe the impacts of vegetation changes on hydrological simulations third the spatial scale mismatch between the et flux measurements and grid based simulations may also affect the et evaluation results in this study et measurements from the flux tower are used to evaluate et simulations in the grid cell where the flux tower is located the flux tower can provide reliable et measurements within a spatial scale of hundreds of square meters wang and dickinson 2012 beyond this spatial scale e g the basic model computation unit 5 km 5 km per grid cell used in this study et measurements may not well represent the realistic et within the grid cell although these uncertainties exist incorporating grace data into the parameterization of hydrological models provides a promising way to achieve better hydrological simulations currently grace satellites have operated three times as long as originally planned famiglietti and rodell 2013 the next generation of the grace mission i e grace follow on grace fo is scheduled for launch in 2018 mccabe et al 2017 grace fo will be equipped with more advanced sensors than its predecessor and should enable continued collection of high quality of twsc data in addition more data sources will be available with advances in remote sensing and data assimilation technologies jarihani et al 2015a miao et al 2015 lettenmaier 2017 mccabe et al 2017 therefore including multiple data sources to constrain the parameterization of hydrological models would be a useful practice to improve model performances 6 conclusion the traditional calibration scheme of hydrological model focuses on the accuracy of runoff simulations i e single objective calibration with less scrutiny on the simulations of other hydrological variables to improve hydrological modeling a multi objective calibration scheme was constructed by incorporating grace derived twsc data into the model calibration along with the runoff observations the multi objective calibration scheme was compared with the traditional calibration scheme in terms of the model performances for runoff twsc and et simulations results indicated that the multi objective calibration scheme improved the twsc and et simulations and slightly degraded the runoff simulations than the traditional calibration scheme which leads to a more realistic partitioning of precipitation into runoff et and twsc the improvement magnitudes of the twsc and et simulation mainly depended on climatic conditions of a catchment the relatively dry catchments benefitted more from the multi objective calibration than the relatively wet catchments in addition the accurate runoff simulations cannot be achieved in ungauged catchments when only using the grace data to calibrate

7494,hydrological model parameters are typically calibrated by observed streamflow data this calibration strategy is questioned when the simulated hydrological variables of interest are not limited to streamflow well performed streamflow simulations do not guarantee the reliable reproduction of other hydrological variables one of the reasons is that hydrological model parameters are not reasonably identified the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived total water storage change twsc data provide an opportunity to constrain hydrological model parameterizations in combination with streamflow observations in this study a multi objective calibration scheme based on grace derived twsc and streamflow observations was compared with the traditional single objective calibration scheme based on only streamflow simulations two hydrological models were employed on 22 catchments in china with different climatic conditions the model evaluations were performed using observed streamflows grace derived twsc and actual evapotranspiration et estimates from flux towers and from the water balance approach results showed that the multi objective calibration scheme provided more reliable twsc and et simulations without significant deterioration in the accuracy of streamflow simulations than the single objective calibration the improvement in twsc and et simulations was more significant in relatively dry catchments than in relatively wet catchments in addition hydrological models calibrated using grace derived twsc data alone cannot obtain accurate runoff simulations in ungauged catchments this study highlights the importance of including additional constraints in addition to streamflow observations to improve performances of hydrological models keywords grace hydrological model parameterization hydrological simulations 1 introduction the water cycle is a highly complex dynamic process involving energy exchange and material transfer between the land surface and the atmosphere miao et al 2016 trancoso et al 2016 as simplified representations of complex hydrological processes hydrological models are fundamental tools for simulating the stores and fluxes of water near land surfaces and predicting future water availability famiglietti and rodell 2013 the simplified representations in hydrological models inevitably cause some hydrological processes to be improperly represented or even ignored beven 1989 clark et al 2015 in addition to the uncertainties in process representations hydrological models suffer from uncertainties in model structures and forcing data those uncertainties in hydrological models indicate that parameter calibration is necessary to achieve reliable hydrological modeling gupta et al 1998 duan et al 2006 hydrological models are typically calibrated against streamflow observations which are the most common and readily available hydrological observations globally in addition streamflow observations reflect the integrated responses of catchment hydrological systems to climate landscape and anthropogenic disturbances güntner 2008 zaitchik et al 2010 rakovec et al 2016a therefore streamflow data have long been used as the observations to calibrate hydrological models duan et al 2006 werth et al 2009 liu et al 2017 in recent years applications of hydrological models have been greatly extended in addition to streamflow simulations hydrological models were also used to simulate snow cover soil moisture actual evapotranspiration et and groundwater level gilfedder et al 2012 cai et al 2014a liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b chen et al 2017 for those practices hydrological models are required to produce reasonable estimates of hydrological variables other than streamflow in these cases calibration of hydrological models using streamflow data alone is likely insufficient because model parameters can be falsely adjusted to maximize the streamflow simulation performances without considering the simulation accuracy of other hydrological variables beven and freer 2001 clark et al 2016 guo et al 2017 several studies have found that well performed streamflow simulations do not warrant reliable reproductions of other hydrological variables minville et al 2014 bai et al 2016a girotto et al 2016 rakovec et al 2016b for example a hydrological model that produces an overestimation of et could be compensated for by an underestimation of soil moisture resulting in accurate streamflow simulations rakovec et al 2016b concluded that calibration of hydrological models using streamflow data alone does not guarantee reasonable estimates of et soil moisture and twsc similar results have also been found by parajka and blöschl 2008 werth et al 2009 lo et al 2010 minville et al 2014 and zhuo and han 2016 simulations of hydrological variables other than runoff based on hydrological models are commonly improved in two ways one way is improving the process representations of hydrological models by making better use of existing hydrological theory zhang et al 2008 clark et al 2016 kim and mohanty 2016 trancoso et al 2017 this can be achieved by 1 replacing the empirical equations in hydrological models with physically based ones e g zhang et al 2008 and 2 including hydrological processes which are ignored in current models e g kim and mohanty 2016 another way is calibrating hydrological models with data complementary to streamflow observations güntner 2008 lee et al 2011 kumar et al 2016 rakovec et al 2016a chen et al 2017 the complementary data for multi objective calibration include et soil moisture groundwater level and twsc such complementary data were mainly obtained from two sources ground based observations and remotely sensed retrievals compared to the ground based observations remotely sensed data are generally more easily accessible and have higher spatial and temporal resolutions though they are often not direct measurements of the hydrological variables of interest van dijk and renzullo 2011 thus remotely sensed data are widely used for calibration of hydrological models along with streamflow observations the grace satellites provide the unprecedented opportunity to quantify spatial temporal variations of the earth s surface mass which largely reflect changes in total water storage on the surface through groundwater swenson et al 2003 tapley et al 2004 although grace data have shortcomings in spatial resolution 300 km and temporal resolution monthly they offer candidate complementary data to better constrain parameterizations of hydrological models in conjunction with streamflow observations table 1 presents a summary of relevant literature including grace data for model parameterization previous studies have reached inconsistent conclusions regarding the effects on streamflow simulations from including grace data for model calibration for example zaitchik et al 2008 werth et al 2009 kumar et al 2016 and chen et al 2017 found positive impacts whereas negative impacts were reported by livneh and lettenmaier 2012 rakovec et al 2016a and tangdamrongsub et al 2017 the objective of this study is to test whether incorporating grace derived twsc data during model parameterizations can improve hydrological model performances to accomplish this purpose the multi objective calibration scheme using streamflow observations and grace data was compared with the traditional single objective calibration scheme using streamflow observations alone two monthly water balance models were employed to reduce the dependence of simulation results on single model behavior section 2 the two hydrological models were applied on 22 basins in china with different climatic conditions section 3 the models were evaluated against the observed streamflow grace derived twsc and et estimates from the water balance approach and from two flux towers section 4 we also investigated the potentials of using grace data alone for streamflow predictions in ungauged basins finally we compared our findings with other relevant research and discussed the uncertainties in the evaluation results section 5 the paper ends with conclusion in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 hydrological models in this study two lumped monthly hydrological models namely the abcd model thomas 1981 and the wm model wang and zhang 2005 were used with the expectation of obtaining robust results the main reason for selecting the two models was that they have relative low complexities and provide clear physical descriptions of the dominant hydrological processes in addition both models explicitly simulate total water storage tws and the model outputs share the same temporal resolution with the grace data this facilitates the simulated water storage changes directly comparable with grace derived twsc data the abcd model has been successfully applied to a large number of basins with different hydro meteorological conditions alley 1984 martinez and gupta 2010 steinschneider et al 2012 the model has four parameters and consists of four routines et water storage quick runoff and base flow two cascaded storage layers are used in the abcd model the upper layer represents soil water storage and the lower layer represents groundwater storage detailed descriptions of the model formulation can be found in fernandez et al 2000 and martinez and gupta 2010 the model structure of the wm model is quite different from that of the abcd model the wm model possesses lower complexity and fewer free parameters three than the abcd model four to maintain model parsimony the wm model uses a series of linear functions to simulate et and runoff a single water storage unit is used in the wm model to partition precipitation into et residual water storage and runoff the et estimates in the wm model are treated as the function of potential evapotranspiration and relative water storage the two hydrological models were forced using the same monthly inputs and tested over the same time periods detailed information regarding the model structures and key equations of the two hydrological models can be found in fig 1 descriptions of model parameters and variables are listed in table 2 2 2 parameter calibration schemes in this study two calibration cases were examined to test whether incorporating grace data into the parameter calibration of hydrological models can improve model performances the first calibration case involved calibration with runoff data alone hereafter referred to as the case q in the second calibration case hydrological models were calibrated using both runoff and grace data hereafter referred to as the case q twsc unlike the case q the case q twsc is a multi objective optimization involving two conflicting objective functions to be optimized simultaneously gupta et al 1998 solving the multi objective optimization problem is not as straightforward as solving the single objective one it requires the different and contradictory objectives to be optimized simultaneously gill et al 2006 yang et al 2016 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is a commonly used multi objective optimization approach srinivas and deb 1994 deb et al 2002 this algorithm solves the multi objective optimization problems using the concept of evolutionary parameter variation and produces a number of solution candidates werth et al 2009 in this study the optimal solutions were selected based on the principle of shortest distances between each candidate solution and ideal solution an ideal solution denotes a perfect fit between observations and simulations for both objectives see fig 2 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was utilized as the objective function which is a modified version of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kge reweights three independent statistical criteria i e linear correlation γ relative variability α and bias ratio β used in the nse and integrates them into a single multi objective criterion this modification avoids the limitation of nse which overemphasizes the match of high flows and sacrifices the match of low flows pechlivanidis et al 2010 guse et al 2017 the kge is expressed as 1 kge 1 1 γ 2 1 α 2 1 β 2 with α σ s σ o and β μ s μ o where μs and μo are the averages for the simulations and observations respectively and σs and σo are the standard deviations for the simulations and observations respectively during model evaluations the kge is typically used as a comprehensive assessment criterion to measure the agreement between observed and simulated values bai et al 2016b rakovec et al 2016b the kge ranges from negative infinity to 1 and kge 1 indicates a perfect agreement between observed and simulated values gupta et al 2009 the classical split sample test scheme klemeš 1986 was employed for model calibration and validation for each catchment the available monthly data from april 2002 to december 2012 were split into two parts of similar lengths and both were used for model calibration and validation by reversing calibration and validation the first year of each part of data was used for model warm up to reduce the impact of initial values on the model calibration 2 3 model assessment criteria in addition to the kge two other statistics were also used to assess the model performances the coefficient of determination r 2 and the percent bias pbias the r 2 represents how much variation in the observations can be explained by the simulations krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 yang et al 2017b the pbias indicates the average tendency of the simulated values to be larger or smaller than the observations gupta et al 1999 with pbias 0 0 being optimal the r 2 is expressed as 2 r 2 i 1 n y obs i y obs y sim i y sim i 1 n y sim i y sim 2 i 1 n y obs i y obs 2 2 the pbias is expressed as 3 pbias i 1 n y obs i y sim i i 1 n y obs i 100 where y sim and y obs are the simulated and observed values respectively y sim and y obs are the average simulated and observed values respectively and n is the total number of months of the data time series 3 study area and data used 3 1 study area the test catchments were selected based on the following three principles first catchments with the drainage areas 10 000 km2 were excluded because their drainage areas are less than a grid cell area of the grace data one degree 10 000 km2 second snow dominated catchments were not selected because the hydrological models used in this study have no snowmelt modules see section 3 1 below third the selected catchments must be relatively unimpaired catchments that are not subject to large impacts of human activities on the river discharge this was necessary because the hydrological models used in this study only simulated natural hydrological processes through catchment screening over china 22 catchments were used in this study most of which are located in the yellow river and yangtze river basins fig 3 the catchments cover a wide range of hydro meteorological conditions and landscape characteristics according to the statistics from 1960 to 2012 the annual precipitation varies between 394 and 1852 mm year aridity index ranges from 0 52 to 2 25 and drainage area from 10 009 to 156 736 km2 see table 3 note that the aridity index used here is defined as the ratio of average annual potential evaporation pet to precipitation p unep 1992 monthly runoff and meteorological data from 2002 to 2012 are available for each catchment the runoff data were provided by the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china the meteorological data were provided by the china meteorological administration including precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration http data cma cn the precipitation data were extracted from a 0 5 degree resolution grid dataset covering the whole of china which was generated by spatial interpolation from 2472 meteorological stations fig 3 li et al 2014 shen and xiong 2016 the other meteorological data were mainly used to calculate pet based on the physically based penman equation penman 1948 donohue et al 2010 the basin average pet data were produced using kriging interpolation based on the available meteorological stations in and around each catchment 3 2 model evaluation data the model evaluations were conducted using the observed runoff data grace derived twsc and et estimates from flux towers and from the water balance approach the latest release of grace data rl05 provided by the university of texas center for space research csr were used in this study http www2 csr utexas edu grace the dataset cover the period from april 2002 to december 2012 with the spatial resolution of 1 0 1 0 although the grace data offer an opportunity to constrain the water balance equation the coarse spatial resolution impedes their applications in small catchments longuevergne et al 2010 long et al 2015 to obtain more reliable twsc estimates the grace data were corrected by restoring signal losses and downscaling grace data to finer resolution signal losses stemming from the sampling and post processing of grace data are among the sources of error in grace data swenson et al 2003 long et al 2015 and can be corrected by scaling factor approach save et al 2016 long et al 2017 the scaling factor approach utilizes the tws output from land surface models lsms to generate scaling factors for correcting the errors in grace data long et al 2017 in this study the global scaling factors were generated based on a lsm in global land data assimilation system gldas i e variable infiltration capacity vic long et al 2015 in addition we employed a model based downscaling approach proposed by wan et al 2015 to obtain a finer resolution 0 25 0 25 time series of twsc over the test catchments the approach combines the advantages of grace data and lsm in twsc estimates specifically the grace based twsc data are reliable when the area of interest is larger than the grace footprint 4 0 4 0 degree longuevergne et al 2010 long et al 2015 lsm can provide better spatial pattern of twsc than grace data while values of lsm simulated twsc have uncertainties in this study a 0 25 degree dataset of hydrological variables including tws estimates simulated by the variable infiltration capacity vic model over china were employed to downscale grace data this dataset adopted high density meteorological observations as forcing data and multi gauge runoff observations for model calibration zhang et al 2014 the vic simulated 0 25 degree twsc was first aggregated to 4 0 degree to match the 4 0 degree grace grid data the 4 0 degree twsc data were then downscaled to 0 25 degree this downscaling approach ensures that the sum of the downscaled twsc value in each 4 0 degree grid cell is equal to the corresponding 4 0 degree grace twsc value the original and downscaled trends of the grace derived twsc during the period 2003 2012 were shown in fig 4 the downscaled grace data presented similar spatial patterns but at a finer resolution than the original grace data detailed descriptions of downscaling the grace data are presented in wan et al 2015 the et fluxes obtained from the hydrological models were evaluated against the et estimates from two flux towers fig 3 and from the water balance approach the et estimates from two flux stations changwu and qianyanzhou were provided by the chinese flux observation and research network http www chinaflux org yu et al 2006 the land use around the changwu gauging station hereafter cw station is dominated by farmland and apple orchard brutsaert et al 2017 and the land use around the qianyanzhou gauging station hereafter qyz station is dominated by mixed evergreen coniferous forests tang et al 2016 the flux data cover the period 2004 2007 for the cw station and 2003 2005 for the qyz station to make the simulated and measured et comparable the grid based modeling 0 05 0 05 was performed in the catchments where the flux stations are located with the aim of producing spatially variable et outputs the et evaluations for hydrological models are typically performed against eddy covariance flux measurements cai et al 2014b long et al 2014 however such measurements can only reflect the local et conditions and flux stations are very sparse globally the ability of grace satellites to observe water storage changes over the entire river basin allows et to be evaluated in a water balance framework rodell et al 2004 zeng et al 2012 famiglietti and rodell 2013 wan et al 2015 in this study the water balance based et estimates were also used as benchmark values for basin scale et evaluations the water balance approach calculates the basin scale et as 4 et p q twsc where p is basin average precipitation mm month q is net runoff depth mm month and twsc is the monthly water storage changes derived from grace satellites mm month the twsc cannot be neglected on the monthly time scale especially for those catchments with relatively low et values zeng et al 2012 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a one disadvantage of the water balance approach is that it only provides the basin average et fluxes and cannot estimate the spatial distribution of et for a catchment rodell et al 2004 4 results 4 1 model evaluations simulation results of runoff twsc and et for the two calibration cases i e the case q and the case q twsc were compared in this section for runoff simulations the two hydrological models successfully simulated the monthly runoff over the test catchments with a median kge exceeding 0 80 and a median r 2 exceeding 0 82 fig 5 in both calibration cases the runoff simulation accuracy in the calibration period is greater than that in the validation period given that the model performances in the validation period better reflects the actual predictive abilities of hydrological models hereafter we only compare model performances in the validation period for the two calibration cases overall hydrological models calibrated with the two cases had similar runoff simulation accuracy the differences in the median kge values of the two cases were 0 02 from 0 84 to 0 82 for the abcd model and 0 01 from 0 85 to 0 84 for the wm model r2 and pbias also exhibited negligible differences between the two cases fig 5 the results indicate that the calibrated parameters from the case q and the case q twsc are equally good for runoff simulations over the test catchments for twsc simulations the two hydrological models produced consistent results and the case q twsc significantly outperformed the case q the median kge increased by 0 64 from 0 22 to 0 42 for the abcd model and 0 49 from 0 12 to 0 37 for the wm model the median r2 increased by 0 12 from 0 41 to 0 53 and 0 14 from 0 34 to 0 48 and the median pbias decreased by 34 from 48 to 14 and 37 from 69 to 32 for the two models respectively fig 6 the et simulations for the two calibration cases were compared with the et benchmark values from the water balance approach fig 7 the et simulations from the case q twsc exhibited better performance than that from the case q for the abcd model the median kge increased from 0 31 to 0 44 the median r2 increased from 0 45 to 0 57 and the median pbias decreased from 33 to 15 similar performance statistics were also found for the wm model in addition the et simulations for the two cases were compared with the et measurements at two flux stations fig 8 compared with the case q significant improvements in et simulations were achieved for the case q twsc at both flux stations the differences in median kge at the cw station between the two cases were 0 05 from 0 85 to 0 80 for the abcd model and 0 07 from 0 84 to 0 77 for the wm model r2 and pbias from the case q twsc also exhibited large improvement compared with that from the case q at the qyz station significant improvement in et simulations was also found the results further confirm that et estimates can be improved by incorporating grace derived twsc data into model calibration 4 2 catchment performance differences when incorporating grace data into model calibration the relationships between catchment characteristics and model performance differences were analyzed in this study two independent catchment characteristics were considered catchment area and aridity index the catchment area is an important physical characteristic of a catchment while the aridity index reflects the climatic condition of a catchment the relatively dry catchments generally have relatively large aridity indices the kge differences between the two cases i e kgeq twsc kgeq were used to represent the magnitudes of improvement deterioration when incorporating grace data into model calibration the values of kgeq twsc kgeq for all three variables runoff twsc and et against the normalized area index and aridity index were shown in fig 9 the values of kgeq twsc kgeq for all three variables were not significantly correlated with the catchment area based on a t test analysis r 2 0 005 p 05 fig 9a c however a significant positive correlation between the aridity index and the values of kgeq twsc kgeq can be found for the twsc r 2 0 40 p 01 and et r 2 0 38 p 01 simulations fig 9d f this implies that the improvement magnitudes of twsc and et increased toward the relatively dry catchments however for the runoff simulations the kgeq twsc kgeq values appeared to be independent of the aridity index r 2 0 09 p 05 indicating that there were no significant differences of runoff simulation improvements under different climatic conditions 4 3 calibration of hydrological models using grace data alone some basins in the world are ungauged or poorly gauged runoff simulations in ungauged catchments have long been a challenge for hydrologists sivapalan et al 2003 hrachowitz et al 2013 jarihani et al 2015b one of the difficulties is the lack of observations for hydrological model calibrations sivapalan 2003 mcintyre et al 2004 the grace satellites provide the potential for calibrating hydrological models in ungauged basins in this study the potential was tested by comparing four different parameterization experiments i model parameters were calibrated using observed runoff data alone denoted sq hereafter ii model parameters were calibrated using grace derived twsc data alone denoted stwsc hereafter iii model parameters were set to random values within the ranges of parameters denoted sr hereafter and iv model parameters were set to the averages of the upper and lower limits of parameters denoted sm hereafter model performances for the runoff simulations using the four parameterization experiments were shown in fig 10 sq resulted in the best performances with the median kge being 0 42 0 46 larger than that of other three parameterization experiments the other three parameterization experiments have similar performances for runoff simulations for example in terms of the median kge values the differences between the stwsc sr and sm were 0 06 for the abcd model and 0 10 for the wm model therefore the calibration of hydrological models using grace data alone cannot obtain accurate runoff simulations in ungauged catchments 5 discussion 5 1 model evaluations the streamflow records have long been used as the only observations to calibrate hydrological models werth et al 2009 this study tested whether including grace data into model calibration can improve hydrological simulations than the traditional model calibration results indicated that including grace data into model calibration produced similar runoff simulations to the traditional model calibration the conclusion is in line with the findings of the previous studies by livneh and lettenmaier 2012 rakovec et al 2016a and tangdamrongsub et al 2017 one possible reason is the non uniqueness of optimal parameters i e equifinality beven 1993 beven and freer 2001 savenije 2001 the model parameters identified from the two calibration cases were equally effective in reproducing observed runoff the evaluation results also showed that including grace data into calibration significantly improved the et and twsc simulations compared with the traditional model calibration according to the water balance equation q is regarded as the difference between p and et twsc see eq 4 constraining model parameterizations against q alone allows hydrological models to reproduce the sum of et and twsc well but leaves a large degree of freedom in adjusting the ratio between et and twsc bai et al 2016a rakovec et al 2016a the freedom degree of hydrological models if not constrained properly can result in poor model performances for et and twsc simulations yassin et al 2017 several studies also found that grace data can be used to constrain model parameterizations and improve the estimates of hydrological variables leading to better hydrological simulations zaitchik et al 2008 lo et al 2010 sun et al 2012 kumar et al 2016 rakovec et al 2016a cai et al 2017 tangdamrongsub et al 2017 the better hydrological simulations are crucial for improving our understanding of hydrological responses to environmental changes predicting the future water availability and extending the applications of hydrological models beyond the streamflow simulations in addition the results showed that calibration of hydrological models using grace data alone cannot improve the runoff simulations compared with the simple parameter estimates see section 4 3 the primary reason could be that tws in hydrological models is a state variable while the runoff is an output variable model calibration using grace data alone improved the parameterization associated with state variables such as soil moisture storage or ground water storage but did not improve the parameterization associated with runoff generation and or routing streamflow observations are still important for model calibration when expecting to obtain accurate streamflow simulations 5 2 uncertainty and research prospects there are several uncertainties in the evaluation results first et benchmark values derived from the water balance approach is a potential source of uncertainty in the water balance equation eq 4 et is calculated as the residual of precipitation p runoff q and twsc the grace derived twsc data may have some degree of uncertainty though bias correlation and downscaling approach were carried out for grace data second the evaluation results are obtained from two parsimonious models and there might be differences if future researches are going to perform similar studies with more physically based models the hydrological models used in this study do not simulate anthropogenic influences and are only suitable for simulating natural hydrological processes they may not well represent the complex hydrological processes under changing environment cai et al 2016 clark et al 2016 yang et al 2017a for example the two models do not consider the hydrological effects of vegetation and thus are incapable to describe the impacts of vegetation changes on hydrological simulations third the spatial scale mismatch between the et flux measurements and grid based simulations may also affect the et evaluation results in this study et measurements from the flux tower are used to evaluate et simulations in the grid cell where the flux tower is located the flux tower can provide reliable et measurements within a spatial scale of hundreds of square meters wang and dickinson 2012 beyond this spatial scale e g the basic model computation unit 5 km 5 km per grid cell used in this study et measurements may not well represent the realistic et within the grid cell although these uncertainties exist incorporating grace data into the parameterization of hydrological models provides a promising way to achieve better hydrological simulations currently grace satellites have operated three times as long as originally planned famiglietti and rodell 2013 the next generation of the grace mission i e grace follow on grace fo is scheduled for launch in 2018 mccabe et al 2017 grace fo will be equipped with more advanced sensors than its predecessor and should enable continued collection of high quality of twsc data in addition more data sources will be available with advances in remote sensing and data assimilation technologies jarihani et al 2015a miao et al 2015 lettenmaier 2017 mccabe et al 2017 therefore including multiple data sources to constrain the parameterization of hydrological models would be a useful practice to improve model performances 6 conclusion the traditional calibration scheme of hydrological model focuses on the accuracy of runoff simulations i e single objective calibration with less scrutiny on the simulations of other hydrological variables to improve hydrological modeling a multi objective calibration scheme was constructed by incorporating grace derived twsc data into the model calibration along with the runoff observations the multi objective calibration scheme was compared with the traditional calibration scheme in terms of the model performances for runoff twsc and et simulations results indicated that the multi objective calibration scheme improved the twsc and et simulations and slightly degraded the runoff simulations than the traditional calibration scheme which leads to a more realistic partitioning of precipitation into runoff et and twsc the improvement magnitudes of the twsc and et simulation mainly depended on climatic conditions of a catchment the relatively dry catchments benefitted more from the multi objective calibration than the relatively wet catchments in addition the accurate runoff simulations cannot be achieved in ungauged catchments when only using the grace data to calibrate
