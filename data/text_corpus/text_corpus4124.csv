20620,this paper examines the burst capacity of reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtps under the effect of internal pressure used the theory of the three dimensional 3d thick walled cylinder combined the 3d hashin failure criterion with the theory of the evolution of damage in composite materials considered the nonlinear stress strain relationship of materials and introduced changes in the winding angle caused by deformation to formulate a analytical model for the progressive failure analysis of rtps the model was used to examine the failure sequence and burst capacity of the rtps and analytical results agree well with the experimental ones the results show that the ply number of the reinforced layer had a more significant effect on the burst capacity of the rtps than the winding angle their burst capacity first increased and then decreased with increasing winding angle when the winding angle was 60 the burst pressure reached its peak with an increase in the ply number of the reinforced layers the burst pressure of the rtps increased nonlinearly and its rate of growth gradually decreased once a certain ply number in the reinforced layer had been reached interlaminar separation was more likely to occur in the rtps before they burst keywords reinforced thermoplastic pipes burst capacity 3d thick walled cylinder theory failure sequence 1 introduction as one of the four major offshore oil and gas accumulation centers in the world the south china sea is rich in oil and gas resources but 70 of them are located in deep water with the development of offshore oil and gas exploitation from shallow to deep the technical limitations in drilling and oil and gas transportation become more and more prominent marine riser is the key equipment of offshore oil and gas transportation development system for deep sea projects marine riser is one of the vulnerable facilities wang et al 2020 lou et al 2016 in the harsh marine environment the pipeline needs to operation safely and reliably which puts forward strict requirements for the structural performance of the pipeline compared with the traditional steel pipes used in offshore oil development composite flexible pipes have more advantages in corrosion weight installation insulation and maintenance cost kaddour et al 2003 bai et al 2015 with further advancements in fiber and thermoplastic materials reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtps have lately been used in deep water oil and gas development liu and wang 2019 lou et al 2020 the capacity of composite pipes to bear internal pressure load is usually called pressure capacity which is a primary concern in the design process of composite pipes it is necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of the pipeline while controlling the cost kuang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 studied the pressure capacity of rtps by the finite element analysis and experimental and illustrated that the failure mode of rtps under internal pressure was the break of glass fiber belt in structural layer xing et al 2015 studied the deformation and stress of multi angle wound composite pipe on the basis of considering the combined load of axial load and internal and external pressure li et al 2016 conducted experimental research on the mechanical properties of rtps with different internal pressures to obtain the burst pressure bai et al 2011 2012 2014 studied the burst capacity of rtps under internal pressure through different methods due to the fact that the nonlinear behavior of polyethylene is not taken into account the calculated results of the model have significant errors compared with the experimental results kuang et al 2017 rafiee and ali 2015 predicted the failure pressure of glass fiber reinforced polyester grp pipes under internal pressure by using finite element model and verified the accuracy of the conclusion by experiments due to the anisotropy of composite materials and a current limitation research theory it is still difficult to accurately predict the progressive failure of rtps many researchers have made achievements in the field of failure analysis over past decades and these literatures can be used for reference diniz et al 2011 used tsai hill criterion and the hoffman criterion in a numerical simulation to determine the failure pressure of the first layer of composite pipes as burst pressure chen et al 2017 2018 and he et al 2019 conducted the failure analysis on composite sheets by numerical simulation and the results obtained by hashin failure criterion had a good agreement with experimental results rafiee 2013 2016 carried out a number of experimental analyses of glass fiber wound tubes of different diameters 300 500 600 700 800 900 and 1000 mm and compared them with an established progressive failure model to verify the effectiveness of their results yao et al 2019 developed a nonlinear stiffness degradation model to investigate the low velocity impact behavior of fiber composite laminates under multiple impacts with the same total energy alshahrani et al 2016 simulated the response of glass fiber reinforced epoxy pipes under low velocity impact loads by ansys it showed that delamination and matrix crack were main damage mode and the results agreed well with experimental results prevalent work on the pressure capacity of rtps has mostly used the laminated plate theory combined with the finite element model and experimental approaches and have ignored the nonlinearity and interlaminar stress of the material the results of such calculations thus have low accuracy kuang et al 2017 furthermore the failure criterion employed cannot be used to simulate the process of evolution of damage to composite materials in this paper the burst capacity of rtps under the effect of internal pressure is analyzed by considering the nonlinear stress strain relationship of thermoplastic materials and interlaminar stress based on 3d thick walled cylinder theory a mechanical model of rtps is constructed by considering changes in the winding angle caused by deformation combined with the 3d hashin failure criterion and the theory of the evolution of damage in composite materials a model for the progressive failure analysis of rtps is established to analyze their failure sequence and burst capacity the simulated burst pressure of analytical model fitted well with the experimental result the model was then used to analyze the mechanism of influence of the winding angle and the ply number of the reinforced layer on the burst capacity of rtps 2 numerical model the rtps studied in this paper is a kind of bonded non metallic flexible pipes its cross section structure is divided into four layers from the inside to the outside which are the inner hdpe liner the reinforced layer the functional units and the outer protective layer the reinforced layers of rtps are composed of hdpe and glass fibers the layers are bonded together by heating fusion to form a fully bonded composite

plate the failure factor r i i ft fc mt mc s td and cd reflects the damage condition the damage occurs once the failure factor is greater than one the degradation of materials due to damage is a gradual process as shown in fig 3 σ eq and δ eq are the equivalent stress and equivalent strain of the material respectively when material stress reaches the ultimate strength σ0 eq the material does not immediately fail but its stiffness degrades the specific form of degradation depends on the value of α α 0 implies linear degradation α 1 2 3 n corresponds to exponential degradation and α is degradation that causes immediate damage the specific form of degradation in the performance related parameters used in this paper refers to the research results of camanho and matthews 1999 and tan and perez 1993 the degraded stiffnesses can be obtained as follows tan and perez 1993 27 e 11 d 1 e 11 e 22 d 2 e 22 g 12 d 6 g 12 where e 11 e 22 and g 12 are the effective damaged lamina stiffnesses and e 11 e 22 and g 12 are the undamaged lamina stiffnesses d 1 d 2 and d 6 are the internal state variables representing the damaged state of the lamina d 1 is the stiffness degradation factor associated with fiber breakage d 2 and d 6 are the stiffness degradation factors perpendicular to the fiber direction and shear component respectively due to matrix cracking the parameter d 1 varies from 0 001 to 0 15 and d 2 and d 6 range from 0 01 to 0 30 tan and perez 1993 the stiffness degradation parameters proposed by camanho and matthews 1999 are based on the approach of tan and perez 1993 as shown in table 1 using them the specific form of degradation in the performance related parameters used in this paper is as shown in table 2 the data in table 2 represent the stiffness reduction coefficient scr of the material the performance related parameter of the material is the product of its initial performance and the scr when the scr is one this indicates that the performance parameter of the material is constant 2 3 numerical analysis procedure a computer code was written in matlab to reveal the damage mechanism of rtps under internal pressure the loading process is simulated using successive iterations and the flowchart fig 4 shows the details of the iterative calculation the necessary parameters should be set in advance including the winding angles of each layer geometric parameters material parameters and ultimate load p load the iteration begins with a given initial load p based on the stress state the variation in the winding angle of each layer is obtained and the elastic plastic state of the material is determined based on the strain these parameters are used for the next iteration if p p load p p p i update the winding angle and material parameters and continue the iterative calculation if p p load the program ends and the output stress and strain fields are obtained under the ultimate load p load 3 experiments in order to further verify the accuracy of the numerical analysis results sample pipes with different ply numbers were selected for hydraulic burst tests the winding angles were 55 55 55 for laminates which means that fibers in one layer were in clockwise direction and those in the adjacent layer were in anti clockwise direction the geometric parameters and experimental data of the sample pipes are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively figs 5 and 6 show the experimental apparatus which featured a 120 mpa bursting test machine pipe fixing device bursting protection device data acquisition instrument monitor joint treatment device and three sample tubes used in the test at six eight 10 and 12 layered fiber wound rtps the sample pipe after burst failure is shown in fig 7 a large amount of fluid leaked into the pipe and failure occurred in its middle far from the joint at both ends this indicates that the experimental results were reasonable to intuitively analyze the forms of bursting failure the sections of six eight 10 and 12 layered pipes were compared and analyzed as shown in fig 8 it shows that the angle of fracture at failure was 55 in terms of failure form the fiber fracture and matrix cracking of the reinforced layer occurred when the number of wound layers was 12 the reinforced layer exhibited prominent interlayer separation on the inner side of the pipeline table 5 shows the results of the burst pressure test it is clear that with an increase in the number of wound layers the burst pressure did not increase linearly and the growth rate gradually slowed down when the number of reinforced layers was small such as increased from six to eight layers the burst pressure increased by 9 74 mpa with an increase in the number of reinforced layers such as from 10 to 12 layers the burst pressure increases by 7 46 mpa 4 numerical analysis 4 1 comparison between theoretical model and experimental results calculations were performed according to the established model for the mechanical analysis of the progressive failure of rtps the results were then compared with those of the experiment the parameters of the rtps used in the analytical model were consistent with the experimental parameters and parameters of the ultimate strength of the reinforced layer are shown in table 6 the nonlinear stress strain relationship of the material used in the rtps studied in this comparison was shown in fig 9 the secant modulus was used to characterize the properties of the elastoplastic materials in each iteration step the elastic modulus of the hdpe is updated based on the strain and a similar approach has been used in the open literatures to study the material nonlinearity of hdpe bai et al 2014 kuang et al 2015a 2015b fig 10 and the parameters listed in table 6 were determined experimentally by weihai nacheon pipeline co ltd the processes of progressive failure of six eight 10 and 12 layered fiber wound rtps were analyzed the failure scenario of the reinforced layer was characterized by the 3d hashin failure coefficient and failure of the lining layer and the outer protective layer was represented by strain failure occurred when the failure coefficient was greater than one and strain was greater than 0 077 taking the calculation results of six layered rtps as an example the progressive failure process is shown in fig 10 fig 10 shows the load response curve of the six layered rtps when internal pressure was zero each failure coefficient was zero as well and strain on the inner liner and protective layers was zero with a gradual increase in the internal pressure load the failure coefficient and strain of the inner liner and protective layers increased correspondingly when the internal pressure load was 10 15 mpa cracking occurred first in the matrix of each reinforced layer almost simultaneously the stiffness of the reinforced layer degraded and various failure coefficients and strain values increased rapidly when the internal pressure load reached 29 9 mpa the strain of the inner liner reached its limit and began to fracture when the internal pressure load was 37 24 mpa the fiber in the innermost layer of the reinforced layer exhibited tensile fracture and the stiffness of the reinforced layer further decreased this rapidly affected the outermost fiber when the internal pressure load was 37 26 mpa the outer protective layer reached the strain limit the inner liner reinforced layer and protective layer of the rtps were damaged and the pipeline failed completely according to the results the burst pressure of the six layered rtps was 37 26 mpa and at this time no stratification of the reinforced layer had occurred the eight 10 and 12 layered rtps were calculated according to the same method their failure sequence before bursting was almost identical to that of the six layered rtps except that the internal pressure for failure was slightly different as far as the eight layered rtps are concerned when the internal pressure load was 13 13 mpa the matrix of the reinforced layer cracked first when it was 33 47 mpa the strain of the inner liner reached its limit and began to fracture when the internal pressure load was 47 59 mpa the fiber of the reinforced layer began to break under tension leading to the ultimate strain of the protective layer and the complete failure of the rtps according to the results the burst pressure of the eight layered rtps was 47 61 mpa and there was no stratification of the reinforced layer according to the results the burst pressure of the 10 layered rtps was 57 67 mpa fig 11 shows the load response curve of the 12 layered rtps when the internal pressure load was 56 69 mpa the interlayer delamination occurred for the first time in the innermost part of the reinforced layer the burst pressure of 12 layered rtps was 66 38 mpa when the internal pressure load was 58 09 mpa clear interlayer separation occurred in the reinforced layer of the rtps thus verifying the accuracy of the progressive failure model proposed here for predicting the failure mode to verify the correctness of the model the predicted burst pressure and experimental value of the model were summarized and their relative errors were analyzed as shown in table 7 the predicted value of the model coincided with the experimental value and the maximum relative error was controlled to within 8 according to table 6 the transverse tensile strength of the reinforced layer is less than the longitudinal tensile strength when the internal pressure gradually increases the stress in each direction of the reinforced layer increases rapidly in the local coordinate system cracking occurred first in the matrix of each reinforced layer almost simultaneously leading to the stiffness degradation of the reinforced layer and the reduction of the burst capacity due to the small elongation at break of the fiber as the internal pressure continues to increase leading to tensile fracture of the fiber and further reduction of the stiffness of the reinforced layer when the internal pressure reached 56 69 mpa of 12 layered rtps the innermost interlayer stress of the reinforced layer exceeded the shear strength and the interlayer delamination occurred for the first time in the innermost part of the reinforced layer it is believed that with the increase of the ply number of reinforced layers the burst capacity increases and the interlayer separation between reinforced layers becomes more and more obvious 4 2 parametric study 4 2 1 winding angle the influence of the winding angle on the stress field in the rtps under internal pressure was analyzed in the local coordinate system and the global column coordinate system the model s geometric parameters and parameters of the material were the same as above the ply number of the reinforced layer was four and the internal pressure was 1 mpa fig 12 shows the influence of changes in the winding angle on the distribution of the stress field in the local coordinate system of the rtps when internal pressure was applied with an increase in the winding angle the longitudinal tensile stress of the fiber first increased rapidly and then decreased the trend of variation in tensile stress perpendicular to the direction of the fiber was opposite that in longitudinal tensile stress both reached their extreme values close to a winding angle of 55 with increasing winding angle the interlaminar stress increases but the growth rate gradually decreased and increases slowly between 60 and 80 the shear stress of the fiber matrix increased first and then decreased with an increase in the winding angle and reached the peak when the winding angle was 35 the influence of changes in the winding angle on the distribution of the stress field in the global coordinate system of the rtps under internal pressure is shown in fig 13 the axial tensile stress and axial annular shear stress first increased and then decreased with an increase in the winding angle the axial tensile stress reached its maximum value at 45 and the axial annular shear stress at a winding angle of 50 both the hoop tensile stress and the radial stress gradually increased with an increase in the winding angle but the growth rate was very slow and was nearly unchanged when the winding angle was 60 to study the influence of the winding angle on burst pressure 14 models of progressive failure over ranges of winding angles of 15 80 and spacings of 5 were established the influence of the winding angle on the burst pressure of the rtps is shown in fig 14 with an increase in the winding angle the burst pressure first increased and then decreased when the winding angle was less than 40 the burst pressure increased slowly and increased rapidly within the range 40 60 once the winding angle had exceeded 60 the burst pressure began to decline on the whole when the winding angle was 60 the burst pressure reached its peak value of 28 28 mpa in conclusion under the internal pressure condition with increasing the winding angle of the reinforced layer the tensile properties of the fibers could more fully manifest and significantly improved the burst capacity of the rtps the optimal winding angle is between 55 and 60 if the winding angle exceeds this range it has little improvement on the burst capacity of rtps and affects the tensile property of rtps 4 2 2 ply number the influence of the ply number of the reinforced layer on the stress field of the rtps in the local coordinate system and the global column coordinate system under internal pressure was analyzed the model s geometric parameters and parameters of the material were the same as above the winding angle of the reinforced layer was 55 and internal pressure was 1 mpa the influence of the ply number of the reinforced layer on the stress field in the local coordinate system of the rtps under internal pressure is shown in fig 15 with an increase in the ply number the longitudinal tensile stress of the fiber transverse tensile stress perpendicular to the direction of the fiber and the shear stress of the fiber matrix all decreased to different degrees but not linearly in a certain range the pressure capacity of the rtps could be significantly improved with increasing ply number of the reinforced layer but the ply number beyond this range had little influence on the pressure capacity of the rtps note that under internal pressure with an increase in the ply number of the reinforced layer the interlaminar compressive stress in the innermost part of the reinforced layer increased gradually and approached the given internal pressure load whereas the interlaminar compressive stress in the outermost part of the reinforced layer decreased gradually and approached zero this is because internal pressure load was applied to the inner surface of the rtps with an increase in the ply number of the reinforced layer the internal pressure load of the rtps was mainly borne by the reinforced layer while the load borne by their outermost part decreased therefore the compressive stress of the innermost interlayer of the reinforced layer increased while that of the outermost interlayer decreased the influence of the ply number of the reinforced layer on the stress field in the global coordinate system of the rtps under internal pressure is shown in fig 16 it changes in the curves in the global and the local coordinate systems were identical to further examine the influence of the ply number on the burst pressure 26 models of progressive damage leading to failure with 4 54 ply numbers of the reinforced layers and two layers of intervals were established the model s geometric parameters and parameters of the material were the same as above and the winding angle was 55 the influence of the ply number of reinforced layer on the burst pressure of the rtps is shown in fig 17 with an increase in the ply number of reinforced layer the burst pressure of the rtps increased significantly from 26 93 mpa to 165 mpa but not linearly after a certain ply number of the reinforced layer had been reached interlaminar separation was more likely to occur in the rtps before burst which led to a reduction in the overall stiffness of the reinforced layer and ultimately affected the burst strength of the rtps in summary appropriately increasing the ply number of the reinforced layer can improve the pressure capacity of rtps but increasing it to a certain extent increases the cost of production while not significantly enhancing pressure capacity 5 conclusions using 3d thick walled cylinder theory combined with the 3d hashin failure criterion and the theory of evolution of damage to composite materials and considering the nonlinear mechanical behavior of thermoplastic materials as well as changes in the winding angle caused by deformation a model to analyze the progressive failure in rtps was formulated here to analyze their failure sequence and burst capability it was then used to examine the mechanism of influence of the winding angle and the ply number of the reinforced layer on the burst capacity of rtps the failure sequence of the internal pressure bursting of rtps can be summarized according to the results of numerical analysis and experimental observations cracking occurred first in the matrix of each reinforced layer almost simultaneously the stiffness of the reinforced layer degraded and various failure coefficients and strain values increased rapidly then strain in the inner liner reached its limit and began to fracture with a further increase in internal pressure fibers of the reinforced layer began to fracture under tension and the protective layer reached the limit of strain nearly at the same time causing the rtps to completely fail when the ply number of the reinforced layer was higher than 10 layers interlayer stratification began to occur the stress field of the local coordinate system and global column coordinate system of the rtps under the action of internal pressure as well as the influence of the winding angle and ply number of the reinforced layer on the burst capacity of the rtps were also analyzed with an increase in the winding angle the burst capacity first increased and then decreased when the winding angle was 60 the burst pressure reached its peak compared with the winding angle the effect of the ply number of the reinforced layer on burst capacity was more prominent with an increase in the ply number the burst pressure increased nonlinearly and the growth in it gradually slowed down once a certain ply numbers of the reinforced layer had been reached interlaminar separation was more likely to occur in the rtps before they burst which led to a decline in the overall stiffness of the reinforced layer ultimately affected the burst strength of the rtps credit authorship contribution statement yangyang wang methodology

pipes have more advantages in corrosion weight installation insulation and maintenance cost kaddour et al 2003 bai et al 2015 with further advancements in fiber and thermoplastic materials reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtps have lately been used in deep water oil and gas development liu and wang 2019 lou et al 2020 the capacity of composite pipes to bear internal pressure load is usually called pressure capacity which is a primary concern in the design process of composite pipes it is necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of the pipeline while controlling the cost kuang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 studied the pressure capacity of rtps by the finite element analysis and experimental and illustrated that the failure mode of rtps under internal pressure was the break of glass fiber belt in structural layer xing et al 2015 studied the deformation and stress of multi angle wound composite pipe on the basis of considering the combined load of axial load and internal and external pressure li et al 2016 conducted experimental research on the mechanical properties of rtps with different internal pressures to obtain the burst pressure bai et al 2011 2012 2014 studied the burst capacity of rtps under internal pressure through different methods due to the fact that the nonlinear behavior of polyethylene is not taken into account the calculated results of the model have significant errors compared with the experimental results kuang et al 2017 rafiee and ali 2015 predicted the failure pressure of glass fiber reinforced polyester grp pipes under internal pressure by using finite element model and verified the accuracy of the conclusion by experiments due to the anisotropy of composite materials and a current limitation research theory it is still difficult to accurately predict the progressive failure of rtps many researchers have made achievements in the field of failure analysis over past decades and these literatures can be used for reference diniz et al 2011 used tsai hill criterion and the hoffman criterion in a numerical simulation to determine the failure pressure of the first layer of composite pipes as burst pressure chen et al 2017 2018 and he et al 2019 conducted the failure analysis on composite sheets by numerical simulation and the results obtained by hashin failure criterion had a good agreement with experimental results rafiee 2013 2016 carried out a number of experimental analyses of glass fiber wound tubes of different diameters 300 500 600 700 800 900 and 1000 mm and compared them with an established progressive failure model to verify the effectiveness of their results yao et al 2019 developed a nonlinear stiffness degradation model to investigate the low velocity impact behavior of fiber composite laminates under multiple impacts with the same total energy alshahrani et al 2016 simulated the response of glass fiber reinforced epoxy pipes under low velocity impact loads by ansys it showed that delamination and matrix crack were main damage mode and the results agreed well with experimental results prevalent work on the pressure capacity of rtps has mostly used the laminated plate theory combined with the finite element model and experimental approaches and have ignored the nonlinearity and interlaminar stress of the material the results of such calculations thus have low accuracy kuang et al 2017 furthermore the failure criterion employed cannot be used to simulate the process of evolution of damage to composite materials in this paper the burst capacity of rtps under the effect of internal pressure is analyzed by considering the nonlinear stress strain relationship of thermoplastic materials and interlaminar stress based on 3d thick walled cylinder theory a mechanical model of rtps is constructed by considering changes in the winding angle caused by deformation combined with the 3d hashin failure criterion and the theory of the evolution of damage in composite materials a model for the progressive failure analysis of rtps is established to analyze their failure sequence and burst capacity the simulated burst pressure of analytical model fitted well with the experimental result the model was then used to analyze the mechanism of influence of the winding angle and the ply number of the reinforced layer on the burst capacity of rtps 2 numerical model the rtps studied in this paper is a kind of bonded non metallic flexible pipes its cross section structure is divided into four layers from the inside to the outside which are the inner hdpe liner the reinforced layer the functional units and the outer protective layer the reinforced layers of rtps are composed of hdpe and glass fibers the layers are bonded together by heating fusion to form a fully bonded composite

plate the failure factor r i i ft fc mt mc s td and cd reflects the damage condition the damage occurs once the failure factor is greater than one the degradation of materials due to damage is a gradual process as shown in fig 3 σ eq and δ eq are the equivalent stress and equivalent strain of the material respectively when material stress reaches the ultimate strength σ0 eq the material does not immediately fail but its stiffness degrades the specific form of degradation depends on the value of α α 0 implies linear degradation α 1 2 3 n corresponds to exponential degradation and α is degradation that causes immediate damage the specific form of degradation in the performance related parameters used in this paper refers to the research results of camanho and matthews 1999 and tan and perez 1993 the degraded stiffnesses can be obtained as follows tan and perez 1993 27 e 11 d 1 e 11 e 22 d 2 e 22 g 12 d 6 g 12 where e 11 e 22 and g 12 are the effective damaged lamina stiffnesses and e 11 e 22 and g 12 are the undamaged lamina stiffnesses d 1 d 2 and d 6 are the internal state variables representing the damaged state of the lamina d 1 is the stiffness degradation factor associated with fiber breakage d 2 and d 6 are the stiffness degradation factors perpendicular to the fiber direction and shear component respectively due to matrix cracking the parameter d 1 varies from 0 001 to 0 15 and d 2 and d 6 range from 0 01 to 0 30 tan and perez 1993 the stiffness degradation parameters proposed by camanho and matthews 1999 are based on the approach of tan and perez 1993 as shown in table 1 using them the specific form of degradation in the performance related parameters used in this paper is as shown in table 2 the data in table 2 represent the stiffness reduction coefficient scr of the material the performance related parameter of the material is the product of its initial performance and the scr when the scr is one this indicates that the performance parameter of the material is constant 2 3 numerical analysis procedure a computer code was written in matlab to reveal the damage mechanism of rtps under internal pressure the loading process is simulated using successive iterations and the flowchart fig 4 shows the details of the iterative calculation the necessary parameters should be set in advance including the winding angles of each layer geometric parameters material parameters and ultimate load p load the iteration begins with a given initial load p based on the stress state the variation in the winding angle of each layer is obtained and the elastic plastic state of the material is determined based on the strain these parameters are used for the next iteration if p p load p p p i update the winding angle and material parameters and continue the iterative calculation if p p load the program ends and the output stress and strain fields are obtained under the ultimate load p load 3 experiments in order to further verify the accuracy of the numerical analysis results sample pipes with different ply numbers were selected for hydraulic burst tests the winding angles were 55 55 55 for laminates which means that fibers in one layer were in clockwise direction and those in the adjacent layer were in anti clockwise direction the geometric parameters and experimental data of the sample pipes are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively figs 5 and 6 show the experimental apparatus which featured a 120 mpa bursting test machine pipe fixing device bursting protection device data acquisition instrument monitor joint treatment device and three sample tubes used in the test at six eight 10 and 12 layered fiber wound rtps the sample pipe after burst failure is shown in fig 7 a large amount of fluid leaked into the pipe and failure occurred in its middle far from the joint at both ends this indicates that the experimental results were reasonable to intuitively analyze the forms of bursting failure the sections of six eight 10 and 12 layered pipes were compared and analyzed as shown in fig 8 it shows that the angle of fracture at failure was 55 in terms of failure form the fiber fracture and matrix cracking of the reinforced layer occurred when the number of wound layers was 12 the reinforced layer exhibited prominent interlayer separation on the inner side of the pipeline table 5 shows the results of the burst pressure test it is clear that with an increase in the number of wound layers the burst pressure did not increase linearly and the growth rate gradually slowed down when the number of reinforced layers was small such as increased from six to eight layers the burst pressure increased by 9 74 mpa with an increase in the number of reinforced layers such as from 10 to 12 layers the burst pressure increases by 7 46 mpa 4 numerical analysis 4 1 comparison between theoretical model and experimental results calculations were performed according to the established model for the mechanical analysis of the progressive failure of rtps the results were then compared with those of the experiment the parameters of the rtps used in the analytical model were consistent with the experimental parameters and parameters of the ultimate strength of the reinforced layer are shown in table 6 the nonlinear stress strain relationship of the material used in the rtps studied in this comparison was shown in fig 9 the secant modulus was used to characterize the properties of the elastoplastic materials in each iteration step the elastic modulus of the hdpe is updated based on the strain and a similar approach has been used in the open literatures to study the material nonlinearity of hdpe bai et al 2014 kuang et al 2015a 2015b fig 10 and the parameters listed in table 6 were determined experimentally by weihai nacheon pipeline co ltd the processes of progressive failure of six eight 10 and 12 layered fiber wound rtps were analyzed the failure scenario of the reinforced layer was characterized by the 3d hashin failure coefficient and failure of the lining layer and the outer protective layer was represented by strain failure occurred when the failure coefficient was greater than one and strain was greater than 0 077 taking the calculation results of six layered rtps as an example the progressive failure process is shown in fig 10 fig 10 shows the load response curve of the six layered rtps when internal pressure was zero each failure coefficient was zero as well and strain on the inner liner and protective layers was zero with a gradual increase in the internal pressure load the failure coefficient and strain of the inner liner and protective layers increased correspondingly when the internal pressure load was 10 15 mpa cracking occurred first in the matrix of each reinforced layer almost simultaneously the stiffness of the reinforced layer degraded and various failure coefficients and strain values increased rapidly when the internal pressure load reached 29 9 mpa the strain of the inner liner reached its limit and began to fracture when the internal pressure load was 37 24 mpa the fiber in the innermost layer of the reinforced layer exhibited tensile fracture and the stiffness of the reinforced layer further decreased this rapidly affected the outermost fiber when the internal pressure load was 37 26 mpa the outer protective layer reached the strain limit the inner liner reinforced layer and protective layer of the rtps were damaged and the pipeline failed completely according to the results the burst pressure of the six layered rtps was 37 26 mpa and at this time no stratification of the reinforced layer had occurred the eight 10 and 12 layered rtps were calculated according to the same method their failure sequence before bursting was almost identical to that of the six layered rtps except that the internal pressure for failure was slightly different as far as the eight layered rtps are concerned when the internal pressure load was 13 13 mpa the matrix of the reinforced layer cracked first when it was 33 47 mpa the strain of the inner liner reached its limit and began to fracture when the internal pressure load was 47 59 mpa the fiber of the reinforced layer began to break under tension leading to the ultimate strain of the protective layer and the complete failure of the rtps according to the results the burst pressure of the eight layered rtps was 47 61 mpa and there was no stratification of the reinforced layer according to the results the burst pressure of the 10 layered rtps was 57 67 mpa fig 11 shows the load response curve of the 12 layered rtps when the internal pressure load was 56 69 mpa the interlayer delamination occurred for the first time in the innermost part of the reinforced layer the burst pressure of 12 layered rtps was 66 38 mpa when the internal pressure load was 58 09 mpa clear interlayer separation occurred in the reinforced layer of the rtps thus verifying the accuracy of the progressive failure model proposed here for predicting the failure mode to verify the correctness of the model the predicted burst pressure and experimental value of the model were summarized and their relative errors were analyzed as shown in table 7 the predicted value of the model coincided with the experimental value and the maximum relative error was controlled to within 8 according to table 6 the transverse tensile strength of the reinforced layer is less than the longitudinal tensile strength when the internal pressure gradually increases the stress in each direction of the reinforced layer increases rapidly in the local coordinate system cracking occurred first in the matrix of each reinforced layer almost simultaneously leading to the stiffness degradation of the reinforced layer and the reduction of the burst capacity due to the small elongation at break of the fiber as the internal pressure continues to increase leading to tensile fracture of the fiber and further reduction of the stiffness of the reinforced layer when the internal pressure reached 56 69 mpa of 12 layered rtps the innermost interlayer stress of the reinforced layer exceeded the shear strength and the interlayer delamination occurred for the first time in the innermost part of the reinforced layer it is believed that with the increase of the ply number of reinforced layers the burst capacity increases and the interlayer separation between reinforced layers becomes more and more obvious 4 2 parametric study 4 2 1 winding angle the influence of the winding angle on the stress field in the rtps under internal pressure was analyzed in the local coordinate system and the global column coordinate system the model s geometric parameters and parameters of the material were the same as above the ply number of the reinforced layer was four and the internal pressure was 1 mpa fig 12 shows the influence of changes in the winding angle on the distribution of the stress field in the local coordinate system of the rtps when internal pressure was applied with an increase in the winding angle the longitudinal tensile stress of the fiber first increased rapidly and then decreased the trend of variation in tensile stress perpendicular to the direction of the fiber was opposite that in longitudinal tensile stress both reached their extreme values close to a winding angle of 55 with increasing winding angle the interlaminar stress increases but the growth rate gradually decreased and increases slowly between 60 and 80 the shear stress of the fiber matrix increased first and then decreased with an increase in the winding angle and reached the peak when the winding angle was 35 the influence of changes in the winding angle on the distribution of the stress field in the global coordinate system of the rtps under internal pressure is shown in fig 13 the axial tensile stress and axial annular shear stress first increased and then decreased with an increase in the winding angle the axial tensile stress reached its maximum value at 45 and the axial annular shear stress at a winding angle of 50 both the hoop tensile stress and the radial stress gradually increased with an increase in the winding angle but the growth rate was very slow and was nearly unchanged when the winding angle was 60 to study the influence of the winding angle on burst pressure 14 models of progressive failure over ranges of winding angles of 15 80 and spacings of 5 were established the influence of the winding angle on the burst pressure of the rtps is shown in fig 14 with an increase in the winding angle the burst pressure first increased and then decreased when the winding angle was less than 40 the burst pressure increased slowly and increased rapidly within the range 40 60 once the winding angle had exceeded 60 the burst pressure began to decline on the whole when the winding angle was 60 the burst pressure reached its peak value of 28 28 mpa in conclusion under the internal pressure condition with increasing the winding angle of the reinforced layer the tensile properties of the fibers could more fully manifest and significantly improved the burst capacity of the rtps the optimal winding angle is between 55 and 60 if the winding angle exceeds this range it has little improvement on the burst capacity of rtps and affects the tensile property of rtps 4 2 2 ply number the influence of the ply number of the reinforced layer on the stress field of the rtps in the local coordinate system and the global column coordinate system under internal pressure was analyzed the model s geometric parameters and parameters of the material were the same as above the winding angle of the reinforced layer was 55 and internal pressure was 1 mpa the influence of the ply number of the reinforced layer on the stress field in the local coordinate system of the rtps under internal pressure is shown in fig 15 with an increase in the ply number the longitudinal tensile stress of the fiber transverse tensile stress perpendicular to the direction of the fiber and the shear stress of the fiber matrix all decreased to different degrees but not linearly in a certain range the pressure capacity of the rtps could be significantly improved with increasing ply number of the reinforced layer but the ply number beyond this range had little influence on the pressure capacity of the rtps note that under internal pressure with an increase in the ply number of the reinforced layer the interlaminar compressive stress in the innermost part of the reinforced layer increased gradually and approached the given internal pressure load whereas the interlaminar compressive stress in the outermost part of the reinforced layer decreased gradually and approached zero this is because internal pressure load was applied to the inner surface of the rtps with an increase in the ply number of the reinforced layer the internal pressure load of the rtps was mainly borne by the reinforced layer while the load borne by their outermost part decreased therefore the compressive stress of the innermost interlayer of the reinforced layer increased while that of the outermost interlayer decreased the influence of the ply number of the reinforced layer on the stress field in the global coordinate system of the rtps under internal pressure is shown in fig 16 it changes in the curves in the global and the local coordinate systems were identical to further examine the influence of the ply number on the burst pressure 26 models of progressive damage leading to failure with 4 54 ply numbers of the reinforced layers and two layers of intervals were established the model s geometric parameters and parameters of the material were the same as above and the winding angle was 55 the influence of the ply number of reinforced layer on the burst pressure of the rtps is shown in fig 17 with an increase in the ply number of reinforced layer the burst pressure of the rtps increased significantly from 26 93 mpa to 165 mpa but not linearly after a certain ply number of the reinforced layer had been reached interlaminar separation was more likely to occur in the rtps before burst which led to a reduction in the overall stiffness of the reinforced layer and ultimately affected the burst strength of the rtps in summary appropriately increasing the ply number of the reinforced layer can improve the pressure capacity of rtps but increasing it to a certain extent increases the cost of production while not significantly enhancing pressure capacity 5 conclusions using 3d thick walled cylinder theory combined with the 3d hashin failure criterion and the theory of evolution of damage to composite materials and considering the nonlinear mechanical behavior of thermoplastic materials as well as changes in the winding angle caused by deformation a model to analyze the progressive failure in rtps was formulated here to analyze their failure sequence and burst capability it was then used to examine the mechanism of influence of the winding angle and the ply number of the reinforced layer on the burst capacity of rtps the failure sequence of the internal pressure bursting of rtps can be summarized according to the results of numerical analysis and experimental observations cracking occurred first in the matrix of each reinforced layer almost simultaneously the stiffness of the reinforced layer degraded and various failure coefficients and strain values increased rapidly then strain in the inner liner reached its limit and began to fracture with a further increase in internal pressure fibers of the reinforced layer began to fracture under tension and the protective layer reached the limit of strain nearly at the same time causing the rtps to completely fail when the ply number of the reinforced layer was higher than 10 layers interlayer stratification began to occur the stress field of the local coordinate system and global column coordinate system of the rtps under the action of internal pressure as well as the influence of the winding angle and ply number of the reinforced layer on the burst capacity of the rtps were also analyzed with an increase in the winding angle the burst capacity first increased and then decreased when the winding angle was 60 the burst pressure reached its peak compared with the winding angle the effect of the ply number of the reinforced layer on burst capacity was more prominent with an increase in the ply number the burst pressure increased nonlinearly and the growth in it gradually slowed down once a certain ply numbers of the reinforced layer had been reached interlaminar separation was more likely to occur in the rtps before they burst which led to a decline in the overall stiffness of the reinforced layer ultimately affected the burst strength of the rtps credit authorship contribution statement yangyang wang methodology

20621,submarine cables play a vital role in a myriad of industries around the globe including power transmission and communication failure of submarine cables can have significant economic and technical implications worldwide current design methods for submarine cables focus on the ultimate limit states that address the cables structural integrity and on bottom stability however abrasion of the outer protective layers i e yarn and extruded sheaths can progressively lead to damage and failure of submarine cables when the integrity of the armour sheathing is compromised this paper documents several case studies of severe abrasion of submarine cables umbilicals and undertaken corrective measures the paper also presents some guidelines to be considered in the design process of submarine cables concerning abrasion the findings of this paper suggest that abrasion should be considered a limit state that must be addressed in the design process of submarine cables and umbilicals a detailed analysis of the underlying abrasion failure mechanisms is presented and explained in a companion paper i e part ii mechanisms keywords subsea cables subsea umbilicals abrasion on bottom stability outer sheath wind farms renewable energy 1 introduction submarine power cables and umbilicals are becoming increasingly common features of offshore hydrocarbon field development and renewable wind farms reda thiedeman elgazzar shahin sultan mckee reda et al 2016a reda et al 2019a reda et al 2016b ventikos and stavrou 2013 the on bottom stability design of the subsea cables and umbilicals tend to use the ultimate limit state accidental limit state and serviceability limit state the ultimate and accidental limit states are based on the maximum characteristic curvature and axial force while the serviceability limit state is defined in terms of excessive displacement due to hydrodynamic effects following dnvgl rp f1019 dnv 2017a some degree of cable umbilical lateral movement is acceptable the serviceability limit state is satisfied by setting limitations for the lateral movement of subsea cables and umbilicals the allowable lateral displacement limit of the subsea cable umbilical is presently governed by the following cable umbilical in a trench cable umbilical must remain in the trench seabed obstructions displacements will be of concern when the cable umbilical is close to other pipelines umbilicals cables rock outcrops or existing subsea structures survey corridor cable umbilical should not move outside the installation survey corridor dnvgl rp f019 dnv 2017a should include in the guide that if the lateral displacement leads to significant abrasion then the lateral movement should be minimized or prevented in some cases lateral displacement of the cable can result in severe abrasion of the cable outer sheath the repeated lateral movement can break the galvanized layer of the steel armour wires and over time the steel wires can corrode armouring is essential for cables and umbilicals for them to hold the tension involved in the installation to protect the cable and umbilical and to provide the requisite on bottom stability in light of the above the allowable lateral movement of the subsea cable umbilical must be governed by the abrasion resistance of the outer sheath abrasion of the subsea cable umbilical takes place as a result of the relative motion of the cable against rough surfaces such as coarse sand coral or rocky seabeds this paper identifies that on bottom stability is not the only cause of abrasion the paper demonstrates that the outer sheath of the cable can be abraded due to the installation procedure lateral movement due to instability and as a result of fishing and anchoring the role of the outer sheath of the cable and umbilical is to protect the underlying armouring from corrosion and abrasion also in in stream tidal environments such as the alderney race the outer sheath of the cable may be subjected to abrasion due to sediment transport and the flight of gravel coles et al 2020 typically the underlying armouring wires are made of galvanized steel wire as such direct contact of the armour wires to the seawater does not pose an issue as long as the outer sheath is not severely damaged or abraded and the galvanized wires are not abraded dnvgl rp 0360 dnvgl rp 2016 considers the excessive abrasion and degradation of the outer sheath to be a serviceability limit state dnvgl rp 0360 dnvgl rp 2016 indicates that the lateral movement of the cable should be minimized to ensure that the outer sheath will not be abraded furthermore the same reference highlights that it is essential to ensure that the cable has sufficient abrasion resistance to ensure that the outer sheath of the cable is not damaged reda et al 2017 2020 and dnvgl rp 0360 dnvgl rp 2016 emphasize that the tubular products which are utilized to provide stability or protection for the pipeline should be designed to ensure abrasion resistance thereby increasing the cable life under the impact of harsh environmental loads the outer surface of the cable and umbilical provides resistance against corrosion the requirements outlined in dnvgl rp 0360 dnvgl rp 2016 state that the corrosion impact of the seawater on armouring wires should be considered to retain the cable capability to withstand external forces and maintain tensile strength for possible repair work in this paper recent incidents associated with abrasion of the outer surface of subsea cables and umbilicals are discussed the main purpose of the paper is to raise awareness and highlight the importance of protecting the subsea cables and umbilicals from severe abrasion additionally the paper presents some strategies by which one may protect the cable and its armour in the instance where the outer sheath of the cable umbilical is excessively damaged due to abrasion five incidents are presented where the outer sheath of the subsea cables and umbilicals were severely damaged the first incident occurred during the shore pull of a subsea cable while the second incident was a result of an anchor dragging an exposed subsea cable on the seafloor the third incident was due to cable instability at the shore approach area while in the fourth incident the cable was left in a free hanging position against a bellmouth which caused abrasion to the outer sheath of the cable this fourth incident provides an excellent example of the wide range of different configurations that can potentially lead to abrasion when the cable moves such that a free span appears it may be prone to vortex induced vibrations due to the combined effects of currents and waves which though causing no significant cumulated displacement can cause some small high frequency two way displacements this phenomenon may be dramatic in terms of abrasion cable abrasion in the fifth incident occurred at a crossing location and was due to the lateral movement of the crossing cable over the crossed cable under the influence of hydrodynamic forces appendix a shows the main definitions used in the paper some are taken from dnvgl rp 2016 american petroleum instit 2017 american petroleum instit 2014 dnv 2017b 2 is abrasion an issue a recent study reda et al 2016a indicated that 35 4 22 9 and 11 5 of all failures in the medium voltage subsea power cable system in greece were related to anchoring fishing and instability events respectively as shown in fig 1 fig 2 shows a proportion of cable faults by cause from a database containing 2162 records spanning the years 1959 2006 reda et al 2016a it can be seen that 14 6 44 4 and 3 7 of all cable faults were due to anchoring fishing and abrasion respectively it should be noted that anchoring and fishing failures also involve abrasion damage as a precursor to failure a recent study strang moran 2020 indicated that 8 of all recorded cable failures were due to external damage which in turn was primarily due to instability from the surrounding conditions see fig 3 the same study highlighted that 46 of recorded failures were due to installation the installation failure mode included cables being handled outside of their specifications and insufficient burial of the cable furthermore the study revealed that 15 of cable failures were due to cable design the study stated that unsuitable cable design can be a reason for components failing during asset operation this includes cable designs not being able to withstand the harsh conditions associated with offshore wind farms lucas and harrington 2016 explained that cable abrasion associated with lateral movement inevitably leads to cable failure over time as shown in fig 4 it was indicated that abrasion of the outer sheath of the cable can lead to fibre failure and cable breakage in the current climate any failure of subsea cables results in a significant loss of revenue due to business interruption recently subsea cables with double armours are increasingly exhibiting abrasion related faults in shallow water lucas and harrington 2016 the same analysis showed that abrasion was a result of the movement and oscillation associated with hydrodynamic forces flynn 2015 presented many recent cable failures associated with abrasion of the outer sheath fig 5 depicts a tensile armour wire rupture of a flexible pipe caused by abrasion as outlined in marinhoet al 2007 contact or clashes between the flexible riser and platform or another flexible riser occurs commonly due to the movement of the hosting platform this is especially common in semi submersible units these interferences may promote not only damage to and abrasion of the external sheath but also lead to the rupture of tensile armours caused by corrosion abrasion and or fatigue and may ultimately result in flexible riser failure there is an intermediate state before breakage an outer sheath failure allows armour layer re arrangement by releasing the pre stress of the manufacturing process this may significantly change its global mechanical properties by modifying for example its torque balance o brien and picksley o brien and picksley 2001 indicated that damage to the external sheath of the flexible pipe during installation is the most common failure incident accounting for 25 of all damage or failure incidents surveyed the same study highlighted that external sheath damage during installation leads to a reduction in the cable life 3 outer sheath cables and umbilicals are required to be covered by an outer sheath which provides overall protection secures the armouring during handling and installation and assists in distributing forces arising from handling and installation in other words the outer sheath provides additional protection and cushioning to the cable umbilical against handling and abrasion the cable umbilical has either an external sheath consisting of a double layer of polypropylene pp roving yarn or linear low density polyethylene lldp or high density polyethylene hdpe extruded over the armour layers for external abrasion chemical and water resistance fig 6 shows an outer sheath made of pp roving yarn left versus extruded hdpe right figs 7 and 8 show a telescopic view of a subsea cable with a pp roving yarn outer sheath and an extruded hdpe outer sheath respectively the outer layer of rovings yarns or extruded hdpe is applied over the outer armour layer this is in part to enable easy cable umbilical identification and visibility employing colour in the case where rovings yarns are used the rovings yarns are anchored to the armour wires through a bitumen slushing compound applied immediately before the application of the rovings yarns this is to provide a positive location during handling and installation and to increase the effectiveness of the armour s corrosion protection 3 1 advantages of rovings yarns cost effective alternative to the thermoplastic sheathing providing a typical saving of anywhere between 5 and 10 of the cable umbilical cost can be applied at the same time as armouring in the instance of a single armour layer product providing a small schedule benefit generally used with a single layer of armour to allow for coilable cable design power cables only lower assembly stiffness lower assembly weight in the air 3 2 disadvantages of rovings yarns more susceptible to abrasion damage and in the instance of an interruption can unwind do not provide a clean face for sealing at a j tube entry point corrosion inhibitor requires sealing thus seal application cannot be achieved in the presence of rovings yarns only suitable for static cable umbilicals do not provide impact protection bitumen can soften leak when stored in a high temperature environment 4 field incidents 4 1 incident 1 recently the outer sheath of a subsea cable was damaged due to abrasion during the shore pull of a subsea cable the damage took place because the shore pull of the cable was carried out in complete violation of the approved installation method statement and procedures the cable was dragged along the rocky seabed resulting in visible damage to the cable the installation procedure required buoyancy floater units to be attached to the cable at designated locations along the cable to ensure the floatation of the cable i e cable to be buoyant and to guarantee that the cable would not be dragged across the rough rocky seabed excessive buoyancy units were not desirable by the cable lay contractor this is in part because the buoyancy units involve additional work that must be performed in terms of the attachment and removal of units it should be noted that the installation contractor did not wish to use buoyancy units because unacceptable curvatures can occur when the buoyancy modules are progressively released this shows that the installation contractors tend to prioritise the ultimate limit state in terms of curvature and effective tension while ignoring the abrasion limit of the outer sheath many installation contractors consider the outer sheath to be sacrificial and believe that no harm can occur to the cable even if the outer sheath is damaged it can be seen from fig 9 that signs of damage to the outer sheath of the subsea cable are visible furthermore it is evident that insufficient buoyancy units were attached to the cable fig 10 illustrates a typical onshore pull arrangement it is a pictorial description of how an onshore pull is conducted for subsea cables using buoyancy modules it can be seen that the onshore spread is comprised of a linear winch and the associated reel and reel winders a back anchor may be used depending on the capacity of the winch and pulling force the offshore spread is made up of the cable lay vessel and smaller support vessels required for the collection of the buoyancy units after the completion of the shore pull once the pulling head reaches the target location on the beach the cable lay vessel continues laying the cable towards the offshore facility divers following the shore pull remove the buoyancy units following the removal of the buoyancy units the cable is lowered onto the sediment the location of the cable lay vessel in reference to the beach directly influences the pulling load however the location of the cable lay vessel is determined by the bathymetry of the landfall it is evident from fig 11 that there are a significantly greater number of buoyancy units attached to the cable compared to that of fig 9 fig 12 illustrates the damage that occurred to the outer serving yarn almost the entire length of the cable from the beach right up to the cable lay vessel experienced some degree of damage it is recommended that a detailed survey be performed of the shore before selecting the location of the shore pull activity to investigate the type of seafloor and determine whether or not the cable can be dragged safely across it the mitigation procedure adopted to prevent the damage of the outer sheath is given in section 6 0 the data of the damage are as follows fibre optic cable outside diameter 38 mm type of outer sheath two layers of polypropylene yarns thickness of outer sheath 5 mm and submerged weight of cable 3 1 kg m 4 2 incident 2 this case study is an incident where an anchor caused a horizontal displacement for a subsea fibre optic cable during the as built survey it was observed that a boat anchor was tangled with a subsea cable as illustrated in fig 13 additionally it was found that a deviation from the indicated as laid position occurred for a 950 m long section of the cable a maximum deviation of 65 m was reported as highlighted in fig 14 a visual inspection revealed the following a 50 m long section of the cable appeared to have suffered physical and mechanical damages to the outer sheathing of the cable at location 1 as indicated in figs 15 and 16 two sections one 10 m long and the other 15 m long suffered such extensive damages that the outer sheathing had been completely removed leaving the armour fully exposed as illustrated in fig 17 it should be noted that the cable was dragged in the manner it was because two secondary stabilization mattresses were installed at a distance of 950 m from each other as illustrated in fig 14 the size of the anchor that had become entangled with the cable was small therefore the applied contact force between the cable and the anchor was not sufficient to cause severe damage to the cable or the armour it is known that the contact between an anchor and a subsea cable is seldom catastrophic as the applied force by a moving anchor is largely dependent on the mass of the anchor the anchoring hazard may arise from negligent anchoring insufficient protection for the cable emergency anchoring or anchor dragging as the result of a vessel being inadequately controlled or piloted the anchor was found to be the one that is typically used by fishermen to retrieve fishing traps see fig 18 in some geographical locations fish trapping is the most widely used fishing method fishermen drop traps and retrieve them using a boat anchor after 5 20 days however several times they miss the trap altogether and entangle their anchor in a cable instead fishermen attempt to retrieve their anchor by dragging and pulling on the anchor thereby inadvertently dragging the cable horizontally this results in damage to the outer sheathing of the cable on many occasions they fail to retrieve the anchor entirely and end up cutting the wire connected to the anchor the abrasion of the cable took place due to anchor dragging to minimize this risk the following recommendations are usually made 1 during cable routing the subsea cable is routed into deep water wherever practical to avoid interference with baskets and anchors associated with traditional fishing methods 2 during the route selection of the cable it is advisable to use the historical ais automatic identification system data to visualize the marine traffic intensity in the proximity of the cable route a new cable route along with the data from ais are shown in fig 19 3 newly installed cables are more prone to damage as other users are as yet unaware of the position of the new cable on the seafloor 4 newly installed cables should be added to navigational charts 5 once the cable is in service it is recommended to use the ais cable monitoring and notification system to identify the vessel or ship that caused the damage of the cable to recover the cost of repair however it should be highlighted that not all vessels are required to install the ais system with only those vessels with a capacity greater than 300 tonnes required to install it the international maritime organisation imo requires that the ais system be fitted aboard any international voyaging ship with a gross tonnage greater than 300 tonnes and to all passenger ships irrespective of their size based on this it can be seen that almost all commercial vessels and the vast majority of private vessels that might pose a risk to cables are covered 6 liaise with the fishing community to inform them of any new cable route and the installation schedule 7 there is a misunderstanding within the industry that cables laid on a seabed tend to bury themselves and thus over time the cable will be protected based on this many cable owners ignore the requirements of on bottom stability and burial while self burial does occur it is predominantly dependent on soil classification and the submerged weight of the cable 8 for the static cable it is cheaper to use yarn sheathing however when one takes into consideration the financial burden of adverse events for areas where the marine traffic and in particular the fishing activity is anticipated to be high it is recommended that an extruded outer external sheath be used instead by doing so the damage to the outer sheath will not propagate as quickly along the length of the cable and additionally the smooth external surface may facilitate anchor sliding the mitigation procedure adopted to ensure that the armour layer will not be progressively damaged is given in section 6 0 the data of the damage are as follows fibre optic cable outside diameter 38 mm type of outer sheath two layers of polypropylene yarns thickness of outer sheath 5 mm and submerged weight of cable 3 1 kg m 4 3 incident 3 this incident is an instance of abrasion caused by the instability of the subsea cable in the shore approach area the on bottom stability study undertaken on this cable indicated that the cable should be covered by a secondary stabilization measure such as concrete mattresses immediately following the shore pull this is in part because the cable was not stable under the influence of hydrodynamic forces due to unforeseen circumstances the installation of the secondary stabilization measure was delayed as a result of the slimming effect of waves and hydrodynamic forces the outer sheath of the cable was damaged as can be seen from figs 20 and 21 the cable was laid on a rocky seabed the photo was taken during low tide the tension in the cable was high which aided in reducing the extent of the damage to the cable if the tension in the cable had been low the extent of the damage to the outer sheath would have been much greater it is recommended that more attention be given to the requirements of stabilizing the cable before planning for the construction campaign however if there is a delay expected between the time of installation of the cable and the time of stabilizing the cable and all the rocks are covered by a hard fouling layer with aggressive shape it is recommended that an hdpe external layer be used the most obvious mitigation measure is that the cable be automatically buried at landing however this is not a classical situation most umbilical cable manufacturers can manufacture the two ends of the cable with extruded outer sheaths i e 100 m of extruded outer sheaths at each end with yarn outer sheath in between as illustrated in fig 22 this arrangement is typically adopted when the umbilical cable is pulled into two j tubes so that a good seal around the umbilical cable at the j tube entry is achieved finally detailed surveys using divers should be undertaken of the area in the vicinity of the shore approach before installation the shore approach area should not be ignored during the geophysical and geotechnical surveys due to the shallow water depth workability limitations of the rov remote operated vehicle and the requirements of shallow water barges the mitigation measure adopted is given in section 5 0 the data of the damage are as follows composite cable power fibre optic outside diameter 124 mm type of outer sheath two layers of polypropylene yarns thickness of outer sheath 5 4 mm and submerged weight of cable 23 kg m 4 4 incident 4 in this incident while preparing to install a j tube seal on a cable divers reported damage to the yarn outer sheath of the cable at the j tube bellmouth a detailed video survey was carried out which covered the entire length between the j tube bellmouth and bend restrictor the yarn outer sheath was found to be damaged and bunched up over a distance of approximately 2 m between the end of the bend stiffener and the bellmouth the investigation uncovered that the centralizer and bend restrictor had been left in a free hanging position as per fig 23 the cable then began to rub against the bellmouth and the bend restrictor began to slide downward causing abrasion as shown in fig 24 snapshots of the cable section depicting the damage to the outer sheath are given in figs 23 26 the investigations also indicated that the installation contractor did not procure the right j tube seal as specified in the engineering drawings the original divers left the j tube seal and bend the restrictor in a free hanging position until subsequent divers who came to install the correct j tube seal discovered the damage to the outer sheath the mitigation measure adopted is given in section 6 0 the data of the damage are as follows composite cable power fibre optic outside diameter 115 mm type of outer sheath one layer of polypropylene yarn thickness of outer sheath 3 mm and submerged weight of cable 22 kg m 4 5 incident 5 this incident of abrasion occurred at the crossing location between a crossing cable 132 kv and a crossed cable 33 kv fig 27 shows that the crossing cable is laid directly on top of the crossed cable at the crossing location a bend restrictor is installed around the 132 kv cable this is because the crossing cable is designed to move laterally atop the crossed cable a recent rov survey was undertaken at this crossing location as demonstrated in figs 28 and 29 the figures show that the yarn outer sheath of the crossed cable is abraded due to the lateral movement of the crossing bend restrictor cable the extent of damage to the abraded outer sheath was approximately 1 m it should be noted that this is an example of bad crossing design practice it was recommended that a hard shell be installed on the crossed cable rather than placing the crossing cable inside a bend restrictor and placing both directly on top of the crossed cable the rov survey indicated that no damage or abrasion was observed on the bend restrictor at the crossing location fig 30 shows the abraded section of the crossed cable this photo was taken after pulling the crossing cable aside to perform the rectification procedures the data of the crossing cable are as follows composite cable power fibre optic outside diameter 191 mm type of outer sheath two layers of polypropylene yarns thickness of outer sheath 4 mm and submerged weight of cable 41 kg m 5 incidents mitigation and corrective measures realistically partial damage to the yarn or roving outer sheath cannot be avoided most subsea cables have double layers of pp yarn and bitumen because of this the galvanized steel wires are protected by the inner pp yarn and the outer pp yarns can be used for abrasion sacrifice this is akin to cathodic protection which can be damaged during cable installation the damaged or loose pp yarns shown in these photos do not necessarily constitute damage to the cable as they would not affect the integrity of the cable as such the loose pp yarn can be left as is cut or wrapped with a normal binder to make it tidy and to address safety concerns however these events occurred in critical areas which were subject to hydrodynamic loads as such it was suggested that these cables should be prevented from experiencing any further movement under the influence of hydrodynamic loads as this would speed up the pp yarn and galvanized steel wire abrasion to address these recommendations mitigation measures were implemented to ensure the situation would not worsen all of the incidents listed in sections 5 1 to 5 5 were associated with subsea fibre optics cables hence to ensure that the cables were fit for the purpose the fibres were tested using optical time domain reflectometry otdr which measures loss against distance in the operating window specified to the ends of the fibre the results were compared with results obtained from tests undertaken before cable lay and during cable installation to ensure that the exposed armour will not be damaged any further and to avoid damage to the second armour layer articulated ducting as shown in figs 31 33 was installed on the cable where the damage took place for incidents 1 and 3 articulated padding made of polyurethane was used to protect the armour from further abrasion for incident 3 rock bolts were used to minimize the lateral movement of the cable as per the requirements of the on bottom stability analysis for incident 2 articulated ducting made of cast iron was employed on the damaged cable to provide the required protection against the traps associated with fishing activities additionally rock bolts were used to ensure that no dragging would take place for the cable for incident 4 it was suggested that the fibre optics cable should not be left in the hanging position under the influence of hydrodynamic loads as doing so would speed up the pp yarn and galvanized steel wire abrasion to ensure that the cable would not remain in frictional contact with the j tube bellmouth under the action of sea bottom ocean currents and to guarantee that the galvanized steel wires armour would not be abraded further a j tube centralizer seal and bend restrictor were immediately installed as per fig 34 following this otdr tests were conducted to ensure that the fibre optics were still functioning for incident 5 pre filled grout bags were placed on top of the crossed cable to achieve a positive separation between the crossing cable and the crossed cable this ensured that no further damage will occur to the yarn outer sheath fig 35 illustrates both cables after deployment of the pre filled grout bags the width of the pre filled grout bag was selected such that it ensures the crossing cable will not fall off the grout bags and come in direct contact with the crossed cable the width of the pre filled grout was determined based on dynamic finite element analyses the crossed cable was left without any repair to the yarn outer sheath as the damage was at the top of the crossed cable and any lateral movement of the crossing cable would not worsen the damage to the armour wires fig 35 also shows that the installation of grout bags causes a free span to occur from the edge of the grout bags until the point where the cable touches down on the mattresses these free spans were produced on both sides therefore it was important to check that these free spans of crossing cable were not prone to vortex induced vibrations viv 6 operating experience of rovings yarns recently results from an out of straightness survey undertaken on a 2000 km length of subsea cable found that the cable had moved laterally under the influence of hydrodynamic forces as illustrated in figs 36 and 37 it is evident from the figures that the cable movement under hydrodynamic loads was factual and that this is not merely an academic issue based on the rov survey undertaken on a 2000 km length of subsea cable the size of the subsea cable was found to vary from 30 mm to 200 mm the cable was covered with either a pp roving yarn outer sheath or an extruded outer sheath the cable was also laid on different soil types as highlighted in table 1 the operational performance of the extruded outer sheath was excellent overall although the lateral movement of the subsea cable on the seabed did occur the survey demonstrated that if the cable had achieved self burial then the pp roving outer sheath remained in excellent condition as shown in fig 38 however in locations where the lateral displacement was more severe and indeed even when the lateral movement was small there was evidence of abrasion and damage to the pp roving outer sheath for every type of soil studied fig 38 shows examples where the pp roving yarn outer sheath was in excellent condition fig 39 illustrates a section of the cable that was stabilized by two spaced mattresses to prevent the cable from moving laterally under the extreme metocean condition it is evident from the figure that the pp roving outer sheath is in excellent condition fig 40 shows the cable at different locations the cable here was designed to be stable and the cable is restrained by rocks the cable pp roving outer sheath is intact and in excellent condition fig 41 shows the cable at a crossing location where the cable was allowed to move laterally over the concrete mattresses fig 42 illustrates a section of the cable designed to move laterally on the seabed both sections have an extruded outer sheath it is clear that the outer sheath is in excellent condition for both cases fig 43 depicts a section of the cable that was designed to allow some lateral movement as per dnv 2017a because of this the pp roving outer sheath was damaged due to abrasion from the seabed during the on bottom stability design the designer focused on the ultimate limit of the umbilical cable in terms of effective tension and minimum bend radius many designers tend to overlook the abrasion limit of the outer sheath and its importance in protecting the armour 7 options for cable protection this section presents some feasible options to stabilize the cable umbilical in situations where the lateral movement of the cable umbilical under the influence of hydrodynamic loads may abrade the outer sheath and hence compromise the integrity of the cable umbilical the following options can be utilized to protect against abrasion articulated pipes or ducts concrete mattresses rock dumping and trenching and burying it should be noted that this section touches only on articulated pipes as this option is not covered adequately in the current literature the other options are discussed extensively in many articles such as reda et al 2019b palmer and king 2004 bai and bai 2014 articulated pipes ap consist of a series of metallic half shell clamps collars that interlock to form articulated half shell modules that create a protective cover comparable to vertebrae around the cable as illustrated by fig 44 this technique is attractive because it also stabilizes the cable through added weight while providing high mechanical protection from impact and abrasion in areas where the conventional burial or trenching methods would be environmentally damaging fig 45 shows how the articulated pipes are arranged next to a cable waiting for the divers to start the installation process figs 46 and 47 explain briefly how the divers install the articulated piping around the subsea cable in some cases the articulated piping installed around the cable will not be enough to achieve the required level of stability in such situations rock bolts or saddles are used to achieve the required stability fig 48 shows the rock bolt saddle and the rod bolt before installation in a subsea environment the concept of the rock bolt can be explained in fig 49 figs 50 and 51 show how the divers install the rock bolt on the articulated padding the on bottom stability design will be utilized to define the spacing between rock bolts to determine the reaction loads on the rock bolts and to select the capacity as well as the depth of the selected rod bolt soil boring should typically be undertaken to assess the geotechnical characteristics of the seabed material to select a suitable piling system 8 conclusions and recommendations the roving yarn layers play a sacrificial role in the cable and any minor damage incurred during transportation or installation are not considered harmful to the integrity of the cable damage to the outer sheath polypropylene rovings yarns or loose polypropylene yarns does not necessarily constitute damage to the cable or umbilical additionally they do not compromise the integrity of the cable however if the cable umbilical is under repeated lateral or axial movement the outer sheath polypropylene rovings yarns will sustain substantial damage and over time the galvanized layer on the armour can become damaged or scratched damage to the galvanization on the armour leaves the armour wire unprotected which can over time cause the armour to corrode and ultimately break due to the salinity of the seawater once the first armour layer is broken the process will repeat itself on the second armour layer over time the second layer will break down resulting in the exposure of the polyethylene insulated cable which will then suffer the effects of abrasion the pp roving yarn outer sheath is fit for purpose if the cable is in a trench or if the cable is designed according to the absolute stability criteria defined in dnvgl rp f109 however if the cable with pp roving yarn outer sheath is subject to lateral movement the roving yarn abrades quickly for its commercial benefits it is worth investigating the option of strapping plastic sleeves around the cable umbilical in areas where repeated abrasion is expected to maintain the integrity of rovings yarns for the remainder of the cable umbilical life since the roving yarn outer sheath does not provide a clean smooth surface for sealing at a j tube entry point corrosion inhibitor requires sealing seal application cannot be achieved in the presence of rovings yarns it is recommended that sheathed sections be utilized at the ends from the hang off arrangement up to the exit of the j tube with rovings for the remaining length the dynamic umbilical cable is sensitive to environmental loading therefore the touchdown point changes depending upon the vessel movement and excursions motion at the touchdown zone on the seabed should be avoided or minimized using stabilization protection devices and anchoring devices to reduce the risk of abrasion table 2 provides recommendations that can be implemented before installing any subsea umbilical cable the abovementioned recommendations are based on operational feedback from the field for umbilical and cable systems that are designed to move laterally on the seabed under the influence of hydrodynamic forces regular monitoring surveys will need to be implemented to ensure the safety and integrity of the outer sheath of the umbilical or cable subsea umbilicals cables are an important asset of offshore hydrocarbon field development and renewable wind farms the umbilicals cables can be critical service cables such as main power cables international fibre optic cables or main umbilicals and the consequences of failure to these critical service cables are enormous understandably the consequences of a failure to a low importance cable are not as critical it is recommended that all umbilical cable operators develop umbilical cable integrity management plans the consequences of a partial failure are also significant and may seriously affect the integrity or functionality of the umbilical cable even if they do not initially result in total failure one such consequence is the necessity to replace the cable which is a huge undertaking in terms of both cost and downtime some partial degradation or failure may result in changes to the mechanical properties of the umbilical cable whilst this may not be catastrophic or constitute a total failure it could lead to a change in behaviour response or performance of the cable which may in turn then cause other failure modes or mechanisms to arise for example if the flexibility changes due to partial failure then the response in dynamic conditions could change which could then cause a failure umbilical cable integrity management plans should address the following items estimating potential risk scenarios determining undesirable consequences and the human environmental and economic impact of said consequences identifying potential safeguard options e g mitigation prevention monitoring needed to minimize potential consequences proposing potential repair philosophies appendix a main definitions used in the paper appendix a term definition abrasion abrasion can be described

20621,submarine cables play a vital role in a myriad of industries around the globe including power transmission and communication failure of submarine cables can have significant economic and technical implications worldwide current design methods for submarine cables focus on the ultimate limit states that address the cables structural integrity and on bottom stability however abrasion of the outer protective layers i e yarn and extruded sheaths can progressively lead to damage and failure of submarine cables when the integrity of the armour sheathing is compromised this paper documents several case studies of severe abrasion of submarine cables umbilicals and undertaken corrective measures the paper also presents some guidelines to be considered in the design process of submarine cables concerning abrasion the findings of this paper suggest that abrasion should be considered a limit state that must be addressed in the design process of submarine cables and umbilicals

umbilical is close to other pipelines umbilicals cables rock outcrops or existing subsea structures survey corridor cable umbilical should not move outside the installation survey corridor dnvgl rp f019 dnv 2017a should include in the guide that if the lateral displacement leads to significant abrasion then the lateral movement should be minimized or prevented in some cases lateral displacement of the cable can result in severe abrasion of the cable outer sheath the repeated lateral movement can break the galvanized layer of the steel armour wires and over time the steel wires can corrode armouring is essential for cables and umbilicals for them to hold the tension involved in the installation to protect the cable and umbilical and to provide the requisite on bottom stability in light of the above the allowable lateral movement of the subsea cable umbilical must be governed by the abrasion resistance of the outer sheath abrasion of the subsea cable umbilical takes place as a result of the relative motion of the cable against rough surfaces such as coarse sand coral or rocky seabeds this paper identifies that on bottom stability is not the only cause of abrasion the paper demonstrates that the outer sheath of the cable can be abraded due to the installation procedure lateral movement due to instability and as a result of fishing and anchoring the role of the outer sheath of the cable and umbilical is to protect the underlying armouring from corrosion and abrasion also in in stream tidal environments such as the alderney race the outer sheath of the cable may be subjected to abrasion due to sediment transport and the flight of gravel coles et al 2020 typically the underlying armouring wires are made of galvanized steel wire as such direct contact of the armour wires to the seawater does not pose an issue as long as the outer sheath is not severely damaged or abraded and the galvanized wires are not abraded dnvgl rp 0360 dnvgl rp 2016 considers the excessive abrasion and degradation of the outer sheath to be a serviceability limit state dnvgl rp 0360 dnvgl rp 2016 indicates that the lateral movement of the cable should be minimized to ensure that the outer sheath will not be abraded furthermore the same reference highlights that it is essential to ensure that the cable has sufficient abrasion resistance to ensure that the outer sheath of the cable is not damaged reda et al 2017 2020 and dnvgl rp 0360 dnvgl rp 2016 emphasize that the tubular products which are utilized to provide stability or protection for the pipeline should be designed to ensure abrasion resistance thereby increasing the cable life under the impact of harsh environmental loads the outer surface of the cable and umbilical provides resistance against corrosion the requirements outlined in dnvgl rp 0360 dnvgl rp 2016 state that the corrosion impact of the seawater on armouring wires should be considered to retain the cable capability to withstand external forces and maintain tensile strength for possible repair work in this paper recent incidents associated with abrasion of the outer surface of subsea cables and umbilicals are discussed the main purpose of the paper is to raise awareness and highlight the importance of protecting the subsea cables and umbilicals from severe abrasion additionally the paper presents some strategies by which one may protect the cable and its armour in the instance where the outer sheath of the cable umbilical is excessively damaged due to abrasion five incidents are presented where the outer sheath of the subsea cables and umbilicals were severely damaged the first incident occurred during the shore pull of a subsea cable while the second incident was a result of an anchor dragging an exposed subsea cable on the seafloor the third incident was due to cable instability at the shore approach area while in the fourth incident the cable was left in a free hanging position against a bellmouth which caused abrasion to the outer sheath of the cable this fourth incident provides an excellent example of the wide range of different configurations that can potentially lead to abrasion when the cable moves such that a free span appears it may be prone to vortex induced vibrations due to the combined effects of currents and waves which though causing no significant cumulated displacement can cause some small high frequency two way displacements this phenomenon may be dramatic in terms of abrasion cable abrasion in the fifth incident occurred at a crossing location and was due to the lateral movement of the crossing cable over the crossed cable under the influence of hydrodynamic forces appendix a shows the main definitions used in the paper some are taken from dnvgl rp 2016 american petroleum instit 2017 american petroleum instit 2014 dnv 2017b 2 is abrasion an issue a recent study reda et al 2016a indicated that 35 4 22 9 and 11 5 of all failures in the medium voltage subsea power cable system in greece were related to anchoring fishing and instability events respectively as shown in fig 1 fig 2 shows a proportion of cable faults by cause from a database containing 2162 records spanning the years 1959 2006 reda et al 2016a it can be seen that 14 6 44 4 and 3 7 of all cable faults were due to anchoring fishing and abrasion respectively it should be noted that anchoring and fishing failures also involve abrasion damage as a precursor to failure a recent study strang moran 2020 indicated that 8 of all recorded cable failures were due to external damage which in turn was primarily due to instability from the surrounding conditions see fig 3 the same study highlighted that 46 of recorded failures were due to installation the installation failure mode included cables being handled outside of their specifications and insufficient burial of the cable furthermore the study revealed that 15 of cable failures were due to cable design the study stated that unsuitable cable design can be a reason for components failing during asset operation this includes cable designs not being able to withstand the harsh conditions associated with offshore wind farms lucas and harrington 2016 explained that cable abrasion associated with lateral movement inevitably leads to cable failure over time as shown in fig 4 it was indicated that abrasion of the outer sheath of the cable can lead to fibre failure and cable breakage in the current climate any failure of subsea cables results in a significant loss of revenue due to business interruption recently subsea cables with double armours are increasingly exhibiting abrasion related faults in shallow water lucas and harrington 2016 the same analysis showed that abrasion was a result of the movement and oscillation associated with hydrodynamic forces flynn 2015 presented many recent cable failures associated with abrasion of the outer sheath fig 5 depicts a tensile armour wire rupture of a flexible pipe caused by abrasion as outlined in marinhoet al 2007 contact or clashes between the flexible riser and platform or another flexible riser occurs commonly due to the movement of the hosting platform this is especially common in semi submersible units these interferences may promote not only damage to and abrasion of the external sheath but also lead to the rupture of tensile armours caused by corrosion abrasion and or fatigue and may ultimately result in flexible riser failure there is an intermediate state before breakage an outer sheath failure allows armour layer re arrangement by releasing the pre stress of the manufacturing process this may significantly change its global mechanical properties by modifying for example its torque balance o brien and picksley o brien and picksley 2001 indicated that damage to the external sheath of the flexible pipe during installation is the most common failure incident accounting for 25 of all damage or failure incidents surveyed the same study highlighted that external sheath damage during installation leads to a reduction in the cable life 3 outer sheath cables and umbilicals are required to be covered by an outer sheath which provides overall protection secures the armouring during handling and installation and assists in distributing forces arising from handling and installation in other words the outer sheath provides additional protection and cushioning to the cable umbilical against handling and abrasion the cable umbilical has either an external sheath consisting of a double layer of polypropylene pp roving yarn or linear low density polyethylene lldp or high density polyethylene hdpe extruded over the armour layers for external abrasion chemical and water resistance fig 6 shows an outer sheath made of pp roving yarn left versus extruded hdpe right figs 7 and 8 show a telescopic view of a subsea cable with a pp roving yarn outer sheath and an extruded hdpe outer sheath respectively the outer layer of rovings yarns or extruded hdpe is applied over the outer armour layer this is in part to enable easy cable umbilical identification and visibility employing colour in the case where rovings yarns are used the rovings yarns are anchored to the armour wires through a bitumen slushing compound applied immediately before the application of the rovings yarns this is to provide a positive location during handling and installation and to increase the effectiveness of the armour s corrosion protection 3 1 advantages of rovings yarns cost effective alternative to the thermoplastic sheathing providing a typical saving of anywhere between 5 and 10 of the cable umbilical cost can be applied at the same time as armouring in the instance of a single armour layer product providing a small schedule benefit generally used with a single layer of armour to allow for coilable cable design power cables only lower assembly stiffness lower assembly weight in the air 3 2 disadvantages of rovings yarns more susceptible to abrasion damage and in the instance of an interruption can unwind do not provide a clean face for sealing at a j tube entry point corrosion inhibitor requires sealing thus seal application cannot be achieved in the presence of rovings yarns only suitable for static cable umbilicals do not provide impact protection bitumen can soften leak when stored in a high temperature environment 4 field incidents 4 1 incident 1 recently the outer sheath of a subsea cable was damaged due to abrasion during the shore pull of a subsea cable the damage took place because the shore pull of the cable was carried out in complete violation of the approved installation method statement and procedures the cable was dragged along the rocky seabed resulting in visible damage to the cable the installation procedure required buoyancy floater units to be attached to the cable at designated locations along the cable to ensure the floatation of the cable i e cable to be buoyant and to guarantee that the cable would not be dragged across the rough rocky seabed excessive buoyancy units were not desirable by the cable lay contractor this is in part because the buoyancy units involve additional work that must be performed in terms of the attachment and removal of units it should be noted that the installation contractor did not wish to use buoyancy units because unacceptable curvatures can occur when the buoyancy modules are progressively released this shows that the installation contractors tend to prioritise the ultimate limit state in terms of curvature and effective tension while ignoring the abrasion limit of the outer sheath many installation contractors consider the outer sheath to be sacrificial and believe that no harm can occur to the cable even if the outer sheath is damaged it can be seen from fig 9 that signs of damage to the outer sheath of the subsea cable are visible furthermore it is evident that insufficient buoyancy units were attached to the cable fig 10 illustrates a typical onshore pull arrangement it is a pictorial description of how an onshore pull is conducted for subsea cables using buoyancy modules it can be seen that the onshore spread is comprised of a linear winch and the associated reel and reel winders a back anchor may be used depending on the capacity of the winch and pulling force the offshore spread is made up of the cable lay vessel and smaller support vessels required for the collection of the buoyancy units after the completion of the shore pull once the pulling head reaches the target location on the beach the cable lay vessel continues laying the cable towards the offshore facility divers following the shore pull remove the buoyancy units following the removal of the buoyancy units the cable is lowered onto the sediment the location of the cable lay vessel in reference to the beach directly influences the pulling load however the location of the cable lay vessel is determined by the bathymetry of the landfall it is evident from fig 11 that there are a significantly greater number of buoyancy units attached to the cable compared to that of fig 9 fig 12 illustrates the damage that occurred to the outer serving yarn almost the entire length of the cable from the beach right up to the cable lay vessel experienced some degree of damage it is recommended that a detailed survey be performed of the shore before selecting the location of the shore pull activity to investigate the type of seafloor and determine whether or not the cable can be dragged safely across it the mitigation procedure adopted to prevent the damage of the outer sheath is given in section 6 0 the data of the damage are as follows fibre optic cable outside diameter 38 mm type of outer sheath two layers of polypropylene yarns thickness of outer sheath 5 mm and submerged weight of cable 3 1 kg m 4 2 incident 2 this case study is an incident where an anchor caused a horizontal displacement for a subsea fibre optic cable during the as built survey it was observed that a boat anchor was tangled with a subsea cable as illustrated in fig 13 additionally it was found that a deviation from the indicated as laid position occurred for a 950 m long section of the cable a maximum deviation of 65 m was reported as highlighted in fig 14 a visual inspection revealed the following a 50 m long section of the cable appeared to have suffered physical and mechanical damages to the outer sheathing of the cable at location 1 as indicated in figs 15 and 16 two sections one 10 m long and the other 15 m long suffered such extensive damages that the outer sheathing had been completely removed leaving the armour fully exposed as illustrated in fig 17 it should be noted that the cable was dragged in the manner it was because two secondary stabilization mattresses were installed at a distance of 950 m from each other as illustrated in fig 14 the size of the anchor that had become entangled with the cable was small therefore the applied contact force between the cable and the anchor was not sufficient to cause severe damage to the cable or the armour it is known that the contact between an anchor and a subsea cable is seldom catastrophic as the applied force by a moving anchor is largely dependent on the mass of the anchor the anchoring hazard may arise from negligent anchoring insufficient protection for the cable emergency anchoring or anchor dragging as the result of a vessel being inadequately controlled or piloted the anchor was found to be the one that is typically used by fishermen to retrieve fishing traps see fig 18 in some geographical locations fish trapping is the most widely used fishing method fishermen drop traps and retrieve them using a boat anchor after 5 20 days however several times they miss the trap altogether and entangle their anchor in a cable instead fishermen attempt to retrieve their anchor by dragging and pulling on the anchor thereby inadvertently dragging the cable horizontally this results in damage to the outer sheathing of the cable on many occasions they fail to retrieve the anchor entirely and end up cutting the wire connected to the anchor the abrasion of the cable took place due to anchor dragging to minimize this risk the following recommendations are usually made 1 during cable routing the subsea cable is routed into deep water wherever practical to avoid interference with baskets and anchors associated with traditional fishing methods 2 during the route selection of the cable it is advisable to use the historical ais automatic identification system data to visualize the marine traffic intensity in the proximity of the cable route a new cable route along with the data from ais are shown in fig 19 3 newly installed cables are more prone to damage as other users are as yet unaware of the position of the new cable on the seafloor 4 newly installed cables should be added to navigational charts 5 once the cable is in service it is recommended to use the ais cable monitoring and notification system to identify the vessel or ship that caused the damage of the cable to recover the cost of repair however it should be highlighted that not all vessels are required to install the ais system with only those vessels with a capacity greater than 300 tonnes required to install it the international maritime organisation imo requires that the ais system be fitted aboard any international voyaging ship with a gross tonnage greater than 300 tonnes and to all passenger ships irrespective of their size based on this it can be seen that almost all commercial vessels and the vast majority of private vessels that might pose a risk to cables are covered 6 liaise with the fishing community to inform them of any new cable route and the installation schedule 7 there is a misunderstanding within the industry that cables laid on a seabed tend to bury themselves and thus over time the cable will be protected based on this many cable owners ignore the requirements of on bottom stability and burial while self burial does occur it is predominantly dependent on soil classification and the submerged weight of the cable 8 for the static cable it is cheaper to use yarn sheathing however when one takes into consideration the financial burden of adverse events for areas where the marine traffic and in particular the fishing activity is anticipated to be high it is recommended that an extruded outer external sheath be used instead by doing so the damage to the outer sheath will not propagate as quickly along the length of the cable and additionally the smooth external surface may facilitate anchor sliding the mitigation procedure adopted to ensure that the armour layer will not be progressively damaged is given in section 6 0 the data of the damage are as follows fibre optic cable outside diameter 38 mm type of outer sheath two layers of polypropylene yarns thickness of outer sheath 5 mm and submerged weight of cable 3 1 kg m 4 3 incident 3 this incident is an instance of abrasion caused by the instability of the subsea cable in the shore approach area the on bottom stability study undertaken on this cable indicated that the cable should be covered by a secondary stabilization measure such as concrete mattresses immediately following the shore pull this is in part because the cable was not stable under the influence of hydrodynamic forces due to unforeseen circumstances the installation of the secondary stabilization measure was delayed as a result of the slimming effect of waves and hydrodynamic forces the outer sheath of the cable was damaged as can be seen from figs 20 and 21 the cable was laid on a rocky seabed the photo was taken during low tide the tension in the cable was high which aided in reducing the extent of the damage to the cable if the tension in the cable had been low the extent of the damage to the outer sheath would have been much greater it is recommended that more attention be given to the requirements of stabilizing the cable before planning for the construction campaign however if there is a delay expected between the time of installation of the cable and the time of stabilizing the cable and all the rocks are covered by a hard fouling layer with aggressive shape it is recommended that an hdpe external layer be used the most obvious mitigation measure is that the cable be automatically buried at landing however this is not a classical situation most umbilical cable manufacturers can manufacture the two ends of the cable with extruded outer sheaths i e 100 m of extruded outer sheaths at each end with yarn outer sheath in between as illustrated in fig 22 this arrangement is typically adopted when the umbilical cable is pulled into two j tubes so that a good seal around the umbilical cable at the j tube entry is achieved finally detailed surveys using divers should be undertaken of the area in the vicinity of the shore approach before installation the shore approach area should not be ignored during the geophysical and geotechnical surveys due to the shallow water depth workability limitations of the rov remote operated vehicle and the requirements of shallow water barges the mitigation measure adopted is given in section 5 0 the data of the damage are as follows composite cable power fibre optic outside diameter 124 mm type of outer sheath two layers of polypropylene yarns thickness of outer sheath 5 4 mm and submerged weight of cable 23 kg m 4 4 incident 4 in this incident while preparing to install a j tube seal on a cable divers reported damage to the yarn outer sheath of the cable at the j tube bellmouth a detailed video survey was carried out which covered the entire length between the j tube bellmouth and bend restrictor the yarn outer sheath was found to be damaged and bunched up over a distance of approximately 2 m between the end of the bend stiffener and the bellmouth the investigation uncovered that the centralizer and bend restrictor had been left in a free hanging position as per fig 23 the cable then began to rub against the bellmouth and the bend restrictor began to slide downward causing abrasion as shown in fig 24 snapshots of the cable section depicting the damage to the outer sheath are given in figs 23 26 the investigations also indicated that the installation contractor did not procure the right j tube seal as specified in the engineering drawings the original divers left the j tube seal and bend the restrictor in a free hanging position until subsequent divers who came to install the correct j tube seal discovered the damage to the outer sheath the mitigation measure adopted is given in section 6 0 the data of the damage are as follows composite cable power fibre optic outside diameter 115 mm type of outer sheath one layer of polypropylene yarn thickness of outer sheath 3 mm and submerged weight of cable 22 kg m 4 5 incident 5 this incident of abrasion occurred at the crossing location between a crossing cable 132 kv and a crossed cable 33 kv fig 27 shows that the crossing cable is laid directly on top of the crossed cable at the crossing location a bend restrictor is installed around the 132 kv cable this is because the crossing cable is designed to move laterally atop the crossed cable a recent rov survey was undertaken at this crossing location as demonstrated in figs 28 and 29 the figures show that the yarn outer sheath of the crossed cable is abraded due to the lateral movement of the crossing bend restrictor cable the extent of damage to the abraded outer sheath was approximately 1 m it should be noted that this is an example of bad crossing design practice it was recommended that a hard shell be installed on the crossed cable rather than placing the crossing cable inside a bend restrictor and placing both directly on top of the crossed cable the rov survey indicated that no damage or abrasion was observed on the bend restrictor at the crossing location fig 30 shows the abraded section of the crossed cable this photo was taken after pulling the crossing cable aside to perform the rectification procedures the data of the crossing cable are as follows composite cable power fibre optic outside diameter 191 mm type of outer sheath two layers of polypropylene yarns thickness of outer sheath 4 mm and submerged weight of cable 41 kg m 5 incidents mitigation and corrective measures realistically partial damage to the yarn or roving outer sheath cannot be avoided most subsea cables have double layers of pp yarn and bitumen because of this the galvanized steel wires are protected by the inner pp yarn and the outer pp yarns can be used for abrasion sacrifice this is akin to cathodic protection which can be damaged during cable installation the damaged or loose pp yarns shown in these photos do not necessarily constitute damage to the cable as they would not affect the integrity of the cable as such the loose pp yarn can be left as is cut or wrapped with a normal binder to make it tidy and to address safety concerns however these events occurred in critical areas which were subject to hydrodynamic loads as such it was suggested that these cables should be prevented from experiencing any further movement under the influence of hydrodynamic loads as this would speed up the pp yarn and galvanized steel wire abrasion to address these recommendations mitigation measures were implemented to ensure the situation would not worsen all of the incidents listed in sections 5 1 to 5 5 were associated with subsea fibre optics cables hence to ensure that the cables were fit for the purpose the fibres were tested using optical time domain reflectometry otdr which measures loss against distance in the operating window specified to the ends of the fibre the results were compared with results obtained from tests undertaken before cable lay and during cable installation to ensure that the exposed armour will not be damaged any further and to avoid damage to the second armour layer articulated ducting as shown in figs 31 33 was installed on the cable where the damage took place for incidents 1 and 3 articulated padding made of polyurethane was used to protect the armour from further abrasion for incident 3 rock bolts were used to minimize the lateral movement of the cable as per the requirements of the on bottom stability analysis for incident 2 articulated ducting made of cast iron was employed on the damaged cable to provide the required protection against the traps associated with fishing activities additionally rock bolts were used to ensure that no dragging would take place for the cable for incident 4 it was suggested that the fibre optics cable should not be left in the hanging position under the influence of hydrodynamic loads as doing so would speed up the pp yarn and galvanized steel wire abrasion to ensure that the cable would not remain in frictional contact with the j tube bellmouth under the action of sea bottom ocean currents and to guarantee that the galvanized steel wires armour would not be abraded further a j tube centralizer seal and bend restrictor were immediately installed as per fig 34 following this otdr tests were conducted to ensure that the fibre optics were still functioning for incident 5 pre filled grout bags were placed on top of the crossed cable to achieve a positive separation between the crossing cable and the crossed cable this ensured that no further damage will occur to the yarn outer sheath fig 35 illustrates both cables after deployment of the pre filled grout bags the width of the pre filled grout bag was selected such that it ensures the crossing cable will not fall off the grout bags and come in direct contact with the crossed cable the width of the pre filled grout was determined based on dynamic finite element analyses the crossed cable was left without any repair to the yarn outer sheath as the damage was at the top of the crossed cable and any lateral movement of the crossing cable would not worsen the damage to the armour wires fig 35 also shows that the installation of grout bags causes a free span to occur from the edge of the grout bags until the point where the cable touches down on the mattresses these free spans were produced on both sides therefore it was important to check that these free spans of crossing cable were not prone to vortex induced vibrations viv 6 operating experience of rovings yarns recently results from an out of straightness survey undertaken on a 2000 km length of subsea cable found that the cable had moved laterally under the influence of hydrodynamic forces as illustrated in figs 36 and 37 it is evident from the figures that the cable movement under hydrodynamic loads was factual and that this is not merely an academic issue based on the rov survey undertaken on a 2000 km length of subsea cable the size of the subsea cable was found to vary from 30 mm to 200 mm the cable was covered with either a pp roving yarn outer sheath or an extruded outer sheath the cable was also laid on different soil types as highlighted in table 1 the operational performance of the extruded outer sheath was excellent overall although the lateral movement of the subsea cable on the seabed did occur the survey demonstrated that if the cable had achieved self burial then the pp roving outer sheath remained in excellent condition as shown in fig 38 however in locations where the lateral displacement was more severe and indeed even when the lateral movement was small there was evidence of abrasion and damage to the pp roving outer sheath for every type of soil studied fig 38 shows examples where the pp roving yarn outer sheath was in excellent condition fig 39 illustrates a section of the cable that was stabilized by two spaced mattresses to prevent the cable from moving laterally under the extreme metocean condition it is evident from the figure that the pp roving outer sheath is in excellent condition fig 40 shows the cable at different locations the cable here was designed to be stable and the cable is restrained by rocks the cable pp roving outer sheath is intact and in excellent condition fig 41 shows the cable at a crossing location where the cable was allowed to move laterally over the concrete mattresses fig 42 illustrates a section of the cable designed to move laterally on the seabed both sections have an extruded outer sheath it is clear that the outer sheath is in excellent condition for both cases fig 43 depicts a section of the cable that was designed to allow some lateral movement as per dnv 2017a because of this the pp roving outer sheath was damaged due to abrasion from the seabed during the on bottom stability design the designer focused on the ultimate limit of the umbilical cable in terms of effective tension and minimum bend radius many designers tend to overlook the abrasion limit of the outer sheath and its importance in protecting the armour 7 options for cable protection this section presents some feasible options to stabilize the cable umbilical in situations where the lateral movement of the cable umbilical under the influence of hydrodynamic loads may abrade the outer sheath and hence compromise the integrity of the cable umbilical the following options can be utilized to protect against abrasion articulated pipes or ducts concrete mattresses rock dumping and trenching and burying it should be noted that this section touches only on articulated pipes as this option is not covered adequately in the current literature the other options are discussed extensively in many articles such as reda et al 2019b palmer and king 2004 bai and bai 2014 articulated pipes ap consist of a series of metallic half shell clamps collars that interlock to form articulated half shell modules that create a protective cover comparable to vertebrae around the cable as illustrated by fig 44 this technique is attractive because it also stabilizes the cable through added weight while providing high mechanical protection from impact and abrasion in areas where the conventional burial or trenching methods would be environmentally damaging fig 45 shows how the articulated pipes are arranged next to a cable waiting for the divers to start the installation process figs 46 and 47 explain briefly how the divers install the articulated piping around the subsea cable in some cases the articulated piping installed around the cable will not be enough to achieve the required level of stability in such situations rock bolts or saddles are used to achieve the required stability fig 48 shows the rock bolt saddle and the rod bolt before installation in a subsea environment the concept of the rock bolt can be explained in fig 49 figs 50 and 51 show how the divers install the rock bolt on the articulated padding the on bottom stability design will be utilized to define the spacing between rock bolts to determine the reaction loads on the rock bolts and to select the capacity as well as the depth of the selected rod bolt soil boring should typically be undertaken to assess the geotechnical characteristics of the seabed material to select a suitable piling system 8 conclusions and recommendations the roving yarn layers play a sacrificial role in the cable and any minor damage incurred during transportation or installation are not considered harmful to the integrity of the cable damage to the outer sheath polypropylene rovings yarns or loose polypropylene yarns does not necessarily constitute damage to the cable or umbilical additionally they do not compromise the integrity of the cable however if the cable umbilical is under repeated lateral or axial movement the outer sheath polypropylene rovings yarns will sustain substantial damage and over time the galvanized layer on the armour can become damaged or scratched damage to the galvanization on the armour leaves the armour wire unprotected which can over time cause the armour to corrode and ultimately break due to the salinity of the seawater once the first armour layer is broken the process will repeat itself on the second armour layer over time the second layer will break down resulting in the exposure of the polyethylene insulated cable which will then suffer the effects of abrasion the pp roving yarn outer sheath is fit for purpose if the cable is in a trench or if the cable is designed according to the absolute stability criteria defined in dnvgl rp f109 however if the cable with pp roving yarn outer sheath is subject to lateral movement the roving yarn abrades quickly for its commercial benefits it is worth investigating the option of strapping plastic sleeves around the cable umbilical in areas where repeated abrasion is expected to maintain the integrity of rovings yarns for the remainder of the cable umbilical life since the roving yarn outer sheath does not provide a clean smooth surface for sealing at a j tube entry point corrosion inhibitor requires sealing seal application cannot be achieved in the presence of rovings yarns it is recommended that sheathed sections be utilized at the ends from the hang off arrangement up to the exit of the j tube with rovings for the remaining length the dynamic umbilical cable is sensitive to environmental loading therefore the touchdown point changes depending upon the vessel movement and excursions motion at the touchdown zone on the seabed should be avoided or minimized using stabilization protection devices and anchoring devices to reduce the risk of abrasion table 2 provides recommendations that can be implemented before installing any subsea umbilical cable the abovementioned recommendations are based on operational feedback from the field for umbilical and cable systems that are designed to move laterally on the seabed under the influence of hydrodynamic forces regular monitoring surveys will need to be implemented to ensure the safety and integrity of the outer sheath of the umbilical or cable subsea umbilicals cables are an important asset of offshore hydrocarbon field development and renewable wind farms the umbilicals cables can be critical service cables such as main power cables international fibre optic cables or main umbilicals and the consequences of failure to these critical service cables are enormous understandably the consequences of a failure to a low importance cable are not as critical it is recommended that all umbilical cable operators develop umbilical cable integrity management plans the consequences of a partial failure are also significant and may seriously affect the integrity or functionality of the umbilical cable even if they do not initially result in total failure one such consequence is the necessity to replace the cable which is a huge undertaking in terms of both cost and downtime some partial degradation or failure may result in changes to the mechanical properties of the umbilical cable whilst this may not be catastrophic or constitute a total failure it could lead to a change in behaviour response or performance of the cable which may in turn then cause other failure modes or mechanisms to arise for example if the flexibility changes due to partial failure then the response in dynamic conditions could change which could then cause a failure umbilical cable integrity management plans should address the following items estimating potential risk scenarios determining undesirable consequences and the human environmental and economic impact of said consequences identifying potential safeguard options e g mitigation prevention monitoring needed to minimize potential consequences proposing potential repair philosophies appendix a main definitions used in the paper appendix a term definition abrasion abrasion can be described

20622,this paper is the second of two companion papers about the design of subsea cables umbilicals for in service abrasion several case studies of severe abrasion of submarine cables umbilicals and corrective measures undertaken have been documented and presented in the first paper part i case studies the mechanisms of failure due to abrasion are explained in this paper the effect of repeated lateral movement on lldpe linear low density polyethylene extruded outer sheaths of two cable samples was investigated in the first test a cable sample was displaced the equivalent of 12 km over a crushed mineral aggregate while in the second test a cable was subjected to 3 km of displacement under conditions that replicated the touchdown point of a dynamic cable the results of the first test indicated that the overall abrasion was low and acceptable in the second test however the outer sheath was completely worn through the authors recommend the thickness of the outer sheath be increased for cables where uniform abrasion is expected and high abrasion protection units be employed where localized abrasion is expected empirical data is provided to support these recommendations keywords subsea cables subsea umbilicals abrasion outer sheath yarn 1 introduction there is currently a large demand for the global installation of subsea cables umbilicals and flexible pipes in offshore hydrocarbon resources and wind farm energy development among many other uses reda et al 2016a reda et al 2019 reda et al 2016b reda et al 2017 reda et al 2020 li et al 2020a li et al 2021 li et al 2020b li et al 2020c tang et al 2019a tang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 tang et al 2019c silva and soares 2019 ahmed reda et al 2021 where the authors discussed underlying abrasion mechanisms and the undertaken corrective measures excessive lateral movement of the cable could undermine the ultimate limit state accidental limit state as well as serviceability limit state a consequence of severe damage to the outer sheath of the cable is armour corrosion and cable failure reda et al 2017 reda et al 2020 ahmed reda et al 2021 cable failure and breakage can be due to water ingress if the cable is of dry design as this may induce insulation and screen issues and therefore affect electrical serviceability another possible failure scenario of severe damage to the outer sheath is the radial pressure of the extrusion process associated with the application of the outer sheath being locally removed causing the pre stress of the armours to be released this may induce an armour layer re arrangement which may cause buckling of armours this failure is related to a single armoured cable umbilical or a product that is not torsionally balanced when a rock layer is installed to prevent scouring dnvgl rp 0360 dnvgl rp 0360 2016 prohibits the cable catenary from touching the rock to avoid abrasion the same reference lists friction and abrasion as properties that should be submitted by the cable manufacturer if relevant one such instance would be the pulling of a cable across the seabed reda et al 2017 presented an example of a failure of a field coating joint of a crossed pipeline the failure was attributed to the repeated lateral movement of the crossing cable as well as the contact load between the crossed pipeline and the crossing subsea cable reda et al 2017 emphasized that when a subsea cable is designed to allow certain lateral movement under the influence of hydrodynamic forces it is important to ensure that the outer sheath of the cable will not be abraded under the said lateral movement abrasion can be described as the removal of material from a surface as a result of sliding in the case of subsea umbilicals cables the abrasion takes place due to the relative motion of the umbilical cable across the seabed the abrasion experiment herein was designed to inflict the maximum damage to the umbilical extruded outer sheath this was primarily achieved by selecting an abrasive medium in the form of hard coarse and homogeneous quartzitic gravel moh s hardness 7 and applying a high stroke rate of 0 33 hz onto the umbilical surface i e a high momentum the choice of quartzitic gravel over the more common calcite based such as calcarenite fragments of gravel is conservative since offshore sand is often softer with a hardness value of just 3 following an abrasive test according to the french standard lcpc test thuro et al 2007 it was demonstrated that quartz and crystalline rich gravel show very high to extremely high abrasive effects the particle size of the abrasive medium ranged from 4 to 9 mm which is a typical gravel size the extended lcpc test performed in thuro et al 2007 illustrated that a reduction in silt and clay particle size reduced the abrasive effect dramatically finally the homogeneity of the quartzitic abrasive material is expected to increase the effect of abrasion since offshore materials are expected to be heterogeneous with varying particle size and hardness in accordance with their variable depositional environment in light of the above it is evident that the outcome of the abrasion test applies to silt sand and clay environments it should be noted that the abrasive media initially selected was calcarenite fragments of medium gravel size 0 2 mm however this was changed during the test to crushed mineral aggregate derived from blue flints this is because the calcarenite fragments were too soft to cause any abrasion or reduction in thickness of the outer sheath of the umbilical sample this also proves that the abrasion of the lldpe extruded outer sheath by fine sand will be insignificant it should be noted that the abrasion test for the subsea cable umbilical is not an industry standard test and there are currently no standard tests provided in any cable or umbilical standards the abrasion test conducted herein is not equivalent to the abrasion test detailed in the iec 60299 standards iec 60299 2014 as highlighted in flynn 2015 the abrasion test detailed in the iec 60299 standards was designed for the umbilical during the laying operation that test therefore does not reflect the susceptibility of the umbilical to abrasion when it is displaced along the seabed in a working environment this paper presents the results from a uniform abrasion test undertaken on an umbilical with an extruded outer sheath the umbilical sample was displaced over 40 000 cycles which equates to 12 km of total lateral displacement the test was conducted to evaluate the performance of the extruded lldpe outer sheath when subject to abrasion another objective of the test was to assess how much protection the outer sheath provides for the armouring of the cable and umbilical a second localized abrasion test was conducted to investigate the performance of the lldpe extruded outer sheath under repeated movement this was an attempt to replicate the touchdown point of a dynamic cable or umbilical the umbilical sample was displaced over 10 000 cycles approximately 3 km of lateral movement in this paper an incident is presented to confirm the findings from the localized abrasion test this incident is associated with umbilical failure due to localized abrasion and the damage to armour wires at the riser touchdown point the umbilical was connecting the plem pipeline end manifold to an spm single point mooring lastly a formula was developed to calculate abrasion versus displacement the formula was developed using the results of the physical abrasion test conducted as part of this work this article should be read in conjunction with reda thiedeman mckee sultan shahin elgazzar 2 why abrasion occurs when the maximum lateral and vertical hydrodynamic loads acting on an umbilical cable from the maximum wave and steady current is greater than the soil resistance the umbilical cable will start to move laterally across the seabed causing the outer sheath of the umbilical cable to abrade as outlined in fig 1 the rate of abrasion is dependent on the soil type e g rock sand clay submerged weight of the umbilical cable and severity of the lateral movement the abrasion will be aggressive in the case where the umbilical cable is laid upon hard seabeds such as rock abrasion will also take place in soft soil but to a lesser extent in some situations embedment of the umbilical cable occurs during the service life when the umbilical cable is laid on soft soil the embedment is caused by the following reasons cyclic movement under waves and current action scouring seabed mobility and or liquefaction this embedment is beneficial to the umbilical cable for the following reasons it provides shelter to the umbilical cable from hydrodynamic loads hence causes a reduction in the hydrodynamic load experienced by the umbilical cable it increases passive resistance i e increased soil resistance it reduces lateral movement of the umbilical cable hence minimises or nullifies the risk of abrasion 3 importance of armour wire the subsea cable umbilical must include at least one layer of galvanized steel wire armour of adequate diameter to meet the following conditions protects the cable umbilical during installation including from any burial equipment and provides strength for laying from an umbilical installation vessel once installed the armour must achieve the following protects to the cable umbilical in the unlikely event that it is lifted to the surface for repair assists with the on bottom stability of the cable umbilical under installation conditions and provides some level of protection to the cable umbilical in the unlikely event that it is impacted by fishing trawling gear the armour should be corrosion resistant and able to withstand the strain and stress fatigue experienced during manufacture installation and service armour wires are applied under uniform tension which limit rotation under varying tensions armoured umbilicals cables are torque balanced and can have a single or double wire armouring depending on their intended use as static or dynamic cables single layer armour umbilical cable is not fully torque balanced however the manufacturer can apply a contra helical metallic tape over the armour package to address this imbalance to an extent tension control during installation is more important for single layer armoured products generally there are limits to how deep a single layer armoured umbilical cable can be installed as determined by the manufacturer too much tension can pull the helix out while insufficient tension can lead to cable hockling this risk is much lower for torque balanced double layer armoured products calculations should be provided to prove that the armour will fulfil the conditions listed above note that armour can be minimized or not used at all if it can be demonstrated that the unarmoured cable umbilical can withstand all the load conditions described above 4 consequences of outer sheath damage many outcomes can arise from the exposure of cable umbilical armour wires as a result of damage to the outer sheath for cables umbilicals installed in a static configuration and where galvanized steel armour wires are used the following situations can arise in the case where the sheath is damaged but the armour wire coating remains intact the exposed armour wires will be protected for a short period until there is a loss in the armour wire coating due to galvanic attack once the coating is reduced and finally removed to expose the bare carbon steel material beneath a full blown corrosion cell will commence which will lead to a steady material loss over time while the cable umbilical internal components such as the hoses and cables etc will remain functional there will be a reduced load capability of the armour wire package over time significant degradation to the armour wire may prohibit the cable umbilical from being retrieved correctly in the case where the sheath and the armour wire coating are both damaged corrosion will commence as soon as the damaged wires come in contact with seawater while the umbilical internal components such as the hoses and cables etc will remain functional there will be a reduced load capability of the armour wire package over time significant degradation to the armour wire may prohibit the cable umbilical from being retrieved properly the following notes should be considered in all of the above cases should the damaged section of cable umbilical be buried or rock dumped then due to a lack of re circulating oxygen the corrosion of the armour wires will be reduced however over time the armour wire capability will still be compromised in all of the above cases as long as the damage is limited to the outer sheath then the internal components should be able to function without issue where there is significant corrosion to the exposed armour wires due to the extended duration of the exposure the strength of the armour package may be compromised such that retrieval may become problematic for dynamic cables umbilicals even minor sheath damage can evolve into more serious issues and must be retrieved and repaired or even replaced immediately some partial degradation or failure of the armour may result in changes to the mechanical properties of the umbilical cable whilst this may not be catastrophic or result in total failure it can lead to a change in the behaviour response or performance of the cable which may in turn cause other failure modes or mechanisms to arise for example if the flexibility changes due to partial failure then its response in dynamic conditions can change and could then cause a total failure the number of allowable spooling and unspooling cycles i e coiling and uncoiling should be discussed and agreed upon with the manufacturer this is because during the spooling and unspooling processes armour re arrangement takes place in conjunction with the release of the pre stress induced in the armour layer in other words if coiling uncoiling limits are exceeded the cable becomes difficult to handle as the helix arrangement is disturbed once the outer sheath is damaged or abraded the armour will get damaged quickly it is worth mentioning that several online fault locating techniques for power lines based on voltage current characteristics and travelling waves have been presented in the literature abu siada et al 2020 abu siada 2019 tashakkori et al 2020 wijayasuwarno and abu siada 2018 these techniques can be adapted to detect the location and level of outer sheath damage to subsea cables in real time however this requires further investigation which is beyond the scope of this paper 5 on bottom stability design philosophy many studies assess on bottom stability for pipelines are available in the literature e g yu et al 2013 youssef et al 2013 tripepi et al 2018 de lima et al 2011 baioco et al 2018 ji and ong 2019 gagliano 2007 li and ong 2016 ji et al 2017 ameh and ameh 2019 pipeline stability is typically designed following the requirements of dnv gl os f101 dnv 2017b and dnvgl rp f109 dnv 2017a standards although these standards are not directly applicable to the design of umbilical cable particularly in regards to their safety objectives their guidelines are being used to determine umbilical cable stabilisation requirements this is not an unreasonable approach given the absence of specific design codes addressing the stabilisation of subsea umbilicals cables the stability analysis of an umbilical cable involves the assessment of umbilical cable integrity and its response on a seabed when subjected to hydrodynamic forces the integrity of an umbilical cable designed following dnv gl os f101 iec 60299 2014 standards is ensured through a limit state approach which guarantees that the established safety objectives are met the safety objectives aim at mitigating adverse consequences and surviving extreme events while sustaining functional loads to evaluate whether the risk of a failure event is acceptable or not acceptance criteria are required such acceptance criteria are based on satisfying acceptable limits for the risks to human safety the environment and the economy the acceptance criteria defined in the dnvgl os f101 dnv 2017b standards are based on achieving target reliability levels for the different identified limit states all relevant failure modes formulated in terms of limit states should be considered in the design the dnvgl os f101 dnv 2017b standards use an lrfd load and resistance factor design approach where partial safety factors are applied to make sure that the acceptance criteria have been satisfied the partial safety factors deal with uncertainty in loads and resistance and are applied to ensure that the target reliability level probability of failure is achieved the partial safety factors are applied based on formulated failure criteria e g load controlled bending moment criteria and are used to satisfy a specific pipeline failure probability the main failure criterion that has been identified for umbilical cable instability is exceeding the effective tension and bend radius beyond the allowable limit specified by the umbilical cable manufacture this results from high bending moments due to umbilical cable displacement repeated umbilical cable lateral displacement itself is not considered a failure criterion unless it leads to excessive abrasion of the outer sheath risk of umbilical cable integrity or interruption of umbilical cable operation displacement should however be used as a design guideline to assess the degree of umbilical cable stability and severity of abrasion of the outer sheath the approach normally used for the on bottom stability design of an umbilical cable can be summarised as follows identification of limit states and definition of acceptance criteria ultimate limit state serviceability limit state and accidental limit state the limit state defines a condition beyond which the design requirements are no longer satisfied each limit state is associated with acceptance criteria including displacement local buckling and integrity which determines whether or not the limit state has been satisfied determination of the metocean condition return period to be applied based on the limit state being assessed the environmental return period to be applied will depend on the limit state being considered and the safety class refer to table 1 performing screening assessments static stability analyses to identify areas that are not a stability concern areas that require secondary stabilisations and areas which require more advanced analyses performing dynamic analyses for areas where optimisation is required and where an understanding of the umbilical cable response is required evaluating the acceptance of umbilical cable response based on the defined acceptance criteria determining primary e g increase the number of armour layers and secondary stabilisation requirements e g mattresses and rock bolts table 1 presents the environmental return period that needs to be applied for the applicable limit state the return period in the analysis depends on the limit state being considered 5 1 design aspects the evaluation of umbilical cable stability involves the consideration of the following aspects wave and current kinematics acting on the umbilical cable hydrodynamic loads induced by the combined wave and current kinematics lateral and vertical resistance to hydrodynamic loads analysis methodology static and dynamic acceptance criteria and pipeline integrity 5 2 environmental loads hydrodynamic loads on the umbilical cable are affected by the following wave and current kinematics flow condition reynolds number keulegan carpenter number and current to wave ratio outside umbilical cable diameter umbilical cable motion separation from the seabed and sheltering embedment or trenching additional secondary stabilisation attracting hydrodynamic loads to the umbilical cable 5 3 lateral and vertical resistance lateral and vertical resistance to hydrodynamic loads is provided using primary stabilisation e g increasing submerged weight of the umbilical cable by increasing the number of armour layers and secondary stabilisation e g concrete mattresses rock dumping and rock bolts methods wherever required resistance to lateral loads can be provided by means of seabed friction passive soil resistance or trenching vertical resistance can be provided by means of umbilical cable weight anchors or burial 5 4 analysis methodology two fundamental approaches are used to assess umbilical cable stability 5 4 1 static approach in this approach the pipeline is considered stable if the maximum lateral and vertical hydrodynamic loads acting on the umbilical cable from the maximum wave and steady current multiplied by a safety factor is less than the soil resistance the maximum lift force from the maximum wave multiplied by a safety factor is less than the submerged weight of the umbilical cable the umbilical cable is considered statically stable when the restraining forces exceed the hydrodynamic loads i e the horizontal restraining forces exceed the horizontal hydrodynamic loads fig 2 shows the forces considered in the 2d force balance approach i e absolute stability approach 5 4 2 dynamic approach dynamic analysis involves the full dynamic simulation of an umbilical cable on the seabed subjected to relevant storm conditions including modelling of soil resistance hydrodynamic forces boundary conditions and dynamic responses the results of the analysis are used to determine the umbilical cable displacement bend radius and effective tension the dynamic analysis is performed using finite element programs such as ansys abaqus or orcaflex to model the umbilical cable response to hydrodynamic forces acting on it refer to 4 5 for more details regarding static and dynamic approaches 6 abrasion test under uniform constant load 6 1 purpose the following section highlights the results of an abrasion test undertaken on a subsea cable with an extruded lldpe outer sheath the main objective of the test was to evaluate the performance of the extruded lldpe outer sheath when subjected to abrasion from crushed mineral aggregate derived from blue flints a secondary objective of the test was to assess how much protection the outer sheath of the umbilical provides to the armouring this test replicates the section of the cable umbilical that rests in a flat position on a seabed and moves horizontally under hydrodynamic forces a reciprocating abrasion rig was used in the test to represent the seabed interaction between the umbilical cable and the abrasive media the rig moves the sample back and forth over a bed of immersed abrasive media under a constant vertical load 6 2 abrasion test during the test the test rig displaced the umbilical sample over a bed of crushed mineral aggregate derived from blue flintag under a uniform constant vertical load of 43 kg the test sample was equivalent to the self weight of the test frame 34 kg plus the weight of the sample itself 9 kg as illustrated in figs 3 6 the length of the umbilical and steel frame was 400 mm the unit weight of the sample was 107 5 kg m with a specific gravity of approximately 12 the test sample was restrained so that it would not rotate the umbilical tested herein was heavier than the majority of umbilicals in the industry this implies that the results of the test are conservative and that real world abrasion would be less aggressive than that observed in this test figs 7 9 show the umbilical sample fixed to a steel frame before the abrasion test fig 7 shows the measurement locations and the umbilical sample fixed to a steel mandrel to avoid umbilical deflections see fig 8 the test rig was filled with water ensuring that the contact face between the umbilical and abrasive media was submerged measurements of the outer sheath were taken at five locations 25 150 200 250 and 375 mm along the umbilical surface these were termed locations 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively a counter recorded the number of times the cycle was repeated the test rig implemented approximately 20 full cycles forward and back per minute the umbilical sample was displaced over 40 000 cycles which equates to 12 km of lateral displacement as the stroke length was 300 mm this implies that the frequency of the abrasion test was 0 33 hz note that the typical frequency for the oscillating motion of waves is approximately 0 1 hz it is expected that the abrasion rate will be less in cases of lower frequency the cyclic displacement amplitude is approximately 2 8 times the umbilical diameter the test was completed over four days where the lab temperature ranged between 10 c and 15 c no measurement of the water temperature was taken and the water was unheated the test was halted every 1000 cycles for approximately 1 h to measure the thickness of the outer sheath if the umbilical sheath was found to be completely abraded the test was stopped and the number of cycles recorded throughout the test if the abrasive material was found to have deteriorated it was replaced during the test the abrasive medium was changed every 10 000 cycles although this may not be realistic it was done to ensure that the outcome of the uniform abrasion test was robust the breakage of the particles during the abrasion process takes place progressively over many cycles this leads to a reduction in particle size abrasion caused by small particles is less severe than that caused by large particles when all other parameters are constant it should be highlighted that there is no basis for the choice of running the experiment for 40 000 cycles or 12 km of displacement this number was chosen arbitrarily it is not expected that an umbilical cable would ever move 12 km during its design life unless there was a significant instability issue with the umbilical cable and environment 6 3 test protocol to perform and complete the abrasion test satisfactorily the test rig shown in fig 10 should be in the following state 1 before performing the test the testbed should be dry the flintag abrasive material should be placed on top of the testbed and immersed in freshwater so that the water level is just above the top of the flintag 2 the thickness of the umbilical sheath should be measured and the state of the surface recorded photographically the umbilical sample should be fitted into the steel support mandrel securing it into position within the support mandrel with fasteners the mandrel should be secured to the mechanical arm using suitable bolts before lowering the arm into position on the flintag 3 the test should be carried out with inspection and measurements taken every 1000 cycles note that fig 11 shows the test samples at 1000 cycles 4 thickness measurements should be taken at the 6 o clock position on the sample the test sample should be immersed up to the top of the support cradle to a depth of approximately 61 mm as illustrated in fig 9 the same figure shows the ultrasonic thickness gauge used during the test to measure the thickness of the outer sheath at the five locations the thickness gauge measures the thickness of the outer sheath and can measure wall thicknesses in the range of 0 08 mm 635 mm the accuracy of the ultrasonic thickness gauge is 0 001 inch 0 0254 mm 5 the water level should be checked at a maximum of 10 000 cycles along with the condition of the umbilical sample and flintag 6 the orange plates shown in fig 4 flatten the flintag during the stroke of the machine to reduce the digging in effect of the sample into the flintag 7 the test should be stopped at 40 000 cycles and the sample cylinder removed from the mechanical arm for inspection as before 8 the surface of the umbilical sample should be photographed and the remaining sheath thicknesses measured 6 4 abrasive test material fig 12 illustrates the abrasive medium used in the abrasion test of the umbilical sample crushed mineral aggregate derived from blue flints was used to replicate limestone particles it was found that the land based calcarenite fragments of gravel size were breaking down in the water an alternative was to use an insoluble hard material such as sharp granite obtained from a rock supplier or quarry the particle size grading shape hardness and properties of the blue flint is similar to the calcarenite fragments of gravel size that exists subsea the granite particles i e blue flint is harder than the calcarenite fragments of gravel size and as such the abrasion evaluation will be more robust the properties of the abrasive material i e blue flint are given in table 2 6 5 results of abrasion test table 3 highlights the thickness of the outer sheath as measured at the beginning of the test and upon completion of the test the results are given for all five locations and show that the outer sheath suffered relatively minor abrasion even after 12 km of lateral movement this is consistent with field observations the readings are different because of the different initial outer sheath thicknesses associated with manufacturing tolerance it is evident that the abrasion was low and acceptable for the life of the extruded outer sheath even when the test conditions were onerous if a seabed survey reveals that yet harsher conditions may exist in a particular area of seabed then monitoring procedures will need to be implemented for safety it was noted that the rate of reduction of the outer sheath thickness was high during the first loading period up to 15 000 cycles however the rate of reduction in the thickness of the outer sheath was significantly reduced thereafter until the end of the test this indicates that the sheath thickness can be designed to accommodate a large reduction in thickness during the time equivalent of 15 000 cycles as well as the smaller reduction that results thereafter from abrasion till the end of the umbilical life this can result in the ability to select an optimal thickness for the extruded outer sheath that does not compromise the integrity of the umbilical while maintaining cost effectiveness these observations are consistent with the results presented in musiał et al 2020 for polymers this can be explained by the fact that the friction between the outer sheath and the abrasive material changes throughout the test this is because at the initial stage of the process the abrasion gets rid of the irregularities on the sheath surface the sheath measurement readings in table 3 concur with this showing between 0 52 and 0 55 mm of wear as such the authors recommend the thickness of the outer sheath to be increased by 0 6 mm for cables photographs fig a 1 to a 9 of the outer sheath during the various testing stages are given in appendix a 6 6 proposed mathematical model to estimate how the sheath thickness changes with service time depth measurements were collected every 5000 cycles at five different locations along with the umbilical sample these measurements are shown in figs 13 and 14 the fact that the lines plotted for thickness randomly intersect at various points throughout the test suggests that thickness is a function of the service time rather than the measurement locations as such the collected location specific information has been averaged as shown in fig 14 the averaged data offers the opportunity to propose a fitted model to predict the sheath thickness at any given service time the model proposed for this relationship is given as follows y c e a t a y o b t y o 1 d t where t is the service time in 10 000 cycles y o is the average thickness measured at t 0 and a b c and d are model constants that have to be estimated via a suitable iterative technique these constants are arrayed in a design vector x a b c d t and the following error function f is established at iteration number i for n data points as follows f x i y y t y y f x o where y is a vector of all calculated thickness values at the given service times t o t 1 t n and y is a vector for the corresponding average values of the thickness measured at the same service time to find the best values for the model design vector a minimisation approach is then adopted to realise the following expression min x f x it is worth noting here that f x o is equal to the error function at the start of iterations this value is used to ensure a normalised definition for the error function in this paper where the number of data points was fairly small a monte carlo optimisation method was utilised to find the best values for the model design parameters at iteration number i an updated design vector can be calculated as follows x i 1 x i δ x c o s π β i where δ x is the increment in the vector x and β i is a vector of random numbers whose values fall between 0 and 1 the final aggregate error at the end of the iteration was 0 007 down from unity during the iterative procedure the error function also progressively reduced as shown in fig 15 at the start of the iterations the design vector was given as follows at the start of the iterations the design vector was given as follows x o 1 1 1 1 t at the end of the iterations the design vector obtained was as follows x e n d 0 0148 1 7771 0 9961 0 6839 t to demonstrate the high accuracy offered by the fitted model the averaged data curve is plotted in fig 16 together with the fitted model 7 incident of localized abrasion this incident confirms that localized abrasion does take place in real world situations this incident took place at a control umbilical connecting the plem pipeline end manifold to spm single point mooring as depicted in fig 17 this umbilical was used to control the opening and closing of the plem valve via a hydraulic hose running from the mooring buoy to the tanker while conducting pre off take procedures a problem was identified with the plem actuator the umbilical was recovered as shown in figs 18 20 it can be seen from figs 21 and 22 that the outer sheath of the umbilical is completely worn off at the area of the touchdown zone additionally the armour is completely damaged and was eroded entirely due to corrosion after the investigations the umbilical failed the pressure test and it was concluded that the thermoplastic tubes inside the umbilical were damaged due to the abrasion the tubes were leaking where they were exposed as shown in fig 22 and were moving on the seabed without protection this movement caused the tubes to abrade from the recovered umbilical it was clear that the abrasion was localized at the area of the touchdown zone the umbilical was installed on a rocky seabed the outer sheath of the umbilical was composed of extruded lldpe having a thickness of 6 mm the umbilical was still within its service life and installed in shallow water the failure of the thermoplastic tubes within the umbilical bundle is attributed to the loss of the outer sheath and armouring additionally we point out that during its design the abrasion limit of the outer sheath was completely overlooked the umbilical was replaced with a temporary umbilical as highlighted in fig 23 before being replaced with a new umbilical at the area of localized abrasion i e the touchdown zone high abrasion protection units or ducting were strapped around the umbilical to ensure that the integrity of the new umbilical will not be compromised in the same way as the original umbilical 8 localized abrasion test the second abrasion test was conducted to investigate the abrasion resistance of an extruded sheath lldpe under localized abrasion this test was undertaken to investigate after how many cycles the outer sheath of the umbilical would abrade this was to mimic the failure incident presented in section 7 the same test rig as described in section 6 was used with some modifications as shown in fig 24 this was to ensure that areas of greater wear such as the ends of the cable were more readily visible the end of the umbilical sample was in contact with the abrasive material i e 10 cm of the umbilical sample was in contact the thickness of the outer sheath was 3 6 mm the objective of this test was not to measure the abrasion rate but rather to replicate the localized abrasion at the touchdown point of a catenary such as a dynamic riser the sample was thus moved laterally until abrasion took place and the armour became exposed the abrasion test was run for 10 000 cycles at a frequency of 0 33 hz in some areas the umbilical sheath was completely worn through as highlighted in figs 25 and 26 it can be concluded that an lldpe outer sheath will become worn or aggressively abraded at the touchdown point under repeated lateral movement cycles and where the abrasion is experienced by the cable or umbilical 9 determination of the thickness of the outer sheath table 4 lists the data of a sample of umbilicals cable that are currently in operation the table presents the outside diameter of the umbilical cable thickness and type of outer sheath and thickness of the armour the umbilicals listed cover the majority of umbilicals being manufactured today the thickness of the extruded outer sheath increases with an increase in the total outside diameter of the umbilical as outer sheath thickness and diameter increases the stiffness of the sheath will increase this is true regardless of the thickness of the extruded outer sheath in static umbilicals cables the extruded outer sheath contributes to the bending stiffness of the umbilical cable albeit only with a small percentage extruded outer sheaths have a negligible effect on the axial stiffness of the umbilical cable in some instances such as in dynamic arrangements the thickness of the extruded outer sheath can be increased to increase umbilical cable stiffness the following feedback was obtained from various umbilical cable manufacturers with regards to how they determine the thickness of the extruded outer sheath for subsea umbilicals or cables first method a design rule is used to determine the thickness of the extruded outer sheath the design rule relates the thickness to the umbilical cable bundle diameter second method the thickness of the extruded outer sheath is set such that it constitutes 5 of the outside diameter of the cable umbilical bundle third method the thickness of the extruded outer sheath is set to 3 mm when the outside diameter of the cable umbilical bundle is less than 100 mm 4 mm when the outside diameter of the cable umbilical bundle is between 100 and 150 mm and 5 or 6 mm when the outside diameter is greater than 150 mm the umbilical outer sheath does have a considerable stiffness value the young s modulus of the outer sheath can vary significantly even between polyethylene grades for example the young s modulus of lldpe linear low density polyethylene is 0 4 gpa whereas for hdpe high density polyethylene it is 0 8 gpa it is evident that the sheath material selection can significantly affect the umbilical cable stiffness the overall umbilical stiffness would depend upon the components within the bundle for thermoplastic umbilicals the outer sheath is typically the primary contributor to overall bend stiffness whereas for steel tube umbilicals the tubes may be the primary factor depending on size and quantity the methods described in table 4 do not consider potential abrasion due to seabed environment conditions based on the results of the abrasion tests described in this paper an alternate method is proposed a parametric study was performed using the mathematical model proposed in section 6 6 and a range of outer sheath thicknesses based on the data presented in table 4 the selected thicknesses were in the range of 4 mm 8 mm at 1 mm increments the mathematical model was used to determine abrasion of a nominal umbilical lldpe sheath moving laterally over a seabed of quartzitic gravel as in these tests fig 27 shows the abrasion results of the study plotted for each thickness this method will enable the determination of outer sheath thickness which meets the specific site conditions and meets the service requirements 10 conclusions this paper highlights the consequence of damage to the outer sheath due to abrasion the extruded outer sheath has excellent resistance to abrasion under repeated lateral movement and for the tested soil types this conclusion is supported by operational field experience as well as with the results of the abrasion test conducted herein where an extruded sheath umbilical sample was subjected to 40 000 cycles equating to 12 km of lateral movement from the results of the abrasion test we recommend that the umbilical manufacturers increase the thickness of the extruded outer sheath lldpe by approximately 0 6 mm to account for any abrasion that may take place as a result of the lateral movement of the cable umbilical over the rocky seabed this is only applicable to cases where uniform abrasion is expected for instance where the cable umbilical is moving laterally on a flat seabed in the case that the umbilical cable is likely to self bury or significantly embed into soft soil before peak hydrodynamic loads can cause severe displacement abrasion of the umbilical cable can be ignored this conclusion was confirmed from the field operational data obtained in cases where abrasion is localized such as at the touchdown point the extruded outer sheath will be worn aggressively leaving the armour wire exposed in the test conducted the outer sheath was worn after only 10 000 cycles approximately 3 km the tests conducted in the current study were carried out at a frequency of 0 33 hz this frequency was used to replicate the frequency associated with environmental loading it is expected that the abrasion rate will be less in cases of lower frequency the test was conducted using a very hard abrasive material with a grain size of 4 9 mm to replicate the fine limestone particles the outcome of the uniform test is onerous this is because the uniform abrasion test applied the following demanding conditions flint with grain size in the range of 4 9 mm the frequency of the abrasion test is 0 33 hz the unit weight of the sample is 107 5 kg m with a specific gravity of approximately 12 this is heavier than most of the umbilicals used in the industry the water temperature ranged from 10 to 15 c the uniform abrasion test was conducted without considering the impact of marine growth on the abrasion rate theoretically marine growth would be beneficial as it would likely reduce the abrasion rate of the outer sheath however if there is any marine growth it will form on the top of the umbilical whereas the abrasion of the umbilical takes place at the contact area between the umbilical and the seabed given the above the results from the uniform abrasion test are still valid for an umbilical with marine growth forming on top dnvgl rp f109 standards consider the excessive lateral displacement due to the action of hydrodynamic loads as a serviceability limit state dnvgl rp f019 standards should include that if the lateral displacement of the umbilical cable leads to significant abrasion then the lateral movement should be minimized or prevented for localized abrasion the outer sheath will abrade very quickly particularly if the cable or umbilical is subjected to repeated cycles over time the armour wire will corrode and drastically reduce the bending stiffness of the cable umbilical consequently compromising the functionality of the cable umbilical in light of this it is recommended to use a high abrasion protection system or ducting in the area where localized abrasion is expected to ensure that the outer sheath is not damaged we point out that the outcomes of this paper apply to flexible pipes as well the umbilical and cable manufacturers can use the results presented herein and from future tests to develop more sophisticated analytical models to determine the abrasion the mathematical model can be calibrated by gathering test results from several umbilicals and cables appendix a photos of the outer sheath at

20622,this paper is the second of two companion papers about the design of subsea cables umbilicals for in service abrasion several case studies of severe abrasion of submarine cables umbilicals and corrective measures undertaken have been documented and presented in the first paper part i case studies the mechanisms of failure due to abrasion are explained in this paper the effect of repeated lateral movement on lldpe linear low density polyethylene extruded outer sheaths of two cable samples was investigated in the first test a cable sample was displaced the equivalent of 12 km over a crushed mineral aggregate while in the second test a cable was subjected to 3 km of displacement under conditions that replicated the touchdown point of a dynamic cable the results of the first test indicated that the overall abrasion was low and acceptable in the second test however the outer sheath was completely worn through the authors recommend the thickness of the outer sheath be increased for cables where uniform abrasion is expected and high abrasion protection units be employed where localized abrasion is expected empirical data is provided to support these recommendations keywords subsea cables subsea umbilicals abrasion outer sheath yarn 1 introduction there is currently a large demand for the global installation of subsea cables umbilicals and flexible pipes in offshore hydrocarbon resources and wind farm energy development among many other uses reda et al 2016a reda et al 2019 reda et al 2016b reda et al 2017 reda et al 2020 li et al 2020a li et al 2021 li et al 2020b li et al 2020c tang et al 2019a tang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 tang et al 2019c silva and soares 2019 ahmed reda et al 2021 where the authors discussed underlying abrasion mechanisms and the undertaken corrective measures excessive lateral movement of the cable could undermine the ultimate limit state accidental limit state as well as serviceability limit state a consequence of severe damage to the outer sheath of the cable is armour corrosion and cable failure reda et al 2017 reda et al 2020 ahmed reda et al 2021 cable failure and breakage can be due to water ingress if the cable is of dry design as this may induce insulation and screen issues and therefore affect electrical serviceability another possible failure scenario of severe damage to the outer sheath is the radial pressure of the extrusion process associated with the application of the outer sheath being locally removed causing the pre stress of the armours to be released this may induce an armour layer re arrangement which may cause buckling of armours this failure is related to a single armoured cable umbilical or a product that is not torsionally balanced when a rock layer is installed to prevent scouring dnvgl rp 0360 dnvgl rp 0360 2016 prohibits the cable catenary from touching the rock to avoid abrasion the same reference lists friction and abrasion as properties that should be submitted by the cable manufacturer if relevant one such instance would be the pulling of a cable across the seabed reda et al 2017 presented an example of a failure of a field coating joint of a crossed pipeline the failure was attributed to the repeated lateral movement of the crossing cable as well as the contact load between the crossed pipeline and the crossing subsea cable reda et al 2017 emphasized that when a subsea cable is designed to allow certain lateral movement under the influence of hydrodynamic forces it is important to ensure that the outer sheath of the cable will not be abraded under the said lateral movement abrasion can be described as the removal of material from a surface as a result of sliding in the case of subsea umbilicals cables the abrasion takes place due to the relative motion of the umbilical cable across the seabed the abrasion experiment herein was designed to inflict the maximum damage to the umbilical extruded outer sheath this was primarily achieved by selecting an abrasive medium in the form of hard coarse and homogeneous quartzitic gravel moh s hardness 7 and applying a high stroke rate of 0 33 hz onto the umbilical surface i e a high momentum the choice of quartzitic gravel over the more common calcite based such as calcarenite fragments of gravel is conservative since offshore sand is often softer with a hardness value of just 3 following an abrasive test according to the french standard lcpc test thuro et al 2007 it was demonstrated that quartz and crystalline rich gravel show very high to extremely high abrasive effects the particle size of the abrasive medium ranged from 4 to 9 mm which is a typical gravel size the extended lcpc test performed in thuro et al 2007 illustrated that a reduction in silt and clay particle size reduced the abrasive effect dramatically finally the homogeneity of the quartzitic abrasive material is expected to increase the effect of abrasion since offshore materials are expected to be heterogeneous with varying particle size and hardness in accordance with their variable depositional environment in light of the above it is evident that the outcome of the abrasion test applies to silt sand and clay environments it should be noted that the abrasive media initially selected was calcarenite fragments of medium gravel size 0 2 mm however this was changed during the test to crushed mineral aggregate derived from blue flints this is because the calcarenite fragments were too soft to cause any abrasion or reduction in thickness of the outer sheath of the umbilical sample this also proves that the abrasion of the lldpe extruded outer sheath by fine sand will be insignificant it should be noted that the abrasion test for the subsea cable umbilical is not an industry standard test and there are currently no standard tests provided in any cable or umbilical standards the abrasion test conducted herein is not equivalent to the abrasion test detailed in the iec 60299 standards iec 60299 2014 as highlighted in flynn 2015 the abrasion test detailed in the iec 60299 standards was designed for the umbilical during the laying operation that test therefore does not reflect the susceptibility of the umbilical to abrasion when it is displaced along the seabed in a working environment this paper presents the results from a uniform abrasion test undertaken on an umbilical with an extruded outer sheath the umbilical sample was displaced over 40 000 cycles which equates to 12 km of total lateral displacement the test was conducted to evaluate the performance of the extruded lldpe outer sheath when subject to abrasion another objective of the test was to assess how much protection the outer sheath provides for the armouring of the cable and umbilical a second localized abrasion test was conducted to investigate the performance of the lldpe extruded outer sheath under repeated movement this was an attempt to replicate the touchdown point of a dynamic cable or umbilical the umbilical sample was displaced over 10 000 cycles approximately 3 km of lateral movement in this paper an incident is presented to confirm the findings from the localized abrasion test this incident is associated with umbilical failure due to localized abrasion and the damage to armour wires at the riser touchdown point the umbilical was connecting the plem pipeline end manifold to an spm single point mooring lastly a formula was developed to calculate abrasion versus displacement the formula was developed using the results of the physical abrasion test conducted as part of this work this article should be read in conjunction with reda thiedeman mckee sultan shahin elgazzar 2 why abrasion occurs when the maximum lateral and vertical hydrodynamic loads acting on an umbilical cable from the maximum wave and steady current is greater than the soil resistance the umbilical cable will start to move laterally across the seabed causing the outer sheath of the umbilical cable to abrade as outlined in fig 1 the rate of abrasion is dependent on the soil type e g rock sand clay submerged weight of the umbilical cable and severity of the lateral movement the abrasion will be aggressive in the case where the umbilical cable is laid upon hard seabeds such as rock abrasion will also take place in soft soil but to a lesser extent in some situations embedment of the umbilical cable occurs during the service life when the umbilical cable is laid on soft soil the embedment is caused by the following reasons cyclic movement under waves and current action scouring seabed mobility and or liquefaction this embedment is beneficial to the umbilical cable for the following reasons it provides shelter to the umbilical cable from hydrodynamic loads hence causes a reduction in the hydrodynamic load experienced by the umbilical cable it increases passive resistance i e increased soil resistance it reduces lateral movement of the umbilical cable hence minimises or nullifies the risk of abrasion 3 importance of armour wire the subsea cable umbilical must include at least one layer of galvanized steel wire armour of adequate diameter to meet the following conditions protects the cable umbilical during installation including from any burial equipment and provides strength for laying from an umbilical installation vessel once installed the armour must achieve the following protects to the cable umbilical in the unlikely event that it is lifted to the surface for repair assists with the on bottom stability of the cable umbilical under installation conditions and provides some level of protection to the cable umbilical in the unlikely event that it is impacted by fishing trawling gear the armour should be corrosion resistant and able to withstand the strain and stress fatigue experienced during manufacture installation and service armour wires are applied under uniform tension which limit rotation under varying tensions armoured umbilicals cables are torque balanced and can have a single or double wire armouring depending on their intended use as static or dynamic cables single layer armour umbilical cable is not fully torque balanced however the manufacturer can apply a contra helical metallic tape over the armour package to address this imbalance to an extent tension control during installation is more important for single layer armoured products generally there are limits to how deep a single layer armoured umbilical cable can be installed as determined by the manufacturer too much tension can pull the helix out while insufficient tension can lead to cable hockling this risk is much lower for torque balanced double layer armoured products calculations should be provided to prove that the armour will fulfil the conditions listed above note that armour can be minimized or not used at all if it can be demonstrated that the unarmoured cable umbilical can withstand all the load conditions described above 4 consequences of outer sheath damage many outcomes can arise from the exposure of cable umbilical armour wires as a result of damage to the outer sheath for cables umbilicals installed in a static configuration and where galvanized steel armour wires are used the following situations can arise in the case where the sheath is damaged but the armour wire coating remains intact the exposed armour wires will be protected for a short period until there is a loss in the armour wire coating due to galvanic attack once the coating is reduced and finally removed to expose the bare carbon steel material beneath a full blown corrosion cell will commence which will lead to a steady material loss over time while the cable umbilical internal components such as the hoses and cables etc will remain functional there will be a reduced load capability of the armour wire package over time significant degradation to the armour wire may prohibit the cable umbilical from being retrieved correctly in the case where the sheath and the armour wire coating are both damaged corrosion will commence as soon as the damaged wires come in contact with seawater while the umbilical internal components such as the hoses and cables etc will remain functional there will be a reduced load capability of the armour wire package over time significant degradation to the armour wire may prohibit the cable umbilical from being retrieved properly the following notes should be considered in all of the above cases should the damaged section of cable umbilical be buried or rock dumped then due to a lack of re circulating oxygen the corrosion of the armour wires will be reduced however over time the armour wire capability will still be compromised in all of the above cases as long as the damage is limited to the outer sheath then the internal components should be able to function without issue where there is significant corrosion to the exposed armour wires due to the extended duration of the exposure the strength of the armour package may be compromised such that retrieval may become problematic for dynamic cables umbilicals even minor sheath damage can evolve into more serious issues and must be retrieved and repaired or even replaced immediately some partial degradation or failure of the armour may result in changes to the mechanical properties of the umbilical cable whilst this may not be catastrophic or result in total failure it can lead to a change in the behaviour response or performance of the cable which may in turn cause other failure modes or mechanisms to arise for example if the flexibility changes due to partial failure then its response in dynamic conditions can change and could then cause a total failure the number of allowable spooling and unspooling cycles i e coiling and uncoiling should be discussed and agreed upon with the manufacturer this is because during the spooling and unspooling processes armour re arrangement takes place in conjunction with the release of the pre stress induced in the armour layer in other words if coiling uncoiling limits are exceeded the cable becomes difficult to handle as the helix arrangement is disturbed once the outer sheath is damaged or abraded the armour will get damaged quickly it is worth mentioning that several online fault locating techniques for power lines based on voltage current characteristics and travelling waves have been presented in the literature abu siada et al 2020 abu siada 2019 tashakkori et al 2020 wijayasuwarno and abu siada 2018 these techniques can be adapted to detect the location and level of outer sheath damage to subsea cables in real time however this requires further investigation which is beyond the scope of this paper 5 on bottom stability design philosophy many studies assess on bottom stability for pipelines are available in the literature e g yu et al 2013 youssef et al 2013 tripepi et al 2018 de lima et al 2011 baioco et al 2018 ji and ong 2019 gagliano 2007 li and ong 2016 ji et al 2017 ameh and ameh 2019 pipeline stability is typically designed following the requirements of dnv gl os f101 dnv 2017b and dnvgl rp f109 dnv 2017a standards although these standards are not directly applicable to the design of umbilical cable particularly in regards to their safety objectives their guidelines are being used to determine umbilical cable stabilisation requirements this is not an unreasonable approach given the absence of specific design codes addressing the stabilisation of subsea umbilicals cables the stability analysis of an umbilical cable involves the assessment of umbilical cable integrity and its response on a seabed when subjected to hydrodynamic forces the integrity of an umbilical cable designed following dnv gl os f101 iec 60299 2014 standards is ensured through a limit state approach which guarantees that the established safety objectives are met the safety objectives aim at mitigating adverse consequences and surviving extreme events while sustaining functional loads to evaluate whether the risk of a failure event is acceptable or not acceptance criteria are required such acceptance criteria are based on satisfying acceptable limits for the risks to human safety the environment and the economy the acceptance criteria defined in the dnvgl os f101 dnv 2017b standards are based on achieving target reliability levels for the different identified limit states all relevant failure modes formulated in terms of limit states should be considered in the design the dnvgl os f101 dnv 2017b standards use an lrfd load and resistance factor design approach where partial safety factors are applied to make sure that the acceptance criteria have been satisfied the partial safety factors deal with uncertainty in loads and resistance and are applied to ensure that the target reliability level probability of failure is achieved the partial safety factors are applied based on formulated failure criteria e g load controlled bending moment criteria and are used to satisfy a specific pipeline failure probability the main failure criterion that has been identified for umbilical cable instability is exceeding the effective tension and bend radius beyond the allowable limit specified by the umbilical cable manufacture this results from high bending moments due to umbilical cable displacement repeated umbilical cable lateral displacement itself is not considered a failure criterion unless it leads to excessive abrasion of the outer sheath risk of umbilical cable integrity or interruption of umbilical cable operation displacement should however be used as a design guideline to assess the degree of umbilical cable stability and severity of abrasion of the outer sheath the approach normally used for the on bottom stability design of an umbilical cable can be summarised as follows identification of limit states and definition of acceptance criteria ultimate limit state serviceability limit state and accidental limit state the limit state defines a condition beyond which the design requirements are no longer satisfied each limit state is associated with acceptance criteria including displacement local buckling and integrity which determines whether or not the limit state has been satisfied determination of the metocean condition return period to be applied based on the limit state being assessed the environmental return period to be applied will depend on the limit state being considered and the safety class refer to table 1 performing screening assessments static stability analyses to identify areas that are not a stability concern areas that require secondary stabilisations and areas which require more advanced analyses performing dynamic analyses for areas where optimisation is required and where an understanding of the umbilical cable response is required evaluating the acceptance of umbilical cable response based on the defined acceptance criteria determining primary e g increase the number of armour layers and secondary stabilisation requirements e g mattresses and rock bolts table 1 presents the environmental return period that needs to be applied for the applicable limit state the return period in the analysis depends on the limit state being considered 5 1 design aspects the evaluation of umbilical cable stability involves the consideration of the following aspects wave and current kinematics acting on the umbilical cable hydrodynamic loads induced by the combined wave and current kinematics lateral and vertical resistance to hydrodynamic loads analysis methodology static and dynamic acceptance criteria and pipeline integrity 5 2 environmental loads hydrodynamic loads on the umbilical cable are affected by the following wave and current kinematics flow condition reynolds number keulegan carpenter number and current to wave ratio outside umbilical cable diameter umbilical cable motion separation from the seabed and sheltering embedment or trenching additional secondary stabilisation attracting hydrodynamic loads to the umbilical cable 5 3 lateral and vertical resistance lateral and vertical resistance to hydrodynamic loads is provided using primary stabilisation e g increasing submerged weight of the umbilical cable by increasing the number of armour layers and secondary stabilisation e g concrete mattresses rock dumping and rock bolts methods wherever required resistance to lateral loads can be provided by means of seabed friction passive soil resistance or trenching vertical resistance can be provided by means of umbilical cable weight anchors or burial 5 4 analysis methodology two fundamental approaches are used to assess umbilical cable stability 5 4 1 static approach in this approach the pipeline is considered stable if the maximum lateral and vertical hydrodynamic loads acting on the umbilical cable from the maximum wave and steady current multiplied by a safety factor is less than the soil resistance the maximum lift force from the maximum wave multiplied by a safety factor is less than the submerged weight of the umbilical cable the umbilical cable is considered statically stable when the restraining forces exceed the hydrodynamic loads i e the horizontal restraining forces exceed the horizontal hydrodynamic loads fig 2 shows the forces considered in the 2d force balance approach i e absolute stability approach 5 4 2 dynamic approach dynamic analysis involves the full dynamic simulation of an umbilical cable on the seabed subjected to relevant storm conditions including modelling of soil resistance hydrodynamic forces boundary conditions and dynamic responses the results of the analysis are used to determine the umbilical cable displacement bend radius and effective tension the dynamic analysis is performed using finite element programs such as ansys abaqus or orcaflex to model the umbilical cable response to hydrodynamic forces acting on it refer to 4 5 for more details regarding static and dynamic approaches 6 abrasion test under uniform constant load 6 1 purpose the following section highlights the results of an abrasion test undertaken on a subsea cable with an extruded lldpe outer sheath the main objective of the test was to evaluate the performance of the extruded lldpe outer sheath when subjected to abrasion from crushed mineral aggregate derived from blue flints a secondary objective of the test was to assess how much protection the outer sheath of the umbilical provides to the armouring this test replicates the section of the cable umbilical that rests in a flat position on a seabed and moves horizontally under hydrodynamic forces a reciprocating abrasion rig was used in the test to represent the seabed interaction between the umbilical cable and the abrasive media the rig moves the sample back and forth over a bed of immersed abrasive media under a constant vertical load 6 2 abrasion test during the test the test rig displaced the umbilical sample over a bed of crushed mineral aggregate derived from blue flintag under a uniform constant vertical load of 43 kg the test sample was equivalent to the self weight of the test frame 34 kg plus the weight of the sample itself 9 kg as illustrated in figs 3 6 the length of the umbilical and steel frame was 400 mm the unit weight of the sample was 107 5 kg m with a specific gravity of approximately 12 the test sample was restrained so that it would not rotate the umbilical tested herein was heavier than the majority of umbilicals in the industry this implies that the results of the test are conservative and that real world abrasion would be less aggressive than that observed in this test figs 7 9 show the umbilical sample fixed to a steel frame before the abrasion test fig 7 shows the measurement locations and the umbilical sample fixed to a steel mandrel to avoid umbilical deflections see fig 8 the test rig was filled with water ensuring that the contact face between the umbilical and abrasive media was submerged measurements of the outer sheath were taken at five locations 25 150 200 250 and 375 mm along the umbilical surface these were termed locations 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively a counter recorded the number of times the cycle was repeated the test rig implemented approximately 20 full cycles forward and back per minute the umbilical sample was displaced over 40 000 cycles which equates to 12 km of lateral displacement as the stroke length was 300 mm this implies that the frequency of the abrasion test was 0 33 hz note that the typical frequency for the oscillating motion of waves is approximately 0 1 hz it is expected that the abrasion rate will be less in cases of lower frequency the cyclic displacement amplitude is approximately 2 8 times the umbilical diameter the test was completed over four days where the lab temperature ranged between 10 c and 15 c no measurement of the water temperature was taken and the water was unheated the test was halted every 1000 cycles for approximately 1 h to measure the thickness of the outer sheath if the umbilical sheath was found to be completely abraded the test was stopped and the number of cycles recorded throughout the test if the abrasive material was found to have deteriorated it was replaced during the test the abrasive medium was changed every 10 000 cycles although this may not be realistic it was done to ensure that the outcome of the uniform abrasion test was robust the breakage of the particles during the abrasion process takes place progressively over many cycles this leads to a reduction in particle size abrasion caused by small particles is less severe than that caused by large particles when all other parameters are constant it should be highlighted that there is no basis for the choice of running the experiment for 40 000 cycles or 12 km of displacement this number was chosen arbitrarily it is not expected that an umbilical cable would ever move 12 km during its design life unless there was a significant instability issue with the umbilical cable and environment 6 3 test protocol to perform and complete the abrasion test satisfactorily the test rig shown in fig 10 should be in the following state 1 before performing the test the testbed should be dry the flintag abrasive material should be placed on top of the testbed and immersed in freshwater so that the water level is just above the top of the flintag 2 the thickness of the umbilical sheath should be measured and the state of the surface recorded photographically the umbilical sample should be fitted into the steel support mandrel securing it into position within the support mandrel with fasteners the mandrel should be secured to the mechanical arm using suitable bolts before lowering the arm into position on the flintag 3 the test should be carried out with inspection and measurements taken every 1000 cycles note that fig 11 shows the test samples at 1000 cycles 4 thickness measurements should be taken at the 6 o clock position on the sample the test sample should be immersed up to the top of the support cradle to a depth of approximately 61 mm as illustrated in fig 9 the same figure shows the ultrasonic thickness gauge used during the test to measure the thickness of the outer sheath at the five locations the thickness gauge measures the thickness of the outer sheath and can measure wall thicknesses in the range of 0 08 mm 635 mm the accuracy of the ultrasonic thickness gauge is 0 001 inch 0 0254 mm 5 the water level should be checked at a maximum of 10 000 cycles along with the condition of the umbilical sample and flintag 6 the orange plates shown in fig 4 flatten the flintag during the stroke of the machine to reduce the digging in effect of the sample into the flintag 7 the test should be stopped at 40 000 cycles and the sample cylinder removed from the mechanical arm for inspection as before 8 the surface of the umbilical sample should be photographed and the remaining sheath thicknesses measured 6 4 abrasive test material fig 12 illustrates the abrasive medium used in the abrasion test of the umbilical sample crushed mineral aggregate derived from blue flints was used to replicate limestone particles it was found that the land based calcarenite fragments of gravel size were breaking down in the water an alternative was to use an insoluble hard material such as sharp granite obtained from a rock supplier or quarry the particle size grading shape hardness and properties of the blue flint is similar to the calcarenite fragments of gravel size that exists subsea the granite particles i e blue flint is harder than the calcarenite fragments of gravel size and as such the abrasion evaluation will be more robust the properties of the abrasive material i e blue flint are given in table 2 6 5 results of abrasion test table 3 highlights the thickness of the outer sheath as measured at the beginning of the test and upon completion of the test the results are given for all five locations and show that the outer sheath suffered relatively minor abrasion even after 12 km of lateral movement this is consistent with field observations the readings are different because of the different initial outer sheath thicknesses associated with manufacturing tolerance it is evident that the abrasion was low and acceptable for the life of the extruded outer sheath even when the test conditions were onerous if a seabed survey reveals that yet harsher conditions may exist in a particular area of seabed then monitoring procedures will need to be implemented for safety it was noted that the rate of reduction of the outer sheath thickness was high during the first loading period up to 15 000 cycles however the rate of reduction in the thickness of the outer sheath was significantly reduced thereafter until the end of the test this indicates that the sheath thickness can be designed to accommodate a large reduction in thickness during the time equivalent of 15 000 cycles as well as the smaller reduction that results thereafter from abrasion till the end of the umbilical life this can result in the ability to select an optimal thickness for the extruded outer sheath that does not compromise the integrity of the umbilical while maintaining cost effectiveness these observations are consistent with the results presented in musiał et al 2020 for polymers this can be explained by the fact that the friction between the outer sheath and the abrasive material changes throughout the test this is because at the initial stage of the process the abrasion gets rid of the irregularities on the sheath surface the sheath measurement readings in table 3 concur with this showing between 0 52 and 0 55 mm of wear as such the authors recommend the thickness of the outer sheath to be increased by 0 6 mm for cables photographs fig a 1 to a 9 of the outer sheath during the various testing stages are given in appendix a 6 6 proposed mathematical model to estimate how the sheath thickness changes with service time depth measurements were collected every 5000 cycles at five different locations along with the umbilical sample these measurements are shown in figs 13 and 14 the fact that the lines plotted for thickness randomly intersect at various points throughout the test suggests that thickness is a function of the service time rather than the measurement locations as such the collected location specific information has been averaged as shown in fig 14 the averaged data offers the opportunity to propose a fitted model to predict the sheath thickness at any given service time the model proposed for this relationship is given as follows y c e a t a y o b t y o 1 d t where t is the service time in 10 000 cycles y o is the average thickness measured at t 0 and a b c and d are model constants that have to be estimated via a suitable iterative technique these constants are arrayed in a design vector x a b c d t and the following error function f is established at iteration number i for n data points as follows f x i y y t y y f x o where y is a vector of all calculated thickness values at the given service times t o t 1 t n and y is a vector for the corresponding average values of the thickness measured at the same service time to find the best values for the model design vector a minimisation approach is then adopted to realise the following expression min x f x it is worth noting here that f x o is equal to the error function at the start of iterations this value is used to ensure a normalised definition for the error function in this paper where the number of data points was fairly small a monte carlo optimisation method was utilised to find the best values for the model design parameters at iteration number i an updated design vector can be calculated as follows x i 1 x i δ x c o s π β i where δ x is the increment in the vector x and β i is a vector of random numbers whose values fall between 0 and 1 the final aggregate error at the end of the iteration was 0 007 down from unity during the iterative procedure the error function also progressively reduced as shown in fig 15 at the start of the iterations the design vector was given as follows at the start of the iterations the design vector was given as follows x o 1 1 1 1 t at the end of the iterations the design vector obtained was as follows x e n d 0 0148 1 7771 0 9961 0 6839 t to demonstrate the high accuracy offered by the fitted model the averaged data curve is plotted in fig 16 together with the fitted model 7 incident of localized abrasion this incident confirms that localized abrasion does take place in real world situations this incident took place at a control umbilical connecting the plem pipeline end manifold to spm single point mooring as depicted in fig 17 this umbilical was used to control the opening and closing of the plem valve via a hydraulic hose running from the mooring buoy to the tanker while conducting pre off take procedures a problem was identified with the plem actuator the umbilical was recovered as shown in figs 18 20 it can be seen from figs 21 and 22 that the outer sheath of the umbilical is completely worn off at the area of the touchdown zone additionally the armour is completely damaged and was eroded entirely due to corrosion after the investigations the umbilical failed the pressure test and it was concluded that the thermoplastic tubes inside the umbilical were damaged due to the abrasion the tubes were leaking where they were exposed as shown in fig 22 and were moving on the seabed without protection this movement caused the tubes to abrade from the recovered umbilical it was clear that the abrasion was localized at the area of the touchdown zone the umbilical was installed on a rocky seabed the outer sheath of the umbilical was composed of extruded lldpe having a thickness of 6 mm the umbilical was still within its service life and installed in shallow water the failure of the thermoplastic tubes within the umbilical bundle is attributed to the loss of the outer sheath and armouring additionally we point out that during its design the abrasion limit of the outer sheath was completely overlooked the umbilical was replaced with a temporary umbilical as highlighted in fig 23 before being replaced with a new umbilical at the area of localized abrasion i e the touchdown zone high abrasion protection units or ducting were strapped around the umbilical to ensure that the integrity of the new umbilical will not be compromised in the same way as the original umbilical 8 localized abrasion test the second abrasion test was conducted to investigate the abrasion resistance of an extruded sheath lldpe under localized abrasion this test was undertaken to investigate after how many cycles the outer sheath of the umbilical would abrade this was to mimic the failure incident presented in section 7 the same test rig as described in section 6 was used with some modifications as shown in fig 24 this was to ensure that areas of greater wear such as the ends of the cable were more readily visible the end of the umbilical sample was in contact with the abrasive material i e 10 cm of the umbilical sample was in contact the thickness of the outer sheath was 3 6 mm the objective of this test was not to measure the abrasion rate but rather to replicate the localized abrasion at the touchdown point of a catenary such as a dynamic riser the sample was thus moved laterally until abrasion took place and the armour became exposed the abrasion test was run for 10 000 cycles at a frequency of 0 33 hz in some areas the umbilical sheath was completely worn through as highlighted in figs 25 and 26 it can be concluded that an lldpe outer sheath will become worn or aggressively abraded at the touchdown point under repeated lateral movement cycles and where the abrasion is experienced by the cable or umbilical 9 determination of the thickness of the outer sheath table 4 lists the data of a sample of umbilicals cable that are currently in operation the table presents the outside diameter of the umbilical cable thickness and type of outer sheath and thickness of the armour the umbilicals listed cover the majority of umbilicals being manufactured today the thickness of the extruded outer sheath increases with an increase in the total outside diameter of the umbilical as outer sheath thickness and diameter increases the stiffness of the sheath will increase this is true regardless of the thickness of the extruded outer sheath in static umbilicals cables the extruded outer sheath contributes to the bending stiffness of the umbilical cable albeit only with a small percentage extruded outer sheaths have a negligible effect on the axial stiffness of the umbilical cable in some instances such as in dynamic arrangements the thickness of the extruded outer sheath can be increased to increase umbilical cable stiffness the following feedback was obtained from various umbilical cable manufacturers with regards to how they determine the thickness of the extruded outer sheath for subsea umbilicals or cables first method a design rule is used to determine the thickness of the extruded outer sheath the design rule relates the thickness to the umbilical cable bundle diameter second method the thickness of the extruded outer sheath is set such that it constitutes 5 of the outside diameter of the cable umbilical bundle third method the thickness of the extruded outer sheath is set to 3 mm when the outside diameter of the cable umbilical bundle is less than 100 mm 4 mm when the outside diameter of the cable umbilical bundle is between 100 and 150 mm and 5 or 6 mm when the outside diameter is greater than 150 mm the umbilical outer sheath does have a considerable stiffness value the young s modulus of the outer sheath can vary significantly even between polyethylene grades for example the young s modulus of lldpe linear low density polyethylene is 0 4 gpa whereas for hdpe high density polyethylene it is 0 8 gpa it is evident that the sheath material selection can significantly affect the umbilical cable stiffness the overall umbilical stiffness would depend upon the components within the bundle for thermoplastic umbilicals the outer sheath is typically the primary contributor to overall bend stiffness whereas for steel tube umbilicals the tubes may be the primary factor depending on size and quantity the methods described in table 4 do not consider potential abrasion due to seabed environment conditions based on the results of the abrasion tests described in this paper an alternate method is proposed a parametric study was performed using the mathematical model proposed in section 6 6 and a range of outer sheath thicknesses based on the data presented in table 4 the selected thicknesses were in the range of 4 mm 8 mm at 1 mm increments the mathematical model was used to determine abrasion of a nominal umbilical lldpe sheath moving laterally over a seabed of quartzitic gravel as in these tests fig 27 shows the abrasion results of the study plotted for each thickness this method will enable the determination of outer sheath thickness which meets the specific site conditions and meets the service requirements 10 conclusions this paper highlights the consequence of damage to the outer sheath due to abrasion the extruded outer sheath has excellent resistance to abrasion under repeated lateral movement and for the tested soil types this conclusion is supported by operational field experience as well as with the results of the abrasion test conducted herein where an extruded sheath umbilical sample was subjected to 40 000 cycles equating to 12 km of lateral movement from the results of the abrasion test we recommend that the umbilical manufacturers increase the thickness of the extruded outer sheath lldpe by approximately 0 6 mm to account for any abrasion that may take place as a result of the lateral movement of the cable umbilical over the rocky seabed this is only applicable to cases where uniform abrasion is expected for instance where the cable umbilical is moving laterally on a flat seabed in the case that the umbilical cable is likely to self bury or significantly embed into soft soil before peak hydrodynamic loads can cause severe displacement abrasion of the umbilical cable can be ignored this conclusion was confirmed from the field operational data obtained in cases where abrasion is localized such as at the touchdown point the extruded outer sheath will be worn aggressively leaving the armour wire exposed in the test conducted the outer sheath was worn after only 10 000 cycles approximately 3 km the tests conducted in the current study were carried out at a frequency of 0 33 hz this frequency was used to replicate the frequency associated with environmental loading it is expected that the abrasion rate will be less in cases of lower frequency the test was conducted using a very hard abrasive material with a grain size of 4 9 mm to replicate the fine limestone particles the outcome of the uniform test is onerous this is because the uniform abrasion test applied the following demanding conditions flint with grain size in the range of 4 9 mm the frequency of the abrasion test is 0 33 hz the unit weight of the sample is 107 5 kg m with a specific gravity of approximately 12 this is heavier than most of the umbilicals used in the industry the water temperature ranged from 10 to 15 c the uniform abrasion test was conducted without considering the impact of marine growth on the abrasion rate theoretically marine growth would be beneficial as it would likely reduce the abrasion rate of the outer sheath however if there is any marine growth it will form on the top of the umbilical whereas the abrasion of the umbilical takes place at the contact area between the umbilical and the seabed given the above the results from the uniform abrasion test are still valid for an umbilical with marine growth forming on top dnvgl rp f109 standards consider the excessive lateral displacement due to the action of hydrodynamic loads as a serviceability limit state dnvgl rp f019 standards should include that if the lateral displacement of the umbilical cable leads to significant abrasion then the lateral movement should be minimized or prevented for localized abrasion the outer sheath will abrade very quickly particularly if the cable or umbilical is subjected to repeated cycles over time the armour wire will corrode and drastically reduce the bending stiffness of the cable umbilical consequently compromising the functionality of the cable umbilical in light of this it is recommended to use a high abrasion protection system or ducting in the area where localized abrasion is expected to ensure that the outer sheath is not damaged we point out that the outcomes of this paper apply to flexible pipes as well the umbilical and cable manufacturers can use the results presented herein and from future tests to develop more sophisticated analytical models to determine the abrasion the mathematical model can be calibrated by gathering test results from several umbilicals and cables appendix a photos of the outer sheath at

20623,the interaction of ship and waterway is of utmost importance in inland navigation regulations and waterway maintenance rely on assumptions for the damage potential of propeller jets scours are to be avoided or repaired at an early stage as preparation for the validation of future cfd simulations measurements were carried out in the propeller jet using different methods 2d3c piv is a non invasive method for flow measurements in a 2d plane however for applications with transient flows volumetric measurements are desired previous particle tracking velocimetry systems suffered from low resolution and difficulties with high seeding density the system used here attempts to overcome these disadvantages with the shake the box algorithm and a new hardware design the focus is on comparing this volumetric flow measurement technique with conventional 2d3c piv the test case is the wake flow of a ducted propeller in bollard pull condition since the tests were carried out in different facilities the measured flow fields are not fully comparable nevertheless it is shown that the method is suitable for phase averaged measurements in addition to the advantages in three dimensional flows the findings from this first series of measurements are used for the further development of the system keywords particle image velocimetry particle tracking velocimetry propeller wake inland navigation shake the box model tests 1 introduction bed and bank protection is part of the maintenance measures on inland waterways due to the trend towards larger ships with more powerful propulsion systems bed loads as well as bed erosion are increasing in addition to the wave wash and effects of the flow around the hull the propeller jet is one of the main causes of bed or bank erosion especially in manoeuvring situations for this reason the federal waterways engineering and research institute baw started a research project to investigate the propeller induced bed and bank erosion by means of numerical simulations the aim is a fully coupled computational fluid dynamics discrete element method model cfd dem including a moving ship a rotating propeller in a duct and discrete particles to represent the bed and bank structures in a first phase covered in this article scale model tests were carried out to generate data for the validation of future cfd simulations previous work showed significant uncertainties of ranse simulations for the wake and hull propeller interaction of full form ships especially under shallow water conditions friedhoff et al 2019 besides near field hull flow and wave patterns the spreading angle and the velocity distribution of the propeller jet are the most interesting topics this paper describes the model setup and the measurement methods used to obtain validation data via particle image velocimetry piv in addition to the common 2d3c piv technique a new fully volumetric particle tracking ptv particle tracking velocimetry method is used ptv enables the detection of 3d flow fields not only in one plane as is the case with 2d3c piv but also to detect transient flows in a measurement volume and by observing the particle propagation over time while passing through the measurement volume 2 particle image velocimetry and particle tracking velocimetry particle imaging velocimetry measures a flow field indirectly by retrieving the movement of tracer particles in the fluid under investigation from camera images for measurements of the flow field in a thin plane the tracer particles are illuminated in a laser light sheet cameras record the light scattered by these particles by recording two images of two laser shots in a short time interval δ t the particles displacement between these two time points can be seen the camera images are divided into interrogation windows and the particle displacement in each window is evaluated by cross correlating the intensity information from both images in the 2d3c piv technique also known as stereo piv two cameras observe the light sheet with different perspective views together with the information from a calibration relating the camera images to a world coordinate system these two camera perspectives and recordings at two points in time provide the necessary information for a measurement of all three velocity components in the illuminated plane to obtain volumetric information individual planes can be measured sequentially and merged to the flow field information in the volume of interest see felli et al 2011 however this is only possible for time averaged or phase locked measurements transient flows with coherent vortex structures for example require time resolved volumetric methods however setting up and aligning the optical components can be challenging especially when measuring in shallow water optical access is often a limiting factor changing the setup involves new alignment and calibration if the cameras and lighting unit are not installed in the same housing as in commonly used torpedo type stereo piv systems the second measurement technique used in this study is the ptv based on the shake the box stb algorithm schanz et al 2016 with the so called minishaker which combines four cameras in one rigid housing this device will be referred to as multi camera in the following in contrast to classical piv shake the box is a particle tracking technique retrieving individual particle tracks over multiple points in time these particles are not illuminated in a plane but in a volume therefore in the ptv measurement an entire volume is measured at once for each time step the particle positions in the measurement volume are reconstructed from the particle images by projection from the camera images to the measurement volume for higher accuracy each particle position is moved shaken in 3d space to find the best match of that particle with all captured camera images wieneke 2012 once a particle position is identified the respective particle images are subtracted from the camera images to produce a residual image for each camera the subsequent particle search uses these residuals to find particles that have not yet been detected due to image aberrations the same particle usually produces differently shaped particle images on the cameras as it moves to different positions in the volume this information is reflected by the optical transfer function schanz et al 2012 to optimise the shaking process and the calculation of the residuals the optical transfer function is calculated under the specific measurement conditions from the particle images before the 3d position determination and used as a look up table in a time resolved stb measurement where several images are used with a constant time interval the temporal information of the particle motion is also used from a particle track identified in the previous time steps the current position of this particle is estimated based on a polynomial fit to the already identified track positions the first step in identifying particle positions in the volume in the current time step is the search for particles near the predicted current particle positions this ensures a significant acceleration and reliability of the particle detection after the initialisation phase volumetric measurements place high demands on the calibration quality i e the error of the mapper between the world coordinate system and the camera images the so called calibration must be minimised elsinga et al 2006 this means that for the calibration process all cameras and lenses must be rigidly mounted images are taken from a calibration plate positioned in the sample volume and the position and mounting of the cameras is maintained for the particle recordings even temperature changes can affect the quality of the calibration to generate reliable measurements two measures were taken in the current study to ensure sufficient calibration quality first the hardware was optimised for underwater measurements as described below second the calibration quality was refined based on the measurement data previous minishakers were designed and built for applications with the multi camera in a dry location the minishaker underwater has the four cameras and required optics placed in a rigid watertight housing that prevents the cameras from moving relative to each other the cameras are aligned and focused to a fixed distance before being mounted in the housing minimising the number of flexible components and the effort required for camera alignment in the measurement environment the size of the housing has been kept as small as possible to minimise interaction with the flow when the system is positioned in the tank a pinhole calibration is performed based on images of a 2 plane calibration plate with known 3d marker distances positioned in the measurement volume this results in the initial calibration function relating world space and camera images this initial calibration is refined on the basis of particle images by volume self calibration this is done by identifying particle positions in 3d space based on the initial calibration function back projections of these identified particle positions onto the camera images result in a disparity between the original particle image position and the back projected position for each camera image this disparity reflects the error of the calibration function which is corrected accordingly wieneke 2008 2018 this iterative process of volume self calibration corrects small calibration errors based on the current measurement which means that small errors e g due to temperature effects misaligning the optical components can be corrected between the initial calibration and the actual measurement 2 1 experimental setup piv the piv system was set up in the circulating water channel at the institute of ship technology ocean engineering and transport systems ismt at the university of duisburg essen the test section is 6m long and 1 5m wide the ends of this section were closed with acrylic glass plates to have a defined boundary condition the water depth is 830 mm the top view of the setup is shown in fig 1 laser and cameras have been positioned to the side of the tank with glass windows providing optical access an innolas spitlight piv dpss frequency doubled nd yag laser with two diode pumped cavities was used at a double pulse frequency of 100hz the pulse energy is about 60mj a separate image is recorded for each of the two light pulses the velocity component is calculated by circular correlation of the two images two phantom v9 1 high speed cmos cameras with 1632px 1200px sensors and 6gb internal memory each were used with 50 mm lenses mounted on scheimpflug adapters resulting in a spatial resolution of 6 7px mm the memory allows the recording of almost 900 double images at full resolution thus 8 98seconds can be recorded at maximum frame rate 14bit colour depth enables high contrast even in demanding applications polyamide particles with a diameter of 100 μ m were used as tracers acquisition and post processing were done with different sub versions of the davis8 software package the measuring plane was aligned in the y z plane with a field of view fov of approximately 200mm 200 mm the time interval of each double frame was 350 μ s for measurements at a distance of 200 mm and 650 μ s for measurement at a distance of 1000 mm these distances are given relative to the propeller plane the arrangement of the propeller and the duct can cause hub cavitation under certain circumstances immersion depth temperature rotational speed during the recording period the speed of rotation was kept constant the immersion depth of the propeller hub was 400 mm the piv measurements were post processed filtered and averaged over 898 time steps corresponding to a measurement duration of 8 98s sliding background subtraction 8px particle intensity normalisation min max filter over 5px were applied to the raw images for piv analysis multiple passes with decreasing interrogation window size from 48 48 50 overlap to 24 24 25 overlap were used 2 2 experimental setup ptv the measurements with the ptv system were carried out in the shallow water basin of the development centre for ship technology and transport systems dst the basin is 200m long and 9 8m wide the setup was installed in the centre of the basin the arrangement of the propeller and duct is almost identical to the piv setup here too the immersion depth was 400 mm two different setups of the multi camera were tested first the multi camera was mounted parallel to the propeller jet second the multi camera was mounted perpendicular to the propeller jet both setups are shown in fig 2 a separate unit was used for the laser illumination which delivered the laser light via an optical fibre to the optics installed below the water surface which expanded the laser light approximately into the shape of a rectangular pyramid the laser is a two cavity nd ylf laser emitting at 527 nm wave length the maximum repetition rate for single shots is 10khz the maximum energy is 30mj at 1khz in this case only one cavity was used with a repetition rate of 511hz and a pulse energy of approximately 17 5mj during each light pulse an image is taken by each camera the tracer particles are detected by their size and intensity contrast to the background in the perpendicular arrangement the multi camera was aligned so that the reference plane was in line with the measurement plane of the piv setup in the parallel arrangement the reference plane was in line with the propeller shaft and jet the system was first calibrated for this plane and laser illumination was optimised accordingly the sensor resolution for each camera is 896px 656px resulting in a spatial resolution of 3px mm the total measurement volume is approximately 300mm 220mm 150 mm the images from all four cameras have to overlap in the measurement volume therefore the volume has a shape of truncated rectangular pyramid rather than a cuboid images were recorded with a frame rate of 511hz for about 20s in addition the same tracer particles were used as in the piv setup the post processing parameters were chosen as for piv setup mentioned in section 2 1 but filtered and averaged over 10000time steps 3 led illumination for volumetric ptv measurements a promising option for reducing facility times and overall experimental costs is to use an led light source instead of the laser due to the led s cheaper price lower maintenance faster set up times and the elimination of laser safety measures the led light source used is a blue lavision led flashlight300 with a cross section of 300mm 100 mm and an electrical power of 300w the led can be operated in a pulsed overdrive mode which allows the led current to be increased above the maximum continuous current of the led when using the pulsed overdrive mode with a duty cycle of 10 at 511hz each light pulse emits the energy of approximately 56mj the measurement volume has a size of 300mm 220mm 150 mm measurements with both light sources were carried out for a twin screw setup similar to the one mentioned above using a pair of the same propeller and duct the propellers were rotating inwards over the top unlike the laser the led illuminated the volume of interest from the top where it was immersed in the water surrounded by an acrylic housing fig 3 due to the housing and the available space above the waterline at the towing carriage the illuminated volume was reduced in positive y direction for the led test setup 4 results 4 1 influence of the camera housing and lighting unit for moving ptv systems discussions about the advantages and disadvantages of a moving versus a stationary system are an on going topic for laser based flow measurements in towing tank facilities the influence of the towed system on the flow measurement is often considered critical therefore both setups shown in fig 2 are towed alone to measure the average flow velocity and calculate the difference from the constant carriage velocity these uniform flow tests were carried out for both setups at two different water depths thus there are four tests to evaluate the influence of the whole system on the measured flow first measurements were carried out at a water depth of 1000 mm with a carriage speed of 1 0m s for the parallel and perpendicular setups furthermore measurements were made for both setups at a water depth of 312 mm with a carriage speed of 0 972m s corresponding to 14km h at full scale factor 16 a speed and scale factor often used at this water depth fig 4 shows the measured velocities normalised with the carriage speed in fig 4a c the position z 0 corresponds to an immersion depth of 400 mm while in fig 4b d the zero coordinate represents an immersion depth of 77 6 mm at a water depth of 1000 mm with the parallel setup fig 4 a shows only very small deviations between carriage speed and measurement almost in the entire measuring volume the influence of the housing becomes apparent at the edge of the measuring volume facing the multi camera with a reduction of flow speed by 2 3 at the same water depth and carriage speed but with the multi camera perpendicular to the flow the deviations are significantly increased fig 4c near the mounting arm of the multi camera a deviation of up to 6 is measured at a water depth of 312 mm the measurements show very similar characteristics with regard to the influence of the multi camera and the lighting unit however the deviations are clearly more pronounced with 4 5 for the parallel fig 4b and up to 10 in the perpendicular arrangement fig 4d with the perpendicular arrangement the maximum speed in the measurement volume is even reduced by 2 compared to the carriage speed to conclude under the above conditions the parallel setup has a lower risk of significantly disturbing the flow to be measured the perpendicular setup can be used in towed applications only in deep water and depending on the further experimental setup and conditions nevertheless depending on the flow characteristics it is suitable for stationary measurements in order to optimise the orientation of the measuring volume in shallow water the perpendicular setup is not suitable for towing applications but only for stationary measurements however this may differ for other water depth and velocity combinations so suitable pre tests should be carried out for each new experiment during the towing experiments a deformation of the free surface was observed for the perpendicular setup mainly in shallow water representing the more pronounced stagnation visible in fig 4c d since the deviations in all four cases correspond with the positions of the interfering housings it is assumed that the majority of them are not related to calibration errors 4 2 comparison of parallel and perpendicular setup a comparison between the parallel and perpendicular setup is not only useful for the moving system but also for a static setup the setup is often limited by the surrounding space and mounting options or the further experimental setup therefore measurements at the same distance and the same experimental conditions are shown in fig 5 for the parallel and perpendicular setup first it can be mentioned that the results show a good agreement for the total velocity in all directions and also for the shape of the jet further fig 5 shows the amount of information that can be obtained from a volumetric measurement with 10000images the 3d plot belongs to a measurement parallel to the jet with three slices shown as an example the x z plane is the reference plane for this setup and is usually the plane with the best results as the calibration and illumination have been optimised for this position as described above the extent of the measurement volume is about twice along the in line arrangement of the cameras in the probe compared to the extension pointing in the camera viewing direction reorienting the probe to the parallel arrangement comes with the disadvantage of a reduced field of view in the y z plane while increasing the length of the volume along the x axis this can be seen in fig 5 on the bottom left for 2d3c piv measurements the choice of the setup orientation usually depends on the dominant velocity component and the optical access the out of plane component is usually not as accurate as the in plane components this consideration does not need to be taken into account for volumetric ptv measurements a slightly higher uncertainty is to be expected in viewing direction of the camera calibration is performed with the target at a distance of 600 mm from the multi camera reference plane and the lenses are focused to this distance the uncertainty increases with positions deviating from the reference plane however a comparison of the results from the perpendicular and from the parallel arrangement in the y z planes shown in fig 5 shows no systematic difference thus depending on the application the arrangement can be chosen under the aspects of best optical access and minimal influence on the measured flow 4 3 comparison of piv and ptv results fig 6 shows the comparison of piv and ptv measurements the ptv measurements were carried out with the perpendicular setup the two time averaged velocity fields correspond in their optical representation with respect to the axial velocity components the deviations of the in plane components are larger which probably result from the different boundary conditions in the basins influencing factors are the size of the tank and the reduced acquisition time and number of vector fields in the piv experiments furthermore the resulting circulation of the water in the smaller tank has to be taken into account for a more detailed comparison a line plot with standard deviations was extracted from both results fig 7 shows the averaged velocity in the x direction vx the piv and ptv measurements were considered at a distance of 200 mm and 1000 mm for better comparability a segment from 270 to 360 with respect to the propeller was chosen in addition the standard deviation along this segment is plotted over the recorded images the cause for the deviations on the inner radii could not be clearly identified systematic errors due to different experimental setups and facilities are assumed fig 7 also shows the comparison of the line profiles of piv and ptv measurements at a distance δ x 1000 mm and a propeller rate of 17hz considering the large distance from the propeller plane and the different boundary conditions the characteristics of the measured jets are very similar for radii larger than about r 45 mm the curves get closer together and the agreement improves in the inner field there can be a deviation of up to 12 the differences in the far field are most likely due to the different setups implying different boundary conditions in particular in the piv setup the flow is more susceptible to external influences and low frequency unsteadiness with decreasing velocity this is mainly caused by the external boundary conditions such as the dimensions of the basin these cause the flow to be reflected at the tank walls and thus influence the flow itself this is especially different in the ptv setup where the flow is infinite measurements with a small speed of advance of the propulsor i e advance coefficient j 0 result in more stable measurements and less influence of boundary conditions unfortunately this was not feasible in the confined facility used for the piv measurements where the working propeller induced more circulation of the water than in the larger model basin used in the ptv campaign 4 4 time averaged and time resolved volumetric measurements this study presents two methods by which volumetric flow fields can be measured by imaging techniques with the stereoscopic system 2d3c piv several planes can be recorded and then merged and interpolated to a volume this method has the inherent disadvantage that it is very time consuming and limited to the analysis of time averaged flow fields in addition it must be ensured that a sufficient number of the particles remains in the light sheet between the two laser shots to obtain a reliable cross correlation result therefore the piv δ t i e the time between the two laser illuminations must be carefully adapted to the flow velocity time resolved methods are more tolerant of flow fields with regions of low and high velocities using the multi camera approach with volumetric illumination provides instant data in a volume without the need for stitching shake the box particle tracking is used here the particle seeding density is lower than for planar piv limiting the spatial resolution since it is a particle tracking technique the spatial resolution can be increased by accumulating the information from multiple time steps kähler et al 2012 the results of a shake the box evaluation are converted to a volumetric grid where the sub volume elements are called voxels vox fig 8 shows a result of a shake the box evaluation after transforming the particle tracks of 10000 time steps to a 3d grid the volume filled with particle tracks is binned to a grid of 323 vox window size with 75 overlap i e the final grid resolution is 8vox 2 5 mm for each track with a minimum length of 11 time steps a 2nd order polynomial with a length of 11 is fitted to retrieve velocity and acceleration information from that track depending on the distance of the track to a bin the respective values contribute to the final value in that bin for a bin to be regarded as valid at least one tracked particle must be present in that bin for a better clarity in fig 8 vertically every 4th vector and horizontally every 2nd vector is shown and 24 levels are omitted between two x z vector planes shown the isosurfaces represent sections of constant velocity instantaneous retrieval of an entire volume paves the way for measuring instantaneous 3d flow fields therefore from the time resolved measurement data over 10000 time steps only a single snapshot is converted into grid based data in a similar way as described above with the difference that the final grid resolution has been reduced to 16vox i e 643 vox with 75 overlap are used for each bin to further improve the quality of the resulting velocity field the temporal resolution was exploited by pseudo lagrangian tracking van gent et al 2017 the result is shown in fig 9 the general rotation and swirl of the propeller jet can be observed in both the time averaged and the instantaneous flow field even though the spatial resolution is lower in the time resolved case as fewer particles contribute to the result this technique can provide access to transient phenomena e g to tip vortices spatial interpolation algorithms such as the vortex in cell plus vic technique schneiders et al 2017 and flowfit ehlers et al 2019 which were not used in this project can be used to improve the resolution at the expense of additional evaluation time compared to steady state processes the seeding density should be increased for transient processes furthermore a low resolution is chosen for a later evaluation in order to show the transient behaviour more clearly an observed volume of 123 vox with 50 overlap and a high seeding density has a final grid resolution of 6vox 1 87 mm nevertheless no tip vortex is clearly visible here which is probably related to the duct used and the high area ratio of the propeller which does not induce a tip vortex into the wake field one aspect that should be considered in future studies becomes clear when comparing time resolved and temporally averaged results the spatial resolution can be increased by collecting more particle tracks contributing to the result therefore measurements with a high number of time steps are advantageous here the flow situation of a propeller wake offers the possibility to record phase constant measurements repeating the flow situation for a blade position multiple times and accumulating the data over multiple measurements triggered at this blade position see e g felli et al 2011 in this way the smoothing over all blade positions leading to the smooth cones in fig 8 could be avoided while the spatial resolution of the flow field could still be increased by accumulating the information in particle tracks recorded in multiple measurements therefore phase constant measurements should be used in future studies to improve the post processing capabilities as the tracking algorithm needs some time steps to identify the tracks 4 5 laser light compared to high power led illumination for volumetric ptv measurements fig 10 shows the averaged velocity fields behind the starboard propeller with the perpendicular setup both measurements show a similar velocity field but different shapes of the jet one reason for the differences can be the interaction of the led housing with the flow the led is located at a relatively small distance above the measurement volume depending on the setup and light access the led light source is a good and simple alternative option however there is no streamlined water tight housing available yet therefore the led light source can only be partly immersed e g surrounded by an acrylic glass housing and can only be used at zero or very low towing speed to maximise the recorded led light power the duty cycle of 10 must be utilised resulting in a light pulse length of 200 μ s at 500hz this must be taken into account in the experimental design to ensure that no particle streaks occur in the camera images and that the background scattered light is not dominant due to the longer exposure time of the cameras due to the limited illuminance of the led compared to the laser at approximately 2m s and faster the laser could provide the better illumination this is explained by the longer exposure time of the cameras which needs to be adjusted because of the lower illuminance 5 summary and conclusions detailed flow measurements were carried out in the jet of a ducted propeller in bollard pull condition in addition to classical 2d3c piv the shake the box particle tracking method was applied and compared the piv system relies on good optical access to the flow field of interest known underwater 2d3c piv torpedo setups are considered too large especially with regard to their interference with the flow in shallow water conditions the minishaker underwater used here has compact housings for the multi camera and the lighting unit acquisition of large amounts of raw data is extremely fast and calibration requires minimal effort in the basin while post processing is more time consuming compared to 2d3c piv despite the different boundary conditions of the setups the results of both techniques show the same flow patterns for averaged vector fields while 2d3c piv allows for higher spatial resolution in one plane the volumetric particle tracking generally allows for a more detailed analysis of transient flows however presumably due to too low seeding density this could not be demonstrated here as expected which method is more suitable for a particular application depends strongly on the expected flow characteristics hub vortex cavitation occurred for propeller rates above 17hz and was a challenge for measurements close to the propeller plane at small distances the cavitation is visible in the images the reflections caused problems especially during post processing of the piv measurements as the punctual overexposure cannot be evaluated reasonably therefore the propeller rate was limited to 17hz for most measurements resulting in reynolds numbers that are lower than normally required for open water tests the resulting scale effects must be taken into account in further analysis based on the tests carried out here a system was developed with the following improvements the working distance between the measuring volume and the multi camera was increased from 600 mm to 1100 mm in order to minimise the interaction with the flow field during shallow water experiments the focal length of the lenses was increased to keep the measurement volume and resolution more or less constant as a result a reduction in optical quality due to blurring must be accepted in applications with high seeding density adjusting the orientation of the minishaker has been simplified by changes to the swivel and articulated joint an externally visible scale was added to facilitate identification of the basic orientation relative to the experimental setup the stability of the internal mounts for camera and optics was improved to counteract misalignment due to vibration the volumetric led lighting approach has been proven to work in principle at low flow rates and greatly simplifies installation and safety measures with an optimised waterproof housing this may favour a more frequent and cost effective use of the ptv technique however this requires further investigation when the new hardware and housing are available credit authorship contribution

20623,the interaction of ship and waterway is of utmost importance in inland navigation regulations and waterway maintenance rely on assumptions for the damage potential of propeller jets scours are to be avoided or repaired at an early stage as preparation for the validation of future cfd simulations measurements were carried out in the propeller jet using different methods 2d3c piv is a non invasive method for flow measurements in a 2d plane however for applications with transient flows volumetric measurements are desired previous particle tracking velocimetry systems suffered from low resolution and difficulties with high seeding density the system used here attempts to overcome these disadvantages with the shake the box algorithm and a new hardware design the focus is on comparing this volumetric flow measurement technique with conventional 2d3c piv the test case is the wake flow of a ducted propeller in bollard pull condition since the tests were carried out in different facilities the measured flow fields are not fully comparable nevertheless it is shown that the method is suitable for phase averaged measurements in addition to the advantages in three dimensional flows the findings from this first series of measurements are used for the further development of the system keywords particle image velocimetry particle tracking velocimetry propeller wake inland navigation shake the box model tests 1 introduction bed and bank protection is part of the maintenance measures on inland waterways due to the trend towards larger ships with more powerful propulsion systems bed loads as well as bed erosion are increasing in addition to the wave wash and effects of the flow around the hull the propeller jet is one of the main causes of bed or bank erosion especially in manoeuvring situations for this reason the federal waterways engineering and research institute baw started a research project to investigate the propeller induced bed and bank erosion by means of numerical simulations the aim is a fully coupled computational fluid dynamics discrete element method model cfd dem including a moving ship a rotating propeller in a duct and discrete particles to represent the bed and bank structures in a first phase covered in this article scale model tests were carried out to generate data for the validation of future cfd simulations previous work showed significant uncertainties of ranse simulations for the wake and hull propeller interaction of full form ships especially under shallow water conditions friedhoff et al 2019 besides near field hull flow and wave patterns the spreading angle and the velocity distribution of the propeller jet are the most interesting topics this paper describes the model setup and the measurement methods used to obtain validation data via particle image velocimetry piv in addition to the common 2d3c piv technique a new fully volumetric particle tracking ptv particle tracking velocimetry method is used ptv enables the detection of 3d flow fields not only in one plane as is the case with 2d3c piv but also to detect transient flows in a measurement volume and by observing the particle propagation over time while passing through the measurement volume 2 particle image velocimetry and particle tracking velocimetry particle imaging velocimetry measures a flow field indirectly by retrieving the movement of tracer particles in the fluid under investigation from camera images for measurements of the flow field in a thin plane the tracer particles are illuminated in a laser light sheet cameras record the light scattered by these particles by recording two images of two laser shots in a short time interval δ t the particles displacement between these two time points can be seen the camera images are divided into interrogation windows and the particle displacement in each window is evaluated by cross correlating the intensity information from both images in the 2d3c piv technique also known as stereo piv two cameras observe the light sheet with different perspective views together with the information from a calibration relating the camera images to a world coordinate system these two camera perspectives and recordings at two points in time provide the necessary information for a measurement of all three velocity components in the illuminated plane to obtain volumetric information individual planes can be measured sequentially and merged to the flow field information in the volume of interest see felli et al 2011 however this is only possible for time averaged or phase locked measurements transient flows with coherent vortex structures for example require time resolved volumetric methods however setting up and aligning the optical components can be challenging especially when measuring in shallow water optical access is often a limiting factor changing the setup involves new alignment and calibration if the cameras and lighting unit are not installed in the same housing as in commonly used torpedo type stereo piv systems the second measurement technique used in this study is the ptv based on the shake the box stb algorithm schanz et al 2016 with the so called minishaker which combines four cameras in one rigid housing this device will be referred to as multi camera in the following in contrast to classical piv shake the box is a particle tracking technique retrieving individual particle tracks over multiple points in time these particles are not illuminated in a plane but in a volume therefore in the ptv measurement an entire volume is measured at once for each time step the particle positions in the measurement volume are reconstructed from the particle images by projection from the camera images to the measurement volume for higher accuracy each particle position is moved shaken in 3d space to find the best match of that particle with all captured camera images wieneke 2012 once a particle position is identified the respective particle images are subtracted from the camera images to produce a residual image for each camera the subsequent particle search uses these residuals to find particles that have not yet been detected due to image aberrations the same particle usually produces differently shaped particle images on the cameras as it moves to different positions in the volume this information is reflected by the optical transfer function schanz et al 2012 to optimise the shaking process and the calculation of the residuals the optical transfer function is calculated under the specific measurement conditions from the particle images before the 3d position determination and used as a look up table in a time resolved stb measurement where several images are used with a constant time interval the temporal information of the particle motion is also used from a particle track identified in the previous time steps the current position of this particle is estimated based on a polynomial fit to the already identified track positions the first step in identifying particle positions in the volume in the current time step is the search for particles near the predicted current particle positions this ensures a significant acceleration and reliability of the particle detection after the initialisation phase volumetric measurements place high demands on the calibration quality i e the error of the mapper between the world coordinate system and the camera images the so called calibration must be minimised elsinga et al 2006 this means that for the calibration process all cameras and lenses must be rigidly mounted images are taken from a calibration plate positioned in the sample volume and the position and mounting of the cameras is maintained for the particle recordings even temperature changes can affect the quality of the calibration to generate reliable measurements two measures were taken in the current study to ensure sufficient calibration quality first the hardware was optimised for underwater measurements as described below second the calibration quality was refined based on the measurement data previous minishakers were designed and built for applications with the multi camera in a dry location the minishaker underwater has the four cameras and required optics placed in a rigid watertight housing that prevents the cameras from moving relative to each other the cameras are aligned and focused to a fixed distance before being mounted in the housing minimising the number of flexible components and the effort required for camera alignment in the measurement environment the size of the housing has been kept as small as possible to minimise interaction with the flow when the system is positioned in the tank a pinhole calibration is performed based on images of a 2 plane calibration plate with known 3d marker distances positioned in the measurement volume this results in the initial calibration function relating world space and camera images this initial calibration is refined on the basis of particle images by volume self calibration this is done by identifying particle positions in 3d space based on the initial calibration function back projections of these identified particle positions onto the camera images result in a disparity between the original particle image position and the back projected position for each camera image this disparity reflects the error of the calibration function which is corrected accordingly wieneke 2008 2018 this iterative process of volume self calibration corrects small calibration errors based on the current measurement which means that small errors e g due to temperature effects misaligning the optical components can be corrected between the initial calibration and the actual measurement 2 1 experimental setup piv the piv system was set up in the circulating water channel at the institute of ship technology ocean engineering and transport systems ismt at the university of duisburg essen the test section is 6m long and 1 5m wide the ends of this section were closed with acrylic glass plates to have a defined boundary condition the water depth is 830 mm the top view of the setup is shown in fig 1 laser and cameras have been positioned to the side of the tank with glass windows providing optical access an innolas spitlight piv dpss frequency doubled nd yag laser with two diode pumped cavities was used at a double pulse frequency of 100hz the pulse energy is about 60mj a separate image is recorded for each of the two light pulses the velocity component is calculated by circular correlation of the two images two phantom v9 1 high speed cmos cameras with 1632px 1200px sensors and 6gb internal memory each were used with 50 mm lenses mounted on scheimpflug adapters resulting in a spatial resolution of 6 7px mm the memory allows the recording of almost 900 double images at full resolution thus 8 98seconds can be recorded at maximum frame rate 14bit colour depth enables high contrast even in demanding applications polyamide particles with a diameter of 100 μ m were used as tracers acquisition and post processing were done with different sub versions of the davis8 software package the measuring plane was aligned in the y z plane with a field of view fov of approximately 200mm 200 mm the time interval of each double frame was 350 μ s for measurements at a distance of 200 mm and 650 μ s for measurement at a distance of 1000 mm these distances are given relative to the propeller plane the arrangement of the propeller and the duct can cause hub cavitation under certain circumstances immersion depth temperature rotational speed during the recording period the speed of rotation was kept constant the immersion depth of the propeller hub was 400 mm the piv measurements were post processed filtered and averaged over 898 time steps corresponding to a measurement duration of 8 98s sliding background subtraction 8px particle intensity normalisation min max filter over 5px were applied to the raw images for piv analysis multiple passes with decreasing interrogation window size from 48 48 50 overlap to 24 24 25 overlap were used 2 2 experimental setup ptv the measurements with the ptv system were carried out in the shallow water basin of the development centre for ship technology and transport systems dst the basin is 200m long and 9 8m wide the setup was installed in the centre of the basin the arrangement of the propeller and duct is almost identical to the piv setup here too the immersion depth was 400 mm two different setups of the multi camera were tested first the multi camera was mounted parallel to the propeller jet second the multi camera was mounted perpendicular to the propeller jet both setups are shown in fig 2 a separate unit was used for the laser illumination which delivered the laser light via an optical fibre to the optics installed below the water surface which expanded the laser light approximately into the shape of a rectangular pyramid the laser is a two cavity nd ylf laser emitting at 527 nm wave length the maximum repetition rate for single shots is 10khz the maximum energy is 30mj at 1khz in this case only one cavity was used with a repetition rate of 511hz and a pulse energy of approximately 17 5mj during each light pulse an image is taken by each camera the tracer particles are detected by their size and intensity contrast to the background in the perpendicular arrangement the multi camera was aligned so that the reference plane was in line with the measurement plane of the piv setup in the parallel arrangement the reference plane was in line with the propeller shaft and jet the system was first calibrated for this plane and laser illumination was optimised accordingly the sensor resolution for each camera is 896px 656px resulting in a spatial resolution of 3px mm the total measurement volume is approximately 300mm 220mm 150 mm the images from all four cameras have to overlap in the measurement volume therefore the volume has a shape of truncated rectangular pyramid rather than a cuboid images were recorded with a frame rate of 511hz for about 20s in addition the same tracer particles were used as in the piv setup the post processing parameters were chosen as for piv setup mentioned in section 2 1 but filtered and averaged over 10000time steps 3 led illumination for volumetric ptv measurements a promising option for reducing facility times and overall experimental costs is to use an led light source instead of the laser due to the led s cheaper price lower maintenance faster set up times and the elimination of laser safety measures the led light source used is a blue lavision led flashlight300 with a cross section of 300mm 100 mm and an electrical power of 300w the led can be operated in a pulsed overdrive mode which allows the led current to be increased above the maximum continuous current of the led when using the pulsed overdrive mode with a duty cycle of 10 at 511hz each light pulse emits the energy of approximately 56mj the measurement volume has a size of 300mm 220mm 150 mm measurements with both light sources were carried out for a twin screw setup similar to the one mentioned above using a pair of the same propeller and duct the propellers were rotating inwards over the top unlike the laser the led illuminated the volume of interest from the top where it was immersed in the water surrounded by an acrylic housing fig 3 due to the housing and the available space above the waterline at the towing carriage the illuminated volume was reduced in positive y direction for the led test setup 4 results 4 1 influence of the camera housing and lighting unit for moving ptv systems discussions about the advantages and disadvantages of a moving versus a stationary system are an on going topic for laser based flow measurements in towing tank facilities the influence of the towed system on the flow measurement is often considered critical therefore both setups shown in fig 2 are towed alone to measure the average flow velocity and calculate the difference from the constant carriage velocity these uniform flow tests were carried out for both setups at two different water depths thus there are four tests to evaluate the influence of the whole system on the measured flow first measurements were carried out at a water depth of 1000 mm with a carriage speed of 1 0m s for the parallel and perpendicular setups furthermore measurements were made for both setups at a water depth of 312 mm with a carriage speed of 0 972m s corresponding to 14km h at full scale factor 16 a speed and scale factor often used at this water depth fig 4 shows the measured velocities normalised with the carriage speed in fig 4a c the position z 0 corresponds to an immersion depth of 400 mm while in fig 4b d the zero coordinate represents an immersion depth of 77 6 mm at a water depth of 1000 mm with the parallel setup fig 4 a shows only very small deviations between carriage speed and measurement almost in the entire measuring volume the influence of the housing becomes apparent at the edge of the measuring volume facing the multi camera with a reduction of flow speed by 2 3 at the same water depth and carriage speed but with the multi camera perpendicular to the flow the deviations are significantly increased fig 4c near the mounting arm of the multi camera a deviation of up to 6 is measured at a water depth of 312 mm the measurements show very similar characteristics with regard to the influence of the multi camera and the lighting unit however the deviations are clearly more pronounced with 4 5 for the parallel fig 4b and up to 10 in the perpendicular arrangement fig 4d with the perpendicular arrangement the maximum speed in the measurement volume is even reduced by 2 compared to the carriage speed to conclude under the above conditions the parallel setup has a lower risk of significantly disturbing the flow to be measured the perpendicular setup can be used in towed applications only in deep water and depending on the further experimental setup and conditions nevertheless depending on the flow characteristics it is suitable for stationary measurements in order to optimise the orientation of the measuring volume in shallow water the perpendicular setup is not suitable for towing applications but only for stationary measurements however this may differ for other water depth and velocity combinations so suitable pre tests should be carried out for each new experiment during the towing experiments a deformation of the free surface was observed for the perpendicular setup mainly in shallow water representing the more pronounced stagnation visible in fig 4c d since the deviations in all four cases correspond with the positions of the interfering housings it is assumed that the majority of them are not related to calibration errors 4 2 comparison of parallel and perpendicular setup a comparison between the parallel and perpendicular setup is not only useful for the moving system but also for a static setup the setup is often limited by the surrounding space and mounting options or the further experimental setup therefore measurements at the same distance and the same experimental conditions are shown in fig 5 for the parallel and perpendicular setup first it can be mentioned that the results show a good agreement for the total velocity in all directions and also for the shape of the jet further fig 5 shows the amount of information that can be obtained from a volumetric measurement with 10000images the 3d plot belongs to a measurement parallel to the jet with three slices shown as an example the x z plane is the reference plane for this setup and is usually the plane with the best results as the calibration and illumination have been optimised for this position as described above the extent of the measurement volume is about twice along the in line arrangement of the cameras in the probe compared to the extension pointing in the camera viewing direction reorienting the probe to the parallel arrangement comes with the disadvantage of a reduced field of view in the y z plane while increasing the length of the volume along the x axis this can be seen in fig 5 on the bottom left for 2d3c piv measurements the choice of the setup orientation usually depends on the dominant velocity component and the optical access the out of plane component is usually not as accurate as the in plane components this consideration does not need to be taken into account for volumetric ptv measurements a slightly higher uncertainty is to be expected in viewing direction of the camera calibration is performed with the target at a distance of 600 mm from the multi camera reference plane and the lenses are focused to this distance the uncertainty increases with positions deviating from the reference plane however a comparison of the results from the perpendicular and from the parallel arrangement in the y z planes shown in fig 5 shows no systematic difference thus depending on the application the arrangement can be chosen under the aspects of best optical access and minimal influence on the measured flow 4 3 comparison of piv and ptv results fig 6 shows the comparison of piv and ptv measurements the ptv measurements were carried out with the perpendicular setup the two time averaged velocity fields correspond in their optical representation with respect to the axial velocity components the deviations of the in plane components are larger which probably result from the different boundary conditions in the basins influencing factors are the size of the tank and the reduced acquisition time and number of vector fields in the piv experiments furthermore the resulting circulation of the water in the smaller tank has to be taken into account for a more detailed comparison a line plot with standard deviations was extracted from both results fig 7 shows the averaged velocity in the x direction vx the piv and ptv measurements were considered at a distance of 200 mm and 1000 mm for better comparability a segment from 270 to 360 with respect to the propeller was chosen in addition the standard deviation along this segment is plotted over the recorded images the cause for the deviations on the inner radii could not be clearly identified systematic errors due to different experimental setups and facilities are assumed fig 7 also shows the comparison of the line profiles of piv and ptv measurements at a distance δ x 1000 mm and a propeller rate of 17hz considering the large distance from the propeller plane and the different boundary conditions the characteristics of the measured jets are very similar for radii larger than about r 45 mm the curves get closer together and the agreement improves in the inner field there can be a deviation of up to 12 the differences in the far field are most likely due to the different setups implying different boundary conditions in particular in the piv setup the flow is more susceptible to external influences and low frequency unsteadiness with decreasing velocity this is mainly caused by the external boundary conditions such as the dimensions of the basin these cause the flow to be reflected at the tank walls and thus influence the flow itself this is especially different in the ptv setup where the flow is infinite measurements with a small speed of advance of the propulsor i e advance coefficient j 0 result in more stable measurements and less influence of boundary conditions unfortunately this was not feasible in the confined facility used for the piv measurements where the working propeller induced more circulation of the water than in the larger model basin used in the ptv campaign 4 4 time averaged and time resolved volumetric measurements this study presents two methods by which volumetric flow fields can be measured by imaging techniques with the stereoscopic system 2d3c piv several planes can be recorded and then merged and interpolated to a volume this method has the inherent disadvantage that it is very time consuming and limited to the analysis of time averaged flow fields in addition it must be ensured that a sufficient number of the particles remains in the light sheet between the two laser shots to obtain a reliable cross correlation result therefore the piv δ t i e the time between the two laser illuminations must be carefully adapted to the flow velocity time resolved methods are more tolerant of flow fields with regions of low and high velocities using the multi camera approach with volumetric illumination provides instant data in a volume without the need for stitching shake the box particle tracking is used here the particle seeding density is lower than for planar piv limiting the spatial resolution since it is a particle tracking technique the spatial resolution can be increased by accumulating the information from multiple time steps kähler et al 2012 the results of a shake the box evaluation are converted to a volumetric grid where the sub volume elements are called voxels vox fig 8 shows a result of a shake the box evaluation after transforming the particle tracks of 10000 time steps to a 3d grid the volume filled with particle tracks is binned to a grid of 323 vox window size with 75 overlap i e the final grid resolution is 8vox 2 5 mm for each track with a minimum length of 11 time steps a 2nd order polynomial with a length of 11 is fitted to retrieve velocity and acceleration information from that track depending on the distance of the track to a bin the respective values contribute to the final value in that bin for a bin to be regarded as valid at least one tracked particle must be present in that bin for a better clarity in fig 8 vertically every 4th vector and horizontally every 2nd vector is shown and 24 levels are omitted between two x z vector planes shown the isosurfaces represent sections of constant velocity instantaneous retrieval of an entire volume paves the way for measuring instantaneous 3d flow fields therefore from the time resolved measurement data over 10000 time steps only a single snapshot is converted into grid based data in a similar way as described above with the difference that the final grid resolution has been reduced to 16vox i e 643 vox with 75 overlap are used for each bin to further improve the quality of the resulting velocity field the temporal resolution was exploited by pseudo lagrangian tracking van gent et al 2017 the result is shown in fig 9 the general rotation and swirl of the propeller jet can be observed in both the time averaged and the instantaneous flow field even though the spatial resolution is lower in the time resolved case as fewer particles contribute to the result this technique can provide access to transient phenomena e g to tip vortices spatial interpolation algorithms such as the vortex in cell plus vic technique schneiders et al 2017 and flowfit ehlers et al 2019 which were not used in this project can be used to improve the resolution at the expense of additional evaluation time compared to steady state processes the seeding density should be increased for transient processes furthermore a low resolution is chosen for a later evaluation in order to show the transient behaviour more clearly an observed volume of 123 vox with 50 overlap and a high seeding density has a final grid resolution of 6vox 1 87 mm nevertheless no tip vortex is clearly visible here which is probably related to the duct used and the high area ratio of the propeller which does not induce a tip vortex into the wake field one aspect that should be considered in future studies becomes clear when comparing time resolved and temporally averaged results the spatial resolution can be increased by collecting more particle tracks contributing to the result therefore measurements with a high number of time steps are advantageous here the flow situation of a propeller wake offers the possibility to record phase constant measurements repeating the flow situation for a blade position multiple times and accumulating the data over multiple measurements triggered at this blade position see e g felli et al 2011 in this way the smoothing over all blade positions leading to the smooth cones in fig 8 could be avoided while the spatial resolution of the flow field could still be increased by accumulating the information in particle tracks recorded in multiple measurements therefore phase constant measurements should be used in future studies to improve the post processing capabilities as the tracking algorithm needs some time steps to identify the tracks 4 5 laser light compared to high power led illumination for volumetric ptv measurements fig 10 shows the averaged velocity fields behind the starboard propeller with the perpendicular setup both measurements show a similar velocity field but different shapes of the jet one reason for the differences can be the interaction of the led housing with the flow the led is located at a relatively small distance above the measurement volume depending on the setup and light access the led light source is a good and simple alternative option however there is no streamlined water tight housing available yet therefore the led light source can only be partly immersed e g surrounded by an acrylic glass housing and can only be used at zero or very low towing speed to maximise the recorded led light power the duty cycle of 10 must be utilised resulting in a light pulse length of 200 μ s at 500hz this must be taken into account in the experimental design to ensure that no particle streaks occur in the camera images and that the background scattered light is not dominant due to the longer exposure time of the cameras due to the limited illuminance of the led compared to the laser at approximately 2m s and faster the laser could provide the better illumination this is explained by the longer exposure time of the cameras which needs to be adjusted because of the lower illuminance 5 summary and conclusions detailed flow measurements were carried out in the jet of a ducted propeller in bollard pull condition in addition to classical 2d3c piv the shake the box particle tracking method was applied and compared the piv system relies on good optical access to the flow field of interest known underwater 2d3c piv torpedo setups are considered too large especially with regard to their interference with the flow in shallow water conditions the minishaker underwater used here has compact housings for the multi camera and the lighting unit acquisition of large amounts of raw data is extremely fast and calibration requires minimal effort in the basin while post processing is more time consuming compared to 2d3c piv despite the different boundary conditions of the setups the results of both techniques show the same flow patterns for averaged vector fields while 2d3c piv allows for higher spatial resolution in one plane the volumetric particle tracking generally allows for a more detailed analysis of transient flows however presumably due to too low seeding density this could not be demonstrated here as expected which method is more suitable for a particular application depends strongly on the expected flow characteristics hub vortex cavitation occurred for propeller rates above 17hz and was a challenge for measurements close to the propeller plane at small distances the cavitation is visible in the images the reflections caused problems especially during post processing of the piv measurements as the punctual overexposure cannot be evaluated reasonably therefore the propeller rate was limited to 17hz for most measurements resulting in reynolds numbers that are lower than normally required for open water tests the resulting scale effects must be taken into account in further analysis based on the tests carried out here a system was developed with the following improvements the working distance between the measuring volume and the multi camera was increased from 600 mm to 1100 mm in order to minimise the interaction with the flow field during shallow water experiments the focal length of the lenses was increased to keep the measurement volume and resolution more or less constant as a result a reduction in optical quality due to blurring must be accepted in applications with high seeding density adjusting the orientation of the minishaker has been simplified by changes to the swivel and articulated joint an externally visible scale was added to facilitate identification of the basic orientation relative to the experimental setup the stability of the internal mounts for camera and optics was improved to counteract misalignment due to vibration the volumetric led lighting approach has been proven to work in principle at low flow rates and greatly simplifies installation and safety measures with an optimised waterproof housing this may favour a more frequent and cost effective use of the ptv technique however this requires further investigation when the new hardware and housing are available credit authorship contribution

20624,design loads for extreme wave events on ships such as slamming and green water are hard to define these events depend on details in the incoming waves ship motions and structure layout which requires high fidelity tools such as cfd or experiments to obtain the correct loads these tools presently do not have the capability to fully resolve the long term statistics of rare events in all metocean conditions over the ship s lifetime the idea of screening is to use lower fidelity numerical methods to identify the occurrence of extreme load events based on an indicator a good indicator has a strong correlation to the design load but is easier to calculate a high fidelity tool can then be used to find the loads in these events the low fidelity statistics and the high fidelity loads can be combined to define a design load and its probability the present study compares different numerical screening indicators for green water loads on a containership against experiments the quality of the identification of the critical events and the required computational time served as comparison metrics this showed that screening both with potential flow tools and with coarse mesh cfd tools is feasible provided the indicator grid time step and wave input settings are well chosen the results from coarse mesh cfd are slightly better than from potential flow but the computational costs are much higher the results also show that the peaks and steepness of the relative wave elevation around the bow are suitable green water load indicators as well as the undisturbed wave crests at the bow fine mesh cfd calculations were done for the identified events based on an example indicator which resulted in a green water load distribution very close to that of the experiments this study shows that screening could potentially reduce the required high fidelity modelling time with up to 90 compared to common practice keywords screening critical events extreme events waves green water design loads multi fidelity approach potential flow coarse mesh cfd 1 introduction 1 1 background and objectives an important but hard to answer question for every ship design is how to handle extreme loading in waves such as slamming and green water more concretely what should be the design green water load on a deck structure in the ship s operational profile this is the topic of the present study by cooperative research ships crs wave impact phenomena are highly non linear johannessen and hagen 2012 and their loads depend on details in the flow which means that they cannot be calculated with fast low fidelity methods such as potential flow much progress has been made in recent years with high fidelity modelling such as cfd and experiments good results were obtained with different types of cfd codes for extreme wave impacts on ships at zero speed pákozdi et al 2014 oger et al 2014 bandringa and helder 2018 and at forward speed nielsen 2003 kawamura et al 2016 ge et al 2018 air entrapments complicate such calculations bogaert 2018 scharnke 2019 but their effect seems limited in green water impacts on deck structures buchner 2002 van essen et al 2020b accurate fine mesh cfd results of the green water loads for the same case study as considered in the present publication were presented by bandringa et al 2020 see fig 1 still present computational resources limit such detailed cfd calculations to a few 10 20 s events for the final ship design extreme events in waves are relatively rare which makes obtaining their statistics challenging on the one hand there is the long term information about the metocean conditions in the area of operation wave scatter diagrams wave spectra wind and current conditions and operational data such as sailing route sailing speeds and loading conditions and on the other hand there is the high fidelity modelling that typically has the capability to calculate loads over a few minutes there is a need for a screening procedure including tools with different levels of fidelity and computational time to help make the sea state and event selections the following steps are distinguished see also fig 2 1 define scatter diagrams for the operational profile 2 select critical sea states from the scatter diagram long term screening 3 generate wave and response realisation time traces 4 select critical events in these time traces short term screening 5 calculate the extreme loads for these events using a high fidelity tool cfd model tests 6 use the loads from step 5 and the statistics from steps 2 and 4 to predict the long term design loads and their probability unfortunately the highest wave crest does not always lead to the largest load it is therefore often important to account for other wave and ship parameters the idea is to use a fast screening or surrogate model for the selections of 2 and 4 such a model should be able to calculate an indicator that has a strong relation to the critical load an example of an indicator for green water could be relative wave elevation rwe if there is a fast tool that can calculate rwe reasonably accurately this can be used to identify possibly critical green water events to run in a high fidelity tool the approach can in principle be used for any type of rare event in waves in the present study the green water loads on the breakwater of a container ship are used as case study the objectives are to evaluate whether event selection based on a numerical indicator is feasible for this case and if so to find suitable tools and indicators this validates short term screening step 4 in the procedure some first results for step 5 and 6 are also provided the study thus contributes towards an overall screening approach that could predict the design green water loads with a certain probability level based on long term wave information 1 2 review of earlier work the first studies that explicitly mention screening were done when weakly non linear time domain seakeeping calculations were still computationally demanding linear screening was applied to find interesting occurrences of for instance global ship bending moments torhaug 1996 dietz 2004 the increase of computational power and development of cfd in recent years makes screening potentially interesting for highly non linear phenomena such as green water loading relevant literature can roughly be divided into three groups 1 identification of suitable indicators for green water or slamming impacts which are considered to be similar phenomena 2 speeding up the screening using response conditioning methods rcm instead of monte carlo simulations mcs and 3 the interaction between different levels of tools finally the common practice for present designs is explained indicators many studies focus on the details of green water or slamming impact loads but the present study considers indicators that predict their occurrence hennig et al 2015 showed strong effects on non linear effects such as upwelling non linear waves and wave breaking on local slamming and airgap impact loads on platforms scharnke 2019 added that air entrapments and jets on the front of a deck box may lead to local variations in wave impact loads but also showed that direct impacts dominate the loading process for the global impacts this is promising for screening as global flow is easier to solve with low fidelity tools than local details in 1964 already ochi 1964b related relative vertical water velocity at a ship bow to peak slamming loads and ochi 1964a showed that green water loads can be related to the static pressure of water on deck buchner 1994 showed that the forward speed of the ship causes a dynamic amplification of this pressure bales 1977 linked the occurrence of slamming and green water for a ship sailing in head seas to rwe and showed that the influence of non linearity in the incoming waves can be significant voogt and buchner 2004 confirmed this effect of wave steepness on impacts ersdal and kvitrud 2000 showed that the pitch motions of a ship as well as the memory effects in wave groups are important in the occurrence of green water events buchner 2002 developed an empirical method to determine green water loads based on rwe and water height and velocity on deck ogawa et al 2002 and van t veer and vlasveld 2014 showed that non linearity should be considered to estimate higher rwe on the bow of a ship but also showed that the general trends of freeboard exceedance on a floating platform can be predicted using potential flow this is promising for a screening application where the exact predicted indicator value is less important than its relative ordering with respect to the green water load eggers et al 2012 stated that the potential energy of the water flowing on deck is a better indicator to predict the green water loading on crew and deck structures of small and fast ships such as sailing yachts grin et al 2013 buchner et al 2014 and van essen et al 2020a showed that waves running up along the side of vessels could be used as indicator for green water impacts on structures on their side such as overhanging lifeboats on cruise ships two types of impacts on a sailing ship were distinguished by kapsenberg 2018 due to large ship motions and due to steep wave impacts they may require different indicators either related to ship motions relative vertical bow motion or velocity or to wave properties steepness crest kinematics a number of studies identified experimental impact indicators stansberg 2008 defined an impact alert parameter based on undisturbed wave crest height wave height orbital velocity and steepness to screen sea states for the occurrence of bow flare slamming and green water impacts on an fpso deck house bunnik et al 2018 showed that the rwe and its rise time may be good indicators to screen for wave impacts on both tension leg and semi submersible platforms bunnik et al 2019 showed that the undisturbed wave crest height is a suitable indicator for wave in deck loads on a jacket platform and undisturbed wave steepness for impacts on a wind turbine and finally stansberg 2020 showed that the undisturbed vertical wave rise velocity is a good indicator for wave in deck loads on a gravity based structure in summary it seems that non linear rwe wave steepness and pitch motions could be indicators that predict the occurrence of green water loads on larger ships wave groups could also be considered as indicator variables describing the water flow flux or kinematics on or just in front of the deck may also be considered if they can be calculated with a lower fidelity tool response conditioning these methods can be used to find a wave event conditioned on a certain target response value or probability this can be used to speed up screening compared to mcs in this category the equivalent design wave edw method conditions a regular wave based on a linear response transfer function one step more complex several methods are based on the new wave theory lindgren 1970 tromans et al 1991 this provides an irregular gaussian wave group profile based on the auto correlation function of the wave spectrum for a target response examples are the original theory target wave crest amplitude the most likely wave mlw method friis hansen and nielsen 1995 target wave crest amplitude and instantaneous frequency the most likely extreme response mler method adegeest et al 1998 and its directional version dmler pastoor 2002 target linear response amplitude and its mean frequency the most likely response wave mlrw or conditioned random response wave crrw method dietz 2004 dietz et al 2004 taylor et al 1997 generates a range of wave profile realisations for a target response amplitude and response frequency by accounting for the random background of the sea state and response function this means that it is no longer assumed that all wave components are in phase at the crest of the design wave but have one of the phase realisations leading to the target response when the target wave frequency is the mean wave frequency the mlw and original new wave profiles are identical similarly when the target response frequency is the mean response frequency the mean mlrw and the mler wave profiles are identical the aforementioned methods all condition the wave profile on a specific value for the response usually the most probable maximum mpm for the given exposure duration the design loads generator dlg kim 2012 and its non linear response version nl dlg seyffert 2018 extend this to a probabilistic approach finding a range of irregular linear wave events that fit the ensemble maximum response distribution for the given exposure duration dlg can generate an ensemble of wave elevations that would produce the extreme value distribution of a target response for a given exposure period this method was successfully applied to find the statistics of non linear responses such as whipping in head sea or parametric rolling in short crested seaways kim et al 2012 kim and troesch 2014 while the approaches in dietz et al 2004 and kim 2012 can account for parameters such as wave steepness and memory effects of ship motion in wave groups these approaches have not been directly applied to the prediction of extreme green water impacts yet seyffert et al 2020 compares mcs results for trimaran bending moments to results from dlg and modified versions of edw and crrw showing that dlg provided the closest results to mcs all mentioned rcm techniques deliver linear gaussian wave profiles which may limit their applicability to highly non linear events however they may be interesting to consider when a screening method based on linear wave input is selected interaction fidelity levels the use of screened events in a high fidelity tool step 4 to 5 is challenging due to the reduced order wave modelling in most screening tools a method to solve the problem of running a linear wave event in cfd is described by johannessen and lande 2018 the event matching method events were selected based on an indicator in linear mcs these events were matched to a database of fully non linear wave events after which the closest fit non linear event was run in cfd this enables the inclusion of higher order wave effects and wave breaking in the screening process this importance of wave breaking in screening for wave in deck loads was confirmed by bøckmann et al 2018 however this method is hard to apply when ship motions and forward speed are important alternatively direct coupling methods such as applied in pákozdi et al 2014 could be used common practice in the offshore industry the contour linemethod haver and kleiven 2004 haver and winterstein 2008 is often used to derive long term design loads for wave impacts this approach uses general rcm method iform inverse first order reliability method winterstein et al 1993 to identify contour lines of equal joint sea state parameter probability e g wave height and period accounting for some short term variability the method equals the long term probability of the response to the long term probability of the sea state the short term probability of the response in a few identified sea states is then evaluated using many experimental wave realisations with a certain exposure duration e g 3 h this approach is commonly applied e g dnv 2010 but some of the assumptions are under debate the approach disregards the contribution of long exposure times in relatively mild sea states to the failure probability it favours short exposures of severe conditions and it does not account for multi modal failure due to different failure modes seyffert et al 2021 other limitations are the need to simplify the joint distribution of the environmental parameters which may disregard complex interactions and the assumption that sea states are independent disregarding the influence of groupiness due to storms the latter two limitations were improved in an alternative procedure based on hindcast data by derbanne and de hauteclocque 2019 1 3 approach some of the aforementioned studies included numerical screening indicators but usually only one or a few and for weakly non linear phenomena numerical indicators are required in practice as experimental data is usually not available in an early design stage the number of studies focussing on green water impacts on ships at speed is also limited if screening methods are considered in earlier studies they are usually fully linear e g potential flow this is logical as long term screening can only be done based on simplified models containing only the essential physics however for green water impacts it can be imagined that some wave non linearity is essential to identify the correct critical events the present study therefore compares the use of a large number of numerical screening indicators and tools to predict green water loads on a sailing ship including validation with experiments and including some methods based on non linear wave input green water events are rare so very long duration experiments would be required to obtain converged statistical data in order to enable validation based on limited duration data experiments were deterministically reproduced in the numerical tools instead the downside of this approach is that it requires deterministic wave reproduction in the numerical tools which is complicated this is also addressed as a direct deterministic comparison was used mcs or rcm were not required in the present study experiments were done with a containership measuring the green water impact forces on a breakwater five different potential flow tools and three different cfd tools with a very coarse mesh were applied to calculate various green water indicators the peaks in these indicators were then used to identify green water events which were compared to the actual experimentally measured events in order to validate them the simplified validation procedure is shown in fig 3 this is further explained in the following sections the quality of the identification of the critical events in the wave realisation and the required computational time serve as comparison metrics the speed of the computations is an important criterion as large amounts of wave data need to be screened in an early design stage this publication is structured as follows section 2 describes the experiments and section 3 the calculations section 4 explains some definitions and section 5 shows the screening results and discussion this includes a demonstration of the use of the identified events in a high fidelity tool to predict the load distribution and a comparison to common practice finally section 6 draws some conclusions and section 7 discusses possible future work 2 experiments experiments were done with a scale 37 89 model of the kcs container ship simman 1997 see fig 4 its full scale dimensions at the selected draught are l p p 230 m b 32 2 m t 10 8 m with a freeboard at the bow of 7 4 m all results in the present publication are provided at full scale the tests were done in marin s seakeeping and manoeuvring basin smb measuring 170 40 5 m the model was tested in a free sailing set up with its own active propulsion consisting of a propeller at a fixed rpm and an active rudder it was steered with an autopilot to keep its heading a constant speed was required for the measurement carriage and the attached wave probes for the deterministic numerical reproduction of the wave conditions see section 3 in order to enable this without losing the model the free sailing set up was combined with a cardanic pole set up acting as spring in surge direction surge stiffness of the system 6 5e3 kn m leading to a natural surge period of 18 9 s see fig 4 the model surge speed varied due to the first order wave excitation but the second order low frequency speed variations were limited by the spring all other ship motions sway heave roll pitch and yaw were free the model sailed in head and bow quartering waves in head waves the measurement carriage did not move in y direction in bow quartering waves it followed the model in y direction to account for the drift of the model the roll period of the ship was adjusted to 27 5 s such that it was far from wave encounter period in the tested conditions this reduced the influence of roll motions on the occurrence of green water events the model was instrumented to measure the six degree of freedom ship motions rwe at 11 locations along the weather side of the ship where relbow relst20 and relst19 are used in present publication rwe at 4 locations on the fore deck relsba an relsbf on starboard are used here impact forces on 40 panels on the front of a breakwater and on 50 panels on the side of a container stack throughout this publication results labelled as relbow are the rwe results at probe relbow the locations of these sensors are indicated in fig 4 only the force panels on the breakwater at the front of the block on deck are used in the present publication they were placed in 5 rows of each 8 panels at 16 0 m behind the forward perpendicular fpp each force panel had a size of 1 89 1 89 m full scale the incoming waves around the ship were also measured at three locations moving with the measurement carriage at a constant forward speed see fig 5 motions and incoming waves were measured at full scale sample frequency 16 2 hz rwe at 32 5 hz and forces at 780 or 1550 hz the experimental conditions are listed in table 1 the test conditions were determined such that a significant number of green water events occurred the wave conditions are relatively steep the vessel speeds were determined based on typical class requirements in severe waves and the estimated maximum sustained speed of the kcs in wind and waves nine tests in irregular waves at forward speed were performed each with a full scale duration around three hours the tests were performed in multiple consecutive runs as the basin has a finite length which were joined in the analysis in each three hour test one run was selected based on a large green water impact to be deterministically repeated without model to measure the undisturbed waves 1 1 naming convention a 6 digit number indicates a full test duration around 3 h and a 8 digit number indicates one run duration depending on vessel speed either around 30 min at 5 kn or around 15 min at 10 kn the run number is composed of the test number and two additional digits examples test 100504 run 1 is also called run 10050401 test 100505 run 10 is also run 10050510 for these runs some additional wave probes were placed over the centreline of the model see fig 5 even though the wave generator and measurement carriage motions were accurately repeated the repeatability of the wave condition in the basin is not perfect due to small wave induced currents and wave breaking effects this was discussed for the same experiments in van essen 2019 2021 based on that work the wave measurements with and without model were considered close enough to use the undisturbed waves as input for some deterministic calculations test 100504 is considered as example test in this publication it consists of 6 runs with a total duration of 3 14 h its first run 10050401 with a duration of 0 30 h is also used as example this particular run was also repeated without model to measure the undisturbed waves the other five runs were not two groups of results were generated for nine tests of three hours each and for this single example 30 min run they are abbreviated here as 3 h and 30 min respectively 3 calculations different numerical codes were evaluated as screening tools and each of these codes was used to derive a number of green water indicators several potential flow codes and cfd codes run on a coarse mesh were considered the properties of all codes and the calculated indicators are described in the present section the present study was based on calculations done by different project partners who each used their best practice and insight to derive the indicators it is therefore not a systematic study of all possible input variations but a comparison of the inputs considered to be best practice by each partner 3 1 potential flow different flavours of potential flow tools are available which differ in their handling of forward speed motion non linearity and wave non linearity first forward speed rankine source methods account correctly for forward speed in the source terms whereas methods using zero speed green s functions account only for forward speed in the encounter frequency corrections and the roll damping terms rankine source codes are expected to better describe rwe at the bow due to the prevention of unrealistic wave pile up the forward speed for the present study is low so the differences were expected to be small both types of methods are included in the present study secondly the codes differ in the level of non linearity of the motion calculation linear and weakly non linear froude krylov methods are available the latter methods account for some non linearity in the ship motions by using the actual wetted area instead of the calm water wetted area in the calculation of the diffraction forces the ship motions are limited for the 230 m ship in short and steep waves but the froude krylov terms may slightly improve the calculated indicators both types of methods are included in the present study finally different choices can be made for the wave non linearity most potential flow methods include linear input waves but some account for second or higher order waves however most available non linear wave potential flow methods only calculate undisturbed waves they are not well validated and used for ship response especially not at forward speed this may be an option for the future the use of wave only codes for screening may also be considered if the ship motions are small the wave non linearity is expected to be more important than the ship motion non linearity in the present steep wave conditions presently only potential flow tools with linear wave input are included in the study of course there is also the difference in frequency or time domain codes but as long as the described physics are the same different results are not anticipated the following potential flow tools were applied by the maritime research institute netherlands marin bureau veritas bv and american bureau of shipping abs hs linear frequency domain zero speed greens function diffraction code hydrostar applied by bv hs weakly non linear froude krylov time domain code hydrostar based on hydrostar diffraction input applied by bv nl3 weakly non linear froude krylov time domain codenload3d abs 2013 based on rankine source diffraction input applied by abs pre linear frequency domain zero speed greens function diffraction code precal r developed by crs applied by marin fat linear frequency domain rankine source diffraction code fatima bunnik 1999 applied by marin an overview of the applied code versions properties and settings is provided in appendix a as explained in the introduction the wave conditions have to be deterministically reproduced in the numerical tools this is not straightforward as the undisturbed waves at the required input locations are not directly available fig 6 shows steps taken to define this wave input per code all considered potential flow methods require linear ised wave input at the ship centre of gravity cog undisturbed wave repeat runs are not available for the full 3 h tests this means that the waves have to be propagated to the ship cog based on wave measurements around the model this was done using linear dispersion for all codes different wave probes can be selected to serve as basis for the propagation fig 5 the difference in results between input based on probe w1 or w2 is only an issue in the validation study performed here in a real screening study there are still limitations due to the linear wave input in the potential flow codes but not due to linear propagation from another location the error introduced by the assumed linear wave propagation for relatively steep sea states in the screening validation study should therefore not affect the results more than necessary the reference wave probe leading to the best match with the experiments was therefore selected for each test this depends on different effects propagation distance shorter should be better so errors larger from w1 than w2 diffracted waves from the model to the probe larger at w2 than w1 and larger in bow quartering waves than in head waves and radiated waves from the model larger at w2 than w1 and larger at higher speed the input probe was therefore selected per test based on the average correspondence of rwe and motions from all potential flow codes with the experiments this led to selection of input wave probe w1 for all tests in bow quartering waves and test 100502 in head waves at 10 kn speed and probe w2 for all tests in head waves at 5 kn speed the potential flow results in the remainder of this publication are all based on this choice fig 6 shows that the project participants made different choices for the potential flow code wave input which may partly determine the outcome for hs and hs a spectral energy limit was used at the input wave probe location and the wave input was re sampled the nl3 wave input was also re sampled for pre and fat the input waves were not changed instead their response functions were interpolated at the wave fft frequencies before applying them to the waves at the ship cog 3 2 coarse mesh cfd most cfd green water studies use one of the two major methods grid based eulerian navier stokes ns or particle based smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph the grid based methods have advanced greatly in recent years to 3d simulation of green water loads on ships at speed in irregular waves see e g fig 1 for the present coarse mesh application confidence in the grid refinement convergence characteristics of the cfd methods was required there is sufficient experience with the grid based methods to know approximately what to expect from coarse grids whereas the experience with particle based methods was not sufficient to know what to expect from coarsely distributed particle meshes only grid based methods were therefore evaluated in the present study also because this type of methods is relatively efficient the following three coarse mesh finite volume cfd methods were applied to in order to calculate green water indicators ofa and ofa1 unstructured grid finite volume cfd method openfoam applied by abs using a dynamic overset grid technique shen and korpus 2015 shen et al 2016 and thewave2foam library for wave generation and absorption jacobsen et al 2012 ofa was run for the 3 h test 100504 and ofa1 for the 30 min run 10050401 only which also necessitates different wave input this is further explained below ofb unstructured grid finite volume cfd method openfoam applied by bv using the foamstar library for wave generation and absorption benhamou et al 2018 cf1 2 3 structured cartesian grid finite volume cfd method comflow luppes et al 2013 applied by marin this was run on three different grids grid 1 coarse to grid 3 very coarse for details see table 7 the finest grid 1 was only run for the 2d wave input the other two grids both for the 2d wave input and the 3d simulations including model the coarse mesh simulations were done in two steps 2d undisturbed wave propagation and simulation on an equivalent 3d mesh including the ship the cfd codes were only applied to tests in head waves so 2d undisturbed wave results are sufficient an overview of the applied code versions properties and grid and time step settings is provided in appendix a the cfd codes need wave input at their defined inflow locations which were defined at different locations in the different codes fig 7 gives an overview of the steps taken to define this input this figure shows that different choices were made for the inflow location and the wave definition at this location these differences have to be kept in mind as they partly determine the outcome all considered coarse mesh cfd codes were applied to the same 30 min run 10050401 see next section 3 3 for which there is an undisturbed wave repeat run available abs also applied openfoam to full 3 h test 100504 so to run 10050401 and five other runs for which no undisturbed wave repeat run was available ofa1 for one run and ofa for six runs therefore have a different wave input method for the 3 h test with ofa the waves at probe w45 with model were used as basis for the input whereas for ofa1 the undisturbed waves at probe w2 were the basis for the input in both cases these waves were linearly propagated to the wave inflow location ofb used a similar procedure as ofa1 linear propagation of the measured waves at one of the probe locations to the inflow location after applying a spectral energy limit to the waves at the input wave probe all three codes ofa ofa1 and ofb added first order wave kinematics to the thus defined wave elevation at the inflow location cf1 3 used a different approach the inflow was defined at probe location w1 such that the measured waves could directly be used as input without the need of propagation from another location cf1 3 also used second order wave kinematics sharma and dean 1979 at the inflow location based on the first order wave elevation the measured wave elevation was split in first and second order components in order to do this following stansberg 1998 buchner et al 2007 3 3 calculation conditions and indicators table 2 shows the numerical test programme an overview of the experimental conditions that were re created deterministically by each code most coarse mesh cfd codes were only applied to 30 min run 10050401 first run of test 100504 see section 2 as explained before the wave input for ofa1 and ofa was different the screening results for the 3 h and 30 min durations cannot be directly compared because especially the 30 min results are probably not converged this is no problem for deterministic relative comparison but it is for comparison to another duration two groups of results 3 h and 30 min are therefore discussed separately in the following sections in order to relate the 30 min results to the 3 h results the pre and ofa results were also added to the 30 min comparisons table 2 also provides an overview of the considered green water indicators per tool the experimental indicators are included for reference these provide a baseline for some indicators no matter how well the rwe is calculated it will probably not serve as a better indicator than the experimentally measured rwe possible green water indicators such as crests in undisturbed wave elevation peaks in rwe at different locations their rise time and crest front steepness both defined in section 4 and troughs in vertical bow position and velocity were calculated the coarse mesh cfd indicators also include the coarse mesh force over the total breakwater and on the bottom row of 8 force panels this force will likely not be calculated accurately as that would require a much finer mesh see bandringa et al 2020 however the idea of screening is that the relative order of the impact forces from the coarse mesh calculations is similar to the order of real impact forces from the experiments or fine mesh cfd calculations this would make it useable for screening other coarse mesh indicators are the peaks in the water fluxes through three vertical planes on deck definition see appendix a signal peaks and their rise time and crest front steepness are defined in section 4 4 definitions 4 1 failure mode the target of any screening exercise is the prediction of a failure mode the critical design load on a structure in the present study this is defined as a large total green water force in x direction on the breakwater of the kcs in the experiments this was derived from the sample by sample sum of all 40 breakwater panel forces fig 4 any mention of fx in the present publication refers to this total force it can be discussed whether typical deck structures are most sensitive to the peak force value or to the duration or total impulse of the green water force this depends on the specific structure the peak forces were deemed most critical for the relatively large breakwater structure so these are used as failure mode in the present study some of the screening quality work was repeated for the prediction of impulse of the force peaks this showed that it is slightly easier to predict force impulse than peak force this may be because peak forces are more sensitive for small details in the flow and therefore vary more for the same indicator peak value this is not further elaborated here 4 2 rise time and crest front steepness the rise time t c r of a peak in a signal is defined as the time between the peak and the last previous time that the indicator reached 10 of the peak value in the time trace see fig 8 the dimensionless crest front steepness ϵ of an indicator peak is defined as in myrhaug and kjeldsen 1986 but modified to include the t c r defined here this is defined in eq 1 where c is the crest or peak height and t d o w n the zero down crossing period around the considered peak especially the crest front steepness is sensitive for discontinuities in the signal which are mainly due to concatenation of the different experimental runs in a 3 h test peaks very close to run changes were therefore removed from all time traces before further analysis 1 ϵ 2 π c g t d o w n t c r 4 3 matching peaks in indicator to peaks in failure mode signal in order to evaluate the screening quality it is required to deterministically match peaks in an indicator signal to experimental force peaks this is not straightforward there is usually a time difference between an indicator peak and the corresponding impact force peak and not each indicator peak leads to a force peak the time difference depends on the type of green water event hammerfist plunging scooping the selected indicator and its location with respect to the deck structure the wave propagation velocity and kinematics the propagation velocity of the green water over the deck and the ship motions two different correlation methods to couple indicator peaks i ˆ p to corresponding failure mode load peaks f ˆ p were therefore used depending on the type of indicator signal where p is the peak index in both cases first all start up and end effects were removed from the experimental and numerical time traces a correlation method based on the indicator zero up crossing times t z u i p was used for continuous signals such as undisturbed wave elevation see eq 2 the maximum load between each set of indicator zero up crossings was coupled to the associated zero up crossing indicator peak this does not have to be a peak load simply the maximum measured value from the experiments within this interval was taken the result of this procedure is illustrated in fig 9 on the left 2a i ˆ p max i t z u i p t t z u i p 1 2b f ˆ p max f t z u i p t t z u i p 1 for continuous signals for more peaked indicator signals without zero crossings such as relative wave elevation on deck an alternative correlation method based on time intervals of a few seconds around peaks above a threshold was used see eq 3 the intervals based on the indicator peaks usually do not fully cover the time trace which could lead to missing important force peaks therefore a two way version of this matching method was applied using both the indicator and failure mode peaks as lead signal the times of the peak over threshold indicator peaks t ˆ i p and of the failure mode peaks t ˆ f p were joined the threshold for this peak over threshold analysis is selected just above the noise level of each signal a time interval of a few seconds d was then applied in order to remove grouped peak intervals next the maximum indicator value and maximum failure mode value were determined for each interval around the joined peak times t ˆ p the result of this procedure is illustrated in fig 9 on the right the same procedures can also be used to link to signals of the same type for instance to make a scatter diagram of numerical wave crests versus experimental wave crests 3a t ˆ p t ˆ i p t ˆ f p grouped 1 peak within d 3b i ˆ p max i t ˆ p d t t ˆ p d 3c f ˆ p max f t ˆ p d t t ˆ p d for peaked signals 4 4 screening quality index the quality of the identification of critical events by a combination of calculation tool and indicator is expressed by the screening quality index sqi first indicator peaks from a numerical tool were matched deterministically to force peaks from the experiments see section 4 3 a false negative occurs when the indicator does not predict a green water event but it nonetheless occurs a false positive occurs when the indicator predicts a green water event but the event does not occur a green water event is defined as a force on the breakwater above a given threshold see section 4 1 forces below this threshold are not considered green water events that need to be captured sqi is then defined in eq 4 and visualised in the left plot of fig 10 it is equal to the ratio of total number of positives over the number of correct positives allowing no false negative above the threshold load horizontal line in scatter plot in the formulation p are all correct positive events p are all false positive events i ˆ p and f ˆ p are still the matched indicator and force peaks p is the matched peak index and f t is the considered force threshold n x indicates the number of elements in x 4 sqi f t total of positives f t of correct positives f t n p f t p f t n p f t n i ˆ p min i ˆ p f ˆ p f t n f ˆ p f t the most left data point above the force threshold in the scatter plot of fig 10 corresponding to a low indicator peak but a relatively high force peak determines sqi a perfect indicator leads to sqi 1 for all thresholds in that case every considered indicator peak corresponds to a significant force peak and the scatter plot shows a linear relation with points only in the correct positive and correct negative areas the thus defined sqi can be plotted as function of force threshold increasing the threshold moves the horizontal line in the left plot of fig 10 upwards over the y axis the resulting sqi can be found using the same threshold on the x axis of the right plot the right plot can be used to compare different tool and indicator combinations each combination adds a line to such a plot and the lowest line corresponds to the best result as the present publication includes a large number of wave conditions numerical tools and indicators the overall comparison will be made based on a reduced dataset for this purpose firstly the sqi corresponding to the 10 th highest force peak was used this ensures that the 10 highest force peaks in each test are predicted the number of correct positives is then equal to 10 for each test regardless of the numerical tool and indicator this corresponds to a different force threshold per sea state see table 3 for reference the maximum measured force per test is also given this shows that the maximum force in 30 min run 10050401 is close to that in 3 h test 100504 a run with a large peak was selected but the 10 event threshold is lower due to the shorter duration assuming that a screening approach as described in section 1 1 needs high fidelity calculations for the 10 highest load peaks in step 5 the number of events to run in e g fine mesh cfd is equal to 10 times sqi an ideal indicator would predict all of them correctly sqi 1 which means that 10 events need to be run secondly the average sqi over the full range of thresholds up to the maximum experimental force per test was used whether aiming for the 10 highest force peaks in 3 h is a good goal for a screening study needs to be evaluated in a follow up study the present study will compare indicators and tools in a relative sense the outcome of which is not expected to change significantly based on the force threshold both the 10 event and average sqi values are used for this purpose 5 results and discussion 5 1 wave and response time traces the basis for the screening results described in the following sections are the time traces of waves and ship responses from the experiments and numerical tools these time traces can also be compared directly which may help to find the cause of good or bad screening performance an outlier in a screening quality plot can probably be related to the numerical reproduction of the waves or to the prediction of the ship response however direct wave and response comparison is not the main purpose of the present paper these results are therefore concisely discussed in appendix b the main conclusions are summarised here the considerations in section 3 lead to some differences in input waves between the different codes linear propagation from the wave probes to the cog was used for all potential flow codes which introduces similar errors compared to the real non linear properties of the steeper wave conditions negligence of higher order wave wave interactions and wave breaking the appendix also shows some differences between the different potential flow wave results due to analytical post processing of the experimental wave measurements fig 6 hs hs underpredicts the highest undisturbed wave crests as the largest green water impacts are probably related to large and steep waves this could be an issue for screening this is further discussed in the next sections the coarse mesh openfoam undisturbed wave results ofa available for one 3 h test deviate more from the experiments than the potential flow results the appendix explains that this is probably mostly due to the choices made for the ofa wave input linear analytical wave elevation propagation from the experimental measurements at w45 to the inflow location was used and linear wave kinematics were added after which the waves were propagated in the cfd code to the model and the other probes see fig 7 the coarse mesh cfd wave results for 30 min run 10050401 show how these results could be improved for instance by defining the inflow directly at an experimental wave probe location and adding second instead of first order wave kinematics these results also show significant differences in undisturbed waves at w11 close to the ship bow between the coarse mesh cfd codes especially for the higher wave crests the ofa1 and ofb results are very similar and quite far below the experimental results for the highest wave crests whereas the highest comflow crests are closer to the experiments with a slight overestimation of the largest crests the differences in undisturbed waves between the three comflow grids cf1 3 are small the ship response results heave pitch relative wave elevation rwe from all potential codes and coarse mesh cfd codes are relatively close to the experiments but they are even closer to each other there is no significant difference between the time domain and frequency domain codes between the rankine source or zero speed green s function codes or between linear and weakly non linear codes the coarse mesh cfd results are also very close to the potential flow results the considered speeds are probably too low to show much better results with rankine source codes and the motions are relatively small in the steep short waves so the froude krylov force components are also small on average both the heave and pitch motion peaks are overestimated compared to the experiments by all codes which may be due to the absence underestimation of small viscous damping effects in potential flow and coarse mesh cfd the largest rwe peaks were slightly overestimated by all potential flow codes compared to the experiments this may be due to water flowing over deck in the experiments wave breaking that lowers experimental rwe for the highest peaks or overestimation of the numerical ship motions the similarity in heave pitch and rwe results indicates that the coarse mesh cfd screening results are not expected to be much better than the potential flow screening results on the other hand the extra indicators such as wave elevation on deck forces and fluxes that cfd can produce may be valuable extra indicators this is discussed in the next sections 5 2 screening quality index for 3 h tests the screening quality was evaluated for all considered codes indicators and 3 h tests the results of the potential flow codes were provided based on linear wave propagation from the best probe discussed in section 3 1 the results from coarse mesh cfd code ofa are also included for one of the 3 h tests the screening performance of the other coarse mesh codes based on the 30 min run are discussed in section 5 3 not all codes were run for all tests and indicators table 2 for consistency the legends of the plots in the present section contain all codes but the missing entries are empty the plots also include the results for experimentally measured indicators where possible the indicator peaks were matched to the experimental force peaks using the matching procedure in section 4 3 after which the sqi was derived according to section 4 4 for each of the available indicators and each of the nine 3 h tests a scatter plot of indicator versus force peaks and a sqi plot as function of force threshold was thus generated such plots are shown in fig 11 for one example test 100504 and two example indicators peaks in relst19 and crests in undisturbed waves at w11 the second indicator was not directly delivered by the potential flow codes it was derived by wave propagation according to linear dispersion from the time traces delivered at probe w1 as explained in section 3 1 this indicator was not calculated with ofa scatter plots for the other indicators for the same example test and for the two selected indicators for all other 3 h tests are shown in appendix c all other scatter plots are omitted from the present publication but their summary values are included in the further discussions these plots show that some of the considered indicators are quite bad such as the troughs in vertical bow motion or velocity or the inverse of the rise time of rwe at the bow their relation with the experimental force peaks is far from linear other indicators perform better the two selected indicators in fig 11 are two of the best performing indicators with numerical sqi values between 3 20 over the full threshold range this will be confirmed in a comparison of all indicators in section 5 5 as explained earlier sqi is quite sensitive for outliers appendix d highlights four events showing the calculated indicator peak the corresponding experimental force peak its position in the scatter and sqi plots and some video snapshots summarising some events are associated with relatively low but steep waves with high horizontal water velocities in the crest if these crests just exceed the freeboard they may be translated to a relatively low rwe but a high speed jet over the foredeck that impacts the breakwater these events are not well captured when the peaks in rwe at the bow are used as indicator but may be by for instance peaks in non linear horizontal water velocities in the wave crest secondly there are the higher steep wave crests breaking over the deck the linear rwe serve reasonably well as indicator in these cases but including some higher order incoming wave components associated with high breaking wave crests could improve the results it seems logical that the water sometimes comes from another side than where the relative wave probe is located which would lead to a bad screening performance for that event however no big sqi determining outliers due to this principle were identified in the rwe results missing non linearity in the rwe peaks and missing non linearity in the water velocities in the wave crests seem the determining factors for the force peaks that are not well predicted the sqi for prediction of the 10 highest events and the mean sqi over the threshold range both described in section 4 4 were derived from these plots for all tests and indicators these plots are presented in fig 12 for the same two example indicators these figures show quite some variation between the different tests but some general trends can be identified most potential flow codes perform very similarly in head waves test numbers 1005xx for the bow quartering waves 1007xx there is more variation but not always towards higher sqi and worse screening performance for the two tests at a higher speed of 10 kn 100502 and 100704 it was expected that rankine source codes nl3 and fat would perform better than the other codes however this is not clearly visible in the results this may be because this speed is still limited for higher speeds these codes may perform better in a relative sense but that is not very realistic for a containership in severe wave conditions the weakly non linear motion codes nl3 and hs also perform similar to the linear codes this is probably because the ship motions were small in the given steep wave conditions the steepness of the waves itself does seem to play a role in the screening performance as expected from potential flow a better performance was found for the least steep wave conditions such as test 100505 100506 and 100702 however this effect is not very strong and mixed with speed wave height and heading effects as it is complicated to obtain an overview of these results they are averaged over all tests or different groups of tests in section 5 5 after a similar analysis of the 30 min run in the next section 5 3 screening quality index for 30 min run for the 30 min run 10050401 similar scatters of indicator peaks versus experimental force peaks were made and the corresponding sqi plots over the full threshold range the results are shown in fig 13 for example indicators peaks in rwe at relst20 crests in undisturbed waves at w11 and peaks in coarse mesh total force on the breakwater similar plots for the other indicators in table 2 are omitted here the peaks at relative wave probe relst20 were selected here as example instead of the results at relst19 which served as example indicator for the 3 h tests because only a few of the coarse mesh cfd codes delivered results at relst19 at a first glance the scatter plots for the 30 min coarse mesh cfd results look similar in number of outliers and amount of scatter as observed for the 3 h potential flow results this is confirmed by the potential flow result pre that is included in these 30 min plots the coarse mesh cfd codes lead to lower sqi values but only marginally the overview of the sqi for the 10 highest peaks and the mean over the threshold ranges are directly presented in the final overview section 5 5 this section also includes a discussion of the difference between the coarse mesh cfd codes 5 4 3 h versus 30 min results as explained in the introduction a converged very long duration result is not required for the present deterministic comparison to the test results this means that the sqi values are not converged especially not in 30 min so the different durations cannot be compared one to one fig 14 shows the difference between the 3 h test 100504 and its first run 10050401 this shows indeed that the values based on the single run are lower however the relative order between the results from the three different tools is largely the same for the long duration test and the single run as expected this means that we can use the comparison to help determine which tools are expected to show the best green water indicators 5 5 final overview of screening capabilities and computational times the present section compares the screening quality results for all indicators and tools and both test durations if only the quality would be assessed fine mesh cfd tools and experiments would win the competition however we know that it is presently not feasible to screen a full scatter diagram with such tools the required computational times of the different tools are therefore also evaluated the higher the screening quality and the faster the tool the more suitable it is for screening the sqi for the 10 highest events and the average sqi over the threshold range from all 3 h tests are shown in fig 15 this plot includes all indicators and tools discussed in section 5 2 that are available for at least four of the 3 h tests and it shows average results over all tests or groups of tests a similar plot for 3 h test 100504 only is shown in fig 16 also including coarse mesh cfd code ofa finally fig 17 shows similar results for the 30 min run 10050401 based on the results in section 5 3 the computational times that were required in order to obtain these results are listed in table 4 3 h tests and table 5 30 min run where cpuh is defined as wall clock time times the number of cores on which the calculation was run the computational times for the frequency and time domain tools scale differently frequency domain codes are relatively expensive for short durations but cheap for a large number of conditions all coarse mesh cfd computational times were much longer than the potential flow times as expected still these times are significantly reduced compared to what would be required for a fine mesh simulation of the same duration ofa1 required a longer computational time for the 2d waves than ofb whereas this is the other way around for the 3d simulation this has to do with the adaptive time stepping used in the 3d simulation in ofb appendix a the required computational times for the comflow calculations are significantly shorter than for the openfoam simulations especially for the coarsest grid this probably has to do both with the cartesian grid modelling and the choices for the time steps and grid cells as expected figs 15 to 17 show that the experimental indicators perform better than those from the numerical tools for almost all measured indicators the differences in performance between the different potential flow codes are very small especially in head waves this is good news it does not matter a lot which potential flow code is available as discussed in section 5 2 the codes with zero speed green s function or rankine source diffraction linear or weakly non linear froude krylov frequency or time domain perform very similarly in bow quartering waves only hs and fat perform slightly less good than the other codes and nl3 slightly better this is not due to the wave input in hs or fat as that is the same as in respectively hs and pre over all 3 h tests the indicators peaks in relst19 relst20 and relbow perform quite well as well as the crest front steepness of relbow in head waves the undisturbed wave elevation at w11 performs even better this indicator was not evaluated in bow quartering waves but there is no reason to assume that it will work significantly less good for this heading this may open the road for the use of non linear wave modelling tools without ship for screening e g non linear potential flow coarse mesh volume of fluid or particle methods although the effect of forward speed would need to be considered based on the 3 h results for test 100504 fig 16 it can be observed that coarse mesh cfd code ofa and the potential flow codes lead to similar screening quality results for the indicators that were calculated with both such as crests and crest front steepness of rwe and of undisturbed incoming waves the additional ofa indicators related to peaks in coarse mesh breakwater force rwe on deck and fluxes through planes on deck also lead to similar or slightly better sqi values the wave input in the long duration ofa calculations could be improved but this is also valid to some extent for the potential flow results comparing ofa with the other coarse mesh cfd tools in the 30 min run will show how much improvement could be expected however table 4 shows that the required computational time to reach these similar results for one 3 h simulation is a factor 1000 100000 depending on reference code higher than that for the potential flow codes as said the sqi for 30 min cannot be directly compared to the sqi for 3 h but the relative ordering of the different codes is assumed to be comparable similar to the 3 h results the 30 min results in fig 17 show that good results were achieved with peaks in rwe around the bow as indicator with the lowest value for the experimental measurements as expected all coarse mesh cfd codes and pre also lead to low values for this indicator the crests in undisturbed wave elevation at w11 also perform well especially based on the average sqi over the threshold range the pre result in that case is the propagated wave elevation using linear dispersion from the w1 measurements including ship model the cfd specific indicators peaks in rwe on deck peaks in coarse mesh breakwater force and fluxes through planes on the fore deck also perform well in some cases even slightly better than the peaks in rwe ofb and ofa run 1 of the 3 h test 100504 perform least well compared to ofa1 and the cf1 3 results the difference between ofb and ofa1 is mainly due to grid and time step settings appendix a the choices made in ofa1 seem better suited to screening leading to lower sqi values against much shorter computational times table 5 the difference between ofa and ofa1 is only the wave input as expected the ofa1 undisturbed wave input leads to better results in cf1 3 a lot of attention was paid to the quality of the wave appendix b shows that the comflow undisturbed waves match the experiments better than the waves in all versions of openfoam fig 17 shows that this also translates to lower sqi values especially for grid 2 cf2 as the wave input methods were different as well as the applied code and grids the main cause for the differences cannot be identified however it is likely that the wave input and the grid and time step settings play a large role this implies that the ofa results in the 3 h test 100504 presented in fig 15 could be improved by improving the wave input method and possibly the grid and time step settings cf2 or cf3 seem the most suitable combinations of tool wave input grid and time step settings for coarse mesh cfd screening they lead to the lowest sqi values of all coarse mesh cfd codes fig 17 against the shortest computational times table 5 cf2 is slightly slower but with better sqi results cf3 is faster but with slightly less good sqi results still these coarse mesh cfd tools deliver only marginally better or even similar sqi results to the reference potential flow code pre while they take 416 or 56 cpuh against 2 cpuh for the full pre database this is a factor 20 200 in computational time increase for a factor 1 2 sqi improvement 5 6 high fidelity force distribution based on screened events as explained above potential flow methods are quicker than coarse mesh cfd and a have similar or only slightly lower screening quality as explained in section 1 it may also be possible to apply rcm based on the linear response functions from potential flow to further speed up the screening however in order to run the selected linear wave events in cfd without missing important higher order wave effects a method such as the event matching in johannessen and lande 2018 is required but then with ship motions and forward speed a possible motivation for eventually selecting coarse mesh cfd for screening can be found when considering the next step in the green water analysis where events identified by the screening method need to be assessed in detail using a high fidelity method when cfd is chosen for both the screening and the detailed analysis an automated coupling between the coarse and the fine mesh cfd simulations can be established this simplifies the workflow significantly such a coupling currently implemented in one of the cfd tools comflow allows the events that are identified as critical by the coarse mesh cfd simulation to be re run automatically on a much finer mesh to determine the detailed green water loads as in bandringa et al 2020 this coupling was used to illustrate the feasibility of the screening approach cf2 was used as screening tool to identify the 10 largest relbow indicator peaks in the 30 min run fig 17 shows that cf2 indicator peaks in relbow has a sqi of 1 2 for the 10 largest events in this run which is almost perfect it means that the 12 highest indicator peaks would have to be assessed in order to obtain the 10 highest forces in a practical problem the sqi would not be known sticking to the 10 highest impact peaks procedure a fine mesh comflow calculation was done for each of the 10 highest indicator peaks using the coarse mesh calculation wave input and ship motions and the fine mesh described in bandringa et al 2020 the forces from these 10 fine mesh calculations in combination with the statistics from the coarse mesh calculation lead to the force distribution in fig 18 this plot also shows the experimental force distribution for the same run the probability is given with respect to the number of wave encounters in this case 238 in the 30 min run the probability level does not start at one on the top because most wave encounters did not lead to a green water impact the figure shows that the distributions are very similar a weibull distribution fit to both sets of discrete data points would also lead to similar results this demonstration shows that the screening procedure is feasible and leads to the desired results the screening was not perfect the order of the 10 highest indicator peaks was slightly different than the order of the 10 highest force peaks two of the largest 10 impacts are missing and two other impacts are included however it turns out that these two other events also lead to large loads in this case this multi fidelity screening approach is much quicker than performing the full 30 min run on a fine mesh in cfd which would be a very heavy computation it could be further sped up by using a potential flow tool for screening however as said that requires some thinking about the use of linear wave input and ship motions as input for the fine mesh cfd calculation in the overall computational time screening quality i e the number of events from the screening procedure with the associated heavy fine mesh computation for each of them also has to be balanced against the computational time for the screening itself in a practical design problem the approach would not be applied to 30 min of wave data mcs with the screening tool would be applied for many wave realisations over a full scatter diagram rcm could maybe be used to speed up as explained in section 1 2 but only for screening based on linear gaussian wave input a similar plot as fig 18 would be made around the desired probability level where the screening simulation duration determines the probability level that can be resolved 5 7 benefit of screening approach compared to common practice in order to show the benefit of the screening procedure a brief comparison was made to the contour line approach discussed in section 1 2 this method would be used to select a few representative wave conditions from a scatter diagram as a containership sails around the world the scatter diagram could be derived from hindcast wave data based on the ship voyages instead of a fixed location each of the selected wave conditions would be run in a wave basin experiment for a large number of 3 h realisations now we consider screening for 3 h example test 100504 with two of the better potential flow indicators peaks in rwe at relst19 from pre and linearly propagated undisturbed wave crests measured at probe w2 to probe w11 table 1 shows that 1528 wave encounters were measured in the test duration without screening all of these crests would have to be run in a high fidelity tool in order to capture the 10 highest green water loads with screening this number can be significantly reduced the left plot in fig 12 shows that the 10 event sqi values for these two indicators are 12 6 respectively 13 4 we need to multiply these values with the number of relevant force peaks 10 in this case in order to determine how many events need to be assessed in a high fidelity tool this leads to 126 respectively 134 events which is a reduction of 91 92 compared to all wave encounters in the present experimental dataset only one 3 h realisation is available per wave condition whereas a number of realisations of this duration would be run in the contour line approach if the screening target would be to identify the 10 highest events in each realisation the ratio of events to analyse with and without screening will be the same for more realisations so still 91 92 reduction if the target is to identify the 10 highest events over all realisations the ratio will probably be even more favourable for screening assuming that the 3 h sqi is converged and assuming that 20 realisations of 3 h duration would be required this could reduce the number of events with even 99 6 1 130 1528 20 the computational time with screening tool pre in order to achieve this is only 2 cpuh see table 4 this could possibly be further reduced using rcm although generating the frequency domain database is more expensive than running the mcs for 20 wave realisations of 3 h this may translate to a significantly shorter experimental basin time or lower number of fine mesh cfd calculations these percentages are rough indications that do not consider the required pre event time in a high fidelity analysis or the groupiness of events it is not possible to run only one wave crest in a high fidelity tool which reduces the efficiency of the screening compared to the numbers above on the other hand individual high wave crests usually occur in groups so a few critical events could probably be grouped in one high fidelity experiment calculation this may partly compensate the pre event time effect finally the sqi value varies quite a lot with test condition see fig 12 so the reduction will not be as large in every wave condition however example test 100504 is not the test with the best result for these two example indicators the sqi values vary between 4 1 and 64 1 over all nine 3 h tests the average values in fig 15 provide estimates for an arbitrary wave condition summarising this study shows that a reduction in the order of 90 of the high fidelity experimental or computational time required to obtain the short term largest green water loads on a sailing ship can be achieved using a smart screening procedure however the amount of saved time depends on the selected indicator and screening tool on the wave condition and on the balance between groupiness of the indicator peaks and the required pre event time in the high fidelity tool 6 conclusions 1 screening for green water events on the breakwater of a sailing containership is feasible this can be done both with potential flow and coarse mesh cfd codes provided the indicator is well chosen as well as the grid time step and wave input settings 2 using linear potential flow means that the input waves are linearised disregarding the effects of higher order wave wave interactions and wave breaking on the identification of the critical events however the present study shows that the screening results from linear potential flow are nearly as good as from coarse mesh cfd for the considered test case 3 the potential flow methods are much faster than coarse mesh cfd which is favourable for long term screening it may even be possible to further speed up the potential flow screening using response conditioning as it is based on linear gaussian wave input this is not possible for cfd 4 if potential flow screening is indeed used questions regarding the use of the low fidelity screening output in high fidelity cfd or experiments have to be solved this is easier for the combination of coarse mesh cfd screening and fine mesh cfd high fidelity calculations in that case the required output can directly be generated 5 the final choice has to be made based on the overall computational time balancing the time for the screening and the time for the high fidelity assessment lower screening quality increases the number of events to evaluate in detail the low to high fidelity coupling may also play a role based on the present results screening with potential flow codes seems the best choice especially for long term screening of full scatter diagrams 6 the peaks in relative wave elevation rwe around the bow perform well as green water indicator as well as the crest front steepness of the rwe the undisturbed wave crest heights at the bow also seem a good indicator cfd specific indicators such as peaks in rwe on deck in coarse mesh breakwater force and in fluxes through planes on the fore deck perform even slightly better missing non linearity in the rwe peaks and missing non linearity in the water velocities in the wave crests seem the determining factors for the force peaks that are not well predicted 7 it does not matter a lot which type of potential flow code is used zero speed green s functions or rankine source frequency or time domain linear or weakly non linear froude krylov modelling the evaluated potential flow codes nload3d hydrostar hydrostar precal r and fatima deliver similar results 8 the coarse mesh cfd results depend heavily on the choice of wave input grid and time step settings two versions of openfoam and comflow on three grids were compared the comflow results with grids 2 or 3 seem to be good optima of these choices leading to quite short computational times and good quality screening results still this is around 2 20 times as computationally expensive as potential flow calculations gaining only a factor 1 2 in screening quality index sqi 9 the identified critical wave events based on coarse mesh comflow indicator rwe at the bow were run with fine mesh cfd this pilot study showed that the resulting load distribution is very similar to the experiments which shows that multi fidelity screening is promising for the handling of statistics of extreme events in waves 10 a smart screening procedure can reduce the required high fidelity experimental computational time to obtain the short term design green water loads on a sailing ship up to 90 compared to full monte carlo simulation however the efficiency depends on the selected indicator and screening tool on the wave condition and on the balance between groupiness of the indicator peaks and the required pre event time in the high fidelity tool 7 future work including some non linearity in the undisturbed wave or its component in the rwe may further improve the results this can be done using coarse mesh cfd but this is computationally expensive a possibly quicker method could be to use analytical second order waves or a fully non linear potential flow method both will be evaluated in follow up project crs scream screening for extremes and maxima in waves also the sqi defined in the present study is a good measure to compare different screening tools in a deterministic validation set up however it also has a few downsides it is sensitive to outliers it is not easy to translate to a practical design study and validation requires deterministic reproduction of the wave conditions appendix b shows that this is challenging and may lead to worse results than in a real screening application a statistical approach is therefore foreseen for definition of sqi 2 0 that can be used in a design procedure the idea would be to predict the shape of the load distribution based on a few identified events and the underlying distribution of the indicator validation would be based on long duration experiments this eliminates the need to deterministically reproduce the waves in the numerical tools and it provides converged statistics for the 1 h or 3 h green water design load this work will also be part of crs scream based on 20 30 h duration tests with a sailing ferry other possible future work could be to combine different indicators to improve the screening performance or to use large wave groups as indicator as suggested by ersdal and kvitrud 2000 applying rcm could further speed up linear screening finally the present validation was based on one ship design in long crested waves variations in wave directional spreading ship type bow flare angle deck layout etc would increase confidence in the results in theory similar screening based approaches could also be used to evaluate other rare events in waves such as bow flare slamming airgap or wetdeck slamming problems or even propeller ventilation or parametric roll of ships overtopping of dykes etc this requires further study and validation

https www crships org appendix a properties and settings of numerical codes tables 6 and 7 show the properties and settings of respectively the potential flow and coarse mesh cfd codes all cfd codes are finite volume codes with volume of fluid free surface approximation in ofa and ofa1 a 2nd order implicit time integration backward scheme was used and 2nd order order spatial discretisation with limited linear divergence scheme for convection in ofb a 1st 2nd order time integration blend was used crank nicolson 0 9 as well as a 1st second order spatial discretisation blend linear upwind and 2nd order upwind with limiter and a cmules vof scheme this code used an adaptive time step but the outcome was relatively constant still the computational time for each time step varied because the number of outer iterations within each time step varied finally in cf1 3 a first order explicit time integration scheme was used as well as first order symmetry preserving spatial discretisation a plic vof with macho advection scheme was also used and an absorbing boundary condition gabc at the outflow fig 19 shows how the planes are defined through which the fluxes in direction of the ship s long axis were calculated with ofa ofa1 and cf1 3 appendix b direct wave and ship response comparison b 1 undisturbed waves the numerical wave results were compared to each other and to the experiments were possible the largest wave crests in the example 3 h test 100504 at w1 and at cog are shown in fig 22 as well as the wave crest distributions scatter plots of reference versus predicted crests are also shown using the matching procedure in section 4 3 no experimental wave results are available at cog for the 3 h tests so these results can only be compared between the different codes pre fat was taken as reference here the ofa wave results were not delivered at the ship cog similar plots of the largest undisturbed wave crest distribution and scatter at probe w11 for the single 30 min run 10050401 are shown in fig 23 summary results for all 3 h tests at probe w1 and at cog are provided in fig 20 and for the 30 min run at probes w1 w2 and w11 in fig 21 these plots show the mean and root mean square rms error for the 10 highest crests compared to the experiments for each test or run for reference the propagated wave using linear dispersion from w1 is also added to the 30 min plot which of course is identical to the experiments at w1 hence zero error in fig 21 for signal linpr at w1 ofa did not deliver the undisturbed wave signals so this signal is not visible in the 30 min figures the 3 h plots show that there are differences between the codes already in the input waves the input waves were identical for hs hs and for pre fat hs hs on average shows lower wave crests at cog than the other codes especially for the larger wave crests this is due to analytical post processing of the experimental wave measurements re sampling fft component selection as shown in fig 6 linear propagation from the wave probes to the cog was used for all potential flow codes which will introduce similar errors compared to the real non linear propagation of the steep wave conditions the ofa results deviate much more from the experiments than the potential flow wave input an important difference with the potential flow wave input is that these waves are the result of numerical wave propagation in the cfd code instead of analytical post processing this may have caused part of the wave quality loss however this is probably largely due to the choices made for the ofa wave input linear analytical wave elevation propagation from the experimental measurements at w45 to the inflow location was used linear wave kinematics were added after which the waves were propagated in the cfd code to the model and the other probes the plots show that even the re propagated result at w45 significantly deviates from the experiments the 30 min figures also show significant differences in waves at w11 between the coarse mesh cfd codes especially for the higher wave crests ofa1 and ofb are very similar and quite far below the experimental results for the highest wave crests even though different ways were used to synthesise their input waves fig 7 however they both used linear wave propagation from another location to the inflow and a selection of the fft components by removing the higher frequency components the details of the steepest wave crests may have been removed this is likely to be the main reason for the underestimation although the wave handling in the code openfoam could also contribute the comflow results on different grids show similar results with small mean errors for the highest crests although grid 1 slightly overestimates them b 2 ship response similar results are presented for the ship responses the heave and pitch motions of the ship were delivered by all considered codes as well as rwe at different probes see fig 4 the largest peaks in rwe at relbow are shown in fig 24 for 3 h test 100504 as well as the peak distributions and a scatter plot of matched peaks using the zero up crossing matching procedure in section 4 3 note that the experimental troughs are truncated due to the length of the probes the mean and rms error in the 10 largest peak values compared to the experiments are provided in fig 25 for all nine 3 h tests it can be observed that the responses from all potential codes and ofa are relatively close to the experiments but they are even closer to each other there is no significant difference between the time and frequency domain codes between the rankine source or zero speed green s function codes or between linear and weakly non linear codes the ofa coarse mesh cfd result is also very close the considered speeds are probably too low to show much better results with rankine source codes and the motions are relatively small in the steep short waves so the froude krylov force components are also small on average both the heave and pitch motion peaks are overestimated compared to the experiments by all codes with a large amount of scatter around the trends more than in the incoming waves this may be due to some small viscous damping effects in the experimental heave and pitch motions that will be absent in potential flow and very small in cfd with a coarse mesh the largest rwe peaks were slightly overestimated by all potential flow codes compared to the experiments this may be due to water flowing over deck in the experiments wave breaking that lowers rwe for the highest peaks and or the overestimation of the numerical ship motions the largest 10 rwe peaks have rms errors around 2 3 m which is significant compared to the h s of 6 4 9 1 m similar plots were made for 30 min run 10050401 fig 26 includes the heave pitch and rwe results around the hull similar as for the 3 h tests but also the rwe on deck and coarse mesh cfd forces on the breakwater results of cf1 were not delivered with the ship only for the undisturbed waves the rwe on deck coarse mesh force on the bottom row and fluxes were not delivered by ofb as there is no experimental result for the fluxes through planes on deck fig 19 the error plot of this signal is omitted similar as for the potential flow and ofa results discussed above the mean heave and pitch peaks from all coarse mesh cfd calculations were over predicted compared to the experiments this is not very surprising as effects of viscous damping in the motions are also underestimated by cfd on a coarse mesh the 30 min mean and rms errors of the 10 largest motion and rwe peaks in fig 26 are also very similar to those based on the 3 h potential flow results for head waves all tests starting with 1005 in fig 25 this indicates that the coarse mesh cfd screening results were not expected to be much better than the potential flow screening results on the other hand the extra indicators such as wave elevation on deck forces and fluxes that cfd can produce may also be valuable indicators the coarse mesh force on the breakwater was expected to deviate significantly from the experimental results this is also visible in fig 26 still the order of the peaks can be an efficient green water indicator see section 5 appendix c extra 3 h indicator scatter plots the present appendix shows other 3 h scatter plots for the matched indicator and force peaks the main text includes these plots for one example test 100504 and two indicators peaks in relst19 and crests in w11 plotting all combinations of indicators and tests is too elaborate but fig 27 shows the scatters for the other considered indicators for test 100504 and figs 28 and 29 show the same for the two example indicators in all 3 h test conditions appendix d example impacts this appendix describes a few selected example impacts that determine outliers in sqi for indicator peaks in rwe at the bow high speed video recordings are shown when available otherwise snapshots from the normal video recording are shown event 1 in head wave test 100506 determines the sqi for relbow at the lower force thresholds fig 30 it shows a relatively high force 4800 kn for a relatively low rwe 9 m the figure shows that all potential flow codes correspond well to the experimental result so the quality of the response prediction is not the problem the snapshots show that this elevation indeed was limited this is especially the case at the bow relst19 serves as better indicator for this particular event a sheet of water moves to two sides of the bow which does not lead to loading on the breakwater however a high speed jet of water also moves over the middle of the fore deck impacting the breakwater this jet was formed by water that just exceeded the freeboard the first snapshot shows that the incoming wave for this event is quite high and steep just before breaking the horizontal kinematics of the water in the crest just overtopping the freeboard may well cause the jet over the fore deck this type of event is hard to predict using linear or even non linear rwe using non linear horizontal wave velocities as indicators could maybe improve this the event is an outlier in the peaks of relbow sqi but it is an event that indeed cannot be accurately predicted by this indicator event 2 was found in head wave test 100504 but not in run 1 that was evaluated as 30 min run see fig 31 the potential flow rwe for this event are low whereas the force on the breakwater is considerable 6000 kn the time traces show that the experimental and ofa results are much higher than the potential flow results for this event this points in the direction of a non linear steep wave event which is confirmed by the snapshots increasing the non linearity in the incoming wave component of the rwe will probably significantly improve the potential flow screening results in this case they could get closer to the experimental and ofa results event 3 was found in bow quartering test 100703 fig 32 this bow quartering test was one of the most difficult conditions to screen for all codes but especially for hs the figure highlights an event where all other codes perform consistently it shows that hs does not predict a high rwe peak for this event and the time trace appears differently from the others the other codes are quite similar to each other and to the experiments around this time inspection of the time traces showed that this is the case more often for hs in this test but not all the time the erratic behaviour is not explained by the wave input as that would lead to similar results from hs this is not the case the hs time trace matches the other codes well it is therefore due to something in the hs code event 4 was the largest event in bow quartering test 100704 fig 33 the rwe at the bow predicted for this event serve reasonably well as indicator but there is quite some variation between the codes in the scatter plot part of this is caused by the differences in wave input discussed earlier for instance all differences between pre and hs should be attributed to this as the codes are very similar however the wave input for hs and hs was identical so there are also differences due to the codes this condition is the most difficult one with a relatively high forward speed of 10 kn in a severe bow quartering wave condition considering that the potential flow screening still performs relatively well the snapshots show that this event is associated with a breaking wave just in front of the model the introduced non linearity is included in the experimental rwe but not in the potential flow results including some non linearity in the indicator may therefore improve the results 
20624,design loads for extreme wave events on ships such as slamming and green water are hard to define these events depend on details in the incoming waves ship motions and structure layout which requires high fidelity tools such as cfd or experiments to obtain the correct loads these tools presently do not have the capability to fully resolve the long term statistics of rare events in all metocean conditions over the ship s lifetime the idea of screening is to use lower fidelity numerical methods to identify the occurrence of extreme load events based on an indicator a good indicator has a strong correlation to the design load but is easier to calculate a high fidelity tool can then be used to find the loads in these events the low fidelity statistics and the high fidelity loads can be combined to define a design load and its probability the present study compares different numerical screening indicators for green water loads on a containership against experiments the quality of the identification of the critical events and the required computational time served as comparison metrics this showed that screening both with potential flow tools and with coarse mesh cfd tools is feasible provided the indicator grid time step and wave input settings are well chosen the results from coarse mesh cfd are slightly better than from potential flow but the computational costs are much higher the results also show that the peaks and steepness of the relative wave elevation around the bow are suitable green water load indicators as well as the undisturbed wave crests at the bow fine mesh cfd calculations were done for the identified events based on an example indicator which resulted in a green water load distribution very close to that of the experiments this study shows that screening could potentially reduce the required high fidelity modelling time with up to 90 compared to common practice keywords screening critical events extreme events waves green water design loads multi fidelity approach potential flow coarse mesh cfd 1 introduction 1 1 background and objectives an important but hard to answer question for every ship design is how to handle extreme loading in waves such as slamming and green water more concretely what should be the design green water load on a deck structure in the ship s operational profile this is the topic of the present study by cooperative research ships crs wave impact phenomena are highly non linear johannessen and hagen 2012 and their loads depend on details in the flow which means that they cannot be calculated with fast low fidelity methods such as potential flow much progress has been made in recent years with high fidelity modelling such as cfd and experiments good results were obtained with different types of cfd codes for extreme wave impacts on ships at zero speed pákozdi et al 2014 oger et al 2014 bandringa and helder 2018 and at forward speed nielsen 2003 kawamura et al 2016 ge et al 2018 air entrapments complicate such calculations bogaert 2018 scharnke 2019 but their effect seems limited in green water impacts on deck structures buchner 2002 van essen et al 2020b accurate fine mesh cfd results of the green water loads for the same case study as considered in the present publication were presented by bandringa et al 2020 see fig 1 still present computational resources limit such detailed cfd calculations to a few 10 20 s events for the final ship design extreme events in waves are relatively rare which makes obtaining their statistics challenging on the one hand there is the long term information about the metocean conditions in the area of operation wave scatter diagrams wave spectra wind and current conditions and operational data such as sailing route sailing speeds and loading conditions and on the other hand there is the high fidelity modelling that typically has the capability to calculate loads over a few minutes there is a need for a screening procedure including tools with different levels of fidelity and computational time to help make the sea state and event selections the following steps are distinguished see also fig 2 1 define scatter diagrams for the operational profile 2 select critical sea states from the scatter diagram long term screening 3 generate wave and response realisation time traces 4 select critical events in these time traces short term screening 5 calculate the extreme loads for these events using a high fidelity tool cfd model tests 6 use the loads from step 5 and the statistics from steps 2 and 4 to predict the long term design loads and their probability unfortunately the highest wave crest does not always lead to the largest load it is therefore often important to account for other wave and ship parameters the idea is to use a fast screening or surrogate model for the selections of 2 and 4 such a model should be able to calculate an indicator that has a strong relation to the critical load an example of an indicator for green water could be relative wave elevation rwe if there is a fast tool that can calculate rwe reasonably accurately this can be used to identify possibly critical green water events to run in a high fidelity tool the approach can in principle be used for any type of rare event in waves in the present study the green water loads on the breakwater of a container ship are used as case study the objectives are to evaluate whether event selection based on a numerical indicator is feasible for this case and if so to find suitable tools and indicators this validates short term screening step 4 in the procedure some first results for step 5 and 6 are also provided the study thus contributes towards an overall screening approach that could predict the design green water loads with a certain probability level based on long term wave information 1 2 review of earlier work the first studies that explicitly mention screening were done when weakly non linear time domain seakeeping calculations were still computationally demanding linear screening was applied to find interesting occurrences of for instance global ship bending moments torhaug 1996 dietz 2004 the increase of computational power and development of cfd in recent years makes screening potentially interesting for highly non linear phenomena such as green water loading relevant literature can roughly be divided into three groups 1 identification of suitable indicators for green water or slamming impacts which are considered to be similar phenomena 2 speeding up the screening using response conditioning methods rcm instead of monte carlo simulations mcs and 3 the interaction between different levels of tools finally the common practice for present designs is explained indicators many studies focus on the details of green water or slamming impact loads but the present study considers indicators that predict their occurrence hennig et al 2015 showed strong effects on non linear effects such as upwelling non linear waves and wave breaking on local slamming and airgap impact loads on platforms scharnke 2019 added that air entrapments and jets on the front of a deck box may lead to local variations in wave impact loads but also showed that direct impacts dominate the loading process for the global impacts this is promising for screening as global flow is easier to solve with low fidelity tools than local details in 1964 already ochi 1964b related relative vertical water velocity at a ship bow to peak slamming loads and ochi 1964a showed that green water loads can be related to the static pressure of water on deck buchner 1994 showed that the forward speed of the ship causes a dynamic amplification of this pressure bales 1977 linked the occurrence of slamming and green water for a ship sailing in head seas to rwe and showed that the influence of non linearity in the incoming waves can be significant voogt and buchner 2004 confirmed this effect of wave steepness on impacts ersdal and kvitrud 2000 showed that the pitch motions of a ship as well as the memory effects in wave groups are important in the occurrence of green water events buchner 2002 developed an empirical method to determine green water loads based on rwe and water height and velocity on deck ogawa et al 2002 and van t veer and vlasveld 2014 showed that non linearity should be considered to estimate higher rwe on the bow of a ship but also showed that the general trends of freeboard exceedance on a floating platform can be predicted using potential flow this is promising for a screening application where the exact predicted indicator value is less important than its relative ordering with respect to the green water load eggers et al 2012 stated that the potential energy of the water flowing on deck is a better indicator to predict the green water loading on crew and deck structures of small and fast ships such as sailing yachts grin et al 2013 buchner et al 2014 and van essen et al 2020a showed that waves running up along the side of vessels could be used as indicator for green water impacts on structures on their side such as overhanging lifeboats on cruise ships two types of impacts on a sailing ship were distinguished by kapsenberg 2018 due to large ship motions and due to steep wave impacts they may require different indicators either related to ship motions relative vertical bow motion or velocity or to wave properties steepness crest kinematics a number of studies identified experimental impact indicators stansberg 2008 defined an impact alert parameter based on undisturbed wave crest height wave height orbital velocity and steepness to screen sea states for the occurrence of bow flare slamming and green water impacts on an fpso deck house bunnik et al 2018 showed that the rwe and its rise time may be good indicators to screen for wave impacts on both tension leg and semi submersible platforms bunnik et al 2019 showed that the undisturbed wave crest height is a suitable indicator for wave in deck loads on a jacket platform and undisturbed wave steepness for impacts on a wind turbine and finally stansberg 2020 showed that the undisturbed vertical wave rise velocity is a good indicator for wave in deck loads on a gravity based structure in summary it seems that non linear rwe wave steepness and pitch motions could be indicators that predict the occurrence of green water loads on larger ships wave groups could also be considered as indicator variables describing the water flow flux or kinematics on or just in front of the deck may also be considered if they can be calculated with a lower fidelity tool response conditioning these methods can be used to find a wave event conditioned on a certain target response value or probability this can be used to speed up screening compared to mcs in this category the equivalent design wave edw method conditions a regular wave based on a linear response transfer function one step more complex several methods are based on the new wave theory lindgren 1970 tromans et al 1991 this provides an irregular gaussian wave group profile based on the auto correlation function of the wave spectrum for a target response examples are the original theory target wave crest amplitude the most likely wave mlw method friis hansen and nielsen 1995 target wave crest amplitude and instantaneous frequency the most likely extreme response mler method adegeest et al 1998 and its directional version dmler pastoor 2002 target linear response amplitude and its mean frequency the most likely response wave mlrw or conditioned random response wave crrw method dietz 2004 dietz et al 2004 taylor et al 1997 generates a range of wave profile realisations for a target response amplitude and response frequency by accounting for the random background of the sea state and response function this means that it is no longer assumed that all wave components are in phase at the crest of the design wave but have one of the phase realisations leading to the target response when the target wave frequency is the mean wave frequency the mlw and original new wave profiles are identical similarly when the target response frequency is the mean response frequency the mean mlrw and the mler wave profiles are identical the aforementioned methods all condition the wave profile on a specific value for the response usually the most probable maximum mpm for the given exposure duration the design loads generator dlg kim 2012 and its non linear response version nl dlg seyffert 2018 extend this to a probabilistic approach finding a range of irregular linear wave events that fit the ensemble maximum response distribution for the given exposure duration dlg can generate an ensemble of wave elevations that would produce the extreme value distribution of a target response for a given exposure period this method was successfully applied to find the statistics of non linear responses such as whipping in head sea or parametric rolling in short crested seaways kim et al 2012 kim and troesch 2014 while the approaches in dietz et al 2004 and kim 2012 can account for parameters such as wave steepness and memory effects of ship motion in wave groups these approaches have not been directly applied to the prediction of extreme green water impacts yet seyffert et al 2020 compares mcs results for trimaran bending moments to results from dlg and modified versions of edw and crrw showing that dlg provided the closest results to mcs all mentioned rcm techniques deliver linear gaussian wave profiles which may limit their applicability to highly non linear events however they may be interesting to consider when a screening method based on linear wave input is selected interaction fidelity levels the use of screened events in a high fidelity tool step 4 to 5 is challenging due to the reduced order wave modelling in most screening tools a method to solve the problem of running a linear wave event in cfd is described by johannessen and lande 2018 the event matching method events were selected based on an indicator in linear mcs these events were matched to a database of fully non linear wave events after which the closest fit non linear event was run in cfd this enables the inclusion of higher order wave effects and wave breaking in the screening process this importance of wave breaking in screening for wave in deck loads was confirmed by bøckmann et al 2018 however this method is hard to apply when ship motions and forward speed are important alternatively direct coupling methods such as applied in pákozdi et al 2014 could be used common practice in the offshore industry the contour linemethod haver and kleiven 2004 haver and winterstein 2008 is often used to derive long term design loads for wave impacts this approach uses general rcm method iform inverse first order reliability method winterstein et al 1993 to identify contour lines of equal joint sea state parameter probability e g wave height and period accounting for some short term variability the method equals the long term probability of the response to the long term probability of the sea state the short term probability of the response in a few identified sea states is then evaluated using many experimental wave realisations with a certain exposure duration e g 3 h this approach is commonly applied e g dnv 2010 but some of the assumptions are under debate the approach disregards the contribution of long exposure times in relatively mild sea states to the failure probability it favours short exposures of severe conditions and it does not account for multi modal failure due to different failure modes seyffert et al 2021 other limitations are the need to simplify the joint distribution of the environmental parameters which may disregard complex interactions and the assumption that sea states are independent disregarding the influence of groupiness due to storms the latter two limitations were improved in an alternative procedure based on hindcast data by derbanne and de hauteclocque 2019 1 3 approach some of the aforementioned studies included numerical screening indicators but usually only one or a few and for weakly non linear phenomena numerical indicators are required in practice as experimental data is usually not available in an early design stage the number of studies focussing on green water impacts on ships at speed is also limited if screening methods are considered in earlier studies they are usually fully linear e g potential flow this is logical as long term screening can only be done based on simplified models containing only the essential physics however for green water impacts it can be imagined that some wave non linearity is essential to identify the correct critical events the present study therefore compares the use of a large number of numerical screening indicators and tools to predict green water loads on a sailing ship including validation with experiments and including some methods based on non linear wave input green water events are rare so very long duration experiments would be required to obtain converged statistical data in order to enable validation based on limited duration data experiments were deterministically reproduced in the numerical tools instead the downside of this approach is that it requires deterministic wave reproduction in the numerical tools which is complicated this is also addressed as a direct deterministic comparison was used mcs or rcm were not required in the present study experiments were done with a containership measuring the green water impact forces on a breakwater five different potential flow tools and three different cfd tools with a very coarse mesh were applied to calculate various green water indicators the peaks in these indicators were then used to identify green water events which were compared to the actual experimentally measured events in order to validate them the simplified validation procedure is shown in fig 3 this is further explained in the following sections the quality of the identification of the critical events in the wave realisation and the required computational time serve as comparison metrics the speed of the computations is an important criterion as large amounts of wave data need to be screened in an early design stage this publication is structured as follows section 2 describes the experiments and section 3 the calculations section 4 explains some definitions and section 5 shows the screening results and discussion this includes a demonstration of the use of the identified events in a high fidelity tool to predict the load distribution and a comparison to common practice finally section 6 draws some conclusions and section 7 discusses possible future work 2 experiments experiments were done with a scale 37 89 model of the kcs container ship simman 1997 see fig 4 its full scale dimensions at the selected draught are l p p 230 m b 32 2 m t 10 8 m with a freeboard at the bow of 7 4 m all results in the present publication are provided at full scale the tests were done in marin s seakeeping and manoeuvring basin smb measuring 170 40 5 m the model was tested in a free sailing set up with its own active propulsion consisting of a propeller at a fixed rpm and an active rudder it was steered with an autopilot to keep its heading a constant speed was required for the measurement carriage and the attached wave probes for the deterministic numerical reproduction of the wave conditions see section 3 in order to enable this without losing the model the free sailing set up was combined with a cardanic pole set up acting as spring in surge direction surge stiffness of the system 6 5e3 kn m leading to a natural surge period of 18 9 s see fig 4 the model surge speed varied due to the first order wave excitation but the second order low frequency speed variations were limited by the spring all other ship motions sway heave roll pitch and yaw were free the model sailed in head and bow quartering waves in head waves the measurement carriage did not move in y direction in bow quartering waves it followed the model in y direction to account for the drift of the model the roll period of the ship was adjusted to 27 5 s such that it was far from wave encounter period in the tested conditions this reduced the influence of roll motions on the occurrence of green water events the model was instrumented to measure the six degree of freedom ship motions rwe at 11 locations along the weather side of the ship where relbow relst20 and relst19 are used in present publication rwe at 4 locations on the fore deck relsba an relsbf on starboard are used here impact forces on 40 panels on the front of a breakwater and on 50 panels on the side of a container stack throughout this publication results labelled as relbow are the rwe results at probe relbow the locations of these sensors are indicated in fig 4 only the force panels on the breakwater at the front of the block on deck are used in the present publication they were placed in 5 rows of each 8 panels at 16 0 m behind the forward perpendicular fpp each force panel had a size of 1 89 1 89 m full scale the incoming waves around the ship were also measured at three locations moving with the measurement carriage at a constant forward speed see fig 5 motions and incoming waves were measured at full scale sample frequency 16 2 hz rwe at 32 5 hz and forces at 780 or 1550 hz the experimental conditions are listed in table 1 the test conditions were determined such that a significant number of green water events occurred the wave conditions are relatively steep the vessel speeds were determined based on typical class requirements in severe waves and the estimated maximum sustained speed of the kcs in wind and waves nine tests in irregular waves at forward speed were performed each with a full scale duration around three hours the tests were performed in multiple consecutive runs as the basin has a finite length which were joined in the analysis in each three hour test one run was selected based on a large green water impact to be deterministically repeated without model to measure the undisturbed waves 1 1 naming convention a 6 digit number indicates a full test duration around 3 h and a 8 digit number indicates one run duration depending on vessel speed either around 30 min at 5 kn or around 15 min at 10 kn the run number is composed of the test number and two additional digits examples test 100504 run 1 is also called run 10050401 test 100505 run 10 is also run 10050510 for these runs some additional wave probes were placed over the centreline of the model see fig 5 even though the wave generator and measurement carriage motions were accurately repeated the repeatability of the wave condition in the basin is not perfect due to small wave induced currents and wave breaking effects this was discussed for the same experiments in van essen 2019 2021 based on that work the wave measurements with and without model were considered close enough to use the undisturbed waves as input for some deterministic calculations test 100504 is considered as example test in this publication it consists of 6 runs with a total duration of 3 14 h its first run 10050401 with a duration of 0 30 h is also used as example this particular run was also repeated without model to measure the undisturbed waves the other five runs were not two groups of results were generated for nine tests of three hours each and for this single example 30 min run they are abbreviated here as 3 h and 30 min respectively 3 calculations different numerical codes were evaluated as screening tools and each of these codes was used to derive a number of green water indicators several potential flow codes and cfd codes run on a coarse mesh were considered the properties of all codes and the calculated indicators are described in the present section the present study was based on calculations done by different project partners who each used their best practice and insight to derive the indicators it is therefore not a systematic study of all possible input variations but a comparison of the inputs considered to be best practice by each partner 3 1 potential flow different flavours of potential flow tools are available which differ in their handling of forward speed motion non linearity and wave non linearity first forward speed rankine source methods account correctly for forward speed in the source terms whereas methods using zero speed green s functions account only for forward speed in the encounter frequency corrections and the roll damping terms rankine source codes are expected to better describe rwe at the bow due to the prevention of unrealistic wave pile up the forward speed for the present study is low so the differences were expected to be small both types of methods are included in the present study secondly the codes differ in the level of non linearity of the motion calculation linear and weakly non linear froude krylov methods are available the latter methods account for some non linearity in the ship motions by using the actual wetted area instead of the calm water wetted area in the calculation of the diffraction forces the ship motions are limited for the 230 m ship in short and steep waves but the froude krylov terms may slightly improve the calculated indicators both types of methods are included in the present study finally different choices can be made for the wave non linearity most potential flow methods include linear input waves but some account for second or higher order waves however most available non linear wave potential flow methods only calculate undisturbed waves they are not well validated and used for ship response especially not at forward speed this may be an option for the future the use of wave only codes for screening may also be considered if the ship motions are small the wave non linearity is expected to be more important than the ship motion non linearity in the present steep wave conditions presently only potential flow tools with linear wave input are included in the study of course there is also the difference in frequency or time domain codes but as long as the described physics are the same different results are not anticipated the following potential flow tools were applied by the maritime research institute netherlands marin bureau veritas bv and american bureau of shipping abs hs linear frequency domain zero speed greens function diffraction code hydrostar applied by bv hs weakly non linear froude krylov time domain code hydrostar based on hydrostar diffraction input applied by bv nl3 weakly non linear froude krylov time domain codenload3d abs 2013 based on rankine source diffraction input applied by abs pre linear frequency domain zero speed greens function diffraction code precal r developed by crs applied by marin fat linear frequency domain rankine source diffraction code fatima bunnik 1999 applied by marin an overview of the applied code versions properties and settings is provided in appendix a as explained in the introduction the wave conditions have to be deterministically reproduced in the numerical tools this is not straightforward as the undisturbed waves at the required input locations are not directly available fig 6 shows steps taken to define this wave input per code all considered potential flow methods require linear ised wave input at the ship centre of gravity cog undisturbed wave repeat runs are not available for the full 3 h tests this means that the waves have to be propagated to the ship cog based on wave measurements around the model this was done using linear dispersion for all codes different wave probes can be selected to serve as basis for the propagation fig 5 the difference in results between input based on probe w1 or w2 is only an issue in the validation study performed here in a real screening study there are still limitations due to the linear wave input in the potential flow codes but not due to linear propagation from another location the error introduced by the assumed linear wave propagation for relatively steep sea states in the screening validation study should therefore not affect the results more than necessary the reference wave probe leading to the best match with the experiments was therefore selected for each test this depends on different effects propagation distance shorter should be better so errors larger from w1 than w2 diffracted waves from the model to the probe larger at w2 than w1 and larger in bow quartering waves than in head waves and radiated waves from the model larger at w2 than w1 and larger at higher speed the input probe was therefore selected per test based on the average correspondence of rwe and motions from all potential flow codes with the experiments this led to selection of input wave probe w1 for all tests in bow quartering waves and test 100502 in head waves at 10 kn speed and probe w2 for all tests in head waves at 5 kn speed the potential flow results in the remainder of this publication are all based on this choice fig 6 shows that the project participants made different choices for the potential flow code wave input which may partly determine the outcome for hs and hs a spectral energy limit was used at the input wave probe location and the wave input was re sampled the nl3 wave input was also re sampled for pre and fat the input waves were not changed instead their response functions were interpolated at the wave fft frequencies before applying them to the waves at the ship cog 3 2 coarse mesh cfd most cfd green water studies use one of the two major methods grid based eulerian navier stokes ns or particle based smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph the grid based methods have advanced greatly in recent years to 3d simulation of green water loads on ships at speed in irregular waves see e g fig 1 for the present coarse mesh application confidence in the grid refinement convergence characteristics of the cfd methods was required there is sufficient experience with the grid based methods to know approximately what to expect from coarse grids whereas the experience with particle based methods was not sufficient to know what to expect from coarsely distributed particle meshes only grid based methods were therefore evaluated in the present study also because this type of methods is relatively efficient the following three coarse mesh finite volume cfd methods were applied to in order to calculate green water indicators ofa and ofa1 unstructured grid finite volume cfd method openfoam applied by abs using a dynamic overset grid technique shen and korpus 2015 shen et al 2016 and thewave2foam library for wave generation and absorption jacobsen et al 2012 ofa was run for the 3 h test 100504 and ofa1 for the 30 min run 10050401 only which also necessitates different wave input this is further explained below ofb unstructured grid finite volume cfd method openfoam applied by bv using the foamstar library for wave generation and absorption benhamou et al 2018 cf1 2 3 structured cartesian grid finite volume cfd method comflow luppes et al 2013 applied by marin this was run on three different grids grid 1 coarse to grid 3 very coarse for details see table 7 the finest grid 1 was only run for the 2d wave input the other two grids both for the 2d wave input and the 3d simulations including model the coarse mesh simulations were done in two steps 2d undisturbed wave propagation and simulation on an equivalent 3d mesh including the ship the cfd codes were only applied to tests in head waves so 2d undisturbed wave results are sufficient an overview of the applied code versions properties and grid and time step settings is provided in appendix a the cfd codes need wave input at their defined inflow locations which were defined at different locations in the different codes fig 7 gives an overview of the steps taken to define this input this figure shows that different choices were made for the inflow location and the wave definition at this location these differences have to be kept in mind as they partly determine the outcome all considered coarse mesh cfd codes were applied to the same 30 min run 10050401 see next section 3 3 for which there is an undisturbed wave repeat run available abs also applied openfoam to full 3 h test 100504 so to run 10050401 and five other runs for which no undisturbed wave repeat run was available ofa1 for one run and ofa for six runs therefore have a different wave input method for the 3 h test with ofa the waves at probe w45 with model were used as basis for the input whereas for ofa1 the undisturbed waves at probe w2 were the basis for the input in both cases these waves were linearly propagated to the wave inflow location ofb used a similar procedure as ofa1 linear propagation of the measured waves at one of the probe locations to the inflow location after applying a spectral energy limit to the waves at the input wave probe all three codes ofa ofa1 and ofb added first order wave kinematics to the thus defined wave elevation at the inflow location cf1 3 used a different approach the inflow was defined at probe location w1 such that the measured waves could directly be used as input without the need of propagation from another location cf1 3 also used second order wave kinematics sharma and dean 1979 at the inflow location based on the first order wave elevation the measured wave elevation was split in first and second order components in order to do this following stansberg 1998 buchner et al 2007 3 3 calculation conditions and indicators table 2 shows the numerical test programme an overview of the experimental conditions that were re created deterministically by each code most coarse mesh cfd codes were only applied to 30 min run 10050401 first run of test 100504 see section 2 as explained before the wave input for ofa1 and ofa was different the screening results for the 3 h and 30 min durations cannot be directly compared because especially the 30 min results are probably not converged this is no problem for deterministic relative comparison but it is for comparison to another duration two groups of results 3 h and 30 min are therefore discussed separately in the following sections in order to relate the 30 min results to the 3 h results the pre and ofa results were also added to the 30 min comparisons table 2 also provides an overview of the considered green water indicators per tool the experimental indicators are included for reference these provide a baseline for some indicators no matter how well the rwe is calculated it will probably not serve as a better indicator than the experimentally measured rwe possible green water indicators such as crests in undisturbed wave elevation peaks in rwe at different locations their rise time and crest front steepness both defined in section 4 and troughs in vertical bow position and velocity were calculated the coarse mesh cfd indicators also include the coarse mesh force over the total breakwater and on the bottom row of 8 force panels this force will likely not be calculated accurately as that would require a much finer mesh see bandringa et al 2020 however the idea of screening is that the relative order of the impact forces from the coarse mesh calculations is similar to the order of real impact forces from the experiments or fine mesh cfd calculations this would make it useable for screening other coarse mesh indicators are the peaks in the water fluxes through three vertical planes on deck definition see appendix a signal peaks and their rise time and crest front steepness are defined in section 4 4 definitions 4 1 failure mode the target of any screening exercise is the prediction of a failure mode the critical design load on a structure in the present study this is defined as a large total green water force in x direction on the breakwater of the kcs in the experiments this was derived from the sample by sample sum of all 40 breakwater panel forces fig 4 any mention of fx in the present publication refers to this total force it can be discussed whether typical deck structures are most sensitive to the peak force value or to the duration or total impulse of the green water force this depends on the specific structure the peak forces were deemed most critical for the relatively large breakwater structure so these are used as failure mode in the present study some of the screening quality work was repeated for the prediction of impulse of the force peaks this showed that it is slightly easier to predict force impulse than peak force this may be because peak forces are more sensitive for small details in the flow and therefore vary more for the same indicator peak value this is not further elaborated here 4 2 rise time and crest front steepness the rise time t c r of a peak in a signal is defined as the time between the peak and the last previous time that the indicator reached 10 of the peak value in the time trace see fig 8 the dimensionless crest front steepness ϵ of an indicator peak is defined as in myrhaug and kjeldsen 1986 but modified to include the t c r defined here this is defined in eq 1 where c is the crest or peak height and t d o w n the zero down crossing period around the considered peak especially the crest front steepness is sensitive for discontinuities in the signal which are mainly due to concatenation of the different experimental runs in a 3 h test peaks very close to run changes were therefore removed from all time traces before further analysis 1 ϵ 2 π c g t d o w n t c r 4 3 matching peaks in indicator to peaks in failure mode signal in order to evaluate the screening quality it is required to deterministically match peaks in an indicator signal to experimental force peaks this is not straightforward there is usually a time difference between an indicator peak and the corresponding impact force peak and not each indicator peak leads to a force peak the time difference depends on the type of green water event hammerfist plunging scooping the selected indicator and its location with respect to the deck structure the wave propagation velocity and kinematics the propagation velocity of the green water over the deck and the ship motions two different correlation methods to couple indicator peaks i ˆ p to corresponding failure mode load peaks f ˆ p were therefore used depending on the type of indicator signal where p is the peak index in both cases first all start up and end effects were removed from the experimental and numerical time traces a correlation method based on the indicator zero up crossing times t z u i p was used for continuous signals such as undisturbed wave elevation see eq 2 the maximum load between each set of indicator zero up crossings was coupled to the associated zero up crossing indicator peak this does not have to be a peak load simply the maximum measured value from the experiments within this interval was taken the result of this procedure is illustrated in fig 9 on the left 2a i ˆ p max i t z u i p t t z u i p 1 2b f ˆ p max f t z u i p t t z u i p 1 for continuous signals for more peaked indicator signals without zero crossings such as relative wave elevation on deck an alternative correlation method based on time intervals of a few seconds around peaks above a threshold was used see eq 3 the intervals based on the indicator peaks usually do not fully cover the time trace which could lead to missing important force peaks therefore a two way version of this matching method was applied using both the indicator and failure mode peaks as lead signal the times of the peak over threshold indicator peaks t ˆ i p and of the failure mode peaks t ˆ f p were joined the threshold for this peak over threshold analysis is selected just above the noise level of each signal a time interval of a few seconds d was then applied in order to remove grouped peak intervals next the maximum indicator value and maximum failure mode value were determined for each interval around the joined peak times t ˆ p the result of this procedure is illustrated in fig 9 on the right the same procedures can also be used to link to signals of the same type for instance to make a scatter diagram of numerical wave crests versus experimental wave crests 3a t ˆ p t ˆ i p t ˆ f p grouped 1 peak within d 3b i ˆ p max i t ˆ p d t t ˆ p d 3c f ˆ p max f t ˆ p d t t ˆ p d for peaked signals 4 4 screening quality index the quality of the identification of critical events by a combination of calculation tool and indicator is expressed by the screening quality index sqi first indicator peaks from a numerical tool were matched deterministically to force peaks from the experiments see section 4 3 a false negative occurs when the indicator does not predict a green water event but it nonetheless occurs a false positive occurs when the indicator predicts a green water event but the event does not occur a green water event is defined as a force on the breakwater above a given threshold see section 4 1 forces below this threshold are not considered green water events that need to be captured sqi is then defined in eq 4 and visualised in the left plot of fig 10 it is equal to the ratio of total number of positives over the number of correct positives allowing no false negative above the threshold load horizontal line in scatter plot in the formulation p are all correct positive events p are all false positive events i ˆ p and f ˆ p are still the matched indicator and force peaks p is the matched peak index and f t is the considered force threshold n x indicates the number of elements in x 4 sqi f t total of positives f t of correct positives f t n p f t p f t n p f t n i ˆ p min i ˆ p f ˆ p f t n f ˆ p f t the most left data point above the force threshold in the scatter plot of fig 10 corresponding to a low indicator peak but a relatively high force peak determines sqi a perfect indicator leads to sqi 1 for all thresholds in that case every considered indicator peak corresponds to a significant force peak and the scatter plot shows a linear relation with points only in the correct positive and correct negative areas the thus defined sqi can be plotted as function of force threshold increasing the threshold moves the horizontal line in the left plot of fig 10 upwards over the y axis the resulting sqi can be found using the same threshold on the x axis of the right plot the right plot can be used to compare different tool and indicator combinations each combination adds a line to such a plot and the lowest line corresponds to the best result as the present publication includes a large number of wave conditions numerical tools and indicators the overall comparison will be made based on a reduced dataset for this purpose firstly the sqi corresponding to the 10 th highest force peak was used this ensures that the 10 highest force peaks in each test are predicted the number of correct positives is then equal to 10 for each test regardless of the numerical tool and indicator this corresponds to a different force threshold per sea state see table 3 for reference the maximum measured force per test is also given this shows that the maximum force in 30 min run 10050401 is close to that in 3 h test 100504 a run with a large peak was selected but the 10 event threshold is lower due to the shorter duration assuming that a screening approach as described in section 1 1 needs high fidelity calculations for the 10 highest load peaks in step 5 the number of events to run in e g fine mesh cfd is equal to 10 times sqi an ideal indicator would predict all of them correctly sqi 1 which means that 10 events need to be run secondly the average sqi over the full range of thresholds up to the maximum experimental force per test was used whether aiming for the 10 highest force peaks in 3 h is a good goal for a screening study needs to be evaluated in a follow up study the present study will compare indicators and tools in a relative sense the outcome of which is not expected to change significantly based on the force threshold both the 10 event and average sqi values are used for this purpose 5 results and discussion 5 1 wave and response time traces the basis for the screening results described in the following sections are the time traces of waves and ship responses from the experiments and numerical tools these time traces can also be compared directly which may help to find the cause of good or bad screening performance an outlier in a screening quality plot can probably be related to the numerical reproduction of the waves or to the prediction of the ship response however direct wave and response comparison is not the main purpose of the present paper these results are therefore concisely discussed in appendix b the main conclusions are summarised here the considerations in section 3 lead to some differences in input waves between the different codes linear propagation from the wave probes to the cog was used for all potential flow codes which introduces similar errors compared to the real non linear properties of the steeper wave conditions negligence of higher order wave wave interactions and wave breaking the appendix also shows some differences between the different potential flow wave results due to analytical post processing of the experimental wave measurements fig 6 hs hs underpredicts the highest undisturbed wave crests as the largest green water impacts are probably related to large and steep waves this could be an issue for screening this is further discussed in the next sections the coarse mesh openfoam undisturbed wave results ofa available for one 3 h test deviate more from the experiments than the potential flow results the appendix explains that this is probably mostly due to the choices made for the ofa wave input linear analytical wave elevation propagation from the experimental measurements at w45 to the inflow location was used and linear wave kinematics were added after which the waves were propagated in the cfd code to the model and the other probes see fig 7 the coarse mesh cfd wave results for 30 min run 10050401 show how these results could be improved for instance by defining the inflow directly at an experimental wave probe location and adding second instead of first order wave kinematics these results also show significant differences in undisturbed waves at w11 close to the ship bow between the coarse mesh cfd codes especially for the higher wave crests the ofa1 and ofb results are very similar and quite far below the experimental results for the highest wave crests whereas the highest comflow crests are closer to the experiments with a slight overestimation of the largest crests the differences in undisturbed waves between the three comflow grids cf1 3 are small the ship response results heave pitch relative wave elevation rwe from all potential codes and coarse mesh cfd codes are relatively close to the experiments but they are even closer to each other there is no significant difference between the time domain and frequency domain codes between the rankine source or zero speed green s function codes or between linear and weakly non linear codes the coarse mesh cfd results are also very close to the potential flow results the considered speeds are probably too low to show much better results with rankine source codes and the motions are relatively small in the steep short waves so the froude krylov force components are also small on average both the heave and pitch motion peaks are overestimated compared to the experiments by all codes which may be due to the absence underestimation of small viscous damping effects in potential flow and coarse mesh cfd the largest rwe peaks were slightly overestimated by all potential flow codes compared to the experiments this may be due to water flowing over deck in the experiments wave breaking that lowers experimental rwe for the highest peaks or overestimation of the numerical ship motions the similarity in heave pitch and rwe results indicates that the coarse mesh cfd screening results are not expected to be much better than the potential flow screening results on the other hand the extra indicators such as wave elevation on deck forces and fluxes that cfd can produce may be valuable extra indicators this is discussed in the next sections 5 2 screening quality index for 3 h tests the screening quality was evaluated for all considered codes indicators and 3 h tests the results of the potential flow codes were provided based on linear wave propagation from the best probe discussed in section 3 1 the results from coarse mesh cfd code ofa are also included for one of the 3 h tests the screening performance of the other coarse mesh codes based on the 30 min run are discussed in section 5 3 not all codes were run for all tests and indicators table 2 for consistency the legends of the plots in the present section contain all codes but the missing entries are empty the plots also include the results for experimentally measured indicators where possible the indicator peaks were matched to the experimental force peaks using the matching procedure in section 4 3 after which the sqi was derived according to section 4 4 for each of the available indicators and each of the nine 3 h tests a scatter plot of indicator versus force peaks and a sqi plot as function of force threshold was thus generated such plots are shown in fig 11 for one example test 100504 and two example indicators peaks in relst19 and crests in undisturbed waves at w11 the second indicator was not directly delivered by the potential flow codes it was derived by wave propagation according to linear dispersion from the time traces delivered at probe w1 as explained in section 3 1 this indicator was not calculated with ofa scatter plots for the other indicators for the same example test and for the two selected indicators for all other 3 h tests are shown in appendix c all other scatter plots are omitted from the present publication but their summary values are included in the further discussions these plots show that some of the considered indicators are quite bad such as the troughs in vertical bow motion or velocity or the inverse of the rise time of rwe at the bow their relation with the experimental force peaks is far from linear other indicators perform better the two selected indicators in fig 11 are two of the best performing indicators with numerical sqi values between 3 20 over the full threshold range this will be confirmed in a comparison of all indicators in section 5 5 as explained earlier sqi is quite sensitive for outliers appendix d highlights four events showing the calculated indicator peak the corresponding experimental force peak its position in the scatter and sqi plots and some video snapshots summarising some events are associated with relatively low but steep waves with high horizontal water velocities in the crest if these crests just exceed the freeboard they may be translated to a relatively low rwe but a high speed jet over the foredeck that impacts the breakwater these events are not well captured when the peaks in rwe at the bow are used as indicator but may be by for instance peaks in non linear horizontal water velocities in the wave crest secondly there are the higher steep wave crests breaking over the deck the linear rwe serve reasonably well as indicator in these cases but including some higher order incoming wave components associated with high breaking wave crests could improve the results it seems logical that the water sometimes comes from another side than where the relative wave probe is located which would lead to a bad screening performance for that event however no big sqi determining outliers due to this principle were identified in the rwe results missing non linearity in the rwe peaks and missing non linearity in the water velocities in the wave crests seem the determining factors for the force peaks that are not well predicted the sqi for prediction of the 10 highest events and the mean sqi over the threshold range both described in section 4 4 were derived from these plots for all tests and indicators these plots are presented in fig 12 for the same two example indicators these figures show quite some variation between the different tests but some general trends can be identified most potential flow codes perform very similarly in head waves test numbers 1005xx for the bow quartering waves 1007xx there is more variation but not always towards higher sqi and worse screening performance for the two tests at a higher speed of 10 kn 100502 and 100704 it was expected that rankine source codes nl3 and fat would perform better than the other codes however this is not clearly visible in the results this may be because this speed is still limited for higher speeds these codes may perform better in a relative sense but that is not very realistic for a containership in severe wave conditions the weakly non linear motion codes nl3 and hs also perform similar to the linear codes this is probably because the ship motions were small in the given steep wave conditions the steepness of the waves itself does seem to play a role in the screening performance as expected from potential flow a better performance was found for the least steep wave conditions such as test 100505 100506 and 100702 however this effect is not very strong and mixed with speed wave height and heading effects as it is complicated to obtain an overview of these results they are averaged over all tests or different groups of tests in section 5 5 after a similar analysis of the 30 min run in the next section 5 3 screening quality index for 30 min run for the 30 min run 10050401 similar scatters of indicator peaks versus experimental force peaks were made and the corresponding sqi plots over the full threshold range the results are shown in fig 13 for example indicators peaks in rwe at relst20 crests in undisturbed waves at w11 and peaks in coarse mesh total force on the breakwater similar plots for the other indicators in table 2 are omitted here the peaks at relative wave probe relst20 were selected here as example instead of the results at relst19 which served as example indicator for the 3 h tests because only a few of the coarse mesh cfd codes delivered results at relst19 at a first glance the scatter plots for the 30 min coarse mesh cfd results look similar in number of outliers and amount of scatter as observed for the 3 h potential flow results this is confirmed by the potential flow result pre that is included in these 30 min plots the coarse mesh cfd codes lead to lower sqi values but only marginally the overview of the sqi for the 10 highest peaks and the mean over the threshold ranges are directly presented in the final overview section 5 5 this section also includes a discussion of the difference between the coarse mesh cfd codes 5 4 3 h versus 30 min results as explained in the introduction a converged very long duration result is not required for the present deterministic comparison to the test results this means that the sqi values are not converged especially not in 30 min so the different durations cannot be compared one to one fig 14 shows the difference between the 3 h test 100504 and its first run 10050401 this shows indeed that the values based on the single run are lower however the relative order between the results from the three different tools is largely the same for the long duration test and the single run as expected this means that we can use the comparison to help determine which tools are expected to show the best green water indicators 5 5 final overview of screening capabilities and computational times the present section compares the screening quality results for all indicators and tools and both test durations if only the quality would be assessed fine mesh cfd tools and experiments would win the competition however we know that it is presently not feasible to screen a full scatter diagram with such tools the required computational times of the different tools are therefore also evaluated the higher the screening quality and the faster the tool the more suitable it is for screening the sqi for the 10 highest events and the average sqi over the threshold range from all 3 h tests are shown in fig 15 this plot includes all indicators and tools discussed in section 5 2 that are available for at least four of the 3 h tests and it shows average results over all tests or groups of tests a similar plot for 3 h test 100504 only is shown in fig 16 also including coarse mesh cfd code ofa finally fig 17 shows similar results for the 30 min run 10050401 based on the results in section 5 3 the computational times that were required in order to obtain these results are listed in table 4 3 h tests and table 5 30 min run where cpuh is defined as wall clock time times the number of cores on which the calculation was run the computational times for the frequency and time domain tools scale differently frequency domain codes are relatively expensive for short durations but cheap for a large number of conditions all coarse mesh cfd computational times were much longer than the potential flow times as expected still these times are significantly reduced compared to what would be required for a fine mesh simulation of the same duration ofa1 required a longer computational time for the 2d waves than ofb whereas this is the other way around for the 3d simulation this has to do with the adaptive time stepping used in the 3d simulation in ofb appendix a the required computational times for the comflow calculations are significantly shorter than for the openfoam simulations especially for the coarsest grid this probably has to do both with the cartesian grid modelling and the choices for the time steps and grid cells as expected figs 15 to 17 show that the experimental indicators perform better than those from the numerical tools for almost all measured indicators the differences in performance between the different potential flow codes are very small especially in head waves this is good news it does not matter a lot which potential flow code is available as discussed in section 5 2 the codes with zero speed green s function or rankine source diffraction linear or weakly non linear froude krylov frequency or time domain perform very similarly in bow quartering waves only hs and fat perform slightly less good than the other codes and nl3 slightly better this is not due to the wave input in hs or fat as that is the same as in respectively hs and pre over all 3 h tests the indicators peaks in relst19 relst20 and relbow perform quite well as well as the crest front steepness of relbow in head waves the undisturbed wave elevation at w11 performs even better this indicator was not evaluated in bow quartering waves but there is no reason to assume that it will work significantly less good for this heading this may open the road for the use of non linear wave modelling tools without ship for screening e g non linear potential flow coarse mesh volume of fluid or particle methods although the effect of forward speed would need to be considered based on the 3 h results for test 100504 fig 16 it can be observed that coarse mesh cfd code ofa and the potential flow codes lead to similar screening quality results for the indicators that were calculated with both such as crests and crest front steepness of rwe and of undisturbed incoming waves the additional ofa indicators related to peaks in coarse mesh breakwater force rwe on deck and fluxes through planes on deck also lead to similar or slightly better sqi values the wave input in the long duration ofa calculations could be improved but this is also valid to some extent for the potential flow results comparing ofa with the other coarse mesh cfd tools in the 30 min run will show how much improvement could be expected however table 4 shows that the required computational time to reach these similar results for one 3 h simulation is a factor 1000 100000 depending on reference code higher than that for the potential flow codes as said the sqi for 30 min cannot be directly compared to the sqi for 3 h but the relative ordering of the different codes is assumed to be comparable similar to the 3 h results the 30 min results in fig 17 show that good results were achieved with peaks in rwe around the bow as indicator with the lowest value for the experimental measurements as expected all coarse mesh cfd codes and pre also lead to low values for this indicator the crests in undisturbed wave elevation at w11 also perform well especially based on the average sqi over the threshold range the pre result in that case is the propagated wave elevation using linear dispersion from the w1 measurements including ship model the cfd specific indicators peaks in rwe on deck peaks in coarse mesh breakwater force and fluxes through planes on the fore deck also perform well in some cases even slightly better than the peaks in rwe ofb and ofa run 1 of the 3 h test 100504 perform least well compared to ofa1 and the cf1 3 results the difference between ofb and ofa1 is mainly due to grid and time step settings appendix a the choices made in ofa1 seem better suited to screening leading to lower sqi values against much shorter computational times table 5 the difference between ofa and ofa1 is only the wave input as expected the ofa1 undisturbed wave input leads to better results in cf1 3 a lot of attention was paid to the quality of the wave appendix b shows that the comflow undisturbed waves match the experiments better than the waves in all versions of openfoam fig 17 shows that this also translates to lower sqi values especially for grid 2 cf2 as the wave input methods were different as well as the applied code and grids the main cause for the differences cannot be identified however it is likely that the wave input and the grid and time step settings play a large role this implies that the ofa results in the 3 h test 100504 presented in fig 15 could be improved by improving the wave input method and possibly the grid and time step settings cf2 or cf3 seem the most suitable combinations of tool wave input grid and time step settings for coarse mesh cfd screening they lead to the lowest sqi values of all coarse mesh cfd codes fig 17 against the shortest computational times table 5 cf2 is slightly slower but with better sqi results cf3 is faster but with slightly less good sqi results still these coarse mesh cfd tools deliver only marginally better or even similar sqi results to the reference potential flow code pre while they take 416 or 56 cpuh against 2 cpuh for the full pre database this is a factor 20 200 in computational time increase for a factor 1 2 sqi improvement 5 6 high fidelity force distribution based on screened events as explained above potential flow methods are quicker than coarse mesh cfd and a have similar or only slightly lower screening quality as explained in section 1 it may also be possible to apply rcm based on the linear response functions from potential flow to further speed up the screening however in order to run the selected linear wave events in cfd without missing important higher order wave effects a method such as the event matching in johannessen and lande 2018 is required but then with ship motions and forward speed a possible motivation for eventually selecting coarse mesh cfd for screening can be found when considering the next step in the green water analysis where events identified by the screening method need to be assessed in detail using a high fidelity method when cfd is chosen for both the screening and the detailed analysis an automated coupling between the coarse and the fine mesh cfd simulations can be established this simplifies the workflow significantly such a coupling currently implemented in one of the cfd tools comflow allows the events that are identified as critical by the coarse mesh cfd simulation to be re run automatically on a much finer mesh to determine the detailed green water loads as in bandringa et al 2020 this coupling was used to illustrate the feasibility of the screening approach cf2 was used as screening tool to identify the 10 largest relbow indicator peaks in the 30 min run fig 17 shows that cf2 indicator peaks in relbow has a sqi of 1 2 for the 10 largest events in this run which is almost perfect it means that the 12 highest indicator peaks would have to be assessed in order to obtain the 10 highest forces in a practical problem the sqi would not be known sticking to the 10 highest impact peaks procedure a fine mesh comflow calculation was done for each of the 10 highest indicator peaks using the coarse mesh calculation wave input and ship motions and the fine mesh described in bandringa et al 2020 the forces from these 10 fine mesh calculations in combination with the statistics from the coarse mesh calculation lead to the force distribution in fig 18 this plot also shows the experimental force distribution for the same run the probability is given with respect to the number of wave encounters in this case 238 in the 30 min run the probability level does not start at one on the top because most wave encounters did not lead to a green water impact the figure shows that the distributions are very similar a weibull distribution fit to both sets of discrete data points would also lead to similar results this demonstration shows that the screening procedure is feasible and leads to the desired results the screening was not perfect the order of the 10 highest indicator peaks was slightly different than the order of the 10 highest force peaks two of the largest 10 impacts are missing and two other impacts are included however it turns out that these two other events also lead to large loads in this case this multi fidelity screening approach is much quicker than performing the full 30 min run on a fine mesh in cfd which would be a very heavy computation it could be further sped up by using a potential flow tool for screening however as said that requires some thinking about the use of linear wave input and ship motions as input for the fine mesh cfd calculation in the overall computational time screening quality i e the number of events from the screening procedure with the associated heavy fine mesh computation for each of them also has to be balanced against the computational time for the screening itself in a practical design problem the approach would not be applied to 30 min of wave data mcs with the screening tool would be applied for many wave realisations over a full scatter diagram rcm could maybe be used to speed up as explained in section 1 2 but only for screening based on linear gaussian wave input a similar plot as fig 18 would be made around the desired probability level where the screening simulation duration determines the probability level that can be resolved 5 7 benefit of screening approach compared to common practice in order to show the benefit of the screening procedure a brief comparison was made to the contour line approach discussed in section 1 2 this method would be used to select a few representative wave conditions from a scatter diagram as a containership sails around the world the scatter diagram could be derived from hindcast wave data based on the ship voyages instead of a fixed location each of the selected wave conditions would be run in a wave basin experiment for a large number of 3 h realisations now we consider screening for 3 h example test 100504 with two of the better potential flow indicators peaks in rwe at relst19 from pre and linearly propagated undisturbed wave crests measured at probe w2 to probe w11 table 1 shows that 1528 wave encounters were measured in the test duration without screening all of these crests would have to be run in a high fidelity tool in order to capture the 10 highest green water loads with screening this number can be significantly reduced the left plot in fig 12 shows that the 10 event sqi values for these two indicators are 12 6 respectively 13 4 we need to multiply these values with the number of relevant force peaks 10 in this case in order to determine how many events need to be assessed in a high fidelity tool this leads to 126 respectively 134 events which is a reduction of 91 92 compared to all wave encounters in the present experimental dataset only one 3 h realisation is available per wave condition whereas a number of realisations of this duration would be run in the contour line approach if the screening target would be to identify the 10 highest events in each realisation the ratio of events to analyse with and without screening will be the same for more realisations so still 91 92 reduction if the target is to identify the 10 highest events over all realisations the ratio will probably be even more favourable for screening assuming that the 3 h sqi is converged and assuming that 20 realisations of 3 h duration would be required this could reduce the number of events with even 99 6 1 130 1528 20 the computational time with screening tool pre in order to achieve this is only 2 cpuh see table 4 this could possibly be further reduced using rcm although generating the frequency domain database is more expensive than running the mcs for 20 wave realisations of 3 h this may translate to a significantly shorter experimental basin time or lower number of fine mesh cfd calculations these percentages are rough indications that do not consider the required pre event time in a high fidelity analysis or the groupiness of events it is not possible to run only one wave crest in a high fidelity tool which reduces the efficiency of the screening compared to the numbers above on the other hand individual high wave crests usually occur in groups so a few critical events could probably be grouped in one high fidelity experiment calculation this may partly compensate the pre event time effect finally the sqi value varies quite a lot with test condition see fig 12 so the reduction will not be as large in every wave condition however example test 100504 is not the test with the best result for these two example indicators the sqi values vary between 4 1 and 64 1 over all nine 3 h tests the average values in fig 15 provide estimates for an arbitrary wave condition summarising this study shows that a reduction in the order of 90 of the high fidelity experimental or computational time required to obtain the short term largest green water loads on a sailing ship can be achieved using a smart screening procedure however the amount of saved time depends on the selected indicator and screening tool on the wave condition and on the balance between groupiness of the indicator peaks and the required pre event time in the high fidelity tool 6 conclusions 1 screening for green water events on the breakwater of a sailing containership is feasible this can be done both with potential flow and coarse mesh cfd codes provided the indicator is well chosen as well as the grid time step and wave input settings 2 using linear potential flow means that the input waves are linearised disregarding the effects of higher order wave wave interactions and wave breaking on the identification of the critical events however the present study shows that the screening results from linear potential flow are nearly as good as from coarse mesh cfd for the considered test case 3 the potential flow methods are much faster than coarse mesh cfd which is favourable for long term screening it may even be possible to further speed up the potential flow screening using response conditioning as it is based on linear gaussian wave input this is not possible for cfd 4 if potential flow screening is indeed used questions regarding the use of the low fidelity screening output in high fidelity cfd or experiments have to be solved this is easier for the combination of coarse mesh cfd screening and fine mesh cfd high fidelity calculations in that case the required output can directly be generated 5 the final choice has to be made based on the overall computational time balancing the time for the screening and the time for the high fidelity assessment lower screening quality increases the number of events to evaluate in detail the low to high fidelity coupling may also play a role based on the present results screening with potential flow codes seems the best choice especially for long term screening of full scatter diagrams 6 the peaks in relative wave elevation rwe around the bow perform well as green water indicator as well as the crest front steepness of the rwe the undisturbed wave crest heights at the bow also seem a good indicator cfd specific indicators such as peaks in rwe on deck in coarse mesh breakwater force and in fluxes through planes on the fore deck perform even slightly better missing non linearity in the rwe peaks and missing non linearity in the water velocities in the wave crests seem the determining factors for the force peaks that are not well predicted 7 it does not matter a lot which type of potential flow code is used zero speed green s functions or rankine source frequency or time domain linear or weakly non linear froude krylov modelling the evaluated potential flow codes nload3d hydrostar hydrostar precal r and fatima deliver similar results 8 the coarse mesh cfd results depend heavily on the choice of wave input grid and time step settings two versions of openfoam and comflow on three grids were compared the comflow results with grids 2 or 3 seem to be good optima of these choices leading to quite short computational times and good quality screening results still this is around 2 20 times as computationally expensive as potential flow calculations gaining only a factor 1 2 in screening quality index sqi 9 the identified critical wave events based on coarse mesh comflow indicator rwe at the bow were run with fine mesh cfd this pilot study showed that the resulting load distribution is very similar to the experiments which shows that multi fidelity screening is promising for the handling of statistics of extreme events in waves 10 a smart screening procedure can reduce the required high fidelity experimental computational time to obtain the short term design green water loads on a sailing ship up to 90 compared to full monte carlo simulation however the efficiency depends on the selected indicator and screening tool on the wave condition and on the balance between groupiness of the indicator peaks and the required pre event time in the high fidelity tool 7 future work including some non linearity in the undisturbed wave or its component in the rwe may further improve the results this can be done using coarse mesh cfd but this is computationally expensive a possibly quicker method could be to use analytical second order waves or a fully non linear potential flow method both will be evaluated in follow up project crs scream screening for extremes and maxima in waves also the sqi defined in the present study is a good measure to compare different screening tools in a deterministic validation set up however it also has a few downsides it is sensitive to outliers it is not easy to translate to a practical design study and validation requires deterministic reproduction of the wave conditions appendix b shows that this is challenging and may lead to worse results than in a real screening application a statistical approach is therefore foreseen for definition of sqi 2 0 that can be used in a design procedure the idea would be to predict the shape of the load distribution based on a few identified events and the underlying distribution of the indicator validation would be based on long duration experiments this eliminates the need to deterministically reproduce the waves in the numerical tools and it provides converged statistics for the 1 h or 3 h green water design load this work will also be part of crs scream based on 20 30 h duration tests with a sailing ferry other possible future work could be to combine different indicators to improve the screening performance or to use large wave groups as indicator as suggested by ersdal and kvitrud 2000 applying rcm could further speed up linear screening finally the present validation was based on one ship design in long crested waves variations in wave directional spreading ship type bow flare angle deck layout etc would increase confidence in the results in theory similar screening based approaches could also be used to evaluate other rare events in waves such as bow flare slamming airgap or wetdeck slamming problems or even propeller ventilation or parametric roll of ships overtopping of dykes etc this requires further study and validation

https www crships org appendix a properties and settings of numerical codes tables 6 and 7 show the properties and settings of respectively the potential flow and coarse mesh cfd codes all cfd codes are finite volume codes with volume of fluid free surface approximation in ofa and ofa1 a 2nd order implicit time integration backward scheme was used and 2nd order order spatial discretisation with limited linear divergence scheme for convection in ofb a 1st 2nd order time integration blend was used crank nicolson 0 9 as well as a 1st second order spatial discretisation blend linear upwind and 2nd order upwind with limiter and a cmules vof scheme this code used an adaptive time step but the outcome was relatively constant still the computational time for each time step varied because the number of outer iterations within each time step varied finally in cf1 3 a first order explicit time integration scheme was used as well as first order symmetry preserving spatial discretisation a plic vof with macho advection scheme was also used and an absorbing boundary condition gabc at the outflow fig 19 shows how the planes are defined through which the fluxes in direction of the ship s long axis were calculated with ofa ofa1 and cf1 3 appendix b direct wave and ship response comparison b 1 undisturbed waves the numerical wave results were compared to each other and to the experiments were possible the largest wave crests in the example 3 h test 100504 at w1 and at cog are shown in fig 22 as well as the wave crest distributions scatter plots of reference versus predicted crests are also shown using the matching procedure in section 4 3 no experimental wave results are available at cog for the 3 h tests so these results can only be compared between the different codes pre fat was taken as reference here the ofa wave results were not delivered at the ship cog similar plots of the largest undisturbed wave crest distribution and scatter at probe w11 for the single 30 min run 10050401 are shown in fig 23 summary results for all 3 h tests at probe w1 and at cog are provided in fig 20 and for the 30 min run at probes w1 w2 and w11 in fig 21 these plots show the mean and root mean square rms error for the 10 highest crests compared to the experiments for each test or run for reference the propagated wave using linear dispersion from w1 is also added to the 30 min plot which of course is identical to the experiments at w1 hence zero error in fig 21 for signal linpr at w1 ofa did not deliver the undisturbed wave signals so this signal is not visible in the 30 min figures the 3 h plots show that there are differences between the codes already in the input waves the input waves were identical for hs hs and for pre fat hs hs on average shows lower wave crests at cog than the other codes especially for the larger wave crests this is due to analytical post processing of the experimental wave measurements re sampling fft component selection as shown in fig 6 linear propagation from the wave probes to the cog was used for all potential flow codes which will introduce similar errors compared to the real non linear propagation of the steep wave conditions the ofa results deviate much more from the experiments than the potential flow wave input an important difference with the potential flow wave input is that these waves are the result of numerical wave propagation in the cfd code instead of analytical post processing this may have caused part of the wave quality loss however this is probably largely due to the choices made for the ofa wave input linear analytical wave elevation propagation from the experimental measurements at w45 to the inflow location was used linear wave kinematics were added after which the waves were propagated in the cfd code to the model and the other probes the plots show that even the re propagated result at w45 significantly deviates from the experiments the 30 min figures also show significant differences in waves at w11 between the coarse mesh cfd codes especially for the higher wave crests ofa1 and ofb are very similar and quite far below the experimental results for the highest wave crests even though different ways were used to synthesise their input waves fig 7 however they both used linear wave propagation from another location to the inflow and a selection of the fft components by removing the higher frequency components the details of the steepest wave crests may have been removed this is likely to be the main reason for the underestimation although the wave handling in the code openfoam could also contribute the comflow results on different grids show similar results with small mean errors for the highest crests although grid 1 slightly overestimates them b 2 ship response similar results are presented for the ship responses the heave and pitch motions of the ship were delivered by all considered codes as well as rwe at different probes see fig 4 the largest peaks in rwe at relbow are shown in fig 24 for 3 h test 100504 as well as the peak distributions and a scatter plot of matched peaks using the zero up crossing matching procedure in section 4 3 note that the experimental troughs are truncated due to the length of the probes the mean and rms error in the 10 largest peak values compared to the experiments are provided in fig 25 for all nine 3 h tests it can be observed that the responses from all potential codes and ofa are relatively close to the experiments but they are even closer to each other there is no significant difference between the time and frequency domain codes between the rankine source or zero speed green s function codes or between linear and weakly non linear codes the ofa coarse mesh cfd result is also very close the considered speeds are probably too low to show much better results with rankine source codes and the motions are relatively small in the steep short waves so the froude krylov force components are also small on average both the heave and pitch motion peaks are overestimated compared to the experiments by all codes with a large amount of scatter around the trends more than in the incoming waves this may be due to some small viscous damping effects in the experimental heave and pitch motions that will be absent in potential flow and very small in cfd with a coarse mesh the largest rwe peaks were slightly overestimated by all potential flow codes compared to the experiments this may be due to water flowing over deck in the experiments wave breaking that lowers rwe for the highest peaks and or the overestimation of the numerical ship motions the largest 10 rwe peaks have rms errors around 2 3 m which is significant compared to the h s of 6 4 9 1 m similar plots were made for 30 min run 10050401 fig 26 includes the heave pitch and rwe results around the hull similar as for the 3 h tests but also the rwe on deck and coarse mesh cfd forces on the breakwater results of cf1 were not delivered with the ship only for the undisturbed waves the rwe on deck coarse mesh force on the bottom row and fluxes were not delivered by ofb as there is no experimental result for the fluxes through planes on deck fig 19 the error plot of this signal is omitted similar as for the potential flow and ofa results discussed above the mean heave and pitch peaks from all coarse mesh cfd calculations were over predicted compared to the experiments this is not very surprising as effects of viscous damping in the motions are also underestimated by cfd on a coarse mesh the 30 min mean and rms errors of the 10 largest motion and rwe peaks in fig 26 are also very similar to those based on the 3 h potential flow results for head waves all tests starting with 1005 in fig 25 this indicates that the coarse mesh cfd screening results were not expected to be much better than the potential flow screening results on the other hand the extra indicators such as wave elevation on deck forces and fluxes that cfd can produce may also be valuable indicators the coarse mesh force on the breakwater was expected to deviate significantly from the experimental results this is also visible in fig 26 still the order of the peaks can be an efficient green water indicator see section 5 appendix c extra 3 h indicator scatter plots the present appendix shows other 3 h scatter plots for the matched indicator and force peaks the main text includes these plots for one example test 100504 and two indicators peaks in relst19 and crests in w11 plotting all combinations of indicators and tests is too elaborate but fig 27 shows the scatters for the other considered indicators for test 100504 and figs 28 and 29 show the same for the two example indicators in all 3 h test conditions appendix d example impacts this appendix describes a few selected example impacts that determine outliers in sqi for indicator peaks in rwe at the bow high speed video recordings are shown when available otherwise snapshots from the normal video recording are shown event 1 in head wave test 100506 determines the sqi for relbow at the lower force thresholds fig 30 it shows a relatively high force 4800 kn for a relatively low rwe 9 m the figure shows that all potential flow codes correspond well to the experimental result so the quality of the response prediction is not the problem the snapshots show that this elevation indeed was limited this is especially the case at the bow relst19 serves as better indicator for this particular event a sheet of water moves to two sides of the bow which does not lead to loading on the breakwater however a high speed jet of water also moves over the middle of the fore deck impacting the breakwater this jet was formed by water that just exceeded the freeboard the first snapshot shows that the incoming wave for this event is quite high and steep just before breaking the horizontal kinematics of the water in the crest just overtopping the freeboard may well cause the jet over the fore deck this type of event is hard to predict using linear or even non linear rwe using non linear horizontal wave velocities as indicators could maybe improve this the event is an outlier in the peaks of relbow sqi but it is an event that indeed cannot be accurately predicted by this indicator event 2 was found in head wave test 100504 but not in run 1 that was evaluated as 30 min run see fig 31 the potential flow rwe for this event are low whereas the force on the breakwater is considerable 6000 kn the time traces show that the experimental and ofa results are much higher than the potential flow results for this event this points in the direction of a non linear steep wave event which is confirmed by the snapshots increasing the non linearity in the incoming wave component of the rwe will probably significantly improve the potential flow screening results in this case they could get closer to the experimental and ofa results event 3 was found in bow quartering test 100703 fig 32 this bow quartering test was one of the most difficult conditions to screen for all codes but especially for hs the figure highlights an event where all other codes perform consistently it shows that hs does not predict a high rwe peak for this event and the time trace appears differently from the others the other codes are quite similar to each other and to the experiments around this time inspection of the time traces showed that this is the case more often for hs in this test but not all the time the erratic behaviour is not explained by the wave input as that would lead to similar results from hs this is not the case the hs time trace matches the other codes well it is therefore due to something in the hs code event 4 was the largest event in bow quartering test 100704 fig 33 the rwe at the bow predicted for this event serve reasonably well as indicator but there is quite some variation between the codes in the scatter plot part of this is caused by the differences in wave input discussed earlier for instance all differences between pre and hs should be attributed to this as the codes are very similar however the wave input for hs and hs was identical so there are also differences due to the codes this condition is the most difficult one with a relatively high forward speed of 10 kn in a severe bow quartering wave condition considering that the potential flow screening still performs relatively well the snapshots show that this event is associated with a breaking wave just in front of the model the introduced non linearity is included in the experimental rwe but not in the potential flow results including some non linearity in the indicator may therefore improve the results
