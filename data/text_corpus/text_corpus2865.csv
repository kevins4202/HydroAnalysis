14325,the preozonation and carbon nanotubes cnts modification of hollow fiber membranes for fouling control was systematically evaluated when treating real sewage effluent the hybrid process was operated in cyclical flow filtration system involving filtrating and backwashing processes the results revealed that preozonation and cnts modification improved fouling control and permeate quality after preozonation the fouling rate of the cnts modified membrane was reduced and its recoverability was effectively improved with increased ozone dosage the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification on fouling control was enhanced the recoverability of cnts modified membranes in the hybrid process was improved by increasing the frequency of backwashing compared with cnts adsorption effect the interception effect of cnts layer pre deposited during membrane modification increased permeate quality and reduced membrane fouling the interception effect of cnts layer was enhanced after preozonation confocal laser scanning microscope results demonstrated that the hybrid preozonation and cnts modification membrane process effectively controlled biofouling after preozonation the presence of cnt layers on membrane surfaces could further decrease the amount of living bacteria the attachment of dead bacteria to cnts modified membrane was also decreased after preozonation keywords preozonation cnts hollow fiber membrane membrane fouling sewage effluent 1 introduction the membrane filtration pressure below 1 2 bar was called low pressure membrane lpm filtration which has attracted wide attention due to its characterizes of low energy requirements and high microbial removal efficiency 1 however the application of lpm in drinking water treatment and wastewater reuse is still restricted by membrane fouling problems wastewater effluent organic matter efom are considered as the major foulants that cause organic fouling of lpm during the wastewater reclamation process which included natural organic matter nom soluble microbial products smp disinfection by products dbps and natural and synthetic trace chemicals soc 2 4 lpm does not effectively remove efom because they are usually smaller than the membrane pores additionally efom can accumulated on the surface of the membrane and inside the pores the accumulated efom act as a good carbon source or so called conditioning film which can further induce the adhesion of bacteria or enhance attachment of bacterial cells to the surface of membranes 5 6 and accelerate the biofouling of lpm adsorption pretreatment with porous carbon material pcm has been investigated to reduce organic fouling of lpm membranes research into powder activated carbon pac as a basic adsorbent which mainly consists of small micropores 2 nm has resulted in conflicting findings some studies indicated that the membrane flux and organic removal ratio were improved with the addition of pac 4 7 10 while other studies suggested a negative impact of pac which was related to its microporous characteristics and the low porosity of the pac cake layer 11 13 recently mesopore and macropore dominated dual templated hierarchical porous carbons hpcs were reported as a effective solution to irreversible fouling of lpm compared to pac during pre treatment of wastewater 14 carbon nanotubes cnts due to their very high surface area to volume have become a novel carbonaceous material and adsorbent 15 17 as the surface of cnts does not contain deeply embedded pores it is easier to undergo desorption than acs 17 19 additionally unlike other carbon materials the inter cnt void can be used in the form of cnt mats or cnt buckypapers 20 21 recently the pre deposition of cnts on membrane surfaces has been proposed as a novel technology in the preparation and modification of lpm for combating membrane fouling investigations showed that the pre deposited cnt layers on membrane surfaces improved the antifouling ability of membrane 20 22 23 gallagher et al further studied the stability of the pre deposited cnt layer and generated stable cnt mats on the inner surface of the hollow fiber membranes which was reported to be stable to backwashing 20 despite this the recoverability of the pre deposited cnt membrane is still a major challenge little related investigation has been performed to evaluate its recoverability especially when used in actual wastewater treatment process the effect of ozonation as a pretreatment of membrane filtration on lpm fouling is complex it has been shown that the substantial structural changed to the organic materials caused the positive effect of pre ozonation on membrane fouling included 1 removal of aromatic rings 2 increase the number of carboxylic functions 3 molecules dissociate into smaller fragments 4 the tendency of humic substances to complex with divalent ions gets higher 24 the negative impact of preozonation on membrane filtration process was also reported to be related to biofouling or reduced permeate quality 25 26 as the smaller fragments of organic materials caused by pre ozonation can be easily utilized as carbon sources by bacterial or they may penetrate through membrane pores the combination of pre ozonation and cnts modification of membrane pre deposition of cnt on membrane surface had a synergistic effect as the cnts had antimicrobial activity 27 28 as well as high adsorption properties 15 17 which were effective in reducing the biofouling and increasing permeate quality in addition pre ozonation has the potential of changing organic substance structures and the distribution of foulants in the pre deposited cnt layer which could help increase the recoverability of the pre deposited cnt until now the hybrid process of pre ozonation and cnts modification on hollow fiber membrane for fouling control has not been studied especially for cyclical flow filtration system used in the actual wastewater treatment to evaluate the possible application of this hybrid process our investigation selected commonly used hollow fiber lpm to filtrate actual sewage effluent the hybrid process was then applied using the normal membrane filtration process including both filtrating and backwashing process the effectiveness of the hybrid process on membrane fouling control was systematically compared with the original unmodified membrane the cnts modified membrane and the preozonation unmodified membrane the impact of operating parameters e g flux backwashing frequency on the hybrid process was further evaluated foulants on membrane surfaces were analyzed with sem to understand the mechanism of the hybrid process on fouling control the adsorption effect of cnts and the interception effect of the pre deposited cnts during modification were further distinguished especially after the preozonation treatment finally the effect of the hybrid process on biofouling control was evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples the real sewage effluent was collected from a pilot scale sequential batch reactor sbr operated by the key laboratory of water pollution control center beijing university of technology and it was stored at 4 c before use the influent of the pilot scale sbr was the domestic sewage discharged from the residential community water qualities were analyzed and are presented in table 1 the milli q water purification system millipore usa was used to obtain ultrapure water 2 2 carbon nanotubes multi walled cnts mwcnts with an outer diameter of 30 50 nm and length 0f 5 20 μm was purchased from beijing nachen tech co ltd china according to the manufacturer the purity of the received mwcnts is 95 2 3 membrane materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membranes and pvdf flat sheet membranes were selected in our experiment as pvdf is a typical organic membrane material the basic properties of pvdf membrane are shown in table 2 in order to make the handmade hollow fiber membrane module we encapsulated the 10 cm in length virgin hollow fiber pvdf membrane in the epoxy resin with one end cut open to make it filter from the inside out dead end filtration the inner surface area of different modules was kept about 50 cm2 once prepared the membrane modules were soaked overnight in milli q water for conditioning before each experiment a new hollow fiber membrane module was used the module and the flat sheet were rinsed with milli q water 2 4 the hybrid pre ozonation and cnts modification membrane filtration experiment the hybrid pre ozonation and cnts modification membrane filtration experiment was performed in a constant flux dead end filtration mode real sewage effluent was continuously flown into the hybrid process in order to make comparison four parallel membrane filtration tests were designed i unmodified membrane ii cnts modified membrane iii preozonation unmodified membrane iv preozonation cnts modified membrane the four tests were carried out under the same operational conditions water flux backwashing time and frequency and a room temperature of 20 1 c the schematic illustration of the hybrid process is shown in fig 1 which includes a sand filtration unit a pre ozonation unit a membrane filtration unit and an automatic recording and control unit 2 4 1 sand filtration unit real sewage effluent was continually supplied to the sand filtration column the filter material was selected from quartz sand with a particle size of 1 2 mm the sand filtration column has a height of 80 cm and a diameter of 5 cm the outflow from the sand filtration column was stored in a high level tank some of the water in the high level tank was directly filtered through the membrane filtration unit while the rest was fed into the preozonation unit 2 4 2 pre ozonation unit the preozonation unit consisted of an ozone generator zr c 5 beijing zhong rui yi jia technology co ltd china a gaseous ozone analyzer an ozone oxidation column and an ozone reaction column the ozone reaction was carried out in a continuous flow ozone contact column ozone was entered into the column through a porous quartz aeration disc loaded 20 mm above the bottom an ozone retention column which had the same size as the ozone contact column was connected to the ozone contact column the dosage of ozone was controlled by regulating the time of ozone supply and monitored by a gaseous ozone analyzer ideal 2000 the residual ozone in the off gas was monitored by an ozone analyzer and further degraded by a destruction unit the consumption of ozone was calculated as the difference between the inlet ozone and the residual ozone in off gas in the experiment ozone concentration was gradually increased from 0 22 mgo3 mgtoc mg of gaseous o3 per mg of dissolved organic matter to 0 41 mgo3 mgtoc then to 0 75 mgo3 mgtoc 2 4 3 membrane filtration unit the membrane filtration unit included four parallel operated tests the hand made hollow fiber membrane modules with an effective filtration area of 50 cm2 were located in a cylinderical column and cleaned by filtering ultrapure water through until the permeate showed zero toc with the cnts modified membrane 15 mg mwnts was suspended in 50 ml ethanol solution with a concentration of 50 v v after sonication for 10 min the cnts suspension was immediately filtered through the cleaned hollow fiber membrane modules by a peristaltic pump with flux of 200 l m2 h a layer of cnts was loaded in the inner surface of hollow fiber membrane which corresponded to cnt loading of 3 g m2 each cnt pre deposited membrane was cleaned with ultrapure water until the permeate showed zero toc then real sewage effluent was filtered from the inside to the outside of the hollow fiber membrane four parallel operated peristaltic pumps were used to drive the feed solution through the membranes with flux range of 35 120 l m2 h the permeate stored in the cylindrical vessel was used as backwashing water each filtration cycle included 30 60 min of filtration and 1 min of backwash during each backwash the membrane module was flushed from outside to inside by the backwashing water at a flux of 120 l m2 h 2 4 4 automatic recording and control unit in the automatic recording and control unit the pressure transducers the peristaltic pumps the ozone generator the gaseous ozone analyzers and the valves were connected to a programmable logic controller plc center and a computer during the operation of the process with the membranes the mass transfer resistance gradually increased to maintain a constant flow rate the trans membrane pressure tmp increased membrane fouling resistance was measured by monitoring tmp changes over time with pressure transducer in the unit the water flux the backwash period and the backwash time the gaseous ozone concentration are automatically recorded and controlled by adjusting the operational parameters the filtration process and backwash process were accomplished additionally the start or stop of ozone generator and peristaltic pump are automatically controlled when the tmp is over the maximum pressure of 0 14 mpa 1 4bar the operation of the peristaltic pump automatically stopped 2 5 water sample analysis permeates from the hybrid system were sampled after every third filtration cycle a total organic carbon analyzer toc l csn shimadzu was used to determine the doc the non purgeable organic carbon npoc detection method was selected and the samples were purified and acidified with carbon free air before measurement then the total carbon in the sample was burned into carbon dioxide which was monitored by the ndir detector potassium hydrogen phthalate stored at 4 c for no more than 1 month was used as the total carbon standard substance humic substances content in water samples was determined by uv254 absorption spectrometry a spectrophotometer unico2100 china was used to made the uv254 measurements 2 6 stability of the loaded mwnts after chemical cleaning the study by gallagher et al showed the loaded mwnts in the hollow fiber membrane had a higher stability 20 the masses of cnt dislodged from the cnt modified membranes after chemical cleaning were analyzed after soaking in 100 ml chemical reagent for several hours and rinsing with 50 ml milli q water the membranes were put back in the system and rinsed with 50 ml back washing water the chemical reagent and milli q water and the back washing water were collected and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to extract the detached cnt according to jiang et al the absorption of cnts appears at 200 300 nm in aqueous solution 29 as ethanol does not absorb light in the range of 200 300 nm the centrifuged cnt was dispersed in 50 ml mixed solution of ethanol and milli q water 50 v v and the cnt concentration was then determined by measuring the average uv absorbance at 266 nm the conducting separate control studies where masses of cnts powders were dispersed in 50 ml ethanol solution was used to determine the correlation between cnts mass concentration mg l and uv absorbance in uv266 2 7 sem and clsm the scanning electron microscope sem s 4300 hitachi japan at 15 kev was used to analyze the images of the inner surfaces and cross sectional of the membranes all specimens were dried for 24 h at 60 before test cross sections were obtained by fracturing the membranes in the presence of liquid nitrogen and then coated their surface with a thin layer of gold to insure charging during sem membrane coupons 0 5 cm2 were cut from the middle of the fouled hollow fiber membrane stained with syto 9 and pi l7012 live dead bacligh bacterial viability kit for the live and dead bacteria cells bacteria with intact cell membranes turn fluorescent green while bacteria with damaged cell membranes turn fluorescent red the background has virtually no fluorescence 1 5 μl of syto 9 and 1 5 μl pi were combined in a microfuge tube and then mixed thoroughly 1 ml phosphate buffered solution kcl 2 7 mmol l nacl 137 mmol l kh2po4 1 4 mmol l na2hpo4 4 3 mmol l was added in the microfuge tube each membrane sample was fixed on a plastic plate with a pin added with mixture solution these were then incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 min unbound stain was carefully rinsed with milli q water subsequently image observation acquisition and analysis of the stained membrane coupons using a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm olympus fv1000 japanese olympus was performed the excitation emission for these dyes are 480 500 nm for syto 9 stain and 490 635 nm for pi image analysis was performed using imagej in this way fluorescence intensity can be determined for the live and dead bacteria cells on the membrane 2 8 cnt pre adsorption and cnts pre deposition comparison studies to differentiate between the adsorption and the interception effect of cnts cnt pre deposition and cnts pre adsorption comparison studies were carried out in constant pressure dead end filtration mode using a 50 ml ultrafiltration cup amicon 8050 millipore usa a flat sheet hydrophilic pvdf membrane table 2 was set up in the ultrafiltration cup every new pvdf membrane was filtered by ultrapure water until the permeate toc of zero was obtained the feed solution was driven through the membrane by nitrogen gas with constant pressure of 0 02 mpa and the flow rate was about 120 l m2 h the weighting data of the permeate was automatically recorded by a computer that was connected to an electronic balance before the filtration tests the feed water was brought to room temperature 20 1 c 2 8 1 cnts pre adsorption doses of cnts 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg were added into 10 ml milliq water and sonicated for 3 min then mixed with 500 ml actual sewage effluent in glass bottle the glass bottles were shaken on a horizontal shaker at a room temperature of 20 c after 5 15 30 45 60 90 120 150 180 min and 4 6 8 10 18 h every 20 ml water was sampled from each glass bottle the water samples were then filtered through polyethersulfone pes membrane pore size of 0 22 μm to separate the cnts toc and uv254 analysis were further conducted the adsorption kinetic tests showed that the adsorption of efom on the cnts reached saturation condition after 6 h next 250 ml actual sewage effluent was mixed with cnts milli q water suspension 10 ml including 4 mg cnt 10 mg cnt and 13 4 mg cnt separately for 6 h to reach equilibrium after cnt pre adsorption treatment the sewage effluent was filtered through a new flat sheet pvdf membrane under constant pressure dead end filtration mode in the same way the weighting data was automatically recorded 2 8 2 cnt pre deposition 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg of cnts corresponding to cnt loading of 3 g m2 7 5 g m2 10 g m2 were sonicated in 10 ml ethanol solution concentration of 50 v v for 3 min after sonication the cnts suspension was filtered through a cleaned pvdf membranes to form a cnts mat each cnt pre deposited membrane was filtered ultrapure water through until the value of toc of the permeate showed zero then the cnt pre deposited membrane was set up in the cell first 10 ml of milli q water was filtered then 250 ml of actual sewage effluent was filtered through the membranes the weighting data were automatically recorded the removal rates of toc and uv254 during filtration by cnt pre deposition membrane were recorded after filtration for 5 15 30 45 and 60 min 20 ml water were sampled from each cell 2 8 3 bench scale ozonation experiment the bench scale ozonation experiment was carried out in a semi continuous flow reactor and the reaction temperature was controlled at 20 1 c ozone was entered into the cylindrical reactor that was made of glass with a volume of 1374 ml through a porous quartz aeration disc loaded 20 mm above the bottom the dosage of ozone was controlled by regulating the time of ozone supply and monitored by a gaseous ozone analyzer ideal 2000 the residual ozone in the off gas was monitored by an ozone analyzer and further degraded by a destruction unit the consumption of ozone was calculated as the difference between the inlet ozone and the residual ozone in off gas each water sample was exposed to ozone for 1 min and the residual ozone was blown off with pure n2 the ozone concentration of 0 41mgo3 mgtoc was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre ozonation and cnts modification on fouling control the real sewage effluent was filtered through the four parallel operated membrane units in dead end mode at a constant flux of 80 l h m2 each filtration cycle of 60 min followed by 1 min backwashing with a permeate effluent rate of 120 l h m2 the net permeate volume was about 98 of the feed water in each cycle membrane fouling was evaluated by measuring the rate of tmp increase p p0 during each filtration cycle where p0 is the initial tmp prior to the filtration and p is the tmp in a specific filtration cycle fig 2 shows the tmp increase measured as a function of the filtration cycle during actual sewage effluent filtration for the four parallel operated units during filtration of real sewage effluent the tmp of the unmodified membrane increased to more than 1 4 bar after filtration periods of 24 cycles in cycles 1 15 the fouling rate was equal to 0 03 bar cycle in cycles 16 24 the fouling rate was equal to 0 09 bar cycle this appears to show that backwashing cannot effectively alleviate fouling for the cnts modified membrane the fouling rate was equal to 0 01 bar cycle in cycles 1 15 in cycles 16 30 fouling rate was increased to 0 03 bar cycle the presence of the cnts layer reduced the fouling rate by about 67 in cycles 1 30 after periods of 37 cycles the tmp of the cnts modified membrane increased above 1 4 bar in view of long term operation it seems that the fouling resistance of the cnts modified membrane cannot be maintained by backwashing the effectiveness of cnts modification on fouling alleviation was lower than that of preozonation after preozonation the fouling rate of the unmodified membrane was 0 013 bar cycle in the cycle of 1 15 corresponding to 0 22 mgo3 doc 0 017 bar cycle in cycles 16 30 corresponding to 0 41 mgo3 doc and 0 027 bar cycle in cycles 31 45 corresponding to 0 75 mgo3 doc preozonation combined with cnts modification appears to have the best alleviation effect on fouling control after preozonation the presence of cnt layer further reduced the fouling rate to 0 007 bar cycle in cycles 1 15 corresponding to 0 22 mgo3 doc 0 01 bar cycle in cycles 16 30 corresponding to 0 41 mgo3 doc and 0 007 bar cycle in cycles 31 45 corresponding to 0 75 mgo3 doc this appears to show that the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification on fouling control is enhanced with increased ozone dosage after preozonation the cnts modified membrane had a prolonged operation time which appears to show that the recoverability of the cnt layer was greatly improved 3 2 pre ozonation and cnts modification on permeate quality as shown in fig 3 the permeates from the four parallel operated membrane units were collected every third filtration cycle for doc and uv254 analysis compared with the unmodified membrane the cnts modified membrane showed little improvement on doc removal and only a small improvement on uv254 removal compared with the unmodified membrane with the increase of filtration cycle the removal rate for doc and uv254 both decreased this seems to show that the presence of cnts layer on the membrane surface did not improve permeate quality yang et al 21 and ajmani et al 23 reported a higher removal rate of humic substances or natural organic matter nom by pre loaded cnts or cnt buckypaper despite this they did not perform related experiments to evaluate the recoverability of the pre loaded cnts as for the actual wastewater treatment process our results appear to show that efom in sewage effluent is much more difficult to remove by the pre loaded cnts on membrane surfaces as reported efom has complex organic characteristics it has more low molecular weight lmw substances as well as hydrophilic fractions which make it difficult to remove compared with nom or humic substances additionally the cnts loading in our experiment 3 g m2 is much lower than that used by yang et al 21 gallagher et al stated that the presence of cnt mats decreased the extent of irreversible alginate fouling of membranes with a pore size of around 0 1um 20 while the concrete removal rate of alginate was not reported after preozonation 0 22 mgo3 mgdoc doc removal rate was slightly increased to 12 with continuous operation removal rate of both doc and uv254 gradually decreased increased ozone dosage did not appear to effectively enhance their removal with the processing of operation the hybrid preozonation and cnts modified membrane was the most effective for doc and uv254 removal also the doc removal can be enhanced with the increase of ozone dosage with an increase of ozone dosage from 0 22 mg o3 mg doc to 0 41 mg o3 mg doc uv254 removal by the hybrid process increased slightly after several filtration cycles removal rate further decreased with the further increasing of ozone dosage from 0 41 mg o3 mg doc to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc doc removal rate increased to about two times that of the unmodified membrane although the uv254 removal rate was not further improved the results appear to demonstrate that preozonation helps to improve the quality of the permeate from cnts modified membranes 3 3 impact of flux on the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification as shown in fig 4 with the gradual increase of the flux from 35 l m2 h to120 l m2 h sewage effluent was filtered through the four parallel operated membrane units with filtration cycle of 60 min followed by 1 min backwashing after filtration for 15 cycles with a flux of 35 l m2 h the tmp of the unmodified membrane increased to 0 31 bar while those of the other three membranes increased slowly and showed little difference when the flux was increased to 80 l m2 h the difference of the fouling rates among the four units became pronounced the tmp of the unmodified membrane continuously increased to 1 01 bar corresponding to a fouling rate of 0 14 bar cycle the presence of the cnts layer restricted the fouling rate to 0 03 bar cycle in cycles 16 to 20 preozonation also restricted the fouling rate to 0 029 bar cycle under a flux of 80 l m2 h for the preozonation and cnts modified membranes the fouling rate was only 0 02 bar cycle when the flux was further increased to 120 l m2 h the fouling rate of the unmodified membrane remained at 0 14 bar cycle with a sharp tmp increase from 1 01 bar to 1 5 bar while the presence of cnts layer did not seem to further effectively restrict fouling the fouling rate of the cnts modified membrane increased to 0 08 bar cycle and its tpm increased from 0 33 bar to 0 71 bar preozonation still kept the fouling rate as around 0 03 bar cycle with increased flux for the preozonation and cnts modified membrane the fouling rate was remained at 0 02 bar cycle with increasing flux the results appear to show that increase of flux did not influence effectiveness of the hybrid preozonation and cnts modification on fouling control this implies that the hybrid pre ozonation and cnts modified membrane unit may have a higher critical flux compared with the other pretreatment unit 3 4 impact of backwash frequency on the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification to explore the impact of backwash frequency on the hybrid effectiveness of pre ozonation and mwnts modification for fouling control real sewage effluent was filtered through the four parallel operated membrane units with the filtration time dropping from 60 min to 30 min combined with 1 min backwashing over 20 cycles as shown in fig 5 increasing the backwash frequency did not reduce the fouling rate of the unmodified membrane the presence of cnts layer decreased the total tmp while the fouling rate kept constant with increasing of backwash frequency for the preozonated sewage effluent there is no difference between the fouling rate of the unmodified and cnts modified membrane in cycles 1 to 10 however in this filtration process both their fouling rate showed clear decrease when the backwash frequency was increased it is thought that a greater proportional foulants could be more easily flushed away with increased backwash frequency especially after ozonation pretreatment this implies that the recoverability of cnts layer may be improved while the backwashing frequency is increased filtration time dropping from 60 min to 30 min 3 5 chemical cleaning on the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification to recover their permeability membranes were removed and performed ex situ cleaning mode naoh at a concentration of 0 2 g l and 0 5 g l naocl at different concentrations 200 600 mg l a mixture of 0 5 g l naoh and 600mgcl l naocl and 10 mg l ozone solution were selected as the chemical reagent as shown in table 3 the soaking time was 2 h or 4 h after chemical cleaning the membranes were placed back in situ the recovery of the membranes was further investigated the level of detached cnt during chemical cleaning process was monitored chemical cleaning on the recoverability of membrane and the detachment of mwnts is shown in fig 6 compared with the other chemical reagent 10 mg l ozone solution did not effectively clean the foulants on membrane surface the membrane s recoverability appears lower the mixture of 0 5 g l naoh and 600 mgcl l naocl was most effective for foulant removal as shown the recoveries of tmp for all four of the membrane units reached to 1 0 after soaking with the mixture of naoh and naocl although the mwnts detachment after cleaning with the mixture of 0 5 g l naoh and 600 mgcl l naocl was slightly higher than the other chemical reagent the whole detachment caused by chemical cleaning was assessed to be lower than 1 5 additionally the mwnts detachment level of the modified membrane under different chemical regent treatments were lower than that without pre ozonation after cleaning with the mixture of 0 5 g l naoh and 600 mgcl l naocl mwnts detachment of the cnts modified membrane unit is 1 4 while cnt detachment in the preozonation cnts modification unit is 0 9 the tmp change of the four membrane units during the following filtration process is shown in fig 7 as shown the initial tmp level decreased back to their initial status after chemical cleaning with 0 5 g l naoh and 600 mgcl l naocl after further filtration cycles tmp level increase were only slightly greater than that before chemical cleaning the results appears to show that ex situ cleaning with the mixture of naoh and naocl may be used as an effective chemical reagent cleaning method for the hybrid process of preozonation and cnts modification 3 6 foulant analysis with sem after filtrating real sewage effluent the inner surfaces of hollow fibers in the four membrane units was analyzed by sem cross sectional sem images of the original unmodified membrane and cnts modified membrane are shown in fig 8 a and b this appears to show that the pre deposition method covered the membrane surface with a thin cnts mat layer several microns thick after filtration as shown in fig 8c a layer of compact foulants formed on the unmodified membrane however for the cnts modified membrane the foulants is very condense and forms an even layer above the cnts layer as fig 8d shown there was an obvious interface between the cnts layer and the foulants the foulants accumulated on the cnts layer and completely blocked it consequently the fouling resistance of the cnts modified membrane cannot be sustained by backwashing in the long term as demonstrated in the membrane filtration experiments fig 2 after the preozonation of sewage effluent the foulants were relatively loosely spread on the unmodified membrane surface with no obvious transformation of thickness being found as shown in fig 8e the effect of preozonation on fouling control may be explained by the increase of porosity of foulants accumulated on the membrane as for the cnts modified membrane preozonation also changed the state of foulants on its surface as shown in fig 8f the obvious interface between the cnts layer and the foulants disappeared after preozonation the foulants were evenly spread through the cnts modified membrane ozonation may transform the structure of organic substances and change their distribution in the cnts layer it is thought that organic foulants with more hydrophilic groups oh cooh formed after ozonation pretreatment could enhance their contact with cnts and enable faster and easier diffusion of organic foulants to the inner pore surface of the cnts layer yang et al had reported a similar phenomenon they reported that the incorporation of hydrophilic functional groups on the purified cnt buckypaper may enable faster and better contact of the humic acids ha solution with the buckypaper surface resulting in a higher water flux and ha removal efficiency 21 preozonation enhanced the diffusion of organic foulants to the inner pore surface of the cnts layer the complexation of organic foulants and the inner pore surface of cnts layer may behave as a complex membrane and effectively exclude the foulants and increase the permeate quality as well additionally the complexation among organic foulants and the inner pore surface of cnts layer may enhance the stability of the cnts layer during backwashing and decrease the detachment of cnts just as fig 6 shown that the cnts modified membrane with preozonation exhibited less detachment of cnts 3 7 adsorption or interception effects evaluation of mwnts and the impact of preozonation to differentiate between the adsorption and the interception effect of cnts cnts pre deposition and cnts pre adsorption comparison studies were performed under constant pressure dead end filtration mode cnts dosage of 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg were selected to make the comparison which corresponds to cnt loadings of 3 g m2 7 5 g m2 10 g m2 after cnts pre adsorption treatment 250 ml real sewage effluent was respectively mixed with 10 ml cnts milli q water suspension for 6 h the mixture was filtered through a new flat sheet pvdf membrane the same dosages of cnts were pre deposited on the membranes and after 10 ml milli q water was filtered 250 ml real sewage effluent was filtered through a new cnts modified pvdf membrane the weighting data was automatically recorded and compared as before 3 7 1 membrane flux as shown in fig 9 compared with the original membrane the flux rate of membranes after cnts pre adsorption and cnts pre deposition both increased during the filtration process this appears to show that the adsorption and interception effects of cnts help to alleviate fouling it should be noted that the interception effect of the cnts layer was more effective compared with its adsorption effect as shown in fig 9a c with the increase of cnts dosage from 4 mg to 10 mg and 13 4 mg the pre deposition of cnts is more effective for fouling control while the diffused cnts seems to aggravate the fouling of original membrane after pre adsorption slightly it would see that preozonation is helpful for the interception effects of cnts layer but it has only a small impact on the adsorption effects of the diffused cnts as shown in fig 9 after preozonation the interception effects of cnts layer were enhanced to a great extent and alleviated membrane fouling 3 7 2 permeate quality fig 10 shows the effect of cnts pre adsorption and cnts pre deposition on permeate doc and uv254 level as can be seen the removal of doc by the interception effect of cnts layer is noticeably higher than that by the diffused cnts under similar cnts dosage during filtration time of 1 h cnts layer consistently showed higher doc removal ratio while the diffused cnts normally needed several hours to reach the adsorption equilibrium as shown in fig 10a c and e under cnts dosage of 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg the average doc removal by cnts adsorption in equilibration is about 5 8 7 8 and 8 4 while the cnts layer could remove around 6 5 8 6 and 9 5 during 1 h of filtration the removal of uv254 is shown in fig 10b d and f compared with doc the uv254 removal efficiency is normally higher than doc after cnts adsorption and cnts layer interception with cnts dosage of 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg the average uv254 removal by cnts adsorption in equilibration is about 9 3 13 9 and 18 6 while the cnts layer could remove around 10 5 14 3 and 19 4 during 1 h of filtration although the fouling removal by cnts modified membrane might derive from both the adsorption and the interception effects of cnts the interception effect of cnts layers appear to play a greater role on foulant removal especially with more limited filtration time after preozonation with cnts dosage of 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg the average doc removal by cnts adsorption in equilibration is about 6 8 8 5 and 9 3 which is about 1 1 1 1 and 1 2 times of the original sewage effluent the uv254 removal is 11 2 17 6 and 24 which are improved to around 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 times of the original sewage effluent after preozonation the cnts layer removed around 6 6 9 9 and 11 5 doc in 1 h of filtration which is around 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 times of the original sewage effluent the cnts layer further removed about 12 8 19 7 and 26 1 uv254 in 1 h of filtration which is around 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 times of original sewage effluent the results appear to show that the interception effects of the cnts layer were increased greatly compared with its adsorption effect especially after pre ozonation 3 8 preozonation and cnts modification on biofouling control at the end of filtration process the inner surfaces of hollow fibers in the four membrane units were analyzed with clsm the images of live cells green color and dead cells red color distribution are displayed in fig 11 the fluorescence intensity of live dead bacterial on the membrane surfaces is shown in table 4 the total fluorescence intensity live dead of the unmodified membrane is 426 while more dead bacteria were present on the membrane surface of the cnts modified membrane the total fluorescence intensity live dead of the cnts modified membrane is as high as 730 the levels of living bacteria on cnts modified membrane were slightly lower than those on the unmodified membrane as reported the mwnts had a relatively lower disinfection capacity compared with swnts 27 however our results appear to show that the cnts layer with its rough surface and mesopore or inter cnt void structures may capture more dead bacteria as a consequence the fouling resistance of cnts modified membranes cannot be sustained and maybe accompanied by lower recoverability as shown in table 4 the total amount of bacteria is reduced by preozonation the total fluorescence intensity live dead of the unmodified membrane reduced to 143 5 and the fluorescence level of living bacteria was reduced from 261 5 to 126 adams et al reported that the bacteria in the water body are effectively destroyed after ozone oxidation 30 as a result the ozone sterilization reduced biological fouling and improved the service life of the membrane units table 4 also shows that very small amounts of dead bacteria were present on the unmodified membrane surface after preozonation the fluorescence intensity of dead bacteria is only 17 5 gunten et al speculated that ozone could change the structure of membrane fouling layer making it difficult for dead bacteria to adhere to the membrane surface 31 after preozonation the presence of cnts layer on membrane surface did further decrease the level of living bacteria from 126 to 75 while it also captured small amounts of dead bacteria the fluorescence intensity of dead bacteria increased from 17 5 to 169 which is much lower than that of the cnts modified membrane 476 5 this may mean the detachment of dead bacteria from the cnts modified membrane increased after preozonation the dead cells captured by preozonation cnts modified membrane did not aggravate fouling as the hybrid process appears to have the best effect on tmp control it is speculated that the increase of tmp is mainly related to the amounts of live bacteria attached to the membrane surface overall the membrane surface of the hybrid process of preozonation and cnts modification had the lowest number of live cells the hybrid preozonation and cnts modification membrane process appears to effectively control biofouling 4 conclusion preozonation and cnts modification appear to alleviate fouling and improve permeate quality without preozonation cnts modified membrane cannot maintain fouling resistance long term after preozonation the fouling rate of the cnts modified membrane was lowered and its recoverability was effectively improved with the increase of ozone dosage the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification on fouling control was enhanced compared with the other pretreatment units the hybrid preozonation and cnts modified membrane unit had a higher critical flux the recoverability of cnts modified membrane in the hybrid process could be improved by having a high frequency of backwashing additionally pre ozonation was helpful for the stability of cnts on membrane surface during chemical cleaning compared with cnts adsorption effect the interception effect of cnts layer pre deposited during membrane modification appeared more effective for increasing permeate quality and alleviating membrane fouling the interception effect of cnts layer was enhanced after preozonation clsm results appear to show that the hybrid preozonation and cnts modification membrane process effectively reduce biofouling after preozonation the presence of cnts layer on membrane surface could decrease the number of living bacteria the attachment of dead bacteria to cnts modified membrane also decreased after preozonation acknowledgement this work was supported by the

14325,the preozonation and carbon nanotubes cnts modification of hollow fiber membranes for fouling control was systematically evaluated when treating real sewage effluent the hybrid process was operated in cyclical flow filtration system involving filtrating and backwashing processes the results revealed that preozonation and cnts modification improved fouling control and permeate quality after preozonation the fouling rate of the cnts modified membrane was reduced and its recoverability was effectively improved with increased ozone dosage the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification on fouling control was enhanced the recoverability of cnts modified membranes in the hybrid process was improved by increasing the frequency of backwashing compared with cnts adsorption effect the interception effect of cnts layer pre deposited during membrane modification increased permeate quality and reduced membrane fouling the interception effect of cnts layer was enhanced after preozonation confocal laser scanning microscope results demonstrated that the hybrid preozonation and cnts modification membrane process effectively controlled biofouling after preozonation the presence of cnt layers on membrane surfaces could further decrease the amount of living bacteria the attachment of dead bacteria to cnts modified membrane was also decreased after preozonation keywords preozonation cnts hollow fiber membrane membrane fouling sewage effluent 1 introduction the membrane filtration pressure below 1 2 bar was called low pressure membrane lpm filtration which has attracted wide attention due to its characterizes of low energy requirements and high microbial removal efficiency 1 however the application of lpm in drinking water treatment and wastewater reuse is still restricted by membrane fouling problems wastewater effluent organic matter efom are considered as the major foulants that cause organic fouling of lpm during the wastewater reclamation process which included natural organic matter nom soluble microbial products smp disinfection by products dbps and natural and synthetic trace chemicals soc 2 4 lpm does not effectively remove efom because they are usually smaller than the membrane pores additionally efom can accumulated on the surface of the membrane and inside the pores the accumulated efom act as a good carbon source or so called conditioning film which can further induce the adhesion of bacteria or enhance attachment of bacterial cells to the surface of membranes 5 6 and accelerate the biofouling of lpm adsorption pretreatment with porous carbon material pcm has been investigated to reduce organic fouling of lpm membranes research into powder activated carbon pac as a basic adsorbent which mainly consists of small micropores 2 nm has resulted in conflicting findings some studies indicated that the membrane flux and organic removal ratio were improved with the addition of pac 4 7 10 while other studies suggested a negative impact of pac which was related to its microporous characteristics and the low porosity of the pac cake layer 11 13 recently mesopore and macropore dominated dual templated hierarchical porous carbons hpcs were reported as a effective solution to irreversible fouling of lpm compared to pac during pre treatment of wastewater 14 carbon nanotubes cnts due to their very high surface area to volume have become a novel carbonaceous material and adsorbent 15 17 as the surface of cnts does not contain deeply embedded pores it is easier to undergo desorption than acs 17 19 additionally unlike other carbon materials the inter cnt void can be used in the form of cnt mats or cnt buckypapers 20 21 recently the pre deposition of cnts on membrane surfaces has been proposed as a novel technology in the preparation and modification of lpm for combating membrane fouling investigations showed that the pre deposited cnt layers on membrane surfaces improved the antifouling ability of membrane 20 22 23 gallagher et al further studied the stability of the pre deposited cnt layer and generated stable cnt mats on the inner surface of the hollow fiber membranes which was reported to be stable to backwashing 20 despite this the recoverability of the pre deposited cnt membrane is still a major challenge little related investigation has been performed to evaluate its recoverability especially when used in actual wastewater treatment process the effect of ozonation as a pretreatment of membrane filtration on lpm fouling is complex it has been shown that the substantial structural changed to the organic materials caused the positive effect of pre ozonation on membrane fouling included 1 removal of aromatic rings 2 increase the number of carboxylic functions 3 molecules dissociate into smaller fragments 4 the tendency of humic substances to complex with divalent ions gets higher 24 the negative impact of preozonation on membrane filtration process was also reported to be related to biofouling or reduced permeate quality 25 26 as the smaller fragments of organic materials caused by pre ozonation can be easily utilized as carbon sources by bacterial or they may penetrate through membrane pores the combination of pre ozonation and cnts modification of membrane pre deposition of cnt on membrane surface had a synergistic effect as the cnts had antimicrobial activity 27 28 as well as high adsorption properties 15 17 which were effective in reducing the biofouling and increasing permeate quality in addition pre ozonation has the potential of changing organic substance structures and the distribution of foulants in the pre deposited cnt layer which could help increase the recoverability of the pre deposited cnt until now the hybrid process of pre ozonation and cnts modification on hollow fiber membrane for fouling control has not been studied especially for cyclical flow filtration system used in the actual wastewater treatment to evaluate the possible application of this hybrid process our investigation selected commonly used hollow fiber lpm to filtrate actual sewage effluent the hybrid process was then applied using the normal membrane filtration process including both filtrating and backwashing process the effectiveness of the hybrid process on membrane fouling control was systematically compared with the original unmodified membrane the cnts modified membrane and the preozonation unmodified membrane the impact of operating parameters e g flux backwashing frequency on the hybrid process was further evaluated foulants on membrane surfaces were analyzed with sem to understand the mechanism of the hybrid process on fouling control the adsorption effect of cnts and the interception effect of the pre deposited cnts during modification were further distinguished especially after the preozonation treatment finally the effect of the hybrid process on biofouling control was evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples the real sewage effluent was collected from a pilot scale sequential batch reactor sbr operated by the key laboratory of water pollution control center beijing university of technology and it was stored at 4 c before use the influent of the pilot scale sbr was the domestic sewage discharged from the residential community water qualities were analyzed and are presented in table 1 the milli q water purification system millipore usa was used to obtain ultrapure water 2 2 carbon nanotubes multi walled cnts mwcnts with an outer diameter of 30 50 nm and length 0f 5 20 μm was purchased from beijing nachen tech co ltd china according to the manufacturer the purity of the received mwcnts is 95 2 3 membrane materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membranes and pvdf flat sheet membranes were selected in our experiment as pvdf is a typical organic membrane material the basic properties of pvdf membrane are shown in table 2 in order to make the handmade hollow fiber membrane module we encapsulated the 10 cm in length virgin hollow fiber pvdf membrane in the epoxy resin with one end cut open to make it filter from the inside out dead end filtration the inner surface area of different modules was kept about 50 cm2 once prepared the membrane modules were soaked overnight in milli q water for conditioning before each experiment a new hollow fiber membrane module was used the module and the flat sheet were rinsed with milli q water 2 4 the hybrid pre ozonation and cnts modification membrane filtration experiment the hybrid pre ozonation and cnts modification membrane filtration experiment was performed in a constant flux dead end filtration mode real sewage effluent was continuously flown into the hybrid process in order to make comparison four parallel membrane filtration tests were designed i unmodified membrane ii cnts modified membrane iii preozonation unmodified membrane iv preozonation cnts modified membrane the four tests were carried out under the same operational conditions water flux backwashing time and frequency and a room temperature of 20 1 c the schematic illustration of the hybrid process is shown in fig 1 which includes a sand filtration unit a pre ozonation unit a membrane filtration unit and an automatic recording and control unit 2 4 1 sand filtration unit real sewage effluent was continually supplied to the sand filtration column the filter material was selected from quartz sand with a particle size of 1 2 mm the sand filtration column has a height of 80 cm and a diameter of 5 cm the outflow from the sand filtration column was stored in a high level tank some of the water in the high level tank was directly filtered through the membrane filtration unit while the rest was fed into the preozonation unit 2 4 2 pre ozonation unit the preozonation unit consisted of an ozone generator zr c 5 beijing zhong rui yi jia technology co ltd china a gaseous ozone analyzer an ozone oxidation column and an ozone reaction column the ozone reaction was carried out in a continuous flow ozone contact column ozone was entered into the column through a porous quartz aeration disc loaded 20 mm above the bottom an ozone retention column which had the same size as the ozone contact column was connected to the ozone contact column the dosage of ozone was controlled by regulating the time of ozone supply and monitored by a gaseous ozone analyzer ideal 2000 the residual ozone in the off gas was monitored by an ozone analyzer and further degraded by a destruction unit the consumption of ozone was calculated as the difference between the inlet ozone and the residual ozone in off gas in the experiment ozone concentration was gradually increased from 0 22 mgo3 mgtoc mg of gaseous o3 per mg of dissolved organic matter to 0 41 mgo3 mgtoc then to 0 75 mgo3 mgtoc 2 4 3 membrane filtration unit the membrane filtration unit included four parallel operated tests the hand made hollow fiber membrane modules with an effective filtration area of 50 cm2 were located in a cylinderical column and cleaned by filtering ultrapure water through until the permeate showed zero toc with the cnts modified membrane 15 mg mwnts was suspended in 50 ml ethanol solution with a concentration of 50 v v after sonication for 10 min the cnts suspension was immediately filtered through the cleaned hollow fiber membrane modules by a peristaltic pump with flux of 200 l m2 h a layer of cnts was loaded in the inner surface of hollow fiber membrane which corresponded to cnt loading of 3 g m2 each cnt pre deposited membrane was cleaned with ultrapure water until the permeate showed zero toc then real sewage effluent was filtered from the inside to the outside of the hollow fiber membrane four parallel operated peristaltic pumps were used to drive the feed solution through the membranes with flux range of 35 120 l m2 h the permeate stored in the cylindrical vessel was used as backwashing water each filtration cycle included 30 60 min of filtration and 1 min of backwash during each backwash the membrane module was flushed from outside to inside by the backwashing water at a flux of 120 l m2 h 2 4 4 automatic recording and control unit in the automatic recording and control unit the pressure transducers the peristaltic pumps the ozone generator the gaseous ozone analyzers and the valves were connected to a programmable logic controller plc center and a computer during the operation of the process with the membranes the mass transfer resistance gradually increased to maintain a constant flow rate the trans membrane pressure tmp increased membrane fouling resistance was measured by monitoring tmp changes over time with pressure transducer in the unit the water flux the backwash period and the backwash time the gaseous ozone concentration are automatically recorded and controlled by adjusting the operational parameters the filtration process and backwash process were accomplished additionally the start or stop of ozone generator and peristaltic pump are automatically controlled when the tmp is over the maximum pressure of 0 14 mpa 1 4bar the operation of the peristaltic pump automatically stopped 2 5 water sample analysis permeates from the hybrid system were sampled after every third filtration cycle a total organic carbon analyzer toc l csn shimadzu was used to determine the doc the non purgeable organic carbon npoc detection method was selected and the samples were purified and acidified with carbon free air before measurement then the total carbon in the sample was burned into carbon dioxide which was monitored by the ndir detector potassium hydrogen phthalate stored at 4 c for no more than 1 month was used as the total carbon standard substance humic substances content in water samples was determined by uv254 absorption spectrometry a spectrophotometer unico2100 china was used to made the uv254 measurements 2 6 stability of the loaded mwnts after chemical cleaning the study by gallagher et al showed the loaded mwnts in the hollow fiber membrane had a higher stability 20 the masses of cnt dislodged from the cnt modified membranes after chemical cleaning were analyzed after soaking in 100 ml chemical reagent for several hours and rinsing with 50 ml milli q water the membranes were put back in the system and rinsed with 50 ml back washing water the chemical reagent and milli q water and the back washing water were collected and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to extract the detached cnt according to jiang et al the absorption of cnts appears at 200 300 nm in aqueous solution 29 as ethanol does not absorb light in the range of 200 300 nm the centrifuged cnt was dispersed in 50 ml mixed solution of ethanol and milli q water 50 v v and the cnt concentration was then determined by measuring the average uv absorbance at 266 nm the conducting separate control studies where masses of cnts powders were dispersed in 50 ml ethanol solution was used to determine the correlation between cnts mass concentration mg l and uv absorbance in uv266 2 7 sem and clsm the scanning electron microscope sem s 4300 hitachi japan at 15 kev was used to analyze the images of the inner surfaces and cross sectional of the membranes all specimens were dried for 24 h at 60 before test cross sections were obtained by fracturing the membranes in the presence of liquid nitrogen and then coated their surface with a thin layer of gold to insure charging during sem membrane coupons 0 5 cm2 were cut from the middle of the fouled hollow fiber membrane stained with syto 9 and pi l7012 live dead bacligh bacterial viability kit for the live and dead bacteria cells bacteria with intact cell membranes turn fluorescent green while bacteria with damaged cell membranes turn fluorescent red the background has virtually no fluorescence 1 5 μl of syto 9 and 1 5 μl pi were combined in a microfuge tube and then mixed thoroughly 1 ml phosphate buffered solution kcl 2 7 mmol l nacl 137 mmol l kh2po4 1 4 mmol l na2hpo4 4 3 mmol l was added in the microfuge tube each membrane sample was fixed on a plastic plate with a pin added with mixture solution these were then incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 min unbound stain was carefully rinsed with milli q water subsequently image observation acquisition and analysis of the stained membrane coupons using a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm olympus fv1000 japanese olympus was performed the excitation emission for these dyes are 480 500 nm for syto 9 stain and 490 635 nm for pi image analysis was performed using imagej in this way fluorescence intensity can be determined for the live and dead bacteria cells on the membrane 2 8 cnt pre adsorption and cnts pre deposition comparison studies to differentiate between the adsorption and the interception effect of cnts cnt pre deposition and cnts pre adsorption comparison studies were carried out in constant pressure dead end filtration mode using a 50 ml ultrafiltration cup amicon 8050 millipore usa a flat sheet hydrophilic pvdf membrane table 2 was set up in the ultrafiltration cup every new pvdf membrane was filtered by ultrapure water until the permeate toc of zero was obtained the feed solution was driven through the membrane by nitrogen gas with constant pressure of 0 02 mpa and the flow rate was about 120 l m2 h the weighting data of the permeate was automatically recorded by a computer that was connected to an electronic balance before the filtration tests the feed water was brought to room temperature 20 1 c 2 8 1 cnts pre adsorption doses of cnts 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg were added into 10 ml milliq water and sonicated for 3 min then mixed with 500 ml actual sewage effluent in glass bottle the glass bottles were shaken on a horizontal shaker at a room temperature of 20 c after 5 15 30 45 60 90 120 150 180 min and 4 6 8 10 18 h every 20 ml water was sampled from each glass bottle the water samples were then filtered through polyethersulfone pes membrane pore size of 0 22 μm to separate the cnts toc and uv254 analysis were further conducted the adsorption kinetic tests showed that the adsorption of efom on the cnts reached saturation condition after 6 h next 250 ml actual sewage effluent was mixed with cnts milli q water suspension 10 ml including 4 mg cnt 10 mg cnt and 13 4 mg cnt separately for 6 h to reach equilibrium after cnt pre adsorption treatment the sewage effluent was filtered through a new flat sheet pvdf membrane under constant pressure dead end filtration mode in the same way the weighting data was automatically recorded 2 8 2 cnt pre deposition 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg of cnts corresponding to cnt loading of 3 g m2 7 5 g m2 10 g m2 were sonicated in 10 ml ethanol solution concentration of 50 v v for 3 min after sonication the cnts suspension was filtered through a cleaned pvdf membranes to form a cnts mat each cnt pre deposited membrane was filtered ultrapure water through until the value of toc of the permeate showed zero then the cnt pre deposited membrane was set up in the cell first 10 ml of milli q water was filtered then 250 ml of actual sewage effluent was filtered through the membranes the weighting data were automatically recorded the removal rates of toc and uv254 during filtration by cnt pre deposition membrane were recorded after filtration for 5 15 30 45 and 60 min 20 ml water were sampled from each cell 2 8 3 bench scale ozonation experiment the bench scale ozonation experiment was carried out in a semi continuous flow reactor and the reaction temperature was controlled at 20 1 c ozone was entered into the cylindrical reactor that was made of glass with a volume of 1374 ml through a porous quartz aeration disc loaded 20 mm above the bottom the dosage of ozone was controlled by regulating the time of ozone supply and monitored by a gaseous ozone analyzer ideal 2000 the residual ozone in the off gas was monitored by an ozone analyzer and further degraded by a destruction unit the consumption of ozone was calculated as the difference between the inlet ozone and the residual ozone in off gas each water sample was exposed to ozone for 1 min and the residual ozone was blown off with pure n2 the ozone concentration of 0 41mgo3 mgtoc was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre ozonation and cnts modification on fouling control the real sewage effluent was filtered through the four parallel operated membrane units in dead end mode at a constant flux of 80 l h m2 each filtration cycle of 60 min followed by 1 min backwashing with a permeate effluent rate of 120 l h m2 the net permeate volume was about 98 of the feed water in each cycle membrane fouling was evaluated by measuring the rate of tmp increase p p0 during each filtration cycle where p0 is the initial tmp prior to the filtration and p is the tmp in a specific filtration cycle fig 2 shows the tmp increase measured as a function of the filtration cycle during actual sewage effluent filtration for the four parallel operated units during filtration of real sewage effluent the tmp of the unmodified membrane increased to more than 1 4 bar after filtration periods of 24 cycles in cycles 1 15 the fouling rate was equal to 0 03 bar cycle in cycles 16 24 the fouling rate was equal to 0 09 bar cycle this appears to show that backwashing cannot effectively alleviate fouling for the cnts modified membrane the fouling rate was equal to 0 01 bar cycle in cycles 1 15 in cycles 16 30 fouling rate was increased to 0 03 bar cycle the presence of the cnts layer reduced the fouling rate by about 67 in cycles 1 30 after periods of 37 cycles the tmp of the cnts modified membrane increased above 1 4 bar in view of long term operation it seems that the fouling resistance of the cnts modified membrane cannot be maintained by backwashing the effectiveness of cnts modification on fouling alleviation was lower than that of preozonation after preozonation the fouling rate of the unmodified membrane was 0 013 bar cycle in the cycle of 1 15 corresponding to 0 22 mgo3 doc 0 017 bar cycle in cycles 16 30 corresponding to 0 41 mgo3 doc and 0 027 bar cycle in cycles 31 45 corresponding to 0 75 mgo3 doc preozonation combined with cnts modification appears to have the best alleviation effect on fouling control after preozonation the presence of cnt layer further reduced the fouling rate to 0 007 bar cycle in cycles 1 15 corresponding to 0 22 mgo3 doc 0 01 bar cycle in cycles 16 30 corresponding to 0 41 mgo3 doc and 0 007 bar cycle in cycles 31 45 corresponding to 0 75 mgo3 doc this appears to show that the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification on fouling control is enhanced with increased ozone dosage after preozonation the cnts modified membrane had a prolonged operation time which appears to show that the recoverability of the cnt layer was greatly improved 3 2 pre ozonation and cnts modification on permeate quality as shown in fig 3 the permeates from the four parallel operated membrane units were collected every third filtration cycle for doc and uv254 analysis compared with the unmodified membrane the cnts modified membrane showed little improvement on doc removal and only a small improvement on uv254 removal compared with the unmodified membrane with the increase of filtration cycle the removal rate for doc and uv254 both decreased this seems to show that the presence of cnts layer on the membrane surface did not improve permeate quality yang et al 21 and ajmani et al 23 reported a higher removal rate of humic substances or natural organic matter nom by pre loaded cnts or cnt buckypaper despite this they did not perform related experiments to evaluate the recoverability of the pre loaded cnts as for the actual wastewater treatment process our results appear to show that efom in sewage effluent is much more difficult to remove by the pre loaded cnts on membrane surfaces as reported efom has complex organic characteristics it has more low molecular weight lmw substances as well as hydrophilic fractions which make it difficult to remove compared with nom or humic substances additionally the cnts loading in our experiment 3 g m2 is much lower than that used by yang et al 21 gallagher et al stated that the presence of cnt mats decreased the extent of irreversible alginate fouling of membranes with a pore size of around 0 1um 20 while the concrete removal rate of alginate was not reported after preozonation 0 22 mgo3 mgdoc doc removal rate was slightly increased to 12 with continuous operation removal rate of both doc and uv254 gradually decreased increased ozone dosage did not appear to effectively enhance their removal with the processing of operation the hybrid preozonation and cnts modified membrane was the most effective for doc and uv254 removal also the doc removal can be enhanced with the increase of ozone dosage with an increase of ozone dosage from 0 22 mg o3 mg doc to 0 41 mg o3 mg doc uv254 removal by the hybrid process increased slightly after several filtration cycles removal rate further decreased with the further increasing of ozone dosage from 0 41 mg o3 mg doc to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc doc removal rate increased to about two times that of the unmodified membrane although the uv254 removal rate was not further improved the results appear to demonstrate that preozonation helps to improve the quality of the permeate from cnts modified membranes 3 3 impact of flux on the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification as shown in fig 4 with the gradual increase of the flux from 35 l m2 h to120 l m2 h sewage effluent was filtered through the four parallel operated membrane units with filtration cycle of 60 min followed by 1 min backwashing after filtration for 15 cycles with a flux of 35 l m2 h the tmp of the unmodified membrane increased to 0 31 bar while those of the other three membranes increased slowly and showed little difference when the flux was increased to 80 l m2 h the difference of the fouling rates among the four units became pronounced the tmp of the unmodified membrane continuously increased to 1 01 bar corresponding to a fouling rate of 0 14 bar cycle the presence of the cnts layer restricted the fouling rate to 0 03 bar cycle in cycles 16 to 20 preozonation also restricted the fouling rate to 0 029 bar cycle under a flux of 80 l m2 h for the preozonation and cnts modified membranes the fouling rate was only 0 02 bar cycle when the flux was further increased to 120 l m2 h the fouling rate of the unmodified membrane remained at 0 14 bar cycle with a sharp tmp increase from 1 01 bar to 1 5 bar while the presence of cnts layer did not seem to further effectively restrict fouling the fouling rate of the cnts modified membrane increased to 0 08 bar cycle and its tpm increased from 0 33 bar to 0 71 bar preozonation still kept the fouling rate as around 0 03 bar cycle with increased flux for the preozonation and cnts modified membrane the fouling rate was remained at 0 02 bar cycle with increasing flux the results appear to show that increase of flux did not influence effectiveness of the hybrid preozonation and cnts modification on fouling control this implies that the hybrid pre ozonation and cnts modified membrane unit may have a higher critical flux compared with the other pretreatment unit 3 4 impact of backwash frequency on the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification to explore the impact of backwash frequency on the hybrid effectiveness of pre ozonation and mwnts modification for fouling control real sewage effluent was filtered through the four parallel operated membrane units with the filtration time dropping from 60 min to 30 min combined with 1 min backwashing over 20 cycles as shown in fig 5 increasing the backwash frequency did not reduce the fouling rate of the unmodified membrane the presence of cnts layer decreased the total tmp while the fouling rate kept constant with increasing of backwash frequency for the preozonated sewage effluent there is no difference between the fouling rate of the unmodified and cnts modified membrane in cycles 1 to 10 however in this filtration process both their fouling rate showed clear decrease when the backwash frequency was increased it is thought that a greater proportional foulants could be more easily flushed away with increased backwash frequency especially after ozonation pretreatment this implies that the recoverability of cnts layer may be improved while the backwashing frequency is increased filtration time dropping from 60 min to 30 min 3 5 chemical cleaning on the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification to recover their permeability membranes were removed and performed ex situ cleaning mode naoh at a concentration of 0 2 g l and 0 5 g l naocl at different concentrations 200 600 mg l a mixture of 0 5 g l naoh and 600mgcl l naocl and 10 mg l ozone solution were selected as the chemical reagent as shown in table 3 the soaking time was 2 h or 4 h after chemical cleaning the membranes were placed back in situ the recovery of the membranes was further investigated the level of detached cnt during chemical cleaning process was monitored chemical cleaning on the recoverability of membrane and the detachment of mwnts is shown in fig 6 compared with the other chemical reagent 10 mg l ozone solution did not effectively clean the foulants on membrane surface the membrane s recoverability appears lower the mixture of 0 5 g l naoh and 600 mgcl l naocl was most effective for foulant removal as shown the recoveries of tmp for all four of the membrane units reached to 1 0 after soaking with the mixture of naoh and naocl although the mwnts detachment after cleaning with the mixture of 0 5 g l naoh and 600 mgcl l naocl was slightly higher than the other chemical reagent the whole detachment caused by chemical cleaning was assessed to be lower than 1 5 additionally the mwnts detachment level of the modified membrane under different chemical regent treatments were lower than that without pre ozonation after cleaning with the mixture of 0 5 g l naoh and 600 mgcl l naocl mwnts detachment of the cnts modified membrane unit is 1 4 while cnt detachment in the preozonation cnts modification unit is 0 9 the tmp change of the four membrane units during the following filtration process is shown in fig 7 as shown the initial tmp level decreased back to their initial status after chemical cleaning with 0 5 g l naoh and 600 mgcl l naocl after further filtration cycles tmp level increase were only slightly greater than that before chemical cleaning the results appears to show that ex situ cleaning with the mixture of naoh and naocl may be used as an effective chemical reagent cleaning method for the hybrid process of preozonation and cnts modification 3 6 foulant analysis with sem after filtrating real sewage effluent the inner surfaces of hollow fibers in the four membrane units was analyzed by sem cross sectional sem images of the original unmodified membrane and cnts modified membrane are shown in fig 8 a and b this appears to show that the pre deposition method covered the membrane surface with a thin cnts mat layer several microns thick after filtration as shown in fig 8c a layer of compact foulants formed on the unmodified membrane however for the cnts modified membrane the foulants is very condense and forms an even layer above the cnts layer as fig 8d shown there was an obvious interface between the cnts layer and the foulants the foulants accumulated on the cnts layer and completely blocked it consequently the fouling resistance of the cnts modified membrane cannot be sustained by backwashing in the long term as demonstrated in the membrane filtration experiments fig 2 after the preozonation of sewage effluent the foulants were relatively loosely spread on the unmodified membrane surface with no obvious transformation of thickness being found as shown in fig 8e the effect of preozonation on fouling control may be explained by the increase of porosity of foulants accumulated on the membrane as for the cnts modified membrane preozonation also changed the state of foulants on its surface as shown in fig 8f the obvious interface between the cnts layer and the foulants disappeared after preozonation the foulants were evenly spread through the cnts modified membrane ozonation may transform the structure of organic substances and change their distribution in the cnts layer it is thought that organic foulants with more hydrophilic groups oh cooh formed after ozonation pretreatment could enhance their contact with cnts and enable faster and easier diffusion of organic foulants to the inner pore surface of the cnts layer yang et al had reported a similar phenomenon they reported that the incorporation of hydrophilic functional groups on the purified cnt buckypaper may enable faster and better contact of the humic acids ha solution with the buckypaper surface resulting in a higher water flux and ha removal efficiency 21 preozonation enhanced the diffusion of organic foulants to the inner pore surface of the cnts layer the complexation of organic foulants and the inner pore surface of cnts layer may behave as a complex membrane and effectively exclude the foulants and increase the permeate quality as well additionally the complexation among organic foulants and the inner pore surface of cnts layer may enhance the stability of the cnts layer during backwashing and decrease the detachment of cnts just as fig 6 shown that the cnts modified membrane with preozonation exhibited less detachment of cnts 3 7 adsorption or interception effects evaluation of mwnts and the impact of preozonation to differentiate between the adsorption and the interception effect of cnts cnts pre deposition and cnts pre adsorption comparison studies were performed under constant pressure dead end filtration mode cnts dosage of 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg were selected to make the comparison which corresponds to cnt loadings of 3 g m2 7 5 g m2 10 g m2 after cnts pre adsorption treatment 250 ml real sewage effluent was respectively mixed with 10 ml cnts milli q water suspension for 6 h the mixture was filtered through a new flat sheet pvdf membrane the same dosages of cnts were pre deposited on the membranes and after 10 ml milli q water was filtered 250 ml real sewage effluent was filtered through a new cnts modified pvdf membrane the weighting data was automatically recorded and compared as before 3 7 1 membrane flux as shown in fig 9 compared with the original membrane the flux rate of membranes after cnts pre adsorption and cnts pre deposition both increased during the filtration process this appears to show that the adsorption and interception effects of cnts help to alleviate fouling it should be noted that the interception effect of the cnts layer was more effective compared with its adsorption effect as shown in fig 9a c with the increase of cnts dosage from 4 mg to 10 mg and 13 4 mg the pre deposition of cnts is more effective for fouling control while the diffused cnts seems to aggravate the fouling of original membrane after pre adsorption slightly it would see that preozonation is helpful for the interception effects of cnts layer but it has only a small impact on the adsorption effects of the diffused cnts as shown in fig 9 after preozonation the interception effects of cnts layer were enhanced to a great extent and alleviated membrane fouling 3 7 2 permeate quality fig 10 shows the effect of cnts pre adsorption and cnts pre deposition on permeate doc and uv254 level as can be seen the removal of doc by the interception effect of cnts layer is noticeably higher than that by the diffused cnts under similar cnts dosage during filtration time of 1 h cnts layer consistently showed higher doc removal ratio while the diffused cnts normally needed several hours to reach the adsorption equilibrium as shown in fig 10a c and e under cnts dosage of 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg the average doc removal by cnts adsorption in equilibration is about 5 8 7 8 and 8 4 while the cnts layer could remove around 6 5 8 6 and 9 5 during 1 h of filtration the removal of uv254 is shown in fig 10b d and f compared with doc the uv254 removal efficiency is normally higher than doc after cnts adsorption and cnts layer interception with cnts dosage of 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg the average uv254 removal by cnts adsorption in equilibration is about 9 3 13 9 and 18 6 while the cnts layer could remove around 10 5 14 3 and 19 4 during 1 h of filtration although the fouling removal by cnts modified membrane might derive from both the adsorption and the interception effects of cnts the interception effect of cnts layers appear to play a greater role on foulant removal especially with more limited filtration time after preozonation with cnts dosage of 4 mg 10 mg and 13 4 mg the average doc removal by cnts adsorption in equilibration is about 6 8 8 5 and 9 3 which is about 1 1 1 1 and 1 2 times of the original sewage effluent the uv254 removal is 11 2 17 6 and 24 which are improved to around 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 times of the original sewage effluent after preozonation the cnts layer removed around 6 6 9 9 and 11 5 doc in 1 h of filtration which is around 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 times of the original sewage effluent the cnts layer further removed about 12 8 19 7 and 26 1 uv254 in 1 h of filtration which is around 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 times of original sewage effluent the results appear to show that the interception effects of the cnts layer were increased greatly compared with its adsorption effect especially after pre ozonation 3 8 preozonation and cnts modification on biofouling control at the end of filtration process the inner surfaces of hollow fibers in the four membrane units were analyzed with clsm the images of live cells green color and dead cells red color distribution are displayed in fig 11 the fluorescence intensity of live dead bacterial on the membrane surfaces is shown in table 4 the total fluorescence intensity live dead of the unmodified membrane is 426 while more dead bacteria were present on the membrane surface of the cnts modified membrane the total fluorescence intensity live dead of the cnts modified membrane is as high as 730 the levels of living bacteria on cnts modified membrane were slightly lower than those on the unmodified membrane as reported the mwnts had a relatively lower disinfection capacity compared with swnts 27 however our results appear to show that the cnts layer with its rough surface and mesopore or inter cnt void structures may capture more dead bacteria as a consequence the fouling resistance of cnts modified membranes cannot be sustained and maybe accompanied by lower recoverability as shown in table 4 the total amount of bacteria is reduced by preozonation the total fluorescence intensity live dead of the unmodified membrane reduced to 143 5 and the fluorescence level of living bacteria was reduced from 261 5 to 126 adams et al reported that the bacteria in the water body are effectively destroyed after ozone oxidation 30 as a result the ozone sterilization reduced biological fouling and improved the service life of the membrane units table 4 also shows that very small amounts of dead bacteria were present on the unmodified membrane surface after preozonation the fluorescence intensity of dead bacteria is only 17 5 gunten et al speculated that ozone could change the structure of membrane fouling layer making it difficult for dead bacteria to adhere to the membrane surface 31 after preozonation the presence of cnts layer on membrane surface did further decrease the level of living bacteria from 126 to 75 while it also captured small amounts of dead bacteria the fluorescence intensity of dead bacteria increased from 17 5 to 169 which is much lower than that of the cnts modified membrane 476 5 this may mean the detachment of dead bacteria from the cnts modified membrane increased after preozonation the dead cells captured by preozonation cnts modified membrane did not aggravate fouling as the hybrid process appears to have the best effect on tmp control it is speculated that the increase of tmp is mainly related to the amounts of live bacteria attached to the membrane surface overall the membrane surface of the hybrid process of preozonation and cnts modification had the lowest number of live cells the hybrid preozonation and cnts modification membrane process appears to effectively control biofouling 4 conclusion preozonation and cnts modification appear to alleviate fouling and improve permeate quality without preozonation cnts modified membrane cannot maintain fouling resistance long term after preozonation the fouling rate of the cnts modified membrane was lowered and its recoverability was effectively improved with the increase of ozone dosage the hybrid effectiveness of preozonation and cnts modification on fouling control was enhanced compared with the other pretreatment units the hybrid preozonation and cnts modified membrane unit had a higher critical flux the recoverability of cnts modified membrane in the hybrid process could be improved by having a high frequency of backwashing additionally pre ozonation was helpful for the stability of cnts on membrane surface during chemical cleaning compared with cnts adsorption effect the interception effect of cnts layer pre deposited during membrane modification appeared more effective for increasing permeate quality and alleviating membrane fouling the interception effect of cnts layer was enhanced after preozonation clsm results appear to show that the hybrid preozonation and cnts modification membrane process effectively reduce biofouling after preozonation the presence of cnts layer on membrane surface could decrease the number of living bacteria the attachment of dead bacteria to cnts modified membrane also decreased after preozonation acknowledgement this work was supported by the

sio2 and copper oxide cuo nps incorporated pvdf the nanocomposites pvdf membranes were modified via an ultrathin coating surface layer of a dilute poly vinyl alcohol pva aqueous solution in order to provide sufficient hydrophilicity rejection and a reduced surface roughness the characterizations of pure pvdf pva pvdf pva pvdf al2o3 m1 pva pvdf sio2 m2 pva pvdf cuo m3 and pva pvdf verm m4 membranes were performed using ftir contact angle and sem the membrane performances were evaluated and antifouling properties of the synthesized membranes were examined via numerous fouling washing series using feed solutions of bovine serum albumin bsa such as a potential foulant the highest permeate flux obtained with a modified ultrafiltration technique was in the order of verm 628 7 al2o3 598 sio2 590 cuo 585 l m2 h and the humic acid ha rejection was in order of verm 94 56 al2o3 91 7 sio2 89 cuo 88 3 based on an optimum concentration of 0 2 0 3 0 1 0 2 wt the results clearly showed that the incorporation of verm nps was favorable to the enhancement of antifouling properties membrane performances and the mechanical properties compared to other membranes at the identical condition the synthesized pva pvdf membrane and the nanocomposite membranes were used for the removal of four different types of dyes i e malachite green mg methylene blue mb congo red cr and safranin o so from aqueous solution as examples for organic wastewater treatment keywords ultrafiltration membrane pvdf nanocomposite poly vinyl alcohol surface modification anifouling 1 introduction worldwide water shortage due to water pollution climate change and population growth has now become a critical challenge to solve 1 the increasing global demands for antiseptic water resource and contaminated water treatment thus necessitate the widespread investigation application and improvement of water treatment processes membrane based separation technique demonstrating the excellent energetic purification and treatment technologies has been a key for the water separation to the manufacturing communities the advantages of membrane separation i e simple scale up easy operating conditions compact design environmentally friendliness no phase change high separation efficiency and low energy consumption are considered to be the main factors to the improvement of membrane based procedures in water purification 2 currently ultrafiltration uf is a well recognized membrane technology in separating micro solutes and water from colloids and macromolecules uf membranes are widely used in wastewater treatment water production biotechnology chemicals processing and food processing the polymeric materials are the main constituents in membrane preparation the mostly studied polymeric membranes such as polysulfone polyethersulfone polypropylene and polyvinylidene fluoride are considered to be favorable to the contaminated water treatment moreover polyvinylidene fluorides pvdfs are very interesting polymeric materials which are extensively used in nanofiltration membranes 3 microfiltration 4 and ultrafiltration 5 the pvdf membranes are beneficial owing to their low energy requirement maximum processing capacity high efficiency low cost for large scale production high chemical and or thermal resistance and excellent physical chemical stabilities 6 however membrane fouling that leads to the increase of operating cost and reduction of permeate quality must be mitigated first for their widespread applications numerous studies have been conducted for membrane modification in order to control the fouling by using physical and chemical processes that produce a hydrophobic membrane with hydrophilic possessions generally the physical modification process consists of coating of membrane surface 7 blending with hydrophilic polymers 8 and the chemical modification process consists of grafting and copolymerization with hydrophilic monomers 9 chemical reagent attack 10 and plasma treatment 11 thus the modification of pvdf membranes to control fouling has two main objectives i improvement of membrane hydrophilicity and ii decrease the roughness of the membrane surface the chemical modification of pvdf is normally carried out using the pva polymer via surface coating to enhance chemical and physical stability of the bulk polymer in this study the pva was selected due to its biocompatibility nontoxicity good film forming ability chemical physical stability high hydrophilicity and smooth surface 12 an ultrathin coating layer of pva onto the pvdf membrane was used to decrease the roughness improve the pollutant rejection and enhance the hydrophilicity of the prepared membrane in recent years researchers modified the membrane surface with a combination of carbon clay and metal based nanomaterials 13 to improve membrane performance significantly clay minerals possess excellent elasticity the chemical and physical properties of clay minerals mainly depend on ion exchange capacity structure reactivity of the surface and specific surface area their demand is rising because these materials are cheap abundant and chemically active furthermore clay based nanoparticles can potentially enhance stiffness heat resistance roughness barrier properties thermal stability strength rheological possessions and impact resistance of the desired materials 14 for an example vermiculite is a platy ore that is formed via the hydrothermal modification of mica i e phlogopite and biotite 15 it is a hydrated silicate with the formula mg ca 0 7 mg fe3 al 6 0 al si 8o20 oh 4 8h2o it has high ion exchange capacity lamellar structure known chemical configuration and permitting connections with organic constituents 16 vermiculite is mainly used in environmental and agriculture applications due to its unique chemical configuration that creates negative charges which are neutralized by alkaline earth cations classically magnesium calcium and sodium it is demonstrated that the hydration of the cations of vermiculite causes the accumulation of water molecule layers 17 furthermore vermiculite is porous and applied as an adsorbent substantial for aiming of eliminating the dyes from aqueous solutions 18 recently the vermiculite nanoparticles verm nps have been extensively applied in the field of polymer nanocomposites 19 due to their high performance 20 vermiculite structures are favorable due to the interfacial linkage that affect uniform distribution of clay layers onto the polymer matrix 21 and inhibit restacking into the polymer matrix verm nps can be synthesized by using different methods such as thermal hydrogen peroxide treatment 22 mechanical treatment and treatment with hydrochloric acid moreover potassium persulfate treatment of vermiculite is a cost effective method to synthesize porous nano vermiculite extensive research on the preparation of vermiculite nanocomposites i e polyethylene vermiculite nanocomposite 23 poly vinyl alcohol vermiculite nanocomposites 24 vermiculite amorphous polyamide bio nanocomposites 19 and their applications as catalysts 25 luminescent species 26 adsorbents 27 catalytic supports 28 and ultrafiltration membrane 5 are readily available in the literature the color is the major impurity in the wastewater and has to be eliminated first prior discharging it on land or water bodies wastewater contaminated by dyes is very challenging to treat due to their complex aromatic structure and synthetic origin 29 as dye pollution of wastewater has theatrically enlarged and become an environmental remediation problem different adsorbents to eliminate the toxic contaminants is now a key point of research interest to this point verm nps can play an effective role for dyes removal from wastewater contaminants the verm nps integrated pvdf membrane can be applied to the removal of the malachite green mg methylene blue mb congo red cr and safranin o so from aqueous solution these organic dyes are carcinogenic and toxic in nature and therefore their elimination from the industrial wastes is a foremost environmental problem 30 as they have low biodegradability and chemical stability uf wastewater treatment techniques are the best choice of treating the colored wastewater therefore careful strategies must be taken into consideration to prepare the cost effective polymeric membranes while maintaining their improved physicochemical and fouling properties newly a significant consideration has been paid to the synthesis of nanocomposite membrane for water purification owing to its enhanced outputs containing high water performances while a substantial improvement has been detected in using nanocomposite for water purification a few reports are obtainable to test such nanocomposite membranes in ultrafiltration process to our knowledge there is no report published on polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf created nanocomposite membrane where a comparative study has been occupied not only to incorporate clay based nanomaterial like vermiculite nanoparticles verm nps but also metal oxide nanoparticles containing copper oxide cuo 31 aluminum oxide al2o3 32 and silicon dioxide sio2 33 nps in uf process testing this assumption is essential to compare the performances antifouling properties mechanical properties and for the removal of four different types of dyes using different nanocomposite membranes at identical condition in this work preparation and modification of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf flat sheet membranes were carried out via surface coating with pva and verm nps it is to be noted that the incorporation of verm nps into the matrix was carried out to enhance the performance and obtain the desired characteristics of the pvdf membrane the verm nps incorporated pvdf polymer matrix was also compared with various nanomaterial such as al2o3 sio2 and cuo incorporated pvdf the prepared membranes were characterized using a dynamic mechanical analyzer dma fourier transforms infrared ftir spectroscopy scanning electron microscope sem and contact angle measurement moreover the protein adsorptions of the nanocomposite membranes were examined using bovine serum albumin bsa as a model protein foulant to evaluate fouling resistance of the modified nanocomposite membranes also the membranes were applied to the removal of mg mb cr and so dyes from an artificial aqueous solution to represent organic wastewater 2 experimental 2 1 materials poly vinylidene fluoride powder pvdf 44080 having melting point of 155 160 c

constant stirring until the homogenous solution was obtained then kept overnight for degassing at 25 c fig 1 a diversity of freshly asymmetric nanocomposite pvdf membranes was synthesized using different nanomaterials such as al2o3 sio2 cuo and the synthesized verm nps to prepare the pvdf al2o3 pvdf sio2 pvdf cuo and pvdf verm nanocomposite nc modified membranes an appropriate amount of al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps 0 1 0 5 as a wt of pvdf concentration were mixed with 88 ml of dmf solutions next the mixtures were sonicated in an ultrasonic bath at 30 40 c for at least 1 h to facilitate the dispersion of the al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps into the solvent matrix then the pvdf powder was added heated and stirred for 3 4 hr to have best dispersions of the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix then kept overnight for degassing the resultant polymer solutions were spread by using film applicators with 200 μm space of film thickness then put in a flat and horizontal glass plate the membrane was allowed to dry and the solvent was gradually vaporized in air for 30 s relative humidity 10 60 and immediately immersed into a water bath 25 c as shown in fig 1 after 2 3 min the pvdf

as a dropwise onto a conical flask which containing 100 ml pva polymeric solution for 1 min with vigorous stirring after that the aqueous solution containing pva and ga cross linking agent was added to the active pvdf nc membranes surface for 30 min at 25 c without shaking see fig 1 the pvdf nc membranes have to be fixed in circular glass frames to confirm contact between the reactant solution and the pvdf nc membrane surfaces then the excess coating solution was removed and the membrane was transferred to the oven for 15 min at 50 c to fix the pva layer onto the pvdf nc membranes the resulting pva pvdf pva pvdf al2o3 m1 pva pvdf sio2 m2 pva pvdf cuo m3 and pva pvdf verm m4 nc membranes see table 1 were removed from the glass frames and washed carefully with di water and saved in distilled water for testing and characterization 2 4 membranes characterizations the synthesized nanocomposite improved membranes were characterized via ftir sem mechanical properties and the contact angle ftir analysis of the prepared membranes was supported using a nicolet is50 ftir spectrophotometer model the membranes surface morphology was estimated using sem model quanta feg250 sem fei company to examine membrane cross sections membrane samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen the water contact angle wca was used to control the membrane surface hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity at room temperature using the sessile droplet method on a drop form analyzer dsa25 germany contact angle meter a water drop was placed onto the membrane surface after air dried at 25 c using deionized water with a digital microsyringe at minimum five measurements at different sites were acquired for every membrane and then the average value was calculated and reported the mechanical measurements of the produced membranes were carried out by universal testing apparatuses v4 5a uti dma at 25 c tensile test and elongation were used to calculate young s modulus and strain at fracture of samples at the amount of 10 mm min young s modulus mega pascal mpa was considered using the following equation 1 young s modulus m p a stress strain 2 5 membrane performance assessment for ultrafiltration techniques the nanocomposite ultrafiltration membrane performances was studied using a laboratory dds model lab m20 alfa laval denmark and where the effective membrane area was 18 cm2 the transmembrane pressure was adjusted from 0 05 to 0 35 mpa there are three parameters that were examined pure water flux l m2 h ha rejection were measured using 1 g l and the fouling test using bsa as a model foulant the ha was used as a model organic water pollutant where it was dissolved in di water and the ph of ha was adjusted to 7 with hcl or naoh as required the ha concentration in the feed and in permeate solutions were examined by uv visible spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 450 nm uv visible spectrophotometer unicam model 300 england in addition the antifouling performance of the membranes was determined using bovine serum albumin bsa as a potential protein foulant the measurements of ha rejection and water flux were taken 30 min after filtration to obtain a steady state had been touched the pure water flux and ha rejection r were calculated using the following equations 2 j w v at 3 r 1 cp cf 100 where jw l m2 h is the clean water flux v l is the permeate water volume a m2 is the effective surface membrane area t h is the permeation time r is the ha rejection and cp and cf are the concentrations of permeate and feed solution respectively the synthesized pure pvdf pva pvdf and nanocomposite modified membranes were used for removal different four dyes as malachite green mg methylene blue mb congo red cr and safranin o so from aqueous solutions as a synthetic organic wastewater treatment the continuing dye concentration was examined by uv visible spectrophotometer each dye was determined at the appropriate wavelength of the highest absorbance λ max that is 497 617 530 and 663 nm for cr mg so and mb respectively ph of the dye solutions was accustomed via dilute solutions of hcl and naoh no additional adjustment of ph was made during the experiments 2 6 antifouling assessment the membrane fouling results in disturbing the application of separation performances such as water flux pollutant rejection and increases in the operational price of the water purification process the antifouling possessions was controlled via recording the normalized water fluxes jw through the membranes relative to their initial water fluxes throughout the filtration period using 1 g l of bsa solution as a protein model foulant with an aqueous feed solution at 0 1 mpa temperature of 25 c and scheming the flux recovery after the pure water flushing the water flux was commonly observed during the experimental period when it is stabilize the productivity of membrane fouling could be advanced through flowing multi turns washing series the membranes were be activated by five separation periods where the membrane from the first separation stage was pressurized again for further filtration procedures to expedite the water flux deterioration at that time the filtration experiment for the membrane was on going exhausting a feed solution containing 1 g l of bsa solution for 20 min and then the fouled pvdf membrane was flushed with di water for 15 min after that the water flux of washed membrane jwf was estimated for 15 min then repeating the separation test with 1 g l of bsa solution for 20 min the circulating multi turns washing series were reiterated to control the influence of membrane fouling as exposed by the water flux decline the flux recovery ratio frr was determined with the declining percentage of the clean water flux decrease before and after the separation of bsa solution the synthesized nanocomposite membranes were assessed through the following equation 4 frr jwf jw 100 where frr is the flux recovery ratio jw is the pure water flux before fouling test and jwf is the pure water flux after fouling 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the vermiculite nanoparticles the functional groups of the al2o3 sio2 cuo nps and the synthesized verm nps were examined using the ftir spectrum fig 2 a the spectra of verm nps in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 at room temperature were shown in fig 2a the characteristic water vibration stretching band at 3434 cm 1 and a deformation band at 1646 cm 1 were distinguished in the ir spectra of verm nps the appearance of stretching vibrations band around 3405 3440 cm 1 for oh of water and oh deformation vibrations band of water appears around 1647 cm 1 a stretching band of mg3 oh stretching near 3750 cm 1 was shown the peaks at 818 and 950 cm 1 point to the presence of al o stretching band al in tetrahedral sheet and sio stretching group respectively the si o deformation band shown at 668 cm 1 and the presence of small band around 447 460 cm 1 due to siosi deformation 36 the presence of small peak appears at approximately 620 cm 1 indicating the mg3 oh deformation and has important applications for vem nps the spectroscopic studies confirmed the prepared vem nps the evidence of sio2 nps was proven by the presence of the very strong and a wide band showing at 1061 cm 1 consigned to the si o si asymmetric stretching vibrations 37 conversely the symmetric stretching vibrations of siosi appear at 800 cm 1 and its bending style appears around 441 cm 1 38 the appearance of the weak band at 550 cm 1 is dispensed to sio stretching of the sio2 the broad peak appears between 3000 to 4000 cm 1 is characteristic of the oh group which exists in water the indication of cuo nps were shown via the presence of two bands nearby 532 and 487 cm 1 owing to cu o stretching along the 202 direction and 202 direction respectively the band at 1436 cm 1was attributed to the co bond the band showed at 600 and 3357 cm 1 which can be attributed to the cuo bond vibrations and oh group respectively 39 the peaks appear at 472 and 690 cm 1 indicating the al o stretching and vibration modes respectively the band showed at 1015 cm 1 is related to symmetric bending of aloh 40 the broad band appears around 3434 cm 1 is owing to oh groups which responsible for the higher reactivity of al2o3 nps the synthesized verm nps and the commercial al2o3 sio2 cuo nps were characterized by x ray diffraction and displayed crystalline structures in fig 2b from the xrd shape and resultant appearances of 2θ of the diffraction peaks which confirm the formation of vermiculite nanoparticles the synthesized vermiculite nps were characterized via x ray diffraction and showed crystalline structures the x ray pattern of vermiculite nps is shown in fig 2b the following x ray pattern consists of 11 peak diffractions at 2θ equal to 18 23 26 7 34 4 35 7 41 45 55 60 65 and 69 from the xrd configuration and resultant characteristics of 2θ of the diffraction peaks that confirm and match with the standard data sheets jcpds cards 01 076 0847 and 00 016 0613 41 which reported by the joint committee on powder diffraction that approves the formation of verm nps the average particle size used for the nanoparticle powders was estimated by debye scherer s equation 42 5 d kλ β cos θ where d is the crystallite diameter of verm nps k is the scherer constant k 0 89 λ is the wavelength of the x ray 1 54 a β is the whole width at half maximum width of the diffraction peak in radiance and θ is the maximum strength of the diffraction angle the crystallite size of the verm nps was determined to be between 51 and 116 5 nm with an average size of 81 5 nm the x ray diffraction procedures of all examined ingredients showed a high amount of crystallinity from the xrd pattern it is observed that the verm nps are crystalline in nature this confirms the crystalline structure of the verm nps which can be used for adsorption procedures and membrane performances in ultrafiltration techniques 5 from the xrd pattern it is observed that the synthesized verm nps has the essential property of being able to disperse in organic polymers 43 the x ray diffraction method was carried out on the commercial al2o3 sio2 cuo nps the crystalline al2o3 cuo and the amorphous sio2 nps were proven by the residue x ray diffraction study and the deflection peaks are shown in fig 2b it was shown that the resultant characteristics of cuo nps consist of 12 peak diffractions at 2θ equal to 33 36 39 49 53 59 62 66 68 72 75 and 83 which confirms and matches with the standard international diffraction data sheets card no 41 0254 and the d spacing values were well matched with the informed values in the card 44 it was shown that the resultant characteristics of al2o3 nps consists of 9 peak diffractions at 2θ equal to 19 21 28 38 41 46 53 67 and 79 which confirms and consistent with the standard joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds value card no79 1558 45 xrd diffraction of al2o3nps exhibited that the al2o3 was in crystal symmetry x ray diffraction examination of sio2 nps is shown in fig 2b it was revealed that the resultant characteristics of sio2 nps are completely amorphous in nature with one peak at 2θ equal to 24 3 and do not display any sharp diffraction peaks which consistent with the standard diffraction data sheets card 850335 46 from the xrd pattern it is observed that the sio2 nps is having hexagonal crystal structure and showed amorphous in nature which can be improved the membrane adsorption efficiency fig 2c presents a histogram of the results obtained from the measurements of the particle size distribution psd of the synthesized verm nps it is observable that the average and standard deviation values of the verm nps particle size were 86 2 nm and 90 1 nm 64 9 which was in agreement with the former dimensions attained from the xrd outcome for the formation of verm nps 3 2 characterization of the synthesized membranes 3 2 1 ftir analysis to enhance the separation performances and hydrophilicity of pvdf membranes surface adjustment of pvdf membranes via coating with pva and incorporation of four different nanomaterials such as al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps were studied the ftir spectra were employed to deliver information about the chemical structure of all modified membranes the ftir spectra of the pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 are shown in fig 3 the ftir peaks reveal that the appearance of four bands at 489 610 795 and 945 cm 1 which are attributed to cf2 wagging flexible and ch2 twisting which described non polar pvdf 47 the strong absorption bands at 1170 and 1405 cm 1 are characteristics of fcf and hch respectively which found in pure pvdf membrane the skeletal vibration of cc bond showed at 877 cm 1 48 the weak absorption band 3421 cm 1 was attributed to oh vibrations as shown in fig 3 the ftir spectra of the pva pvdf structured membranes indicate the presence of the peak at 1653 cm 1 shows that the carbonyl co group was successfully presented into pva pvdf membrane and 2923 cm 1 which responsible for the aliphatic ch bond for appropriate comparison after the membrane surface modification the ratio of the band intensity of 1402 cm 1 that is coh fcf the decrease which mainly due to the change of hydroxyl groups which confirmed that the pva chain backbone structure was formed meanwhile the ftir spectra of the pva pvdf and the nanocomposite modified pvdf membranes reveals shows that the presence of a strong peak at 3000 3500 cm 1 with a higher intensity which is related with the hydroxyl group ho 49 this was confirming once pvdf was interacted with a strong alkali solution and it s de fluorination as supplemented via an oxidizing reaction it is expected that the main reason for decreasing the wca after the modification of pvdf membrane is the creation of the hydroxyl ho groups which can advance the hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces this is mostly owing to the chemical compositions of the modified membranes it is observable that all synthesized membranes confined very alike functional groups owing to the existence of similar peaks this is attributed to the membranes chemical structures the incorporated nanoparticles have changed oxy functional groups that might be intersected with actual pva pvdf membranes deficiency of their exclusive bands could also owe to the exhausting small concentration used which might be condensed below pva pvdf polymer matrix 50 compared with the pure pvdf membrane the pva pvdf and pva pvdf nc modified membranes have a wider peak at 3400 cm 1 due to the hydroxyl group from al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nanoparticles additionally the entrance of oh group might contribute to the improvement of membrane surface hydrophilicity caused by the hydrophilic nature of the nanoparticles 3 2 2 water contact angle wca the water contact angle θ wca is the most ordinary factor used to illustrate the hydrophilicity of membrane surfaces a lower wca value demonstrates a hydrophilic surface while a higher wca value indicating a hydrophobic surface the wca increase with increasing the pva content over the pvdf membrane surfaces and decrease when compared with the pure pvdf membrane fig 4 a the wca reaches 67 7 for 1 5 wt of pva and 82 55 for pure pvdf respectively which indicating higher hydrophilicity of pva pvdf modified membrane the higher the hydrophilicity of pva pvdf membrane surface may be owing to the higher of oxygen content groups on pva pvdf membrane surface which responsible for the attainment of advanced membrane hydrophilicity further increasing the pva monomer concentration more than 1 5 wt causes an increase in water contact angle with additional pva monomer content which may be due to the aggregation of pva layer on the pvdf membrane surfaces wherever intense polymerization procedures create a dense membrane layer with low porosity it is obvious that the pva layer is aggregated in high content of the pva which subsequently plugged the pores of the resulting membranes as well as decreases the available hydroxyl groups and increase the water contact angle 12 in fig 4b the mean water contact angles for m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc membranes were 62 45 2 5 64 7 5 2 8 66 42 2 and 57 25 1 9 respectively indicating they possess hydrophilic surfaces as it is clearly observed from fig 4b the addition of al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps reduced the contact angle of pvdf nc membranes this was due to oxide forms of these nanoparticles that might act as active materials on the pvdf membrane surface and form hydrogen bonds with water the mean wca were gotten via using verm 0 2 al2o3 0 3 sio2 0 1 cuo 0 2 wt of the pvdf concentration compared by the integration of different metal oxide nps the wca for verm is slightly more hydrophilic than al2o3 sio2 and cuo 51 this is due to the water affinity and higher density of electrostatic charge on the surface of verm nps 5 it is concluded from the fig 4b that the wca of nanocomposite modified pva pvdf membranes decreased when compared to the pure pvdf membrane consequently indicating that the hydrophilicity of pvdf membrane improves after nano alkali modification and the incorporation of these nanoparticles to the polymer matrix caused a higher affinity for h2o than pure pvdf membrane this is mostly owing to the hydrophilic nature of the nanoparticles that also contributed to creating membrane surface more hydrophilic this improvement mainly attributable to the interaction between the pvdf polymer matrix and strong base which can initiate hydrophilic polar groups such as carboxyl groups cooh and hydroxide radical ho formed owing to the grafting of pva which retains a less negative charge on the membrane surface that enhances the hydrophilicity of the pvdf membrane 52 the incorporation of verm nps into membrane matrix improved the roughness of the membranes and increased the surface energy which allows water to easily spread onto the surface and enhances the capability of the hydrophilic pores to imbibe water through capillary effects thus enhanced the wettability of the modified membrane 5 this observation mainly due to the occurrence of active hydrophilic functional groups on the membranes surfaces which also helps to improve the antifouling properties this is owing to the polarity of a hydroxyl group oh and oxygen element from the surface of metal oxide that is able to form interaction with water during hydrogen bonding and van der waal s force 53 3 2 3 mechanical properties the mechanical properties of pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes are shown in table 2 and the stress strain curves are shown in fig 5 these properties contain tensile strength elongation at break and the calculated young modulus of the membranes the pva pvdf and modified nc membranes demonstrate enhanced elongation break tensile strength mpa and improved young s modulus values when compared to the pure pvdf membrane the enhancement in tensile strength and young s modulus values for the pva pvdf and modified nc membranes with respect to wards the pure pvdf membrane is mostly because of the cross linked complex structure in the alkyl group which improved strength and flexibility of the nc membranes these behaviors demonstrate that adding the suitable amount of nano materials such as al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps into pvdf polymer matrix can enhance the membranes mechanical possessions attributed to cross linking property to tolerate the stress of the membrane load al2o3 and sio2 nps could act as a cross linking point to link the polymeric chains and enhance the rigidity of polymeric chains 52 and enhance the rigidity toughness of polymeric chains and thus generate an enhancement in the tensile strength and elongation at break the development of the tensile strength due to the incorporation of cuo nps to the polymer matrix due to the formation of nanocomposites between cuo and pvdf blend matrix the increment in mechanical properties are rational because cuo nps can act as plasticizer 54 the maximum elongation and young s modulus was improved via incorporation of the verm nps with pvdf membrane due to the ternary molecular structure of vermiculite in addition to the compatibility among the vermiculite and pvdf polymer matrix the addition of small amounts of verm nps to the pvdf polymer matrix causes a uniform dispersion of verm nps and showed less agglomeration in the membrane matrix so that it has interacted muscularly forming hydrogen bonding which reinforced membrane mechanical properties this scattering provides superior uniform stress distribution the condensed making of stress concentration centers and consequently improves the mechanical properties of the membrane 55 the mechanical possessions of the membrane depend mostly on the membrane microstructure and intermolecular forces operating along the membrane polymer chain as was reported the verm nps enhanced the mechanical properties of polyethylene vermiculite nanocomposites 56 the above results were well in agreement with ftir and sem which specify that the pva pvdf verm m4 nc membranes also have good mechanical stability due to the interaction between the organic and inorganic structures 3 2 4 morphology analysis of membranes the sem images of the surface and cross section of the pure pvdf pva pvdf pva pvdf al2o3 m1 pva pvdf sio2 m2 pva pvdf cuo m3 and pva pvdf verm m4 nc modified membranes were revealed in figs 6 and 7 the surface sem images with three different magnifications of pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes at a scale of 5 10 and 50 μm are revealed in fig 6 the sem images also exhibited that m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes had more surface pore density than pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes these images obviously showed that all membranes display an asymmetric construction with a slight change in membrane surface morphology after incorporation of al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps and the pores of the membrane became well dispersed all over the membrane surface and this possibly led to improving the membranes performances especially with the pva pvdf verm nc membrane the morphologies of the top surface of nc modified membrane are more porous roughness with microvoids when compared with the pure pvdf membrane where it has a smooth surface without noticeable microvoids the morphology of the top surface of pva pvdf verm m4 nc modified membrane showed an improvement of the network porous structure of the membrane surface after incorporation of verm nps with pvdf polymer matrix through detecting the cross section sem images of the pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes it is obvious that the nature of nanoparticles considerably affected the morphology of the membrane fig 7 the cross section of the pure pvdf membrane exhibited the finger like pores below the top surface as the surface modification with pva occurred the number of the finger like pores declines this is due to the modification with a hydrophilic pva polymer 57 all the modified membranes offered characteristically asymmetric structure with macrovoid structure and pore finger like structure in the sub layer these results matched with the observation in fig 6 the cross sectional morphologies of all membranes reveal a network porous structure these results were well in contract with ftir and wca which specify that the pva pvdf verm m4 nc membranes also have good network porous structure due to the interaction among the organic and inorganic constituents 3 3 performances assessments the main aim of this research is to present a novel functional group through surface coating procedures as well as embedding the four different nanomaterials such as al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps this combination leads to improved membrane performance for water purification fig 8 a displays the effect of the different pva concentration 1 5 3 5 7 and 10 wt solutions on the water flux and rejection using 1 g l humic acid ha as a feed solution was used to evaluate its rejection at an applied pressure of 0 15 mpa at 25 c the pvdf membrane surface coating using pva monomer showed enhanced water flux jw and ha removal using 1 5 wt of pva monomer concentrations which showed comparable water flux and ha rejection when compared to pure pvdf membrane the ha elimination reaches 80 9 and 85 5 and the jw reaches 551 and 576 l m2 h at 0 15 mpa for pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes respectively enhanced water flux and ha rejection may be due to improving the hydrophilicity and causes negatively charged functional group onto the membrane surfaces 58 additional increasing the pva monomer concentration further than 1 5 wt causes a decline in water flux and ha elimination with further pva monomer content which can be attributed to pva monomer aggregation on the pvdf membrane surfaces wherever intense polymerization processes produce a dense membrane layer with low porosity it is obvious that the pva layer is aggregated in high content of the pva which subsequently decreases the available hydroxyl groups and reduce the flux furthermore some pores of the membrane surfaces could be plugged possessing to the pva aggregation resulting in water flux and ha rejection decline the effect of four different nanoparticles content on the pva pvdf membrane performances and the outcomes are represented in fig 8b e and table 3 firstly all parameters were optimized containing the structures and the operating condition of pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes as deliberated in details in the schematic diagram fig 1 the pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes performances were maximized exclusively in terms of enhancing the water flux and rejection using different concentrations of al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps at optimized circumstances different concentrations of al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps were incorporated onto pvdf polymer matrix where these concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 wt related to pvdf concentration i e 12 wt all synthesized pva pvdf al2o3 m1 pva pvdf sio2 m2 pva pvdf cuo m3 and pva pvdf verm m4 nc modified membranes were estimated in terms of water flux and ha rejection at 0 15 mpa at 25 c as revealed in fig 8b e and table 3 it can be observed that all nc modified pva pvdf membranes exhibited a significant enhancement in performances when compared to the pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes the best concentration of the al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps were 0 3 0 1 0 2 and 0 2 respectively the improvement of water flux was consistent with increasing the al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps concentrations this is attributed to enhancing the hydrophilicity of pva pvdf membranes conversely the water flux decrease using additional al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps concentrations i e 0 3 wt this may be ascribed to aggregation of the nanoparticles and a thicker membrane structure was formed firstly it might be observed that pva pvdf al2o3 nc membrane showed a significant increase in the water flux and ha rejection until the al2o3 nps reaches 0 3 wt and the membrane separation performances decrease with further al2o3 nps content fig 8b and table 3 it was detected that after incorporation of al2o3 nps to the pvdf polymer matrix the water flux and ha rejection was enhanced due to the homogeneity hydrophilic nature of al2o3 nps in the membrane structure in addition to the membrane surface roughness and pore structure due to the introduction of polar functional groups to the membrane polymer chain 59 secondly varied pvdf sio2 membranes were synthesized with various sio2 concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 wt as exposed in fig 8c and table 3 it is obvious that the water flux and the ha rejection increase up to sio2 concentration reach 0 1 wt when compared to pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes it might be attributable to the hydrophilic nature of sio2 nps and uniformity of its presence in the pvdf polymer matrix conversely further increasing of sio2 i e at 0 2 wt a declining in the water flux and ha rejection was noticed this mainly due to the aggregation of sio2 nps content which blocks the movement of the polymer matrix and pores blocking took place 60 thirdly cuo nps was used with different concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 wt as presented in fig 8d and table 3 it can be seen that there was a slight increase in the pva pvdf cuo nc membrane performances by using 0 1 0 2 wt of cuo nps and start to decrease via further cuo nps concentration up to 0 2 wt the enhanced behavior due to the presence of the hydroxyl group also established the same behavior of the mixed matrix membranes using hydrophilic cuo nps however pore blocking of membrane surface might be the result of the higher contents of cuo nps and the aggregation might occur and interrupt the polymer chain filling finally the effect of verm nps concentration on water flux and ha rejection of pva pvdf membranes were considered using verm concentrations of 0 1 0 5 wt as presented in fig 8e and table 3 it was noticeable that the best membrane performances were achieved using 0 2 wt of verm nps concentration when the concentration of verm raises the filler density on the surface increases therefore the hydrophilicity of the pva pvdf membranes as well as the roughness and the free energy of the membranes were improved due to the combination of verm nps into the membrane matrix the verm nps is a hydrophilic substance and improved the membrane performances for water separation these results were in agreement with the previous work on using verm nps with polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane matrix 5 the membranes own jw and ha solute rejection values in the following order m4 m1 m2 m3 nc membranes it is observable that the nanoparticles are aggregated with the content of the different nanoparticles attributed to the specific surface decline of the al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps which consequently decreases the presented hydroxyl oh groups which decline the water flux furthermore some pores of the membranes might be plugged possessing to the nanoparticles aggregation causing a decline in water flux 61 fig 9 demonstrates the pure water permeability for pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 membranes under different applied pressure 0 05 to 0 35 mpa the pure water permeability increased proportionally with the trans membrane pressure all the nanocomposite membranes revealed that the pure water permeability higher than the original pvdf and pva pvdf membranes the membranes own pure water permeability values in the following order m4 1554 m1 1490 m2 1420 m3 1305 pva pvdf 1189 pure pvdf 1080 l m2 h membranes using 0 35 mpa it is concluded that the incorporation of the synthesized verm nps onto the pva pvdf polymer matrix improved the pure water permeability of the membrane the water permeability enhancement of verm nps composite membranes was achieved due to hydrophilic nature of the verm nps which promotes the permeability and invites water molecules that go through the membrane matrix as well as enhance water flux in addition to enhanced the mechanical possessions of the membrane 62 consequently the enhanced in the water permeability of the pva pvdf verm nc membrane might be elucidated from the following features firstly the occurrence of hydrophilic pva and verm nps improved the hydrophilicity of membranes leading to additional promising condition for water permeation secondly the improved surface pore size and the pore density in membrane structure were favorable to develop the water flux which was confirmed via sem and ftir results subsequently the favorable membrane structure and enhanced hydrophilicity lead to higher water flux of the nano modified membranes than that of pure pvdf membrane furthermore the surface roughness of the pva pvdf and nanocomposite membranes increased by incorporation of al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps into the membrane matrix which spreading out the h2o passage and accordingly causes an improvement in water flux the obtained data suggested that the incorporation of the vermiculite nps with the organic moieties improved the membrane structure due to the vermiculite nps monolayer structure which consists of sio2 40 08 al2o3 12 35 fe2o3 6 83 tio2 1 43 cao 2 32 mgo 18 74 na2o 3 37 k2o 2 86 41 vermiculite nps has a better physical connection with the polymer part due to its higher specific surface area so it has been chosen as the inorganic part of the mixed matrix membrane 3 4 antifouling performance to estimate the antifouling properties of the pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes a compaction test with di water and then multi turns washing series of fouling washing ultrafiltration were carried out using 1 g l bsa as a model protein foulant with an aqueous feed solution at 0 1 mpa at 25 c ph 7 and calculating the flux recovery after the pure water flushing the results are observed in fig 10 a it is found that the initial fluxes for the nano modified membranes were higher than the initial water fluxes of pure pvdf as in order m4 m1 m2 m3 pva pvdf pure pvdf membrane afterward all the fouling washing experimental period overall flux losses for all nano modified membranes and pva pvdf were slightly lower when compared with the pure pvdf membrane pva pvdf membrane with 0 2 wt verm nps revealed the highest frr with a final water flux value of 528 l m2 h about 65 of the initial value this was indicates that the verm nps embedded membrane exhibit an enhancement in pvdf membrane hydrophilicity verm nps which may possibly hinder the solute deposition and adsorption on the membrane matrix 63 after introducing the pva as a coating surface as well as incorporation of hydrophilic nanoparticles to the pvdf membrane thus the membrane became more hydrophilic so the membrane fouling was delayed due to a higher hydrophilicity affected by the joined effect of the incorporated al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps onto the polymer matrix and improvement of the membrane surfaces with the hydrophilic pva ultrathin layer the nanoparticles additives had a high attraction to polar constituents as h2o that led to a higher permeability for pure water thus a high retention to hydrophobic composites as the macromolecules and proteins 64 fig 10b described the normalized flux ratio nfr of the pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes the nfr was used to detect the fouling degree of all the synthesized membranes and it was evaluated against the filtration time 3 5 h it was noticed that pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes revealed less fouling affinity i e higher nfr values when compared to the pure pvdf membrane that is a pointer of the achievement in the modification in the polymer matrix and in the membrane surface possessions these results might be relatively leads to their high water fluxes and their hydrophilic surface nature that making the foulant hard to adsorb that reduced the hydrophobic interaction between the membrane surface and the protein foulants m4 exhibited the highest nfr values 81 5 which demonstrate the lowest total flux loss during the ultrafiltration process in comparison with the other modified membranes the results showed that the embedding of verm nps into pva pvdf membrane might be an operative way for better bsa retention and decrease the membrane fouling compared with the pure pvdf membrane the difference between the retention of bsa of different nanomodified membranes that may depend on the pore blockage conversely the following gradual deterioration might be due to the accumulation of the organic foulant on the membrane surface 4 application for removal efficiency the presently used cationic and anionic synthetic dyes such as congo red cr malachite green oxalate mg safranin o so and methylene blue mb are highly water soluble azo or anthraquinone based reactive dyes that must be removed from wastewater completely these dyes were selected based on their shape charges and molecular weight most of these dyes are potentially carcinogenic and toxic in nature and the azo bonds existing in these compounds are hardy to break down the selected dyes are responsible for the growing of these composites in the environment therefore their elimination from the industrial effluents is a major environmental challenge the selected membranes were applied in the treatment of four different organic dyes as examples for wastewater pollutants and the chemical characteristics for the selected dyes were shown in table 4 the removal of pollutants from an aqueous solution by the pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes to detect the rejection efficiency of the selected dyes was shown in fig 11 a d it is observed that the water flux and the removal efficiency of cr mb mg and so organic dyes were in order m4 m1 m2 m3 pva pvdf pure pvdf membrane and m4 m1 m3 m2 pva pvdf pure pvdf membrane respectively it is found that the rejection of mb cr mg so for all the selected membranes these results might be attributed to the importance of dyes molecular charge that plays an important role in the ultrafiltration process smaller dye molecules mb and so exhibit identical separation styles both mb and so passed through the modified membranes however linear mb was rejected higher than the globular so the molecular size and the chemical origin of natural organic matter are valuable tools evaluating their effects on the performances of wastewater treatment organizations the separation efficiency depends not only on the charges on the membrane surfaces and the natural organic matter charge that plays a significant role in the rejection process but also molecule shape becomes an essential factor where the globular structure is more favorable than the linear one 65 the small charged molecules as dyes do not pass through the membrane i e have higher rejection value when compared to larger uncharged molecules the cr and mg have the same trend for rejection due to the higher molecular weight of their chemical structure where the doubly charged dyes have a higher retention than the mono charged one it is estimated that highly charged dyes might be further retention via the negatively charged membrane surfaces than the fewer charged dyes as a result of the repulsion of similar charges 66 from the result it was found that the rejection of mb and cr was higher than the mg and so this mainly attributed to the linear shape is hinder to pore passage compared to globular molecular shape 67 because of various opportunities of stretched linear shape orientation numerous linear particles are rejected or hindered through the separation due to suboptimal pore configuration and the repulsion forces among the negatively charged membrane surfaces and the negatively charged dye that obstructs the dye flux via membrane pores this results might be due to hydrophobic and dipolar interactions between membranes and solutes 68 5 conclusions in this work the pvdf membranes were successfully incorporated with the vermiculite nps via phase inversion method and compared with inorganic al2o3 sio2 and cuo nps incorporated pvdf the incorporation of verm 0 2 al2o3 0 3 sio2 0 1 and cuo 0 2 wt nps improved the permeate flux and rejection rate of pvdf membranes the prepared membranes were modified via surface coating of pva layer using interfacial crosslinking method the nanocomposite modified membranes showed enhanced flux solute rejection mechanical properties and antifouling properties and dyes removal efficiency when compared with the pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes among the nanocomposite membranes pva pvdf verm 0 2 wt showed highest flux of 628 7 l m2 h and ha rejection of 94 56 the results of antifouling of bsa multi series test showed that pva pvdf verm membrane with its surface roughness showed improved antifouling resistance thus pva pvdf verm nc membrane promises to be the best candidate in terms of quality and cost when compared to all prepared membranes for its potential application in wastewater treatment 
14326,vermiculite nanoparticles verm nps incorporated polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf flat sheet membrane was prepared using phase inversion method and compared with aluminum oxide al2o3 silicon dioxide sio2 and copper oxide cuo nps incorporated pvdf the nanocomposites pvdf membranes were modified via an ultrathin coating surface layer of a dilute poly vinyl alcohol pva aqueous solution in order to provide sufficient hydrophilicity rejection and a reduced surface roughness the characterizations of pure pvdf pva pvdf pva pvdf al2o3 m1 pva pvdf sio2 m2 pva pvdf cuo m3 and pva pvdf verm m4 membranes were performed using ftir contact angle and sem the membrane performances were evaluated and antifouling properties of the synthesized membranes were examined via numerous fouling washing series using feed solutions of bovine serum albumin bsa such as a potential foulant the highest permeate flux obtained with a modified ultrafiltration technique was in the order of verm 628 7 al2o3 598 sio2 590 cuo 585 l m2 h and the humic acid ha rejection was in order of verm 94 56 al2o3 91 7 sio2 89 cuo 88 3 based on an optimum concentration of 0 2 0 3 0 1 0 2 wt the results clearly showed that the incorporation of verm nps was favorable to the enhancement of antifouling properties membrane performances and the mechanical properties compared to other membranes at the identical condition the synthesized pva pvdf membrane and the nanocomposite membranes were used for the removal of four different types of dyes i e malachite green mg methylene blue mb congo red cr and safranin o so from aqueous solution as examples for organic wastewater treatment keywords ultrafiltration membrane pvdf nanocomposite poly vinyl alcohol surface modification anifouling 1 introduction worldwide water shortage due to water pollution climate change and population growth has now become a critical challenge to solve 1 the increasing global demands for antiseptic water resource and contaminated water treatment thus necessitate the widespread investigation application and improvement of water treatment processes membrane based separation technique demonstrating the excellent energetic purification and treatment technologies has been a key for the water separation to the manufacturing communities the advantages of membrane separation i e simple scale up easy operating conditions compact design environmentally friendliness no phase change high separation efficiency and low energy consumption are considered to be the main factors to the improvement of membrane based procedures in water purification 2 currently ultrafiltration uf is a well recognized membrane technology in separating micro solutes and water from colloids and macromolecules uf membranes are widely used in wastewater treatment water production biotechnology chemicals processing and food processing the polymeric materials are the main constituents in membrane preparation the mostly studied polymeric membranes such as polysulfone polyethersulfone polypropylene and polyvinylidene fluoride are considered to be favorable to the contaminated water treatment moreover polyvinylidene fluorides pvdfs are very interesting polymeric materials which are extensively used in nanofiltration membranes 3 microfiltration 4 and ultrafiltration 5 the pvdf membranes are beneficial owing to their low energy requirement maximum processing capacity high efficiency low cost for large scale production high chemical and or thermal resistance and excellent physical chemical stabilities 6 however membrane fouling that leads to the increase of operating cost and reduction of permeate quality must be mitigated first for their widespread applications numerous studies have been conducted for membrane modification in order to control the fouling by using physical and chemical processes that produce a hydrophobic membrane with hydrophilic possessions generally the physical modification process consists of coating of membrane surface 7 blending with hydrophilic polymers 8 and the chemical modification process consists of grafting and copolymerization with hydrophilic monomers 9 chemical reagent attack 10 and plasma treatment 11 thus the modification of pvdf membranes to control fouling has two main objectives i improvement of membrane hydrophilicity and ii decrease the roughness of the membrane surface the chemical modification of pvdf is normally carried out using the pva polymer via surface coating to enhance chemical and physical stability of the bulk polymer in this study the pva was selected due to its biocompatibility nontoxicity good film forming ability chemical physical stability high hydrophilicity and smooth surface 12 an ultrathin coating layer of pva onto the pvdf membrane was used to decrease the roughness improve the pollutant rejection and enhance the hydrophilicity of the prepared membrane in recent years researchers modified the membrane surface with a combination of carbon clay and metal based nanomaterials 13 to improve membrane performance significantly clay minerals possess excellent elasticity the chemical and physical properties of clay minerals mainly depend on ion exchange capacity structure reactivity of the surface and specific surface area their demand is rising because these materials are cheap abundant and chemically active furthermore clay based nanoparticles can potentially enhance stiffness heat resistance roughness barrier properties thermal stability strength rheological possessions and impact resistance of the desired materials 14 for an example vermiculite is a platy ore that is formed via the hydrothermal modification of mica i e phlogopite and biotite 15 it is a hydrated silicate with the formula mg ca 0 7 mg fe3 al 6 0 al si 8o20 oh 4 8h2o it has high ion exchange capacity lamellar structure known chemical configuration and permitting connections with organic constituents 16 vermiculite is mainly used in environmental and agriculture applications due to its unique chemical configuration that creates negative charges which are neutralized by alkaline earth cations classically magnesium calcium and sodium it is demonstrated that the hydration of the cations of vermiculite causes the accumulation of water molecule layers 17 furthermore vermiculite is porous and applied as an adsorbent substantial for aiming of eliminating the dyes from aqueous solutions 18 recently the vermiculite nanoparticles verm nps have been extensively applied in the field of polymer nanocomposites 19 due to their high performance 20 vermiculite structures are favorable due to the interfacial linkage that affect uniform distribution of clay layers onto the polymer matrix 21 and inhibit restacking into the polymer matrix verm nps can be synthesized by using different methods such as thermal hydrogen peroxide treatment 22 mechanical treatment and treatment with hydrochloric acid moreover potassium persulfate treatment of vermiculite is a cost effective method to synthesize porous nano vermiculite extensive research on the preparation of vermiculite nanocomposites i e polyethylene vermiculite nanocomposite 23 poly vinyl alcohol vermiculite nanocomposites 24 vermiculite amorphous polyamide bio nanocomposites 19 and their applications as catalysts 25 luminescent species 26 adsorbents 27 catalytic supports 28 and ultrafiltration membrane 5 are readily available in the literature the color is the major impurity in the wastewater and has to be eliminated first prior discharging it on land or water bodies wastewater contaminated by dyes is very challenging to treat due to their complex aromatic structure and synthetic origin 29 as dye pollution of wastewater has theatrically enlarged and become an environmental remediation problem different adsorbents to eliminate the toxic contaminants is now a key point of research interest to this point verm nps can play an effective role for dyes removal from wastewater contaminants the verm nps integrated pvdf membrane can be applied to the removal of the malachite green mg methylene blue mb congo red cr and safranin o so from aqueous solution these organic dyes are carcinogenic and toxic in nature and therefore their elimination from the industrial wastes is a foremost environmental problem 30 as they have low biodegradability and chemical stability uf wastewater treatment techniques are the best choice of treating the colored wastewater therefore careful strategies must be taken into consideration to prepare the cost effective polymeric membranes while maintaining their improved physicochemical and fouling properties newly a significant consideration has been paid to the synthesis of nanocomposite membrane for water purification owing to its enhanced outputs containing high water performances while a substantial improvement has been detected in using nanocomposite for water purification a few reports are

to the active pvdf nc membranes surface for 30 min at 25 c without shaking see fig 1 the pvdf nc membranes have to be fixed in circular glass frames to confirm contact between the reactant solution and the pvdf nc membrane surfaces then the excess coating solution was removed and the membrane was transferred to the oven for 15 min at 50 c to fix the pva layer onto the pvdf nc membranes the resulting pva pvdf pva pvdf al2o3 m1 pva pvdf sio2 m2 pva pvdf cuo m3 and pva pvdf verm m4 nc membranes see table 1 were removed from the glass frames and washed carefully with di water and saved in

the amount of 10 mm min young s modulus mega pascal mpa was considered using the following equation 1 young s modulus m p a stress strain 2 5 membrane performance assessment for ultrafiltration techniques the nanocomposite ultrafiltration membrane performances was studied using a laboratory dds model lab m20 alfa laval denmark and where the effective membrane area was 18 cm2 the transmembrane pressure was adjusted from 0 05 to 0 35 mpa there are three parameters that were examined pure water flux l m2 h ha rejection were measured using 1 g l and the fouling test using bsa as a model foulant the ha was used as a model organic water pollutant where it was dissolved in di water and the ph of ha was adjusted to 7 with hcl or naoh as required the ha concentration in the feed and in permeate solutions were examined by uv visible spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 450 nm uv visible spectrophotometer unicam model 300 england in addition the antifouling performance of the membranes was determined using bovine serum albumin bsa as a potential protein foulant the measurements of ha rejection and water flux were taken 30 min after filtration to obtain a steady state had been touched the pure water flux and ha rejection r were calculated using the following equations 2 j w v at 3 r 1 cp cf 100 where jw l m2 h is the clean water flux v l is the permeate water volume a m2 is the effective surface membrane area t h is the permeation time r is the ha rejection and cp and cf are the concentrations of permeate and feed solution respectively the synthesized pure pvdf pva pvdf and nanocomposite modified membranes were used for removal different four dyes as malachite green mg methylene blue mb congo red cr and safranin o so from aqueous solutions as a synthetic organic wastewater treatment the continuing dye concentration was examined by uv visible spectrophotometer each dye was determined at the appropriate wavelength of the highest absorbance λ max that is 497 617 530 and 663 nm for cr mg so and mb respectively ph of the dye solutions was accustomed via dilute solutions of hcl and naoh no additional adjustment of ph was made during the experiments 2 6 antifouling assessment the membrane fouling results in disturbing the application of separation performances such as water flux pollutant rejection and increases in the operational price of the water purification process the antifouling possessions was controlled via recording the normalized water fluxes jw through the membranes relative to their initial water fluxes throughout the filtration period using 1 g l of bsa solution as a protein model foulant with an aqueous feed solution at 0 1 mpa temperature of 25 c and scheming the flux recovery after the pure water flushing the water flux was commonly observed during the experimental period when it is stabilize the productivity of membrane fouling could be advanced through flowing multi turns washing series the membranes were be activated by five separation periods where the membrane from the first separation stage was pressurized again for further filtration procedures to expedite the water flux deterioration at that time the filtration experiment for the membrane was on going exhausting a feed solution containing 1 g l of bsa solution for 20 min and then the fouled pvdf membrane was flushed with di water for 15 min after that the water flux of washed membrane jwf was estimated for 15 min then repeating the separation test with 1 g l of bsa solution for 20 min the circulating multi turns washing series were reiterated to control the influence of membrane fouling as exposed by the water flux decline the flux recovery ratio frr was determined with the declining percentage of the clean water flux decrease before and after the separation of bsa solution the synthesized nanocomposite membranes were assessed through the following equation 4 frr jwf jw 100 where frr is the flux recovery ratio jw is the pure water flux before fouling test and jwf is the pure water flux after fouling 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the vermiculite nanoparticles the functional groups of the al2o3 sio2 cuo nps and the synthesized verm nps were examined using the ftir spectrum fig 2 a the spectra of verm nps in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 at room temperature were shown in fig 2a the characteristic water vibration stretching band at 3434 cm 1 and a deformation band at 1646 cm 1 were distinguished in the ir spectra of verm nps the appearance of stretching vibrations band around 3405 3440 cm 1 for oh of water and oh deformation vibrations band of water appears around 1647 cm 1 a stretching band of mg3 oh stretching near 3750 cm 1 was shown the peaks at 818 and 950 cm 1 point to the presence of al o stretching band al in tetrahedral sheet and sio stretching group respectively the si o deformation band shown at 668 cm 1 and the presence of small band around 447 460 cm 1 due to siosi deformation 36 the presence of small peak appears at approximately 620 cm 1 indicating the mg3 oh deformation and has important applications for vem nps the spectroscopic studies confirmed the prepared vem nps the evidence of sio2 nps was proven by the presence of the very strong and a wide band showing at 1061 cm 1 consigned to the si o si asymmetric stretching vibrations 37 conversely the symmetric stretching vibrations of siosi appear at 800 cm 1 and its bending style appears around 441 cm 1 38 the appearance of the weak band at 550 cm 1 is dispensed to sio stretching of the sio2 the broad peak appears between 3000 to 4000 cm 1 is characteristic of the oh group which exists in water the indication of cuo nps were shown via the presence of two bands nearby 532 and 487 cm 1 owing to cu o stretching along the 202 direction and 202 direction respectively the band at 1436 cm 1was attributed to the co bond the band showed at 600 and 3357 cm 1 which can be attributed to the cuo bond vibrations and oh group respectively 39 the peaks appear at 472 and 690 cm 1 indicating the al o stretching and vibration modes respectively the band showed at 1015 cm 1 is related to symmetric bending of aloh 40 the broad band appears around 3434 cm 1 is owing to oh groups which responsible for the higher reactivity of al2o3 nps the synthesized verm nps and the commercial al2o3 sio2 cuo nps were characterized by x ray diffraction and displayed crystalline structures in fig 2b from the xrd shape and resultant appearances of 2θ of the diffraction peaks which confirm the formation of vermiculite nanoparticles the synthesized vermiculite nps were characterized via x ray diffraction and showed crystalline structures the x ray pattern of vermiculite nps is shown in fig 2b the following x ray pattern consists of 11 peak diffractions at 2θ equal to 18 23 26 7 34 4 35 7 41 45 55 60 65 and 69 from the xrd configuration and resultant characteristics of 2θ of the diffraction peaks that confirm and match with the standard data sheets jcpds cards 01 076 0847 and 00 016 0613 41 which reported by the joint committee on powder diffraction that approves the formation of verm nps the average particle size used for the nanoparticle powders was estimated by debye scherer s equation 42 5 d kλ β cos θ where d is the crystallite diameter of verm nps k is the scherer constant k 0 89 λ is the wavelength of the x ray 1 54 a β is the whole width at half maximum width of the diffraction peak in radiance and θ is the maximum strength of the diffraction angle the crystallite size of the verm nps was determined to be between 51 and 116 5 nm with an average size of 81 5 nm the x ray diffraction procedures of all examined ingredients showed a high amount of crystallinity from the xrd pattern it is observed that the verm nps are crystalline in nature this confirms the crystalline structure of the verm nps which can be used for adsorption procedures and membrane performances in ultrafiltration techniques 5 from the xrd pattern it is observed that the synthesized verm nps has the essential property of being able to disperse in organic polymers 43 the x ray diffraction method was carried out on the commercial al2o3 sio2 cuo nps the crystalline al2o3 cuo and the amorphous sio2 nps were proven by the residue x ray diffraction study and the deflection peaks are shown in fig 2b it was shown that the resultant characteristics of cuo nps consist of 12 peak diffractions at 2θ equal to 33 36 39 49 53 59 62 66 68 72 75 and 83 which confirms and matches with the standard international diffraction data sheets card no 41 0254 and the d spacing values were well matched with the informed values in the card 44 it was shown that the resultant characteristics of al2o3 nps consists of 9 peak diffractions at 2θ equal to 19 21 28 38 41 46 53 67 and 79 which confirms and consistent with the standard joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds value card no79 1558 45 xrd diffraction of al2o3nps exhibited that the al2o3 was in crystal symmetry x ray diffraction examination of sio2 nps is shown in fig 2b it was revealed that the resultant characteristics of sio2 nps are completely amorphous in nature with one peak at 2θ equal to 24 3 and do not display any sharp diffraction peaks which consistent with the standard diffraction data sheets card 850335 46 from the xrd pattern it is observed that the sio2 nps is having hexagonal crystal structure and showed amorphous in nature which can be improved the membrane adsorption efficiency fig 2c presents a histogram of the results obtained from the measurements of the particle size distribution psd of the synthesized verm nps it is observable that the average and standard deviation values of the verm nps particle size were 86 2 nm and 90 1 nm 64 9 which was in agreement with the former dimensions attained from the xrd outcome for the formation of verm nps 3 2 characterization of the synthesized membranes 3 2 1 ftir analysis to enhance the separation performances and hydrophilicity of pvdf membranes surface adjustment of pvdf membranes via coating with pva and incorporation of four different nanomaterials such as al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps were studied the ftir spectra were employed to deliver information about the chemical structure of all modified membranes the ftir spectra of the pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 are shown in fig 3 the ftir peaks reveal that the appearance of four bands at 489 610 795 and 945 cm 1 which are attributed to cf2 wagging flexible and ch2 twisting which described non polar pvdf 47 the strong absorption bands at 1170 and 1405 cm 1 are characteristics of fcf and hch respectively which found in pure pvdf membrane the skeletal vibration of cc bond showed at 877 cm 1 48 the weak absorption band 3421 cm 1 was attributed to oh vibrations as shown in fig 3 the ftir spectra of the pva pvdf structured membranes indicate the presence of the peak at 1653 cm 1 shows that the carbonyl co group was successfully presented into pva pvdf membrane and 2923 cm 1 which responsible for the aliphatic ch bond for appropriate comparison after the membrane surface modification the ratio of the band intensity of 1402 cm 1 that is coh fcf the decrease which mainly due to the change of hydroxyl groups which confirmed that the pva chain backbone structure was formed meanwhile the ftir spectra of the pva pvdf and the nanocomposite modified pvdf membranes reveals shows that the presence of a strong peak at 3000 3500 cm 1 with a higher intensity which is related with the hydroxyl group ho 49 this was confirming once pvdf was interacted with a strong alkali solution and it s de fluorination as supplemented via an oxidizing reaction it is expected that the main reason for decreasing the wca after the modification of pvdf membrane is the creation of the hydroxyl ho groups which can advance the hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces this is mostly owing to the chemical compositions of the modified membranes it is observable that all synthesized membranes confined very alike functional groups owing to the existence of similar peaks this is attributed to the membranes chemical structures the incorporated nanoparticles have changed oxy functional groups that might be intersected with actual pva pvdf membranes deficiency of their exclusive bands could also owe to the exhausting small concentration used which might be condensed below pva pvdf polymer matrix 50 compared with the pure pvdf membrane the pva pvdf and pva pvdf nc modified membranes have a wider peak at 3400 cm 1 due to the hydroxyl group from al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nanoparticles additionally the entrance of oh group might contribute to the improvement of membrane surface hydrophilicity caused by the hydrophilic nature of the nanoparticles 3 2 2 water contact angle wca the water contact angle θ wca is the most ordinary factor used to illustrate the hydrophilicity of membrane surfaces a lower wca value demonstrates a hydrophilic surface while a higher wca value indicating a hydrophobic surface the wca increase with increasing the pva content over the pvdf membrane surfaces and decrease when compared with the pure pvdf membrane fig 4 a the wca reaches 67 7 for 1 5 wt of pva and 82 55 for pure pvdf respectively which indicating higher hydrophilicity of pva pvdf modified membrane the higher the hydrophilicity of pva pvdf membrane surface may be owing to the higher of oxygen content groups on pva pvdf membrane surface which responsible for the attainment of advanced membrane hydrophilicity further increasing the pva monomer concentration more than 1 5 wt causes an increase in water contact angle with additional pva monomer content which may be due to the aggregation of pva layer on the pvdf membrane surfaces wherever intense polymerization procedures create a dense membrane layer with low porosity it is obvious that the pva layer is aggregated in high content of the pva which subsequently plugged the pores of the resulting membranes as well as decreases the available hydroxyl groups and increase the water contact angle 12 in fig 4b the mean water contact angles for m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc membranes were 62 45 2 5 64 7 5 2 8 66 42 2 and 57 25 1 9 respectively indicating they possess hydrophilic surfaces as it is clearly observed from fig 4b the addition of al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps reduced the contact angle of pvdf nc membranes this was due to oxide forms of these nanoparticles that might act as active materials on the pvdf membrane surface and form hydrogen bonds with water the mean wca were gotten via using verm 0 2 al2o3 0 3 sio2 0 1 cuo 0 2 wt of the pvdf concentration compared by the integration of different metal oxide nps the wca for verm is slightly more hydrophilic than al2o3 sio2 and cuo 51 this is due to the water affinity and higher density of electrostatic charge on the surface of verm nps 5 it is concluded from the fig 4b that the wca of nanocomposite modified pva pvdf membranes decreased when compared to the pure pvdf membrane consequently indicating that the hydrophilicity of pvdf membrane improves after nano alkali modification and the incorporation of these nanoparticles to the polymer matrix caused a higher affinity for h2o than pure pvdf membrane this is mostly owing to the hydrophilic nature of the nanoparticles that also contributed to creating membrane surface more hydrophilic this improvement mainly attributable to the interaction between the pvdf polymer matrix and strong base which can initiate hydrophilic polar groups such as carboxyl groups cooh and hydroxide radical ho formed owing to the grafting of pva which retains a less negative charge on the membrane surface that enhances the hydrophilicity of the pvdf membrane 52 the incorporation of verm nps into membrane matrix improved the roughness of the membranes and increased the surface energy which allows water to easily spread onto the surface and enhances the capability of the hydrophilic pores to imbibe water through capillary effects thus enhanced the wettability of the modified membrane 5 this observation mainly due to the occurrence of active hydrophilic functional groups on the membranes surfaces which also helps to improve the antifouling properties this is owing to the polarity of a hydroxyl group oh and oxygen element from the surface of metal oxide that is able to form interaction with water during hydrogen bonding and van der waal s force 53 3 2 3 mechanical properties the mechanical properties of pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes are shown in table 2 and the stress strain curves are shown in fig 5 these properties contain tensile strength elongation at break and the calculated young modulus of the membranes the pva pvdf and modified nc membranes demonstrate enhanced elongation break tensile strength mpa and improved young s modulus values when compared to the pure pvdf membrane the enhancement in tensile strength and young s modulus values for the pva pvdf and modified nc membranes with respect to wards the pure pvdf membrane is mostly because of the cross linked complex structure in the alkyl group which improved strength and flexibility of the nc membranes these behaviors demonstrate that adding the suitable amount of nano materials such as al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps into pvdf polymer matrix can enhance the membranes mechanical possessions attributed to cross linking property to tolerate the stress of the membrane load al2o3 and sio2 nps could act as a cross linking point to link the polymeric chains and enhance the rigidity of polymeric chains 52 and enhance the rigidity toughness of polymeric chains and thus generate an enhancement in the tensile strength and elongation at break the development of the tensile strength due to the incorporation of cuo nps to the polymer matrix due to the formation of nanocomposites between cuo and pvdf blend matrix the increment in mechanical properties are rational because cuo nps can act as plasticizer 54 the maximum elongation and young s modulus was improved via incorporation of the verm nps with pvdf membrane due to the ternary molecular structure of vermiculite in addition to the compatibility among the vermiculite and pvdf polymer matrix the addition of small amounts of verm nps to the pvdf polymer matrix causes a uniform dispersion of verm nps and showed less agglomeration in the membrane matrix so that it has interacted muscularly forming hydrogen bonding which reinforced membrane mechanical properties this scattering provides superior uniform stress distribution the condensed making of stress concentration centers and consequently improves the mechanical properties of the membrane 55 the mechanical possessions of the membrane depend mostly on the membrane microstructure and intermolecular forces operating along the membrane polymer chain as was reported the verm nps enhanced the mechanical properties of polyethylene vermiculite nanocomposites 56 the above results were well in agreement with ftir and sem which specify that the pva pvdf verm m4 nc membranes also have good mechanical stability due to the interaction between the organic and inorganic structures 3 2 4 morphology analysis of membranes the sem images of the surface and cross section of the pure pvdf pva pvdf pva pvdf al2o3 m1 pva pvdf sio2 m2 pva pvdf cuo m3 and pva pvdf verm m4 nc modified membranes were revealed in figs 6 and 7 the surface sem images with three different magnifications of pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes at a scale of 5 10 and 50 μm are revealed in fig 6 the sem images also exhibited that m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes had more surface pore density than pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes these images obviously showed that all membranes display an asymmetric construction with a slight change in membrane surface morphology after incorporation of al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps and the pores of the membrane became well dispersed all over the membrane surface and this possibly led to improving the membranes performances especially with the pva pvdf verm nc membrane the morphologies of the top surface of nc modified membrane are more porous roughness with microvoids when compared with the pure pvdf membrane where it has a smooth surface without noticeable microvoids the morphology of the top surface of pva pvdf verm m4 nc modified membrane showed an improvement of the network porous structure of the membrane surface after incorporation of verm nps with pvdf polymer matrix through detecting the cross section sem images of the pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes it is obvious that the nature of nanoparticles considerably affected the morphology of the membrane fig 7 the cross section of the pure pvdf membrane exhibited the finger like pores below the top surface as the surface modification with pva occurred the number of the finger like pores declines this is due to the modification with a hydrophilic pva polymer 57 all the modified membranes offered characteristically asymmetric structure with macrovoid structure and pore finger like structure in the sub layer these results matched with the observation in fig 6 the cross sectional morphologies of all membranes reveal a network porous structure these results were well in contract with ftir and wca which specify that the pva pvdf verm m4 nc membranes also have good network porous structure due to the interaction among the organic and inorganic constituents 3 3 performances assessments the main aim of this research is to present a novel functional group through surface coating procedures as well as embedding the four different nanomaterials such as al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps this combination leads to improved membrane performance for water purification fig 8 a displays the effect of the different pva concentration 1 5 3 5 7 and 10 wt solutions on the water flux and rejection using 1 g l humic acid ha as a feed solution was used to evaluate its rejection at an applied pressure of 0 15 mpa at 25 c the pvdf membrane surface coating using pva monomer showed enhanced water flux jw and ha removal using 1 5 wt of pva monomer concentrations which showed comparable water flux and ha rejection when compared to pure pvdf membrane the ha elimination reaches 80 9 and 85 5 and the jw reaches 551 and 576 l m2 h at 0 15 mpa for pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes respectively enhanced water flux and ha rejection may be due to improving the hydrophilicity and causes negatively charged functional group onto the membrane surfaces 58 additional increasing the pva monomer concentration further than 1 5 wt causes a decline in water flux and ha elimination with further pva monomer content which can be attributed to pva monomer aggregation on the pvdf membrane surfaces wherever intense polymerization processes produce a dense membrane layer with low porosity it is obvious that the pva layer is aggregated in high content of the pva which subsequently decreases the available hydroxyl groups and reduce the flux furthermore some pores of the membrane surfaces could be plugged possessing to the pva aggregation resulting in water flux and ha rejection decline the effect of four different nanoparticles content on the pva pvdf membrane performances and the outcomes are represented in fig 8b e and table 3 firstly all parameters were optimized containing the structures and the operating condition of pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes as deliberated in details in the schematic diagram fig 1 the pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes performances were maximized exclusively in terms of enhancing the water flux and rejection using different concentrations of al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps at optimized circumstances different concentrations of al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps were incorporated onto pvdf polymer matrix where these concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 wt related to pvdf concentration i e 12 wt all synthesized pva pvdf al2o3 m1 pva pvdf sio2 m2 pva pvdf cuo m3 and pva pvdf verm m4 nc modified membranes were estimated in terms of water flux and ha rejection at 0 15 mpa at 25 c as revealed in fig 8b e and table 3 it can be observed that all nc modified pva pvdf membranes exhibited a significant enhancement in performances when compared to the pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes the best concentration of the al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps were 0 3 0 1 0 2 and 0 2 respectively the improvement of water flux was consistent with increasing the al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps concentrations this is attributed to enhancing the hydrophilicity of pva pvdf membranes conversely the water flux decrease using additional al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps concentrations i e 0 3 wt this may be ascribed to aggregation of the nanoparticles and a thicker membrane structure was formed firstly it might be observed that pva pvdf al2o3 nc membrane showed a significant increase in the water flux and ha rejection until the al2o3 nps reaches 0 3 wt and the membrane separation performances decrease with further al2o3 nps content fig 8b and table 3 it was detected that after incorporation of al2o3 nps to the pvdf polymer matrix the water flux and ha rejection was enhanced due to the homogeneity hydrophilic nature of al2o3 nps in the membrane structure in addition to the membrane surface roughness and pore structure due to the introduction of polar functional groups to the membrane polymer chain 59 secondly varied pvdf sio2 membranes were synthesized with various sio2 concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 wt as exposed in fig 8c and table 3 it is obvious that the water flux and the ha rejection increase up to sio2 concentration reach 0 1 wt when compared to pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes it might be attributable to the hydrophilic nature of sio2 nps and uniformity of its presence in the pvdf polymer matrix conversely further increasing of sio2 i e at 0 2 wt a declining in the water flux and ha rejection was noticed this mainly due to the aggregation of sio2 nps content which blocks the movement of the polymer matrix and pores blocking took place 60 thirdly cuo nps was used with different concentrations ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 wt as presented in fig 8d and table 3 it can be seen that there was a slight increase in the pva pvdf cuo nc membrane performances by using 0 1 0 2 wt of cuo nps and start to decrease via further cuo nps concentration up to 0 2 wt the enhanced behavior due to the presence of the hydroxyl group also established the same behavior of the mixed matrix membranes using hydrophilic cuo nps however pore blocking of membrane surface might be the result of the higher contents of cuo nps and the aggregation might occur and interrupt the polymer chain filling finally the effect of verm nps concentration on water flux and ha rejection of pva pvdf membranes were considered using verm concentrations of 0 1 0 5 wt as presented in fig 8e and table 3 it was noticeable that the best membrane performances were achieved using 0 2 wt of verm nps concentration when the concentration of verm raises the filler density on the surface increases therefore the hydrophilicity of the pva pvdf membranes as well as the roughness and the free energy of the membranes were improved due to the combination of verm nps into the membrane matrix the verm nps is a hydrophilic substance and improved the membrane performances for water separation these results were in agreement with the previous work on using verm nps with polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane matrix 5 the membranes own jw and ha solute rejection values in the following order m4 m1 m2 m3 nc membranes it is observable that the nanoparticles are aggregated with the content of the different nanoparticles attributed to the specific surface decline of the al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps which consequently decreases the presented hydroxyl oh groups which decline the water flux furthermore some pores of the membranes might be plugged possessing to the nanoparticles aggregation causing a decline in water flux 61 fig 9 demonstrates the pure water permeability for pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 membranes under different applied pressure 0 05 to 0 35 mpa the pure water permeability increased proportionally with the trans membrane pressure all the nanocomposite membranes revealed that the pure water permeability higher than the original pvdf and pva pvdf membranes the membranes own pure water permeability values in the following order m4 1554 m1 1490 m2 1420 m3 1305 pva pvdf 1189 pure pvdf 1080 l m2 h membranes using 0 35 mpa it is concluded that the incorporation of the synthesized verm nps onto the pva pvdf polymer matrix improved the pure water permeability of the membrane the water permeability enhancement of verm nps composite membranes was achieved due to hydrophilic nature of the verm nps which promotes the permeability and invites water molecules that go through the membrane matrix as well as enhance water flux in addition to enhanced the mechanical possessions of the membrane 62 consequently the enhanced in the water permeability of the pva pvdf verm nc membrane might be elucidated from the following features firstly the occurrence of hydrophilic pva and verm nps improved the hydrophilicity of membranes leading to additional promising condition for water permeation secondly the improved surface pore size and the pore density in membrane structure were favorable to develop the water flux which was confirmed via sem and ftir results subsequently the favorable membrane structure and enhanced hydrophilicity lead to higher water flux of the nano modified membranes than that of pure pvdf membrane furthermore the surface roughness of the pva pvdf and nanocomposite membranes increased by incorporation of al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps into the membrane matrix which spreading out the h2o passage and accordingly causes an improvement in water flux the obtained data suggested that the incorporation of the vermiculite nps with the organic moieties improved the membrane structure due to the vermiculite nps monolayer structure which consists of sio2 40 08 al2o3 12 35 fe2o3 6 83 tio2 1 43 cao 2 32 mgo 18 74 na2o 3 37 k2o 2 86 41 vermiculite nps has a better physical connection with the polymer part due to its higher specific surface area so it has been chosen as the inorganic part of the mixed matrix membrane 3 4 antifouling performance to estimate the antifouling properties of the pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes a compaction test with di water and then multi turns washing series of fouling washing ultrafiltration were carried out using 1 g l bsa as a model protein foulant with an aqueous feed solution at 0 1 mpa at 25 c ph 7 and calculating the flux recovery after the pure water flushing the results are observed in fig 10 a it is found that the initial fluxes for the nano modified membranes were higher than the initial water fluxes of pure pvdf as in order m4 m1 m2 m3 pva pvdf pure pvdf membrane afterward all the fouling washing experimental period overall flux losses for all nano modified membranes and pva pvdf were slightly lower when compared with the pure pvdf membrane pva pvdf membrane with 0 2 wt verm nps revealed the highest frr with a final water flux value of 528 l m2 h about 65 of the initial value this was indicates that the verm nps embedded membrane exhibit an enhancement in pvdf membrane hydrophilicity verm nps which may possibly hinder the solute deposition and adsorption on the membrane matrix 63 after introducing the pva as a coating surface as well as incorporation of hydrophilic nanoparticles to the pvdf membrane thus the membrane became more hydrophilic so the membrane fouling was delayed due to a higher hydrophilicity affected by the joined effect of the incorporated al2o3 sio2 cuo and verm nps onto the polymer matrix and improvement of the membrane surfaces with the hydrophilic pva ultrathin layer the nanoparticles additives had a high attraction to polar constituents as h2o that led to a higher permeability for pure water thus a high retention to hydrophobic composites as the macromolecules and proteins 64 fig 10b described the normalized flux ratio nfr of the pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes the nfr was used to detect the fouling degree of all the synthesized membranes and it was evaluated against the filtration time 3 5 h it was noticed that pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes revealed less fouling affinity i e higher nfr values when compared to the pure pvdf membrane that is a pointer of the achievement in the modification in the polymer matrix and in the membrane surface possessions these results might be relatively leads to their high water fluxes and their hydrophilic surface nature that making the foulant hard to adsorb that reduced the hydrophobic interaction between the membrane surface and the protein foulants m4 exhibited the highest nfr values 81 5 which demonstrate the lowest total flux loss during the ultrafiltration process in comparison with the other modified membranes the results showed that the embedding of verm nps into pva pvdf membrane might be an operative way for better bsa retention and decrease the membrane fouling compared with the pure pvdf membrane the difference between the retention of bsa of different nanomodified membranes that may depend on the pore blockage conversely the following gradual deterioration might be due to the accumulation of the organic foulant on the membrane surface 4 application for removal efficiency the presently used cationic and anionic synthetic dyes such as congo red cr malachite green oxalate mg safranin o so and methylene blue mb are highly water soluble azo or anthraquinone based reactive dyes that must be removed from wastewater completely these dyes were selected based on their shape charges and molecular weight most of these dyes are potentially carcinogenic and toxic in nature and the azo bonds existing in these compounds are hardy to break down the selected dyes are responsible for the growing of these composites in the environment therefore their elimination from the industrial effluents is a major environmental challenge the selected membranes were applied in the treatment of four different organic dyes as examples for wastewater pollutants and the chemical characteristics for the selected dyes were shown in table 4 the removal of pollutants from an aqueous solution by the pure pvdf pva pvdf m1 m2 m3 and m4 nc modified membranes to detect the rejection efficiency of the selected dyes was shown in fig 11 a d it is observed that the water flux and the removal efficiency of cr mb mg and so organic dyes were in order m4 m1 m2 m3 pva pvdf pure pvdf membrane and m4 m1 m3 m2 pva pvdf pure pvdf membrane respectively it is found that the rejection of mb cr mg so for all the selected membranes these results might be attributed to the importance of dyes molecular charge that plays an important role in the ultrafiltration process smaller dye molecules mb and so exhibit identical separation styles both mb and so passed through the modified membranes however linear mb was rejected higher than the globular so the molecular size and the chemical origin of natural organic matter are valuable tools evaluating their effects on the performances of wastewater treatment organizations the separation efficiency depends not only on the charges on the membrane surfaces and the natural organic matter charge that plays a significant role in the rejection process but also molecule shape becomes an essential factor where the globular structure is more favorable than the linear one 65 the small charged molecules as dyes do not pass through the membrane i e have higher rejection value when compared to larger uncharged molecules the cr and mg have the same trend for rejection due to the higher molecular weight of their chemical structure where the doubly charged dyes have a higher retention than the mono charged one it is estimated that highly charged dyes might be further retention via the negatively charged membrane surfaces than the fewer charged dyes as a result of the repulsion of similar charges 66 from the result it was found that the rejection of mb and cr was higher than the mg and so this mainly attributed to the linear shape is hinder to pore passage compared to globular molecular shape 67 because of various opportunities of stretched linear shape orientation numerous linear particles are rejected or hindered through the separation due to suboptimal pore configuration and the repulsion forces among the negatively charged membrane surfaces and the negatively charged dye that obstructs the dye flux via membrane pores this results might be due to hydrophobic and dipolar interactions between membranes and solutes 68 5 conclusions in this work the pvdf membranes were successfully incorporated with the vermiculite nps via phase inversion method and compared with inorganic al2o3 sio2 and cuo nps incorporated pvdf the incorporation of verm 0 2 al2o3 0 3 sio2 0 1 and cuo 0 2 wt nps improved the permeate flux and rejection rate of pvdf membranes the prepared membranes were modified via surface coating of pva layer using interfacial crosslinking method the nanocomposite modified membranes showed enhanced flux solute rejection mechanical properties and antifouling properties and dyes removal efficiency when compared with the pure pvdf and pva pvdf membranes among the nanocomposite membranes pva pvdf verm 0 2 wt showed highest flux of 628 7 l m2 h and ha rejection of 94 56 the results of antifouling of bsa multi series test showed that pva pvdf verm membrane with its surface roughness showed improved antifouling resistance thus pva pvdf verm nc membrane promises to be the best candidate in terms of quality and cost when compared to all prepared membranes for its potential application in wastewater treatment 
14327,in this study investigation of the applicability and efficiency of electrochemical oxidation eo processes for slaughterhouse wastewater was targeted by evaluating the treatment efficiency and energy consumption values together the effect of operating parameters such as type of supporting electrolyte se na2so4 nano3 and nacl concentration of se 0 01 0 1 m initial wastewater ph 3 9 current density cd 4 73 14 20 ma cm2 and dilution rate of wastewater 1 1 1 4 on removal of chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss and color were investigated the most effective electrolyte type was observed as nacl with the use of 0 025 m nacl and 25 c reaction temperature at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd and ph of 7 03 for 4 h reaction time the optimum conditions for both energy consumption and removal efficiency for treatment of sww were obtained at optimum conditions tss toc cod tn and color removal efficiencies were found as 99 5 88 0 92 2 93 5 and 99 9 respectively and the energy consumption under these conditions were 153 57 kwh m3 and 14 12 kwh kg cod the energy cost was calculated as 1 69 kg cod also results distinctly show that almost full mineralization of organics is obtained after 4 h treatment unluckily taking into account the large volumes of effluent produced per slaughtering cycle the need for long treatment times is impractical yet if the reactor is developed to include hydrodynamic conditions or combined with another treatment process which is shorter than the eo treatment time a novel setup may be possible keywords electrochemical oxidation slaughterhouse wastewater energy consumption 1 introduction it is critical to secure the environment against the growing human population and rapid industrialization industrial wastewaters may contain assorted organic or inorganic contaminants slaughterhouses are a section of an expansive industry because meat is included in the basic diet of humans meat consumption continues to increase with an acceleration in the last decades 1 the slaughterhouse sector produces a significant amount of wastewater from both production and non production units owing to the slaughtering of animals and cleaning of the slaughterhouse plants 2 wastewater contains substantial biodegradable organic compounds like biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen phosphorus oil and grease due to suspended solids and colloidal matters such as fat blood protein and cellulose 3 4 also these wastewaters contain trace amounts of drug residues because of antibiotics vaccines and other pharmaceuticals pathogenic and non pathogenic microorganisms and detergent if such wastewater is discharged into the receiving environment without treatment it can reduce the dissolved oxygen level and thus negatively affect biological life 5 6 for this reason it is necessary to treat wastewater before discharge into aquatic media commonly slaughterhouse wastewater sww treatment approaches use biological processes such as activated sludge 7 8 stabilization ponds 9 anaerobic reactors 10 and combined processes 11 12 though these frameworks are successful they generally require lengthy hydraulic retention time expansive areas and huge amounts of created sludge 13 14 sww s may involve deleterious and non biodegradable organic matter biological treatment may be inadequate sww generally contains blood as is known electrolytes and ions in blood induce electrical conductivity this makes the treatment of sww s with electrochemical processes advantageous to treat the sww s many electrochemical methods were investigated studies mainly focus on the ec technique and combined or hybrid processes and fewer examine the single eo process ün et al 15 investigated hybrid processes for the treatment of cattle sww using aluminum and iron electrodes they evaluated the impacts of cd initial ph and se na2so4 concentration on the efficiency of the system in the case of aluminum electrodes polyaluminum chloride pac was utilized as the coagulant aid cod removal of 94 4 was obtained by adding 0 75 g l pac with the use of an iron electrode ec was conducted simultaneously with the fenton process according to the results 81 1 cod removal was achieved by adding 9 h2o2 poultry slaughterhouse wastewater psw treatment using the electro fenton process was investigated by davarnejad and nasiri 16 the effect of ph reaction time volume ratio of h2o2 psw ml l cd h2o2 fe2 molar ratio was investigated on the color and cod removal they found the optimum conditions were reaction time of 55 60 min h2o2 fe2 molar ratio of 3 73 ph of 4 38 cd of 74 07 ma cm2 and volume ratio of h2o2 psw of 1 63 ml l for 92 3 cod removal and ph of 3 39 reaction time of 49 22 min h2o2 fe2 molar ratio of 3 62 cd of 67 90 ma cm2 and volume ratio of h2o2 psw of 1 44 ml l for 88 0 color removal another study was completed by eryuruk et al 17 about treatment of poultry sww s with electrochemical methods the impact of cd se na2so4 concentration feed rate of wastewater ph and the polyelectrolyte substance were investigated in a continuous flow system also they investigated the peroxy electrocoagulation by using h2o2 with several concentrations to reach maximum efficiency when wastewater was exposed to the peroxy electrocoagulation cod removal efficiency of 95 4 was obtained treatment of poultry sww by ec was investigated batchwise by kobya et al 18 the most elevated cod removal efficiency was 93 with aluminum and maximum oil grease removal of 98 was obtained with iron electrodes as can be seen sww s were treated successfully using ec post treatment of sww using eo was investigated by awang et al 19 the effects of cd reaction time and influent cod on color cod and bod removal efficiencies and ph were investigated in a batch system sodium sulfate na2so4 was selected as se and aluminum electrodes were used the optimum conditions were 220 mg l influent cod 30 ma cm2 cd and reaction time of 55 min under these conditions removal of color bod and cod were 96 8 81 3 85 0 respectively using aluminum electrodes with electrochemical post treatment of sww was successful for color bod and cod removal another study carried out by abdelhay et al 20 about anodic oxidation of sww on boron doped diamond examined the effect of process variables the effect of process variables cd initial wastewater ph se nature and concentration of electro coagulant on the removal of color turbidity and cod removal was investigated as a result raising the cd had a positive effect on all pollutants sodium sulfate na2so4 was less effective than nacl for cod removal complete removal of cod was completed in the presence of nacl 1 as se the turbidity in wastewater was reduced by 98 with the simultaneous use of fecl3 and na2so4 owing to ec ec is frequently applied due to its low energy consumption and high removal efficiency nevertheless these processes cause secondary waste additionally in ec electrodes dissolve over time and need to be replaced with new ones therefore it is useful to test the processes that are as effective as the ec process but which do not create secondary waste eo of organic compounds is an advanced oxidation process aop which permits total mineralization of organic matter 21 the organic and deleterious contaminants in wastewaters decompose mainly via a direct anodic process or via indirect anodic oxidation by the production of oxidants like hydroxyl radicals and ozone in eo 22 oxidation of the organic pollutants occurs on the anodes by active oxygen like hydroxyl radicals oh with the direct oxidation route indirect oxidation begins in the presence of chlorine ions as creation of chlorine or hypochlorite oxidizes the inorganic organic matters 23 eo has many advantages in comparison with conventional and other aop treatment methods they involve no subsidiary waste generation such as expended sorbents sullied retentate ferric hydroxide waste or waste activated sludge that occurs with adsorption filtration fenton reactions and biological processes respectively eo has the advantage of easy inspection via operation and does not require extra chemicals to control the process eo is applicable for the treatment of industrial wastewaters owing to good electric conductivity of the wastewaters 21 also eo is appropriate for colored and blurred wastewater which is difficult to clarify with photo degradation and catalysis 21 but as in other processes eo has inconveniences these are abrasion passivation and polarization of electrodes and high energy consumption when electrochemical technologies are compared with other technologies they consume much more energy but are more efficient and more compact it is critical to emphasize that electrochemical reactors work with dc current which can be obtained from renewable energy sources like photovoltaic cells pv 24 in the eo process use of se energy consumption is reduced while the efficiency of the treatment is increased polarization of the anodes and cathodes occurs with low mass conduction and the gases aggregate on the surface of electrode and this gives rise to the exhaustion of electro active species in the border coat of the electrode 21 abrasion of the electrodes is another problem caused by oxidation reactions of the anode and the formation of abrasive products on the surface of electrode for instance cl2 g this issue can be solved by improving new electrode materials or by choosing optimal anode materials various electrodes are used in eo of organic pollutants in wastewaters such as graphite electrodes metal electrodes mixed metal oxide electrodes mmo boron doped diamond bdd electrodes etc 25 27 because of their long service life abrasion resistance and high potential to produce oxygen and hydroxyl radicals by electrochemical reactions taking into consideration that electrochemical processes are compact and simple to automate 28 the improvement of small sized electrochemical wastewater treatment systems to treat sww might become an alternative to be explored as far as the authors are aware there are many studies about electrochemical treatments of sww s and there are fewer studies about the use of single eo processes on sww s but there are no published studies investigating the combination of many parameters efficiency using ti pt anodes on cattle sww s treatment in a single eo process the authors also intend to contribute to the literature by predicting the feasibility and efficiency of a single eo operation with active anodes ti pt on an industrial scale for sww s 2 material and method 2 1 materials and characterization of wastewater the wastewater used in this work was collected from a cattle slaughterhouse van turkey the sample was taken from the main effluent outlet and stored at 4 c before use in experiments and further studies the chemical analysis of sww is shown in table 1 which was reported in the previous study öztürk et al 2019 except biochemical oxygen demand bod and oil grease analyses giving the maximum and minimum values of the samples taken during 6 months all chemicals utilized in this study were purchased from e merck with a purity of 99 4 mesh type ti pt and ti electrodes were selected as anode and cathode respectively because of highest electrocatalytic activity towards organic oxidation 29 ti pt electrodes were chosen as anode 2 2 experimental setup the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 1 a glass jacketed reactor for the circulation of the coolant liquid antifreeze was used in experiments wastewater of 700 ml was used in the batch studies during the study using three 3 ti pt mesh type anodes and three 3 ti mesh type cathodes the total areas of the electrodes were calculated as 1056 cm² all electrodes had rectangular shape with dimensions of 40 mm x 200 mm the distance between the electrodes was the least possible 3 mm because decreasing the space between the electrodes reduces energy consumption 30 electrodes were connected in parallel ti pt and ti electrodes are reported in the literature for use in several studies about wastewater treatments 31 33 in order to provide the required electric current during the trials a tti qpx1200s model digital controlled direct current dc power supply 0 60 v 0 50 a was used wtw multi340i multimeter was utilized to adjust the ph conductivity and temperature values of the sww at the beginning of the reaction and to read these values momentarily during the reaction the initial sww ph was adjusted with nitric acid 0 1 m or sodium hydroxide 0 1 m due to the nature of the eo process there is an increase in heat during the reaction so a temperature controlled liquid circulator labo c200 h13 was used to keep the sww at a constant temperature all experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure and constant temperature 25 c the electrolysis time in the eo process is highly effective both on the removal of pollutants from the system and on energy consumption several preliminary tests were performed before deciding the reaction time as a result of the experiments it was observed that the eo rate of all pollutants was slow this may be due to the properties of the anode material used for this reason the reaction time was chosen as 4 h to observe satisfactory removal efficiency and provide the discharge standards 2 3 analytical methods cod was measured with the closed reflux colorimetric method according to the standard methods for measurement 34 color measurements were carried out using the platinum cobalt standard method 35 with a spectrophotometer spectroquant prove300 according to method 180 before color analysis the ph values of the samples were set to 7 6 as recommended by the ncasi method 36 and filtered by means of 0 4 mm filter paper deionized water was used as a blank tn readings were completed with the nitrogen total cell test method based on peroxydisulfate oxidation 2 6 dimethylphenol by using a spectrophotometer spectroquant prove 300 according to the method of 108 toc was measured with a toc analyzer shimadzu toc l at 680 c the lovibond water testing photometer system md100 was used for tss measurements the photometric specification of suspended solids is based upon a gravimetric method this is ordinarily based on evaporation of the filter remnant of a filtered water specimen in a stove at 103 105 c and weighing of the dried remnant for higher accuracy we performed a gravimetric determination of samples the results of the photometric method are consistent with the results of the gravimetric method with a margin of error of 1 the energy consumption was calculated using eq 1 1 e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n k w h m 3 v x i x t v where v volt is potential difference i ampere is current intensity t hour is time and v m 3 is sww volume during the process the amount of electrochemical energy consumption and per kg of removed cod was calculated using eq 2 37 2 e k w h k g c o d v x i x t δ c x v r where v is the average of applied voltage v i is the applied current a t is the time of reaction h δ c is the difference between the input and output cod to the reactor mg l and vr is the sww volume l removal efficiency was calculated by eq 3 3 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c t c 0 x 100 where c0 and ct are pollutant concentration before and after the reaction with time t respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial ph of sww the ph of wastewater could have both a positive and a negative effect on the mineralization of organics as it affects the stability of various hydroxide species that form the impact of initial ph on cod toc tn tss and color removal was firstly examined in this way ph values of 3 5 natural ph 7 03 8 and 9 were investigated at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd without using se and fixed reaction temperature of 25 c and reaction time of 4 h fig 2 the removal efficiency for all pollutants increased when the initial ph value of the wastewater increased from 3 to 7 03 while the removal efficiencies at ph 7 03 and 8 were close to each other the effluent efficiency decreased abruptly when the ph increased to 9 moreover tss and color removal efficiencies did not change much at ph values other than ph 9 this indicates that the degradation with ti pt performed well in wide ranges of ph which means ph adjustment is not required if ph of 9 is not exceeded and thus treatment costs will be reduced in practical applications initial ph of sww was a very substantial parameter for the treatment of sww by eo it can be seen from the results that the removal efficiency for all selected pollutants in the sww was highest at neutral ph 7 03 and quite low in very acidic 3 and basic 9 conditions the removal yield was less in acidic conditions owing to oh instability and noticeably more in alkali solution owing to formation of ocl ion indicating that the basic or neutral ph situations were more favorable under acidic conditions to produce hocl the ocl and h ions undergo the reverse reaction of combining with each other eq 4 38 so ocl ions prefer the reverse reaction rather than oxidizing the pollutants due to its instability also acidic conditions considerably reduce the concentration of notable oxidative radicals of oh produced on anodes 39 4 hocl h ocl on the other hand active chlorine at high ph is found as hypochlorite which is a less potent oxidant of organic species than hypochlorite acid 40 the removal efficiencies depend on the initial ph value as well as the ph values during the process fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the effluent at all ph generally increased during the first 90 min of reaction and then began to slightly decrease or remain stable until 240 min the ph rises owing to the release of more oh ions than protons in the solution due to reactions on the cathode and anode in cases where eo is dominant a tendency for ph to remain constant or slightly increase is observed after 90 min ph decreases which could be due to the formation of hocl at this point the ph of the media is either more acidic or basic depending on whether hocl or ocl is dominant at these points the degradation of organic compounds can occur at different phs the maximum removal efficiency at initial ph 7 03 can be explained with this approach so it can be said that the removal efficiency of the eo process is not only related to initial wastewater ph but also to the variation in ph during eo 3 2 effect of current density the impact of cd on the cod toc tn tss and color removal was examined at 4 73 9 47 and 14 20 ma cm2 cds at initial ph of 7 03 and reaction temperature of 25 c without using se and reaction time of 4 h according to the results as cd increased all remaining pollution parameters decreased fig 4 for this situation it can be said that the increase in cd greatly speeded up the removal of pollutants due to the production of more electrons 41 but at higher cd generation of additional electrons may contribute to unwanted side reactions such as parasitic loss reactions causing the consumption of hypochlorite concentration 42 43 results for 4 73 9 47 and 14 20 ma cm2 on cod toc tn tss and color removal for each cd are 78 2 71 5 78 7 89 6 and 88 1 91 4 94 5 97 6 98 8 and 99 2 and 96 1 96 2 98 2 99 8 and 99 2 respectively as seen the concentrations of cod and toc decreased to 96 1 and 96 2 thus confirming the degradation of organic compounds existing in the sww by the low amount of electrically produced oxidative species and chemisorbed oxygen on the anode surface it is clear from the results that even at lower cd s the removal efficiency was good for all pollutants this situation suggests that oxidation is based on the characteristic of the electrode and that it might be executed by both direct oxidation of pollutants by electrons transferred to the electrode surface and indirect oxidation oxidation with electrogenerated hydroxyl radicals oh formed from water discharge at the anode surface m eq 5 44 the activity of the oh radicals is strongly related to their interaction with the electrode surface m 5 m h2o m oh h e although the removal of pollutants is largely dependent on the applied cd the type and characteristic of the anode material used is also very effective ti pt electrodes are categorized as active material 45 46 according to the literature 47 49 low amounts of reactive m oh are formed by oxidation at ti pt electrodes eq 5 because the strong m oh interaction and low o2 evolution overpotential facilitates oxidation to yield the weaker mox chemisorbed oxygen on anode surface species 62 the mox species favoring partial conversion of the pollutants p eq 6 6 p mox m pox finally they are oxidized with low m o h radicals until thorough oxidation co2 and h2o is achieved eq 7 7 p o x m o h c o 2 h 2 o this situation lengthens the time of electrolysis as previously reviewed by other authors 48 50 3 3 effect of supporting electrolyte type and concentration the effect of se type on the cod toc tn tss and color removal was examined at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd natural initial sww ph 7 03 and temperature of 25 c using different se s nacl nano3 and na2so4 at 0 1 m se concentration and reaction time of 4 h sorting nacl nano3 and na2so4 by removal efficiency the following order was found nacl nano3 na2so4 electrolyte nacl has the highest removal efficiency which is similar to observations reported in the literature 51 52 the highest yield was seen in this se owing to the formation of strong oxidizing species such as chlorine radical hypochlorous acid hclo and hypochlorite ion clo 53 nano3 and na2so4 electrolytes were not as effective as nacl this situation was explained by fil et al 54 as being due to na2so4 and nano3 electrolytes not including chloride ions in their molecular structures and they may change into a more stable media that is broken down by direct electrolysis also the reason for lower efficiency of the process in nano3 and na2so4 media compared to nacl is because both are inert electrolytes unlike nacl which produces active chlorine species 55 56 using se leads to an increase in the removal efficiency for all pollutants numerical results are illustrated in table 2 and the removal efficiency graph is shown in fig 5 a to investigate the effect of se concentration on removal efficiency nacl was chosen as se with different concentrations 0 01 0 025 0 05 0 1 m at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd natural initial sww ph 7 03 temperature of 25 c for 4 h reaction time the removal efficiency at se concentration of 0 1 m was cod 96 2 color 100 tn 94 2 toc 93 9 and tss 100 at 0 05 m se concentration removal efficiency was observed as cod 94 6 color 99 9 tn 93 8 toc 92 0 and tss 100 at 0 025 m se concentration results were observed as cod 92 2 color 99 9 tn 93 5 toc 88 0 and tss 99 5 and at 0 01 m se concentration the removal efficiency for cod 88 2 color 99 5 tn 80 0 toc 85 0 and tss 98 9 was observed the indirect oxidation process varied with the nacl concentration in sww it is well recognized that electrolysis of chloride solutions in a disunited cell includes the anodic oxidation of cl to provide soluble cl2 44 8 2cl cl2 aq 2e there is accompanying attenuation of water at the cathode which provides oh and h2 g if the concentration of solubilized chlorine exceeds its solubility supersaturation results in the creation of cl2 g blisters 44 since the electro produced chlorine spreads away from the anode trichloride ions can occur by means of reaction with chloride ions 9 cl2 aq cl cl3 as an alternative chlorine is quickly hydrolyzed and forms hypochlorous acid and chloride ions 10 cl2 aq h2o hclo cl h hypochlorous acid is in equilibrium with the hypochlorite ion 11 hclo clo h the prepotent species is soluble chlorine up to ph near 3 hclo at ph between 3 and 8 and clo above ph 8 44 on the other hand depending on the conditions of operation the possibility of chlorate formation may also be considered 12 clo 2hclo clo3 2cl 2h chlorate may promote indirect removal of organics in the course of indirect oxidation an elevation in nacl concentration gives rise to stepped interchange of the oxygen alteration reaction to more favorable potentials when checked against electrolysis applied in the lack of se similar observations are reported in the literature 44 57 58 as can be seen from both numerical and graphic results fig 5 b at 0 025 m and above the removal efficiency for all pollutants did not change much also the use of 0 01 and 0 025 m nacl reduced the energy consumption and results are close to each other in the same way the use of 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl produced almost the same results to decide the optimum electrolyte concentration it is important to know whether the discharge standards are achieved when the concentration is applied with the use of 0 025 m discharge limits 2 of sww s are provided for the effluent concentration of cod 120 mg l tn 10 mg l and tss 0 mg l so it can be concluded that the concentration of 0 025 is sufficient to achieve the discharge limits consequently the addition of chloride had a considerable effect on the treatment of sww by eo even with both low cd and low concentration of chloride 3 4 effect of dilution rate of sww to investigate the effect of dilution rate the raw sww was diluted with tap water to 1 1 raw wastewater 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 5 and experiments were conducted at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd natural sww ph 7 03 temperature of 25 c and 4 h reaction time without using any se all pollutant removal efficiencies are illustrated in fig 6 the reduction in dilution factors resulted in an increase in the removal efficiency owing to the reduced pollution concentration however this would not be suitable for an industrial process as it would require the need to purify more water due to the use of even more water similar observations are available in the literature 59 60 for all dilution rates results are given in table 3 3 5 energy consumption like all treatment methods the cost of the system is as important as the removal efficiency for the eo process while this study was carried out to treat 700 ml of wastewater the energy consumption values were calculated for all operational parameters as the amount of energy consumed per cubic meter of wastewater eq 1 in order to create an estimate for an industrial plant after deciding the optimum operation conditions to calculate the energy consumption as the amount of energy spent per removed kg cod eq 3 was used 3 5 1 effect of initial ph on energy consumption the influence of the initial ph on the energy consumption related to cod removal is presented in fig 7 the maximum energy consumption per m3 wastewater from maximum to minimum is as follows ph7 03 ph8 ph5 ph3 ph9 for initial phs this situation is related to the hno3 and naoh added to the wastewater which increased the conductivity of the wastewater and the increase in conductivity decreased the potential difference applied to the system in experiments with constant cd 4 73 ma cm2 on the other hand the highest removal efficiency for all pollutants was observed at sww s natural ph 7 03 which did not need chemicals for adjustment of ph see fig 2 in order to achieve cost advantages high removal capability and low energy utilization should be chosen when the energy consumption values are considered it is clear that the lowest consumption value is at ph 9 but when the cost approach is considered according to industrial applications it is obvious that the cost will increase depending on the amount of base to be used to increase the original waste water ph value to 9 in such cases different parameters should be evaluated in order to make a decision more importantly it should be decided whether the priority goal is the removal efficiency or the cost advantage 3 5 2 effect of current density on energy consumption energy consumption was calculated for 4 73 9 47 and 14 20 ma cm2 cd for operation conditions fixed as initial ph of 7 03 25 c temperature 4 h reaction time without se the results are shown in fig 8 it is obviously seen from fig 8 that as the cd increases the potential difference applied to the system and cod removal efficiency increases and the rise in the potential difference increases the energy consumption increasing cd accelerates the eo process and reduces the reaction time but according to faraday s law the increase in cd increases the consumption of electrodes 61 above 4 73 ma cm² energy consumption increased significantly so these cds are not applicable at real scales this is why 4 73 ma cm² was chosen as fixed cd for further studies 3 5 3 effect of supporting electrolyte type on energy consumption the change in the energy consumption of the system versus time is shown graphically in fig 9 for nacl nano3 and na2so4 at fixed concentration of 0 01 m under operation conditions of 25 c temperature ph 7 03 and 4 h reaction time when the results are examined it is seen that the se type significantly affects the energy consumption the energy consumption for each type of se is lower than the energy consumption obtained from the trials without se the reason for this is that the solubility of the se used are very high resulting in good ionization in the solution medium and thus increased electrical conductivity of the solutions an increase in the electrical conductivity of the solution causes a decrease in the potential difference applied at the constant current which results in low energy consumption at the end of the reaction consumption of energy values can be listed without se nano3 na2so4 and nacl as 243 31 206 86 191 80 and 174 31 kw h m3 respectively nacl has minimum energy consumption among other salts because of its high solubility and good ionization in solution even at very low concentration 0 01 m nacl there was 28 35 less energy consumption compared to the experiment without se when deciding on the electrolyte type the ionization the capacity to reduce the potential difference the behavior of reducing the energy consumption and the indirect removal efficiency on pollutant parameters should also be taken into account because when applied in a real facility tons of the electrolyte considered to be the most suitable will be used considering all respects the most suitable electrolyte is nacl 3 5 4 effect of supporting electrolyte concentration on energy consumption to investigate the effect of se concentration on energy consumption nacl was chosen as target electrolyte studies were carried out with 0 01 0 025 0 05 and 0 1 m se concentrations at fixed 25 c reaction temperature 4 73 ma cm2 cd initial ph of 7 03 and 4 h reaction time results are shown in fig 10 when fig 10 is examined increasing the se concentration decreases the energy consumption and increases the cod removal the conductivity of the wastewater increases as the amount of se added to the system increases and this leads to a decrease in the potential difference required to pass the same current through the system so the consumption of energy reduces at the end of the reaction values of energy consumption can be listed for concentration of 0 01 m 0 025 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl as 174 31 153 57 143 43 and 118 86 kw h m3 respectively it can be seen from fig 10 that the use of 0 01 and 0 025 m nacl reduced the energy consumption and results are close to each other in the same way the use of 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl produced almost the same results although the application of increasing concentration of se may have a reducing impact on energy consumption when deciding the optimum concentration of se it should also be noted that the effluent must meet the discharge standards specified for that wastewater with the use of 0 025 m discharge limits 2 of sww s are ensured for the effluent concentration of cod 120 mg l tn 10 mg l and tss 0 mg l so it can be concluded that the concentration of 0 025 nacl is sufficient to achieve the discharge limits optimum conditions are accepted as the use of 0 025 m nacl and 25 c reaction temperature at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd and initial sww ph of 7 03 for 4 h reaction time in terms of both energy consumptions and removal efficiency for treatment of sww also energy consumption value for per kg cod calculated for 0 025 m was 14 12 kw h kg cod 3 5 5 effect of dilution rate on energy consumption to understand the real effect of dilution rate on the energy consumption this study was conducted in an environment without se at constant 25 c reaction temperature 4 73 ma cm2 cd and 4 h reaction time fig 11 exhibits the plot of energy consumption per m3 wastewater versus dilution rate and cod removal efficiency it is clearly seen from the figure that the energy consumption increases with increasing dilution rate energy consumption values for dilution rates of 1 1 raw wastewater 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 were calculated as 243 31 284 54 297 06 and 320 03 kw h m3 the increased dilution rate decreases the pollution in the wastewater but on the other hand it reduces the electrical conductivity of the sww due to the electrical conductivity of tap water 0 285 ms cm in this study being lower than the sww 3 04 ms cm therefore energy consumption increased as a result of the increased resistance in the system the dilution rate is a natural process that occurs as a result of washing the equipment in the slaughterhouse plants as tap water is mixed with wastewater pollutants are diluted and can be oxidized more easily by the eo process on the other hand because the electrical conductivity of the tap water is less than sww it causes a higher potential difference during the eo process as a result of this situation the amount of energy consumed by the system increases therefore minimum water consumption during the washing operations in slaughterhouses will result in less energy consumption for the treatment of these wastewaters with eo 4 conclusions in this study the aim was to treat sww with eo using a ti pt mesh anode under different operation conditions according to the experiments it was found that the removal of the organic content of sww by eo with ti pt mesh anode was very efficient with respect to the results the removal of all pollutants was observed to be maximum at swws natural ph 7 03 the most effective electrolyte was found to be nacl the highest removal efficacy was seen with the use of 0 1 m nacl but the application of this concentration on an industrial scale means the use of tons of nacl taking into consideration the discharge limits of sww s and contribution to low energy consumption the optimum concentration was selected as 0 025 m as the cd increased an obvious increase was seen on removal efficiency but 4 73 ma cm² was chosen to minimize the consumption of energy the dilution rate affected the removal efficiency positively but caused a decrease in the electrical conductivity because of the lower conductivity of tap water compared to sww hence it caused an increase in the energy consumption therefore minimum water consumption during washing operations in slaughterhouses will result in less energy consumption for the treatment of these wastewaters with eo optimum conditions for the treatment of sww with eo were found to be natural initial ph of 7 03 4 73 ma cm² cd using 0 025 m nacl without dilution reaction time of 4 h at reaction temperature of 25 c under these optimum conditions tss toc cod tn and color removal efficiencies were found to be 99 5 88 0 92 2 93 5 and 99 9 respectively four hours of electrolysis were completed at 153 57 kw h m3 14 12 kw h kg cod and the energy cost under optimum removal conditions was calculated as 1 69 kg cod also the results clearly demonstrate that almost full mineralization of organics was obtained after 4 h treatment unluckily taking into account the large volumes of effluent produced per slaughtering cycle the need for long treatment times is impractical yet if the reactor is developed to arrange the hydrodynamic conditions or combined with another treatment process which shortens the eo treatment time such as ef a novel setup may be possible acknowledgement this study was part of the doctoral thesis of dilara ozturk this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
14327,in this study investigation of the applicability and efficiency of electrochemical oxidation eo processes for slaughterhouse wastewater was targeted by evaluating the treatment efficiency and energy consumption values together the effect of operating parameters such as type of supporting electrolyte se na2so4 nano3 and nacl concentration of se 0 01 0 1 m initial wastewater ph 3 9 current density cd 4 73 14 20 ma cm2 and dilution rate of wastewater 1 1 1 4 on removal of chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss and color were investigated the most effective electrolyte type was observed as nacl with the use of 0 025 m nacl and 25 c reaction temperature at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd and ph of 7 03 for 4 h reaction time the optimum conditions for both energy consumption and removal efficiency for treatment of sww were obtained at optimum conditions tss toc cod tn and color removal efficiencies were found as 99 5 88 0 92 2 93 5 and 99 9 respectively and the energy consumption under these conditions were 153 57 kwh m3 and 14 12 kwh kg cod the energy cost was calculated as 1 69 kg cod also results distinctly show that almost full mineralization of organics is obtained after 4 h treatment unluckily taking into account the large volumes of effluent produced per slaughtering cycle the need for long treatment times is impractical yet if the reactor is developed to include hydrodynamic conditions or combined with another treatment process which is shorter than the eo treatment time a novel setup may be possible keywords electrochemical oxidation slaughterhouse wastewater energy consumption 1 introduction it is critical to secure the environment against the growing human population and rapid industrialization industrial wastewaters may contain assorted organic or inorganic contaminants slaughterhouses are a section of an expansive industry because meat is included in the basic diet of humans meat consumption continues to increase with an acceleration in the last decades 1 the slaughterhouse sector produces a significant amount of wastewater from both production and non production units owing to the slaughtering of animals and cleaning of the slaughterhouse plants 2 wastewater contains substantial biodegradable organic compounds like biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen phosphorus oil and grease due to suspended solids and colloidal matters such as fat blood protein and cellulose 3 4 also these wastewaters contain trace amounts of drug residues because of antibiotics vaccines and other pharmaceuticals pathogenic and non pathogenic microorganisms and detergent if such wastewater is discharged into the receiving environment without treatment it can reduce the dissolved oxygen level and thus negatively affect biological life 5 6 for this reason it is necessary to treat wastewater before discharge into aquatic media commonly slaughterhouse wastewater sww treatment approaches use biological processes such as activated sludge 7 8 stabilization ponds 9 anaerobic reactors 10 and combined processes 11 12 though these frameworks are successful they generally require lengthy hydraulic retention time expansive areas and huge amounts of created sludge 13 14 sww s may involve deleterious and non biodegradable organic matter biological treatment may be inadequate sww generally contains blood as is known electrolytes and ions in blood induce electrical conductivity this makes the treatment of sww s with electrochemical processes advantageous to treat the sww s many electrochemical methods were investigated studies mainly focus on the ec technique and combined or hybrid processes and fewer examine the single eo process ün et al 15 investigated hybrid processes for the treatment of cattle sww using aluminum and iron electrodes they evaluated the impacts of cd initial ph and se na2so4 concentration on the efficiency of the system in the case of aluminum electrodes polyaluminum chloride pac was utilized as the coagulant aid cod removal of 94 4 was obtained by adding 0 75 g l pac with the use of an iron electrode ec was conducted simultaneously with the fenton process according to the results 81 1 cod removal was achieved by adding 9 h2o2 poultry slaughterhouse wastewater psw treatment using the electro fenton process was investigated by davarnejad and nasiri 16 the effect of ph reaction time volume ratio of h2o2 psw ml l cd h2o2 fe2 molar ratio was investigated on the color and cod removal they found the optimum conditions were reaction time of 55 60 min h2o2 fe2 molar ratio of 3 73 ph of 4 38 cd of 74 07 ma cm2 and volume ratio of h2o2 psw of 1 63 ml l for 92 3 cod removal and ph of 3 39 reaction time of 49 22 min h2o2 fe2 molar ratio of 3 62 cd of 67 90 ma cm2 and volume ratio of h2o2 psw of 1 44 ml l for 88 0 color removal another study was completed by eryuruk et al 17 about treatment of poultry sww s with electrochemical methods the impact of cd se na2so4 concentration feed rate of wastewater ph and the polyelectrolyte substance were investigated in a continuous flow system also they investigated the peroxy electrocoagulation by using h2o2 with several concentrations to reach maximum efficiency when wastewater was exposed to the peroxy electrocoagulation cod removal efficiency of 95 4 was obtained treatment of poultry sww by ec was investigated batchwise by kobya et al 18 the most elevated cod removal efficiency was 93 with aluminum and maximum oil grease removal of 98 was obtained with iron electrodes as can be seen sww s were treated successfully using ec post treatment of sww using eo was investigated by awang et al 19 the effects of cd reaction time and influent cod on color cod and bod removal efficiencies and ph were investigated in a batch system sodium sulfate na2so4 was selected as se and aluminum electrodes were used the optimum conditions were 220 mg l influent cod 30 ma cm2 cd and reaction time of 55 min under these conditions removal of color bod and cod were 96 8 81 3 85 0 respectively using aluminum electrodes with electrochemical post treatment of sww was successful for color bod and cod removal another study carried out by abdelhay et al 20 about anodic oxidation of sww on boron doped diamond examined the effect of process variables the effect of process variables cd initial wastewater ph se nature and concentration of electro coagulant on the removal of color turbidity and cod removal was investigated as a result raising the cd had a positive effect on all pollutants sodium sulfate na2so4 was less effective than nacl for cod removal complete removal of cod was completed in the presence of nacl 1 as se the turbidity in wastewater was reduced by 98 with the simultaneous use of fecl3 and na2so4 owing to ec ec is frequently applied due to its low energy consumption and high removal efficiency nevertheless these processes cause secondary waste additionally in ec electrodes dissolve over time and need to be replaced with new ones therefore it is useful to test the processes that are as effective as the ec process but which do not create secondary waste eo of organic compounds is an advanced oxidation process aop which permits total mineralization of organic matter 21 the organic and deleterious contaminants in wastewaters decompose mainly via a direct anodic process or via indirect anodic oxidation by the production of oxidants like hydroxyl radicals and ozone in eo 22 oxidation of the organic pollutants occurs on the anodes by active oxygen like hydroxyl radicals oh with the direct oxidation route indirect oxidation begins in the presence of chlorine ions as creation of chlorine or hypochlorite oxidizes the inorganic organic matters 23 eo has many advantages in comparison with conventional and other aop treatment methods they involve no subsidiary waste generation such as expended sorbents sullied retentate ferric hydroxide waste or waste activated sludge that occurs with adsorption filtration fenton reactions and biological processes respectively eo has the advantage of easy inspection via operation and does not require extra chemicals to control the process eo is applicable for the treatment of industrial wastewaters owing to good electric conductivity of the wastewaters 21 also eo is appropriate for colored and blurred wastewater which is difficult to clarify with photo degradation and catalysis 21 but as in other processes eo has inconveniences these are abrasion passivation and polarization of electrodes and high energy consumption when electrochemical technologies are compared with other technologies they consume much more energy but are more efficient and more compact it is critical to emphasize that electrochemical reactors work with dc current which can be obtained from renewable energy sources like photovoltaic cells pv 24 in the eo process use of se energy consumption is reduced while the efficiency of the treatment is increased polarization of the anodes and cathodes occurs with low mass conduction and the gases aggregate on the surface of electrode and this gives rise to the exhaustion of electro active species in the border coat of the electrode 21 abrasion of the electrodes is another problem caused by oxidation reactions of the anode and the formation of abrasive products on the surface of electrode for instance cl2 g this issue can be solved by improving new electrode materials or by choosing optimal anode materials various electrodes are used in eo of organic pollutants in wastewaters such as graphite electrodes metal electrodes mixed metal oxide electrodes mmo boron doped diamond bdd electrodes etc 25 27 because of their long service life abrasion resistance and high potential to produce oxygen and hydroxyl radicals by electrochemical reactions taking into consideration that electrochemical processes are compact and simple to automate 28 the improvement of small sized electrochemical wastewater treatment systems to treat sww might become an alternative to be explored as far as the authors are aware there are many studies about electrochemical treatments of sww s and there are fewer studies about the use of single eo processes on sww s but there are no published studies investigating the combination of many parameters efficiency using ti pt anodes on cattle sww s treatment in a single eo process the authors also intend to contribute to the literature by predicting the feasibility and efficiency of a single eo operation with active anodes ti pt on an industrial scale for sww s 2 material and method 2 1 materials and characterization of wastewater the wastewater used in this work was collected from a cattle slaughterhouse van turkey the sample was taken from the main effluent outlet and stored at 4 c before use in experiments and further studies the chemical analysis of sww is shown in table 1 which was reported in the previous study öztürk et al 2019 except biochemical oxygen demand bod and oil grease analyses giving the maximum and minimum values of the samples taken during 6 months all chemicals utilized in this study were purchased from e merck with a purity of 99 4 mesh type ti pt and ti electrodes were selected as anode and cathode respectively because of highest electrocatalytic activity towards organic oxidation 29 ti pt electrodes were chosen as anode 2 2 experimental setup the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 1 a glass jacketed reactor for the circulation of the coolant liquid antifreeze was used in experiments wastewater of 700 ml was used in the batch studies during the study using three 3 ti pt mesh type anodes and three 3 ti mesh type cathodes the total areas of the electrodes were calculated as 1056 cm² all electrodes had rectangular shape with dimensions of 40 mm x 200 mm the distance between the electrodes was the least possible 3 mm because decreasing the space between the electrodes reduces energy consumption 30 electrodes were connected in parallel ti pt and ti electrodes are reported in the literature for use in several studies about wastewater treatments 31 33 in order to provide the required electric current during the trials a tti qpx1200s model digital controlled direct current dc power supply 0 60 v 0 50 a was used wtw multi340i multimeter was utilized to adjust the ph conductivity and temperature values of the sww at the beginning of the reaction and to read these values momentarily during the reaction the initial sww ph was adjusted with nitric acid 0 1 m or sodium hydroxide 0 1 m due to the nature of the eo process there is an increase in heat during the reaction so a temperature controlled liquid circulator labo c200 h13 was used to keep the sww at a constant temperature all experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure and constant temperature 25 c the electrolysis time in the eo process is highly effective both on the removal of pollutants from the system and on energy consumption several preliminary tests were performed before deciding the reaction time as a result of the experiments it was observed that the eo rate of all pollutants was slow this may be due to the properties of the anode material used for this reason the reaction time was chosen as 4 h to observe satisfactory removal efficiency and provide the discharge standards 2 3 analytical methods cod was measured with the closed reflux colorimetric method according to the standard methods for measurement 34 color measurements were carried out using the platinum cobalt standard method 35 with a spectrophotometer spectroquant prove300 according to method 180 before color analysis the ph values of the samples were set to 7 6 as recommended by the ncasi method 36 and filtered by means of 0 4 mm filter paper deionized water was used as a blank tn readings were completed with the nitrogen total cell test method based on peroxydisulfate oxidation 2 6 dimethylphenol by using a spectrophotometer spectroquant prove 300 according to the method of 108 toc was measured with a toc analyzer shimadzu toc l at 680 c the lovibond water testing photometer system md100 was used for tss measurements the photometric specification of suspended solids is based upon a gravimetric method this is ordinarily based on evaporation of the filter remnant of a filtered water specimen in a stove at 103 105 c and weighing of the dried remnant for higher accuracy we performed a gravimetric determination of samples the results of the photometric method are consistent with the results of the gravimetric method with a margin of error of 1 the energy consumption was calculated using eq 1 1 e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n k w h m 3 v x i x t v where v volt is potential difference i ampere is current intensity t hour is time and v m 3 is sww volume during the process the amount of electrochemical energy consumption and per kg of removed cod was calculated using eq 2 37 2 e k w h k g c o d v x i x t δ c x v r where v is the average of applied voltage v i is the applied current a t is the time of reaction h δ c is the difference between the input and output cod to the reactor mg l and vr is the sww volume l removal efficiency was calculated by eq 3 3 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c t c 0 x 100 where c0 and ct are pollutant concentration before and after the reaction with time t respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial ph of sww the ph of wastewater could have both a positive and a negative effect on the mineralization of organics as it affects the stability of various hydroxide species that form the impact of initial ph on cod toc tn tss and color removal was firstly examined in this way ph values of 3 5 natural ph 7 03 8 and 9 were investigated at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd without using se and fixed reaction temperature of 25 c and reaction time of 4 h fig 2 the removal efficiency for all pollutants increased when the initial ph value of the wastewater increased from 3 to 7 03 while the removal efficiencies at ph 7 03 and 8 were close to each other the effluent efficiency decreased abruptly when the ph increased to 9 moreover tss and color removal efficiencies did not change much at ph values other than ph 9 this indicates that the degradation with ti pt performed well in wide ranges of ph which means ph adjustment is not required if ph of 9 is not exceeded and thus treatment costs will be reduced in practical applications initial ph of sww was a very substantial parameter for the treatment of sww by eo it can be seen from the results that the removal efficiency for all selected pollutants in the sww was highest at neutral ph 7 03 and quite low in very acidic 3 and basic 9 conditions the removal yield was less in acidic conditions owing to oh instability and noticeably more in alkali solution owing to formation of ocl ion indicating that the basic or neutral ph situations were more favorable under acidic conditions to produce hocl the ocl and h ions undergo the reverse reaction of combining with each other eq 4 38 so ocl ions prefer the reverse reaction rather than oxidizing the pollutants due to its instability also acidic conditions considerably reduce the concentration of notable oxidative radicals of oh produced on anodes 39 4 hocl h ocl on the other hand active chlorine at high ph is found as hypochlorite which is a less potent oxidant of organic species than hypochlorite acid 40 the removal efficiencies depend on the initial ph value as well as the ph values during the process fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the effluent at all ph generally increased during the first 90 min of reaction and then began to slightly decrease or remain stable until 240 min the ph rises owing to the release of more oh ions than protons in the solution due to reactions on the cathode and anode in cases where eo is dominant a tendency for ph to remain constant or slightly increase is observed after 90 min ph decreases which could be due to the formation of hocl at this point the ph of the media is either more acidic or basic depending on whether hocl or ocl is dominant at these points the degradation of organic compounds can occur at different phs the maximum removal efficiency at initial ph 7 03 can be explained with this approach so it can be said that the removal efficiency of the eo process is not only related to initial wastewater ph but also to the variation in ph during eo 3 2 effect of current density the impact of cd on the cod toc tn tss and color removal was examined at 4 73 9 47 and 14 20 ma cm2 cds at initial ph of 7 03 and reaction temperature of 25 c without using se and reaction time of 4 h according to the results as cd increased all remaining pollution parameters decreased fig 4 for this situation it can be said that the increase in cd greatly speeded up the removal of pollutants due to the production of more electrons 41 but at higher cd generation of additional electrons may contribute to unwanted side reactions such as parasitic loss reactions causing the consumption of hypochlorite concentration 42 43 results for 4 73 9 47 and 14 20 ma cm2 on cod toc tn tss and color removal for each cd are 78 2 71 5 78 7 89 6 and 88 1 91 4 94 5 97 6 98 8 and 99 2 and 96 1 96 2 98 2 99 8 and 99 2 respectively as seen the concentrations of cod and toc decreased to 96 1 and 96 2 thus confirming the degradation of organic compounds existing in the sww by the low amount of electrically produced oxidative species and chemisorbed oxygen on the anode surface it is clear from the results that even at lower cd s the removal efficiency was good for all pollutants this situation suggests that oxidation is based on the characteristic of the electrode and that it might be executed by both direct oxidation of pollutants by electrons transferred to the electrode surface and indirect oxidation oxidation with electrogenerated hydroxyl radicals oh formed from water discharge at the anode surface m eq 5 44 the activity of the oh radicals is strongly related to their interaction with the electrode surface m 5 m h2o m oh h e although the removal of pollutants is largely dependent on the applied cd the type and characteristic of the anode material used is also very effective ti pt electrodes are categorized as active material 45 46 according to the literature 47 49 low amounts of reactive m oh are formed by oxidation at ti pt electrodes eq 5 because the strong m oh interaction and low o2 evolution overpotential facilitates oxidation to yield the weaker mox chemisorbed oxygen on anode surface species 62 the mox species favoring partial conversion of the pollutants p eq 6 6 p mox m pox finally they are oxidized with low m o h radicals until thorough oxidation co2 and h2o is achieved eq 7 7 p o x m o h c o 2 h 2 o this situation lengthens the time of electrolysis as previously reviewed by other authors 48 50 3 3 effect of supporting electrolyte type and concentration the effect of se type on the cod toc tn tss and color removal was examined at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd natural initial sww ph 7 03 and temperature of 25 c using different se s nacl nano3 and na2so4 at 0 1 m se concentration and reaction time of 4 h sorting nacl nano3 and na2so4 by removal efficiency the following order was found nacl nano3 na2so4 electrolyte nacl has the highest removal efficiency which is similar to observations reported in the literature 51 52 the highest yield was seen in this se owing to the formation of strong oxidizing species such as chlorine radical hypochlorous acid hclo and hypochlorite ion clo 53 nano3 and na2so4 electrolytes were not as effective as nacl this situation was explained by fil et al 54 as being due to na2so4 and nano3 electrolytes not including chloride ions in their molecular structures and they may change into a more stable media that is broken down by direct electrolysis also the reason for lower efficiency of the process in nano3 and na2so4 media compared to nacl is because both are inert electrolytes unlike nacl which produces active chlorine species 55 56 using se leads to an increase in the removal efficiency for all pollutants numerical results are illustrated in table 2 and the removal efficiency graph is shown in fig 5 a to investigate the effect of se concentration on removal efficiency nacl was chosen as se with different concentrations 0 01 0 025 0 05 0 1 m at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd natural initial sww ph 7 03 temperature of 25 c for 4 h reaction time the removal efficiency at se concentration of 0 1 m was cod 96 2 color 100 tn 94 2 toc 93 9 and tss 100 at 0 05 m se concentration removal efficiency was observed as cod 94 6 color 99 9 tn 93 8 toc 92 0 and tss 100 at 0 025 m se concentration results were observed as cod 92 2 color 99 9 tn 93 5 toc 88 0 and tss 99 5 and at 0 01 m se concentration the removal efficiency for cod 88 2 color 99 5 tn 80 0 toc 85 0 and tss 98 9 was observed the indirect oxidation process varied with the nacl concentration in sww it is well recognized that electrolysis of chloride solutions in a disunited cell includes the anodic oxidation of cl to provide soluble cl2 44 8 2cl cl2 aq 2e there is accompanying attenuation of water at the cathode which provides oh and h2 g if the concentration of solubilized chlorine exceeds its solubility supersaturation results in the creation of cl2 g blisters 44 since the electro produced chlorine spreads away from the anode trichloride ions can occur by means of reaction with chloride ions 9 cl2 aq cl cl3 as an alternative chlorine is quickly hydrolyzed and forms hypochlorous acid and chloride ions 10 cl2 aq h2o hclo cl h hypochlorous acid is in equilibrium with the hypochlorite ion 11 hclo clo h the prepotent species is soluble chlorine up to ph near 3 hclo at ph between 3 and 8 and clo above ph 8 44 on the other hand depending on the conditions of operation the possibility of chlorate formation may also be considered 12 clo 2hclo clo3 2cl 2h chlorate may promote indirect removal of organics in the course of indirect oxidation an elevation in nacl concentration gives rise to stepped interchange of the oxygen alteration reaction to more favorable potentials when checked against electrolysis applied in the lack of se similar observations are reported in the literature 44 57 58 as can be seen from both numerical and graphic results fig 5 b at 0 025 m and above the removal efficiency for all pollutants did not change much also the use of 0 01 and 0 025 m nacl reduced the energy consumption and results are close to each other in the same way the use of 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl produced almost the same results to decide the optimum electrolyte concentration it is important to know whether the discharge standards are achieved when the concentration is applied with the use of 0 025 m discharge limits 2 of sww s are provided for the effluent concentration of cod 120 mg l tn 10 mg l and tss 0 mg l so it can be concluded that the concentration of 0 025 is sufficient to achieve the discharge limits consequently the addition of chloride had a considerable effect on the treatment of sww by eo even with both low cd and low concentration of chloride 3 4 effect of dilution rate of sww to investigate the effect of dilution rate the raw sww was diluted with tap water to 1 1 raw wastewater 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 5 and experiments were conducted at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd natural sww ph 7 03 temperature of 25 c and 4 h reaction time without using any se all pollutant removal efficiencies are illustrated in fig 6 the reduction in dilution factors resulted in an increase in the removal efficiency owing to the reduced pollution concentration however this would not be suitable for an industrial process as it would require the need to purify more water due to the use of even more water similar observations are available in the literature 59 60 for all dilution rates results are given in table 3 3 5 energy consumption like all treatment methods the cost of the system is as important as the removal efficiency for the eo process while this study was carried out to treat 700 ml of wastewater the energy consumption values were calculated for all operational parameters as the amount of energy consumed per cubic meter of wastewater eq 1 in order to create an estimate for an industrial plant after deciding the optimum operation conditions to calculate the energy consumption as the amount of energy spent per removed kg cod eq 3 was used 3 5 1 effect of initial ph on energy consumption the influence of the initial ph on the energy consumption related to cod removal is presented in fig 7 the maximum energy consumption per m3 wastewater from maximum to minimum is as follows ph7 03 ph8 ph5 ph3 ph9 for initial phs this situation is related to the hno3 and naoh added to the wastewater which increased the conductivity of the wastewater and the increase in conductivity decreased the potential difference applied to the system in experiments with constant cd 4 73 ma cm2 on the other hand the highest removal efficiency for all pollutants was observed at sww s natural ph 7 03 which did not need chemicals for adjustment of ph see fig 2 in order to achieve cost advantages high removal capability and low energy utilization should be chosen when the energy consumption values are considered it is clear that the lowest consumption value is at ph 9 but when the cost approach is considered according to industrial applications it is obvious that the cost will increase depending on the amount of base to be used to increase the original waste water ph value to 9 in such cases different parameters should be evaluated in order to make a decision more importantly it should be decided whether the priority goal is the removal efficiency or the cost advantage 3 5 2 effect of current density on energy consumption energy consumption was calculated for 4 73 9 47 and 14 20 ma cm2 cd for operation conditions fixed as initial ph of 7 03 25 c temperature 4 h reaction time without se the results are shown in fig 8 it is obviously seen from fig 8 that as the cd increases the potential difference applied to the system and cod removal efficiency increases and the rise in the potential difference increases the energy consumption increasing cd accelerates the eo process and reduces the reaction time but according to faraday s law the increase in cd increases the consumption of electrodes 61 above 4 73 ma cm² energy consumption increased significantly so these cds are not applicable at real scales this is why 4 73 ma cm² was chosen as fixed cd for further studies 3 5 3 effect of supporting electrolyte type on energy consumption the change in the energy consumption of the system versus time is shown graphically in fig 9 for nacl nano3 and na2so4 at fixed concentration of 0 01 m under operation conditions of 25 c temperature ph 7 03 and 4 h reaction time when the results are examined it is seen that the se type significantly affects the energy consumption the energy consumption for each type of se is lower than the energy consumption obtained from the trials without se the reason for this is that the solubility of the se used are very high resulting in good ionization in the solution medium and thus increased electrical conductivity of the solutions an increase in the electrical conductivity of the solution causes a decrease in the potential difference applied at the constant current which results in low energy consumption at the end of the reaction consumption of energy values can be listed without se nano3 na2so4 and nacl as 243 31 206 86 191 80 and 174 31 kw h m3 respectively nacl has minimum energy consumption among other salts because of its high solubility and good ionization in solution even at very low concentration 0 01 m nacl there was 28 35 less energy consumption compared to the experiment without se when deciding on the electrolyte type the ionization the capacity to reduce the potential difference the behavior of reducing the energy consumption and the indirect removal efficiency on pollutant parameters should also be taken into account because when applied in a real facility tons of the electrolyte considered to be the most suitable will be used considering all respects the most suitable electrolyte is nacl 3 5 4 effect of supporting electrolyte concentration on energy consumption to investigate the effect of se concentration on energy consumption nacl was chosen as target electrolyte studies were carried out with 0 01 0 025 0 05 and 0 1 m se concentrations at fixed 25 c reaction temperature 4 73 ma cm2 cd initial ph of 7 03 and 4 h reaction time results are shown in fig 10 when fig 10 is examined increasing the se concentration decreases the energy consumption and increases the cod removal the conductivity of the wastewater increases as the amount of se added to the system increases and this leads to a decrease in the potential difference required to pass the same current through the system so the consumption of energy reduces at the end of the reaction values of energy consumption can be listed for concentration of 0 01 m 0 025 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl as 174 31 153 57 143 43 and 118 86 kw h m3 respectively it can be seen from fig 10 that the use of 0 01 and 0 025 m nacl reduced the energy consumption and results are close to each other in the same way the use of 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl produced almost the same results although the application of increasing concentration of se may have a reducing impact on energy consumption when deciding the optimum concentration of se it should also be noted that the effluent must meet the discharge standards specified for that wastewater with the use of 0 025 m discharge limits 2 of sww s are ensured for the effluent concentration of cod 120 mg l tn 10 mg l and tss 0 mg l so it can be concluded that the concentration of 0 025 nacl is sufficient to achieve the discharge limits optimum conditions are accepted as the use of 0 025 m nacl and 25 c reaction temperature at fixed 4 73 ma cm2 cd and initial sww ph of 7 03 for 4 h reaction time in terms of both energy consumptions and removal efficiency for treatment of sww also energy consumption value for per kg cod calculated for 0 025 m was 14 12 kw h kg cod 3 5 5 effect of dilution rate on energy consumption to understand the real effect of dilution rate on the energy consumption this study was conducted in an environment without se at constant 25 c reaction temperature 4 73 ma cm2 cd and 4 h reaction time fig 11 exhibits the plot of energy consumption per m3 wastewater versus dilution rate and cod removal efficiency it is clearly seen from the figure that the energy consumption increases with increasing dilution rate energy consumption values for dilution rates of 1 1 raw wastewater 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 were calculated as 243 31 284 54 297 06 and 320 03 kw h m3 the increased dilution rate decreases the pollution in the wastewater but on the other hand it reduces the electrical conductivity of the sww due to the electrical conductivity of tap water 0 285 ms cm in this study being lower than the sww 3 04 ms cm therefore energy consumption increased as a result of the increased resistance in the system the dilution rate is a natural process that occurs as a result of washing the equipment in the slaughterhouse plants as tap water is mixed with wastewater pollutants are diluted and can be oxidized more easily by the eo process on the other hand because the electrical conductivity of the tap water is less than sww it causes a higher potential difference during the eo process as a result of this situation the amount of energy consumed by the system increases therefore minimum water consumption during the washing operations in slaughterhouses will result in less energy consumption for the treatment of these wastewaters with eo 4 conclusions in this study the aim was to treat sww with eo using a ti pt mesh anode under different operation conditions according to the experiments it was found that the removal of the organic content of sww by eo with ti pt mesh anode was very efficient with respect to the results the removal of all pollutants was observed to be maximum at swws natural ph 7 03 the most effective electrolyte was found to be nacl the highest removal efficacy was seen with the use of 0 1 m nacl but the application of this concentration on an industrial scale means the use of tons of nacl taking into consideration the discharge limits of sww s and contribution to low energy consumption the optimum concentration was selected as 0 025 m as the cd increased an obvious increase was seen on removal efficiency but 4 73 ma cm² was chosen to minimize the consumption of energy the dilution rate affected the removal efficiency positively but caused a decrease in the electrical conductivity because of the lower conductivity of tap water compared to sww hence it caused an increase in the energy consumption therefore minimum water consumption during washing operations in slaughterhouses will result in less energy consumption for the treatment of these wastewaters with eo optimum conditions for the treatment of sww with eo were found to be natural initial ph of 7 03 4 73 ma cm² cd using 0 025 m nacl without dilution reaction time of 4 h at reaction temperature of 25 c under these optimum conditions tss toc cod tn and color removal efficiencies were found to be 99 5 88 0 92 2 93 5 and 99 9 respectively four hours of electrolysis were completed at 153 57 kw h m3 14 12 kw h kg cod and the energy cost under optimum removal conditions was calculated as 1 69 kg cod also the results clearly demonstrate that almost full mineralization of organics was obtained after 4 h treatment unluckily taking into account the large volumes of effluent produced per slaughtering cycle the need for long treatment times is impractical yet if the reactor is developed to arrange the hydrodynamic conditions or combined with another treatment process which shortens the eo treatment time such as ef a novel setup may be possible acknowledgement

14328,electro fenton ef process was utilized for degradation of benzene b toluene t and p xylene x btx in aqueous solutions using different electrodes the cathode was made from carbon felt while different materials were used as anodes including carbon stainless steel and nickel complete degradation of btx was attained within 30 min under favored conditions however toc removal of btx in the mixture was only 75 at early stages of the ef process due to the remaining organic by products the effects of operational conditions at different initial concentrations of btx were assessed in depth the ef process was able to attain 95 4 88 7 and 87 6 toc removal efficiencies at an initial concentration of 150 mg l using sacrificial stainless steel carbon and nickel anodes respectively in 60 min the stainless steel anode in the mode of the sacrificial electrode was favored due to the continuous production of fe2 in the solution the precipitated sludge during the ef process was treated and used to improve the degradation of btx a cost estimation study showed that treatment of one cubic meter of btx contaminated water by electro fenton process costs 1 40 under certain conditions keywords aops btx cost estimation electro fenton wastewater 1 introduction benzene toluene and xylenes btx are toxic and hazardous volatile organic compounds vocs that have attracted the attention due to their environmental effects on air water and soil btx are mainly released from petroleum refineries related industries such as glue factories or paint municipal waste traffic plastics agriculture effluents and solvent extraction furthermore it may be continuously released due to petrol and diesel fuel leakage from cracked and old underground gasoline storage tanks in urban areas 1 3 the solubility of btx is considerable so they have the ability to go deeper through the soil causing the contamination of the underground water these compounds can cause health problems even at low concentrations for example benzene may harm the nervous system leading to leukemia and anemia 4 moreover btx can be classified as industrial wastewater and hazardous air pollutants among the organic compounds 5 as the harmful aforementioned impact of btx it is an urgent necessity to develop suitable technologies for the treatment and remediation of water contaminated with btx conventional methods like flocculation sedimentation and filtration seem impractical for the treatment of btx in comparison with the application of the activated carbon adsorption systems 6 it is considered one of the successful technologies for the removal of vocs like btx as activated carbon has high porosity and large internal surface area 7 in addition modified poly butyl methacrylate resin showed high adsorption capacity of different btx 8 shakeri et al 2016 used a cationic surfactant prepared from ostrich bones as a bio adsorbent of petrochemicals however the high cost of activated carbon regeneration constrains the application in full scale 9 10 then the research for new alternative technologies for the degradation of btx either to complete mineralization or less harmful intermediates is a recent trend 3 11 air stripping is another treatment method of high efficiency for btx removal from aqueous solutions 12 some advanced oxidation processes aops have shown relative success in the removal of btx from water and wastewater 13 14 for instance lhotský et al 2017 reported successful removal of selected petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals by uv h2o2 under vigorous aeration 15 aops are preferred technologies for the rapid degradation of bio resistant organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides phenolic compounds and vocs 16 18 aops are oxidation reactions that produce high reactive hydroxyl radicals which are capable of destructing resistant and stable organic compounds 19 fenton processes are considered very efficient methods for producing active hydroxyl radicals 20 in fenton reaction hydroxyl radicals are produced through h2o2 decomposition catalyzed by fe2 ions in order to obtain higher degradation efficiency less harmful by products or reduction of energy and chemical consumption modified methods were developed to carry out fenton reaction other than classical fenton reaction electro fenton ef photo fenton sono fenton and fenton like process are examples of modified processes 21 24 the production of ferric hydroxide sludge and the excessive use of h2o2 are the main concerns of classic fenton reaction many researchers reported that ef process reduces the production of ferric hydroxide 25 26 in ef the applied current intensity induces the formation of fe2 ions from the reduction of ferric hydrogen sludge at the cathode 27 the reduction of the dissolved oxygen to form h2o2 in aqueous solutions is performed due to the negatively charged surface of the cathode fenton reaction starts by adding fe2 salts with the electrically produced h2o2 and the formation of fe 3 is continuing in the ef process the oxidation of contaminants is enhanced and the amount of sludge is reduced as ferrous ions regenerated from ferric ions near the cathode 28 the in situ production of h2o2 is the main advantage of this method which minimizes the storage and transport besides the performance of contamination removal is improved with the utilized clean energy source 29 the present study was conducted with the aim of studying the effectiveness of ef process for removal of btx from the water it also aimed to determine the favored operational conditions of the suggested method initial btx concentration fe2 dose current intensity and anode material are the operational conditions that have been studied the treatment and reuse of the sludge resulting from the experiment of btx mixture have been evaluated btx reactions and intermediate products have also been discussed the obtained information from the experiments can be utilized to promote a cost effective destructive and clean treatment process for btx cost estimation for a full scale electro chemical reactor has been studied including capital and running costs 2 materials and method 2 1 materials benzene toluene and p xylene were purchased from merck analytical standard purity grade 99 and used as received methanol hplc grade ferrous sulfate heptahydrate 99 pure and sodium sulfate 99 5 were supplied by sigma aldrich all other reagents were of analytical grade the ph adjustment of solutions was performed using analytical grade hydrochloric acid merck 2 2 experimental procedure all ef experiments were carried out in a cell comprised of a cylindrical beaker 1000 ml and submerged electrodes in all experiments 650 ml of polluted water of certain concentration was added in the cell the cathode was an elastic piece of carbon felt 30 cm 13 5 cm 0 5 cm that covered the inner wall of the cylindrical beaker three different anodes were used including carbon plate 3 5 cm 2 1 cm 1 1 cm sacrificial stainless steel grade 304 plate 5 cm 5 cm 0 5 cm and nickel plate 4 2 cm 4 2 cm 0 5 cm the anode was positioned vertically in the center of the cell the solution was vigorously stirred at 400 rpm by a magnetic stirrer to keep the concentration of the electrolytic solution uniform a compressed air pump with a rate of 2 l min was supplied to induce air bubbles the compressor was turned on 10 min prior to the reaction to increase the dissolved o2 and continued to the end of experiment time the ph was adjusted by hcl acid with specific quantities before starting the ef reaction the solution ph was recorded using a ph meter mettler toledo 320 ohio usa the electrodes were connected to a digital dc power supply model wyk 305 yangzhou jintong source co ltd china the desired amount of feso4 7h2o was added at the same time of switching the dc power supply na2so4 was dissolved in the solution 1 g l to obtain the required conductivity of the ef process an ammeter phywe 07036 00 was used to record the values of current intensity and a voltmeter digital voltmeter g 1002 500 was used to obtain the voltage samples were periodically taken every 10 min during the process and filtered using 0 2 μm syringe filters to remove any suspended materials before hplc analysis after each run the dc power source was switched off and the electrodes were washed with deionized water and kept to dry in room temperature additional experiments were carried out to evaluate the utilization of remaining sludge in new ef experiments the remaining sludge was collected and dried in an oven at 105 c for 7 h cooled in a desiccator at room temperature afterward the sludge re weighted until obtaining the constant dry weight a certain quantity of sludge was prepared to obtain the desired concentration 2 3 analytical methods hplc apparatus agilent 1200 was used to quantify btx concentrations samples of 25 μl were automatically transferred to a 150 x 4 6 mm apollo c18 column btx peaks were detected at wavelengths λ 210 nm under a column temperature of 40 c the mobile phase was 80 20 v v methanol ultra pure water at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the total organic carbon toc was measured using toc analyzer analytik jena ag co germany atomic absorption spectrometer varian aa2280fs was used to quantify remained fe2 3 results and discussion the removal of btx was evaluated at various operating conditions such as initial concentrations the intensity of dc power fe2 loading and electrode type in order to evaluate the efficiency of the ef process degradation of btx at different conditions was plotted in the form of relative substrate concentrations c co versus time min 3 1 effect of initial btx concentration the degradation of btx at different initial concentrations using carbon anode is shown in figs 1 a c the initial concentrations of each compound are less than their maximum solubility in water to assure the mixed amounts are dissolved the maximum soluble concentrations of benzene toluene p xylene in water are 1790 520 and 215 mg l respectively the obtained results revealed that the degradation efficiency decreases with the increase of the initial concentration of btx and complete removal was attained at all initial concentrations the degradation of p xylene was slightly slower among btx as can be noticed the removal of btx exceeded 85 in 10 min because of the quick formation of phenolic compounds as by products 30 fig 1a states that the removal efficiency of benzene was 100 in 10 and 30 min at initial concentrations of 150 and 500 mg l respectively fig 1b indicates that the removal efficiency of toluene was 100 in 30 and 45 min at initial concentrations of 150 and 500 mg l respectively fig 1c illustrates that the complete removal of p xylene was attained at initial concentrations of 150 and 200 mg l in 30 and 60 min respectively at higher initial concentrations the degradation efficiency decreased due to the abundance of btx molecules which have to be oxidized with the same amount of oxidant species more fe2 ions may be required to reduce the reaction time for complete degradation at higher initial concentration 31 btx degradation by the electrochemical process at an initial concentration of 150 mg l is presented in fig 1d and e respectively the observed results demonstrated that during the first 10 min rapid degradation of btx was monitored and followed by slow decomposition along with the progression of time it may be as a result of the fast generation of hydroxyl radicals within a short time fe oh 3 started to participate and caused a reduction in the generation of hydroxyl radicals 32 thus the slow regeneration of fe ii could decrease btx degradation 33 as illustrated in fig 1d and e the degradation efficiency followed the order benzene toluene p xylene the difference in performance may be due to the existence of different destructions pathways and the variation in destruction rates of organic molecules 34 moreover the longer the side chain in the benzene ring the lower in the degradation as in p xylene the existence of a side chain beside the expected formed an acid group as in p xylene ch ch3 ch3 ch caused a delay in the degradation pathways which may be attributed to the limited number of hydroxyl radicals 35 a previous study of btx degradation using uv h2o2 presented the same degradation efficiency order as well 36 3 2 effect of external fe2 addition with a sacrificial anode the degradation of btx using sacrificial stainless steel anode with and without external fe2 addition is presented in fig 2 a c as observed in fig 2a the degradation trends of benzene with and without external fe2 were almost the same complete degradation of benzene was attained after 10 min of electrochemical reaction at both conditions the same finding was also observed for toluene as ef reaction was able to achieve 100 removal after 30 min at fe2 doses of 5 and 0 mg l fig 2b p xylene degradation efficiency reached 100 within 10 and 30 min at fe2 doses of 0 and 5 mg l respectively fig 2c the additional increase in fe2 dose had no remarkable improvement in btx degradation and more sludge of fe oh 3 was observed accordingly the addition of external fe2 with sacrificial stainless steel anodes is not favored the amount of sacrificed iron from stainless steel grade 304 offered better degradation efficiency than adding extra fe2 33 an elaborate discussion for the amount produced iron from the sacrificial anode is presented in section 3 4 in this paper garcia segura et al 2012 and ghoneim et al 2011 reported a detailed interpretation for the destruction of organics by ef process without external iron loading 37 38 it is important finding that in the ef process reducing the amount of external fe2 is favored with respect to economic and environmental issues 39 3 3 effect of current intensity current intensity is considered one of the major parameters which play an important role in the oxidation of organic contaminants by electro chemical reactions 40 the effect of current intensity on the degradation of btx is shown in fig 3 a c it can be observed that raising the applied current offers better performance for toluene and p xylene degradation while the degradation of benzene was not enhanced after 60 min the removal efficiencies for toluene were 100 99 82 and 99 81 at 900 ma 600 ma and 400 ma respectively furthermore for p xylene the degradation efficiencies were 100 99 9 and 97 56 at 900 ma 600 ma and 400 ma respectively within 60 min of ef reaction on the other hand at current intensities of 600 ma 400 ma and 900 ma the removal efficiencies of benzene were 100 within 20 30 and 30 min respectively thus the favored current intensity is 900 ma for toluene and p xylene while 600 ma is the favored current intensity for benzene this can be attributed to the fact that current intensity plays an important role in the generation of h2o2 near the cathode 41 the increase of h2o2 improves the activity of fenton reaction and hence provides more hydroxyl radicals which are vital for the degradation process 42 moreover higher applied current intensity enhances regeneration of ferrous ions from ferric products and hence fenton reaction is enhanced 43 however the increase in current intensity from 600 ma to 900 ma decreases the degradation efficiency of benzene this may be attributed to the discharge of o2 at the anode eq 1 and the evolution of h2 at the cathode eq 2 that occur at a higher current intensity 44 the efficiency of ef can be decreased as these reactions may restrain main reactions such as reactions 3 and 4 43 1 2h2o 4h o2 4e 2 2h 2e h2 3 h2o ho h e 4 fe3 e fe2 3 4 effect of anode material toc analysis was performed to better assess btx removal fig 4 a b show the mineralization of btx by quantifying the toc during ef reaction the removal of toc for btx during 60 min of reaction time is shown in fig 4a the results revealed that after 60 min the toc removal efficiencies were 80 98 79 29 and 68 57 for p xylene toluene and benzene respectively it is observed that the mineralization rate rapidly increased in the first 20 min then it slightly decreased this may be due to the rapid production of hydroxyl radicals at early stages of the process then the reaction rate decreased due to the consumption of hydrogen peroxide which is the main source for production of hydroxyl radicals 45 in addition btx commonly contain high molecular weight and complex structured organic compounds that need longer time for complete degradation 46 the results also indicated that the toc removal followed the order x t b as time went forward more hydroxyl radicals released and favored the attack ch3 groups of p xylene moreover it is reported that the degradation will be faster when the benzene ring contains more methyl groups 36 fig 4b depicts a comparison between the performance of stainless steel nickel and carbon anodes under the same conditions however the area of anodes are different the cathode the current intensity and other conditions are the same in the comparison accordingly it is suggested that the number of electrons in the medium during the three experiments are the same the number of electrons is the driving force for h2o2 production which required to make fenton reaction takes place 42 after 60 min of ef reaction 95 4 of toc was removed using stainless steel anode while the removals were 88 7 and 87 6 using carbon and nickel anodes respectively stainless steel grade 304 is not ideal corrosion resistant material as it does not contain molybdenum accordingly eq 5 reveals that during the electrochemical process fe2 ions are sacrificed from stainless steel anode fig 5 displays the degradation of btx along with the concentration of dissolved iron during 60 min of electrochemical reaction similar degradation order results were obtained in fig 1 d and e as shown in fig 5 the remaining iron was measured to detect the production and consumption of fe2 during the ef process it can be observed that considerable amount of iron was accumulated in the first 20 min then the consumption became dominant in the rest of process time due to the activity of fenton reaction as given in eqs 6 7 the rate of precipitation of fe oh 3 in the first 20 min was limited which interprets the accumulation of iron at the first stages the reduction in the regeneration of fe2 and the dissolved fe3 by the formation of fe oh 3 caused the decrease in iron concentration at later stages of the process eq 7 47 in addition to its sacrificial nature stainless steel is favored due to its high conductivity in corrosive mediums at high current potential 48 5 fe fe2 2e 6 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh ho 7 fe3 3h2o fe oh 3 s 3h 3 5 sludge reuse the sludge from previous experiments of btx degradation was collected and utilized in the new ef process the sludge contained iron complexes so it was suggested to improve the fenton reaction performance the effect of sludge reuse on toc removal is depicted in fig 6 a b fig 6a demonstrated that toc removals after 60 min of electrochemical oxidation were 91 1 89 7 and 89 4 at initial concentrations of 100 50 and 25 mg l respectively the toc reduction exceeded 88 at early stages till 20 min after that the removal slightly increased further increase of sludge dose than needed did not improve toc removal as competitive side reactions happen that may diminish the concentration of hydroxyl radicals and create more precipitation eqs 7 8 49 50 therefore an optimal sludge loading of 25 mg l was considered the formation of fe2 from the sludge according to eqs 4 5 improved fenton reaction 51 at higher doses of sludge the mineralization efficiency was enhanced due to the increase of fe2 ions which improve the generation of hydroxyl radicals during fenton reaction 52 a comparison between the performance of nickel anode and carbon anode using 100 mg l of sludge dose under the same conditions is illustrated in fig 6 b carbon anode was able to achieve 91 1 reduction in toc while nickel anode obtained 89 9 toc reduction in 60 min similar trends were previously observed in fig 4 b that confirm carbon anode offered slightly better toc removal than nickel anode 8 fe2 ho fe3 oh 3 6 btx reactions and intermediate products the observed results of btx and toc removal state the formation of intermediates products which inhibit the complete mineralization several intermediate compounds such as benzyl alcohol benzaldehyde benzoic acid phenol malonic acid acetaldehyde and formic acid were suggested to be produced during the degradation of btx 14 at the beginning of the reaction hydroxyl radicals attacked btx which yielded benzaldehyde then malonic acid formed on account of the subsequent cleavage of the benzaldehyde 36 formic acid and acetaldehyde were generated from the conversion of malonic acid to lower molecular weight organic compounds 53 through the subsequent reaction steps co2 and h2o are the end products from the conversion of formic acid and acetaldehyde 54 similarity several other researchers also reported that the degradation of btx using aops obtained similar intermediate by products 13 55 58 co2 and h2o are mainly the end products after the complete degradation of intermediates 14 3 7 cost estimation the costs of electro chemical treatment of one cubic meter of petrochemical effluents are proportional to the daily amount of effluent and to the capacity of the reactor in order to put a reference for the costs of the electro fenton process it is assumed that an electro chemical reactor of a capacity volume vc of 10 m3 is used in sequence batches the reactor body is assumed to be reinforced concrete with a life time n of 25 years carbon felt and stainless steel are considered as electrodes with a lifetime of 6 months it is assumed that the working days per year d are 300 days the reaction time is assumed 45 min based on the outputs of our experiments additional time of 25 min is assumed for ripening filling and emptying the reactor so the total batch time tb is 70 min the working time per day tw for the reactor is assumed to be 14 h the total cost of the treatment process tc is determined by taking into account both the amortization cost of ac and operating cost oc i e tc ac oc all the costs are normalized to one cubic meter of the contaminated effluent the ac cost is calculated by summation of the costs of all installations and equipment such as reinforced concrete body aeration motor mixing motor dc supplier and other miscellaneous equipment the ac can be calculated by eqs 9 12 59 9 a c c p v c n v t 10 v t v c d t w t t 11 a c p 0 i 1 i n 1 i n 1 12 c p c p 0 n a where cp0 is the present amortization cost per one cubic meter of the reactor volume a is the annual investment cost of cp0 cp is the net cost per one cubic meter of the reactor volume i is the interest rate and vt is the total volume of treated effluent per year the estimated cp0 value according to average costs of as reinforced concrete body aeration motor mixing motor dc supplier and other miscellaneous equipment was 2800 m3 the cp value after adding the investment costs based on an interest rate of 6 is 8276 m3 the average ac equals 0 092 m3 the oc in this study includes chemicals electrodes maintenance and energy consumption the costs of labor were not considered for the simplicity of the study the cost of chemical cch is assumed 0 4 m3 including ph adjustment and ferrous sulfate if

14328,electro fenton ef process was utilized for degradation of benzene b toluene t and p xylene x btx in aqueous solutions using different electrodes the cathode was made from carbon felt while different materials were used as anodes including carbon stainless steel and nickel complete degradation of btx was attained within 30 min under favored conditions however toc removal of btx in the mixture was only 75 at early stages of the ef process due to the remaining organic by products the effects of operational conditions at different initial concentrations of btx were assessed in depth the ef process was able to attain 95 4 88 7 and 87 6 toc removal efficiencies at an initial concentration of 150 mg l using sacrificial stainless steel carbon and nickel anodes respectively in 60 min the stainless steel anode in the mode of the sacrificial electrode was favored due to the continuous production of fe2 in the solution the precipitated sludge during the ef process was treated and used to improve the degradation of btx a cost estimation study showed that treatment of one cubic meter of btx contaminated water by electro fenton process costs 1 40 under certain conditions keywords aops btx cost estimation electro fenton wastewater 1 introduction benzene toluene and xylenes btx are toxic and hazardous volatile organic compounds vocs that have attracted the attention due to their environmental effects on air water and soil btx are mainly released from petroleum refineries related industries such as glue factories or paint municipal waste traffic plastics agriculture effluents and solvent extraction furthermore it may be continuously released due to petrol and diesel fuel leakage from cracked and old underground gasoline storage tanks in urban areas 1 3 the solubility of btx is considerable so they have the ability to go deeper through the soil causing the contamination of the underground water these compounds can cause health problems even at low concentrations for example benzene may harm the nervous system leading to leukemia and anemia 4 moreover btx can be classified as industrial wastewater and hazardous air pollutants among the organic compounds 5 as the harmful aforementioned impact of btx it is an urgent necessity to develop suitable technologies for the treatment and remediation of water contaminated with btx conventional methods like flocculation sedimentation and filtration seem impractical for the treatment of btx in comparison with the application of the activated carbon adsorption systems 6 it is considered one of the successful technologies for the removal of vocs like btx as activated carbon has high porosity and large internal surface area 7 in addition modified poly butyl methacrylate resin showed high adsorption capacity of different btx 8 shakeri et al 2016 used a cationic surfactant prepared from ostrich bones as a bio adsorbent of petrochemicals however the high cost of activated carbon regeneration constrains the application in full scale 9 10 then the research for new alternative technologies for the degradation of btx either to complete mineralization or less harmful intermediates is a recent trend 3 11 air stripping is another treatment method of high efficiency for btx removal from aqueous solutions 12 some advanced oxidation processes aops have shown relative success in the removal of btx from water and wastewater 13 14 for instance lhotský et al 2017 reported successful removal of selected petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals by uv h2o2 under vigorous aeration 15 aops are preferred technologies for the rapid degradation of bio resistant organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides phenolic compounds and vocs 16 18 aops are oxidation reactions that produce high reactive hydroxyl radicals which are capable of destructing resistant and stable organic compounds 19 fenton processes are considered very efficient methods for producing active hydroxyl radicals 20 in fenton reaction hydroxyl radicals are produced through h2o2 decomposition catalyzed by fe2 ions in order to obtain higher degradation efficiency less harmful by products or reduction of energy and chemical consumption modified methods were developed to carry out fenton reaction other than classical fenton reaction electro fenton ef photo fenton sono fenton and fenton like process are examples of modified processes 21 24 the production of ferric hydroxide sludge and the excessive use of h2o2 are the main concerns of classic fenton reaction many researchers reported that ef process reduces the production of ferric hydroxide 25 26 in ef the applied current intensity induces the formation of fe2 ions from the reduction of ferric hydrogen sludge at the cathode 27 the reduction of the dissolved oxygen to form h2o2 in aqueous solutions is performed due to the negatively charged surface of the cathode fenton reaction starts by adding fe2 salts with the electrically produced h2o2 and the formation of fe 3 is continuing in the ef process the oxidation of contaminants is enhanced and the amount of sludge is reduced as ferrous ions regenerated from ferric ions near the cathode 28 the in situ production of h2o2 is the main advantage of this method which minimizes the storage and transport besides the performance of contamination removal is improved with the utilized clean energy source 29 the present study was conducted with the aim of studying the effectiveness of ef process for removal of btx from the water it also aimed to determine the favored operational conditions of the suggested method initial btx concentration fe2 dose current intensity and anode material are the operational conditions that have been studied the treatment and reuse of the sludge resulting from the experiment of btx mixture have been evaluated btx reactions and intermediate products have also been discussed the obtained information from the experiments can be utilized to promote a cost effective destructive and clean treatment process for btx cost estimation for a full scale electro chemical reactor has been studied including capital and running costs 2 materials and method 2 1 materials benzene toluene and p xylene were purchased from merck analytical standard purity grade 99 and used as received methanol hplc grade ferrous sulfate heptahydrate 99 pure and sodium sulfate 99 5 were supplied by sigma aldrich all other reagents were of analytical grade the ph adjustment of solutions was performed using analytical grade hydrochloric acid merck 2 2 experimental procedure all ef experiments were carried out in a cell comprised of a cylindrical beaker 1000 ml and submerged electrodes in all experiments 650 ml of polluted water of certain concentration was added in the cell the cathode was an elastic piece of carbon felt 30 cm 13 5 cm 0 5 cm that covered the inner wall of the cylindrical beaker three different anodes were used including carbon plate 3 5 cm 2 1 cm 1 1 cm sacrificial stainless steel grade 304 plate 5 cm 5 cm 0 5 cm and nickel plate 4 2 cm 4 2 cm 0 5 cm the anode was positioned vertically in the center of the cell the solution was vigorously stirred at 400 rpm by a magnetic stirrer to keep the concentration of the electrolytic solution uniform a compressed air pump with a rate of 2 l min was supplied to induce air bubbles the compressor was turned on 10 min prior to the reaction to increase the dissolved o2 and continued to the end of experiment time the ph was adjusted by hcl acid with specific quantities before starting the ef reaction the solution ph was recorded using a ph meter mettler toledo 320 ohio usa the electrodes were connected to a digital dc power supply model wyk 305 yangzhou jintong source co ltd china the desired amount of feso4 7h2o was added at the same time of switching the dc power supply na2so4 was dissolved in the solution 1 g l to obtain the required conductivity of the ef process an ammeter phywe 07036 00 was used to record the values of current intensity and a voltmeter digital voltmeter g 1002 500 was used to obtain the voltage samples were periodically taken every 10 min during the process and filtered using 0 2 μm syringe filters to remove any suspended materials before hplc analysis after each run the dc power source was switched off and the electrodes were washed with deionized water and kept to dry in room temperature additional experiments were carried out to evaluate the utilization of remaining sludge in new ef experiments the remaining sludge was collected and dried in an oven at 105 c for 7 h cooled in a desiccator at room temperature afterward the sludge re weighted until obtaining the constant dry weight a certain quantity of sludge was prepared to obtain the desired concentration 2 3 analytical methods hplc apparatus agilent 1200 was used to quantify btx concentrations samples of 25 μl were automatically transferred to a 150 x 4 6 mm apollo c18 column btx peaks were detected at wavelengths λ 210 nm under a column temperature of 40 c the mobile phase was 80 20 v v methanol ultra pure water at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the total organic carbon toc was measured using toc analyzer analytik jena ag co germany atomic absorption spectrometer varian aa2280fs was used to quantify remained fe2 3 results and discussion the removal of btx was evaluated at various operating conditions such as initial concentrations the intensity of dc power fe2 loading and electrode type in order to evaluate the efficiency of the ef process degradation of btx at different conditions was plotted in the form of relative substrate concentrations c co versus time min 3 1 effect of initial btx concentration the degradation of btx at different initial concentrations using carbon anode is shown in figs 1 a c the initial concentrations of each compound are less than their maximum solubility in water to assure the mixed amounts are dissolved the maximum soluble concentrations of benzene toluene p xylene in water are 1790 520 and 215 mg l respectively the obtained results revealed that the degradation efficiency decreases with the increase of the initial concentration of btx and complete removal was attained at all initial concentrations the degradation of p xylene was slightly slower among btx as can be noticed the removal of btx exceeded 85 in 10 min because of the quick formation of phenolic compounds as by products 30 fig 1a states that the removal efficiency of benzene was 100 in 10 and 30 min at initial concentrations of 150 and 500 mg l respectively fig 1b indicates that the removal efficiency of toluene was 100 in 30 and 45 min at initial concentrations of 150 and 500 mg l respectively fig 1c illustrates that the complete removal of p xylene was attained at initial concentrations of 150 and 200 mg l in 30 and 60 min respectively at higher initial concentrations the degradation efficiency decreased due to the abundance of btx molecules which have to be oxidized with the same amount of oxidant species more fe2 ions may be required to reduce the reaction time for complete degradation at higher initial concentration 31 btx degradation by the electrochemical process at an initial concentration of 150 mg l is presented in fig 1d and e respectively the observed results demonstrated that during the first 10 min rapid degradation of btx was monitored and followed by slow decomposition along with the progression of time it may be as a result of the fast generation of hydroxyl radicals within a short time fe oh 3 started to participate and caused a reduction in the generation of hydroxyl radicals 32 thus the slow regeneration of fe ii could decrease btx degradation 33 as illustrated in fig 1d and e the degradation efficiency followed the order benzene toluene p xylene the difference in performance may be due to the existence of different destructions pathways and the variation in destruction rates of organic molecules 34 moreover the longer the side chain in the benzene ring the lower in the degradation as in p xylene the existence of a side chain beside the expected formed an acid group as in p xylene ch ch3 ch3 ch caused a delay in the degradation pathways which may be attributed to the limited number of hydroxyl radicals 35 a previous study of btx degradation using uv h2o2 presented the same degradation efficiency order as well 36 3 2 effect of external fe2 addition with a sacrificial anode the degradation of btx using sacrificial stainless steel anode with and without external fe2 addition is presented in fig 2 a c as observed in fig 2a the degradation trends of benzene with and without external fe2 were almost the same complete degradation of benzene was attained after 10 min of electrochemical reaction at both conditions the same finding was also observed for toluene as ef reaction was able to achieve 100 removal after 30 min at fe2 doses of 5 and 0 mg l fig 2b p xylene degradation efficiency reached 100 within 10 and 30 min at fe2 doses of 0 and 5 mg l respectively fig 2c the additional increase in fe2 dose had no remarkable improvement in btx degradation and more sludge of fe oh 3 was observed accordingly the addition of external fe2 with sacrificial stainless steel anodes is not favored the amount of sacrificed iron from stainless steel grade 304 offered better degradation efficiency than adding extra fe2 33 an elaborate discussion for the amount produced iron from the sacrificial anode is presented in section 3 4 in this paper garcia segura et al 2012 and ghoneim et al 2011 reported a detailed interpretation for the destruction of organics by ef process without external iron loading 37 38 it is important finding that in the ef process reducing the amount of external fe2 is favored with respect to economic and environmental issues 39 3 3 effect of current intensity current intensity is considered one of the major parameters which play an important role in the oxidation of organic contaminants by electro chemical reactions 40 the effect of current intensity on the degradation of btx is shown in fig 3 a c it can be observed that raising the applied current offers better performance for toluene and p xylene degradation while the degradation of benzene was not enhanced after 60 min the removal efficiencies for toluene were 100 99 82 and 99 81 at 900 ma 600 ma and 400 ma respectively furthermore for p xylene the degradation efficiencies were 100 99 9 and 97 56 at 900 ma 600 ma and 400 ma respectively within 60 min of ef reaction on the other hand at current intensities of 600 ma 400 ma and 900 ma the removal efficiencies of benzene were 100 within 20 30 and 30 min respectively thus the favored current intensity is 900 ma for toluene and p xylene while 600 ma is the favored current intensity for benzene this can be attributed to the fact that current intensity plays an important role in the generation of h2o2 near the cathode 41 the increase of h2o2 improves the activity of fenton reaction and hence provides more hydroxyl radicals which are vital for the degradation process 42 moreover higher applied current intensity enhances regeneration of ferrous ions from ferric products and hence fenton reaction is enhanced 43 however the increase in current intensity from 600 ma to 900 ma decreases the degradation efficiency of benzene this may be attributed to the discharge of o2 at the anode eq 1 and the evolution of h2 at the cathode eq 2 that occur at a higher current intensity 44 the efficiency of ef can be decreased as these reactions may restrain main reactions such as reactions 3 and 4 43 1 2h2o 4h o2 4e 2 2h 2e h2 3 h2o ho h e 4 fe3 e fe2 3 4 effect of anode material toc analysis was performed to better assess btx removal fig 4 a b show the mineralization of btx by quantifying the toc during ef reaction the removal of toc for btx during 60 min of reaction time is shown in fig 4a the results revealed that after 60 min the toc removal efficiencies were 80 98 79 29 and 68 57 for p xylene toluene and benzene respectively it is observed that the mineralization rate rapidly increased in the first 20 min then it slightly decreased this may be due to the rapid production of hydroxyl radicals at early stages of the process then the reaction rate decreased due to the consumption of hydrogen peroxide which is the main source for production of hydroxyl radicals 45 in addition btx commonly contain high molecular weight and complex structured organic compounds that need longer time for complete degradation 46 the results also indicated that the toc removal followed the order x t b as time went forward more hydroxyl radicals released and favored the attack ch3 groups of p xylene moreover it is reported that the degradation will be faster when the benzene ring contains more methyl groups 36 fig 4b depicts a comparison between the performance of stainless steel nickel and carbon anodes under the same conditions however the area of anodes are different the cathode the current intensity and other conditions are the same in the comparison accordingly it is suggested that the number of electrons in the medium during the three experiments are the same the number of electrons is the driving force for h2o2 production which required to make fenton reaction takes place 42 after 60 min of ef reaction 95 4 of toc was removed using stainless steel anode while the removals were 88 7 and 87 6 using carbon and nickel anodes respectively stainless steel grade 304 is not ideal corrosion resistant material as it does not contain molybdenum accordingly eq 5 reveals that during the electrochemical process fe2 ions are sacrificed from stainless steel anode fig 5 displays the degradation of btx along with the concentration of dissolved iron during 60 min of electrochemical reaction similar degradation order results were obtained in fig 1 d and e as shown in fig 5 the remaining iron was measured to detect the production and consumption of fe2 during the ef process it can be observed that considerable amount of iron was accumulated in the first 20 min then the consumption became dominant in the rest of process time due to the activity of fenton reaction as given in eqs 6 7 the rate of precipitation of fe oh 3 in the first 20 min was limited which interprets the accumulation of iron at the first stages the reduction in the regeneration of fe2 and the dissolved fe3 by the formation of fe oh 3 caused the decrease in iron concentration at later stages of the process eq 7 47 in addition to its sacrificial nature stainless steel is favored due to its high conductivity in corrosive mediums at high current potential 48 5 fe fe2 2e 6 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh ho 7 fe3 3h2o fe oh 3 s 3h 3 5 sludge reuse the sludge from previous experiments of btx degradation was collected and utilized in the new ef process the sludge contained iron complexes so it was suggested to improve the fenton reaction performance the effect of sludge reuse on toc removal is depicted in fig 6 a b fig 6a demonstrated that toc removals after 60 min of electrochemical oxidation were 91 1 89 7 and 89 4 at initial concentrations of 100 50 and 25 mg l respectively the toc reduction exceeded 88 at early stages till 20 min after that the removal slightly increased further increase of sludge dose than needed did not improve toc removal as competitive side reactions happen that may diminish the concentration of hydroxyl radicals and create more precipitation eqs 7 8 49 50 therefore an optimal sludge loading of 25 mg l was considered the formation of fe2 from the sludge according to eqs 4 5 improved fenton reaction 51 at higher doses of sludge the mineralization efficiency was enhanced due to the increase of fe2 ions which improve the generation of hydroxyl radicals during fenton reaction 52 a comparison between the performance of nickel anode and carbon anode using 100 mg l of sludge dose under the same conditions is illustrated in fig 6 b carbon anode was able to achieve 91 1 reduction in toc while nickel anode obtained 89 9 toc reduction in 60 min similar trends were previously observed in fig 4 b that confirm carbon anode offered slightly better toc removal than nickel anode 8 fe2 ho fe3 oh 3 6 btx reactions and intermediate products the observed results of btx and toc removal state the formation of intermediates products which inhibit the complete mineralization several intermediate compounds such as benzyl alcohol benzaldehyde benzoic acid phenol malonic acid acetaldehyde and formic acid were suggested to be produced during the degradation of btx 14 at the beginning of the reaction hydroxyl radicals attacked btx which yielded benzaldehyde then malonic acid formed on account of the subsequent cleavage of the benzaldehyde 36 formic acid and acetaldehyde were generated from the conversion of malonic acid to lower molecular weight organic compounds 53 through the subsequent reaction steps co2 and h2o are the end products from the conversion of formic acid and acetaldehyde 54 similarity several other researchers also reported that the degradation of btx using aops obtained similar intermediate by products 13 55 58 co2 and h2o are mainly the end products after the complete degradation of intermediates 14 3 7 cost estimation the costs of electro chemical treatment of one cubic meter of petrochemical effluents are proportional to the daily amount of effluent and to the capacity of the reactor in order to put a reference for the costs of the electro fenton process it is assumed that an electro chemical reactor of a capacity volume vc of 10 m3 is used in sequence batches the reactor body is assumed to be reinforced concrete with a life time n of 25 years carbon felt and stainless steel are considered as electrodes with a lifetime of 6 months it is assumed that the working days per year d are 300 days the reaction time is assumed 45 min based on the outputs of our experiments additional time of 25 min is assumed for ripening filling and emptying the reactor so the total batch time tb is 70 min the working time per day tw for the reactor is assumed to be 14 h the total cost of the treatment process tc is determined by taking into account both the amortization cost of ac and operating cost oc i e tc ac oc all the costs are normalized to one cubic meter of the contaminated effluent the ac cost is calculated by summation of the costs of all installations and equipment such as reinforced concrete body aeration motor mixing motor dc supplier and other miscellaneous equipment the ac can be calculated by eqs 9 12 59 9 a c c p v c n v t 10 v t v c d t w t t 11 a c p 0 i 1 i n 1 i n 1 12 c p c p 0 n a where cp0 is the present amortization cost per one cubic meter of the reactor volume a is the annual investment cost of cp0 cp is the net cost per one cubic meter of the reactor volume i is the interest rate and vt is the total volume of treated effluent per year the estimated cp0 value according to average costs of as reinforced concrete body aeration motor mixing motor dc supplier and other miscellaneous equipment was 2800 m3 the cp value after adding the investment costs based on an interest rate of 6 is 8276 m3 the average ac equals 0 092 m3 the oc in this study includes chemicals electrodes maintenance and energy consumption the costs of labor were not considered for the simplicity of the study the cost of chemical cch is assumed 0 4 m3 including ph adjustment and ferrous sulfate if required the costs of replacing the electrodes every 6 months ce are 0 17 m3 the energy cost ec in m3 was determined using eq 13 based on the power required for dc power supply mixing and aeration 13 e c e p e t w d v t where e is the consumed power kw pe is the unit price of power energy i e 0 18 kwh 59 maintenance cost was assumed as 2 of the ac 60 hence the total operating cost including consumed materials power and maintenance was calculated by eq 14 14 o c c c h c e e c 0 02 a c the average ec is 0 735 m3 and hence the oc equals 1 307 m3 then the estimated tc equals 1 40 m3 it should be noted that these values may be different according to the location 4 conclusions based on the experimental results the ef process with feasible electrodes has positively offered high efficiency for btx degradation btx components were strongly degraded with 85 removal efficiency within 10 min at all experiments complete degradation of btx was attained at favored operating conditions however toc removal of btx in the mixture was 75 after 10 min of electro oxidation reaction after 60 min the ef process was able to remove about 95 4 88 7 and 87 6 of toc using sacrificial stainless steel carbon and nickel anodes respectively at an initial concentration of 150 mg l the collected sludge from previous experiments was utilized in a new ef experiment the toc removal exceeded 91 using 100 mg l of collected sludge the estimated total cost for treatment of one cubic meter of btx contaminated water is 1 40 m3 including amortization and operating costs acknowledgment

14329,removal of some metals viz cd pb ni cr cu and co by oxidation coagulation adsorption at optimized ph ocop an efficient and low cost method for simultaneous removal of as fe and mn from groundwater has been studied nahco3 kmno4 and fecl3 are used in ocop as ph conditioner oxidant and coagulant respectively the effects of variation of initial concentration and residence time on the

4 cu 98 0 cr 98 3 pb 99 5 analyses by atomic adsorption spectrophotometer energy dispersed x ray spectrophotometer and powder x ray diffraction indicate adsorption of the heavy metals on the surface of coagulates precipitates as oxides and complexes of the heavy metals the highly active absorber coagulates precipitates formed in feooh 5fe2o3 9h2o mno2 and mn3o4 also strongly adsorb other metals in addition to removal by precipitations of oxy complexes in cases of cd and pb the relatively lower removal of cd has been attributed to its soft acidic nature and higher removal of cr is due to its hard acidic nature the present study shows that the ocop method is capable of removing the heavy metals of cd pb ni cr cu and co very well in addition to efficiently removing as fe and mn from water keywords heavy metals removal oxidation coagulation adsorption nahco3 kmno4 fecl3 1 introduction groundwater is the vital resource necessary for all aspects of mankind and ecosystem survival 1 one of the most imperative environmental issues today is ground water contamination and among the wide diversity of contaminants affecting water resources heavy metals receive particular concern considering their strong toxicity even at low concentrations 2 metals or elements with an atomic density greater than 6 g cm3 are heavy metal which is one of the most tenacious pollutants found in groundwater 3 unlike organic pollutants the majority of heavy metals do not degrade and accumulate throughout the food chain producing potential risk to human health risks and ecological balance 3 4 some metals generally exists nature due to erosion and weathering of parent rocks spread into groundwater 5 release of leachates in to groundwater from domestic and industrial solid waste is another source of metal ion contamination in groundwater 5 industries like metal plating mining operations fertilizer industries tanneries batteries paper industries and pesticides pharmaceuticals hospitals etc directly or indirectly discharge heavy metal wastewaters into the environment especially in developing countries polluting surface water and groundwater 6 7 several metals concern us because of occupational or residential exposure 8 although small amounts of these are common in our environment and diet and some of them are necessary for good health large amounts of most of them may cause acute or chronic toxicity 8 the common hazardous metals found in groundwater are as fe mn hg pb cr cd ni and cu 4 9 11 presently india is facing critical water supply and drinking water quality problems there is evidence of prevailing contamination of water resources by heavy metals in many areas of india 10 the concentrations of metals in the surface water of the river ganga in west bengal is reported to follow the order fe mn ni cr pb zn cu cd 10 the problem of arsenic and other heavy metals in groundwater and related health hazards in assam a north eastern state of india is now receiving wide attention 9 borah et al reported that the ground water of the tea garden belt of darrang district of assam is contaminated with cadmium lead iron and manganese 12 13 buragohain et al studied the seasonal variations of heavy metals of groundwater in dhemaji district assam and found the concentrations of aluminium lead and cadmium to be significantly elevated 14 singh reported very high arsenic contamination in groundwater of jorhat golaghat and lakhimpur districts in assam 15 a high percentage of iron contamination 77 in the tube well waters of the region indicates the severity of the heavy metal pollution in the region 15 among the chemical contaminants of groundwater arsenic has become a major threat to the life of human being and useful microorganisms 16 manganese and iron are essential elements to a certain level only but they are also unwanted due to aesthetic plumbing or health problems at higher concentrations 17 18 excessive concentrations of lead cobalt cadmium and nickel can cause variety of harmful health effects even sometime cause death 19 cd ii is a potent neurotoxic metal and is known to cause kidney damage renal dysfunction bone degeneration lung inefficiency liver damage and hypertension in humans 20 though cobalt co is a key constituent of cobalamin vitamin b12 the excess intake of co results toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on human health 19 excess concentration of hexavalent chromium cr vi found in groundwater is acutely toxic carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic 21 24 ingestion of copper at high dose causes health effect on human body such as lesions in the central nervous system and liver and kidney damage or wilson s disease 25 lead poisoning through drinking water in human body causes damage of kidney liver and brain nervous system reproductive system and causes anaemia sickness or death 26 severe exposure to lead has been associated with sterility abortion stillbirth and neonatal deaths 27 nickel exposure to drinking water causes allergic skin reaction weight gain weakness and damage to lungs the nervous system and mucous membranes 28 it is utmost necessary to remove heavy metals stated above from groundwater before drinking the world health organisation who sets guideline values of the heavy metals of pb cr ni cu and cd as 0 01 mg l 0 05 mg l 0 07 mg l 2 0 mg l 0 003 mg l respectively for drinking water 29 33 among various processes reported for arsenic removal process based on adsorption oxidation coagulation ion exchange electrocoagulation application of nanomaterials etc are commonly used 34 kamaraj et al reported that electrocoagulation process for the removal of pb2 from water using magnesium and galvanized iron as anode and cathode results in maximum removal efficiency of 99 3 at a ph of 7 0 at a current density 0 8 a dm2 with an energy consumption of 0 72 kw h m3 35 ion exchange is also a frequently used method to remove metal ions from contaminated water 36 in hydroxide precipitation process the incorporation of coagulants like iron salts alum and some polymers may improve heavy metal separation from wastewater and groundwater 36 electrocoagulation electro floatation electrodeposition is good process however they need application of current with electrodes increasing the cost of the process for heavy metals removal 36 37 amuda et al reported that addition of ferric chloride alone results significant removal of total cr up to 91 which is increased to 95 on addition of polymer with ferric chloride 38 activated carbon and carbon nanotubes cnt have also been used as adsorbent to remove heavy metals from water li et al achieved 74 8 removal efficiency of cu by using cnts and 83 3 by using cnts ac from initial cu2 concentration of 20 mgl 1 at ph 5 0 and adsorbent dose of 0 05 g 39 using chemically enhanced primary treatment with 40 mg l of fecl3 and 0 5 mg l of anionic polymer stretches the best removal of chromium copper nickel lead and zinc this study by johnson et al 2008 40 showed ferric chloride to be more effective than alum for metal ion capture from wastewater aziz et al 2008 investigated that more than 80 of cd pb zn ni cu and cr iii with an initial concentration of 2 mg l can be removed by limestone at a final ph of 8 5 41 hydroxide precipitation process using ca oh 2 and naoh in removing cu and cr iii ions from wastewater was evaluated by mirbagheri and hosseini 2005 42 maximum precipitation of cr iii occurred at ph 8 7 with the addition of ca oh 2 and the concentration of chromate was reduced from 30 mg l to 0 01 mg l the cu was removed by aeration and at an optimum ph of about 12 0 by ca oh 2 and naoh from 48 51 mg l to 0 694 mg l 43 in hydroxide precipitation process the addition of coagulants such as alum iron salts and organic polymers can enhance the removal of heavy metals from wastewater zouboulis and katsoyiannis 2002 44 showed the coagulation by alum or ferric chloride to be enhanced by some organic polymers for 99 removal of arsenic though there are some successful methods for removal of different heavy metals from water they cannot efficiently remove arsenic present as unionised h3aso3 at normal ph ion exchange method also removes heavy metals very well but the process needs high cost resin effective under specific conditions and electricity to push the inlet water with required force moreover as such ion exchange cannot remove arsenic present as unionised h3aso3 at normal ph though reverse osmosis ro can remove all dissolved contaminants from water it is unsuitable for treatment of water with moderate or low total dissolved substance in addition to that ro is a costly method and cannot be used without electricity thus a simple method which can remove the heavy metals together with as at an affordable cost without needing electricity is not available a low cost efficient and safe method for removal of arsenic based on oxidation coagulation adsorption at optimized ph ocop with easy operational procedure reported by our research group efficiently removes fe and mn also simultaneously along with as 45 47 the ocop method which involves addition of small doses of nahco3 kmno4 and fecl3 to the contaminated water as ph conditioner oxidant and coagulant respectively has been gaining popularity in india especially in rural assam 46 a modified ocop by our research group 37 and another method based on sequential addition of permanganate and ferric iron by ahmad et al 2018 48 have shown removal of arsenic to undetectable level or below 1 μg l the ocop method was also reported to reduce the concentrations of certain heavy metal ions such as iron and manganese in the treated water 49 50 however the removal of the other commonly found heavy metals by the ocop method was not studied in detail though similar methods based on coagulation and adsorption are capable of removing the heavy metals to satisfactory level it will be better to have a single method capable of removing heavy metals also along with arsenic thus considering the relevance of a low cost and simple method that can comprehensively remove the heavy metals together with as in arsenite state and the increasing popularity of the ocop method for removing as and fe it was thought worthwhile to carry out a detail study of removal of the other heavy metals by the ocop method though oxidation may not be necessary for removal of some of the heavy metals we have retained the dose of kmno4 for all of the chosen heavy metals in order to examine their removal simultaneously along with arsenic iron and manganese in a single ocop process removal of six common heavy metals viz pb cd cu cr ni and co is included in this study 2 materials and method 2 1 reagents nahco3 fecl3 kmno4 feso4 7h2o cuso4 5h2o cdcl2 cr2 so4 3 6h2o cocl2 6h2o nicl2 6h2o and pbso4 obtained from merck specialities private limited india were of analytical grade and used without further purification stock solutions of 1 0 g l cu2 cd2 cr3 co2 ni2 and pb2 were prepared by spiking tap water with cuso4 5h2o cdcl2 cr2 so4 3 6h2o cocl2 6h2o nicl2 6h2o and pbso4 respectively the approximate composition of the tap water can be seen elsewhere 45 46 synthetic groundwater containing these ions was prepared by mixing required volume of the freshly prepared stock solutions with tap water the stock solutions of 1 0 g l fecl3 1 0 g l kmno4 and 9 0 g l of nahco3 were prepared in doubly distilled water 2 2 instrumental analysis the ph of the experimental water samples were measured in the laboratory and in field using a multi parameter kit model 5star ph ise cond do benchtop orion usa and a pocket sized ph metre model ph 222 lutron electronic enterprise co ltd taiwan respectively the concentrations of the heavy metals in influent and effluent water were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas model analyst 200 thermo ice 3000 series usa coupled with a hydride vapour generator model vp100 the x ray spectra of coagulates or precipitates were recorded on a powder x ray diffractometer xrd model miniflex rigaku japan with graphite mono chromated cuka radiation 0 15 nm at 30 kv and 15 rna using a scanning rate of 0 0500 s the energy dispersive x ray spectra edx were recorded on a jeol scanning microscope model jsm 6390 l v at room temperature at an accelerating voltage of 15 0 kv 2 3 experimental procedure in this study a series of ocop experiment with fixed doses of nahco3 fecl3 and kmno4 was carried out in 1 5 l mug a set of experiments with variation of initial concentration of the metals is verified to see the capacity of removal of the selected metals by ocop the initial concentrations of the metals were examined in the range from 2 mg l to 10 mg l with a fixed treatment time of 2 h to each mug 100 mg 0 5 mg and 25 mg of aqueous 9 nahco3 5 kmno4 and 25 fecl3 respectively were added successively with gentle intermittent stirring after that the treated water was allowed to coagulate and settle down nahco3 was added to the solutions in two steps initially about 60 mg l of nahco3 was added to increase initial ph of the treated water to approximately 8 5 0 1 which provides a favourable condition for kmno4 to oxidise the heavy metals forming itself to mno2 nahco3 was added again after addition of fecl3 to adjust the final ph at approximately 7 3 0 1 the ocop experiments with variation of initial metal ion concentration and with variation of residential time were done in triplicates to check reproducibility and data presented are averages of three the top clear water was then filtered through whatman 42 filter paper another set of experiment with mug containing 1 l synthetic contaminated water with a fixed 5 mg l initial concentrations of each of cu ii cr vi ni ii cd ii pb ii and co ii respectively in separate mugs the filtrate was collected after varying residence time from 1 to 4 h all the filtrates obtained after the experiments were analysed by aas to determine the remaining concentrations of the heavy metals the filtrates were preserved after acidifying with hcl acid to keep the ph below 2 for determination of metal ion concentrations by aas the solids obtained during the ocop experiments were collected in petri dish after filtration allowed to dry in hot air circulating oven at 70 c for 5 min and kept overnight in a desiccator at room temperature finally solid powder samples were prepared by grinding the dried solid with the help of a glass mortar 3 results and discussions 3 1 removal of the heavy metals fig 1 shows removal of the hazardous heavy metal namely cd pb ni cr co and co from contaminated groundwater with variation of initial concentration of the metal ions from 2 mg l to 10 mg l interestingly all six metal ions have been found to be removed considerably after the ocop treatment the percentage of removal of all heavy metals increased with decrease in the initial concentration of the heavy metals the removal of the metals from equal initial concentration of 2 mg l was found to increase in the order cd 79 0 co 94 8 ni 94 4 cu 98 0 cr 98 3 pb 99 5 the removal of pb is competitive with 99 3 reported with electrocoagulation 35 the observed 98 3 removal of total cr is far better than 91 reported with ferric chloride alone and 95 reported with ferric chloride and polymer 37 98 cu removal by the present method is also far better than reported 74 8 removal with cnts and 83 3 removal with cnts ac 39 in ocop method the mild alkaline ph provided by nahco3 may favour precipitation of the heavy metals 36 the present results are also better than reported 80 removal of cd pb zn ni cu and cr iii from an initial concentration of 2 mg l by limestone with a final ph of 8 5 which is in the higher side of the acceptable range of ph for drinking water 41 thus the ocop method with a removal efficiency of 94 4 99 5 and with a final ph of 7 3 removes cd pb ni cr cu and co also very well from drinking water the observed low removal of cd may be attributed to weaker binding adsorption to oxygen of feooh coagulates or mno2 precipitates formed during ocop treatment due to its soft acidic nature 50 on the other hand cr being a hard acid 50 is removed very well due to its strong binding feooh and mno2 further evidences are required to explain the observed order of ease of removal of the other heavy metal ions the initial concentration ranges of the heavy metals used in this study were above the concentration range in which they occur in groundwater due to limitation of the atomic absorption spectrophotometer in detecting the metal ions in microgram per litre level however the percentage removals of the metal ions were found to increase gradually with decrease in initial concentrations of the metal ions pb and cd are reported to be present up to 0 215 mg l and 0 110 mg l respectively in groundwater considering the percentage removals of pb and cd to be at least equal to that observed at initial concentration of 2 mg l the estimated remaining concentrations of the metal ions after ocop treatment are 0 001 mg l and 0 024 mg l against their who guideline values of 0 01 mg l and 0 003 mg l respectively the heavy metal ions of pb cr cu ni and cd are estimated to be removed below their respective who guideline values from initial concentrations of at least 2 mg l 7 5 mg l 80 mg l 0 81 mg l and 0 014 mg l respectively literatures reveals that heavy metal concentration in natural groundwater is usually found below 2 mg l 28 33 and therefore the ocop method with 94 4 99 5 of removal is highly efficient for removal of heavy metals from groundwater thus ocop is capable of removing pb cr cu co and ni to safe level from their respective ranges of concentrations in which they generally occur in groundwater except for cd fig 2 shows the results of removal of these heavy metals from initial concentration of 5 mg l by ocop method with variation of residence time up to 4 h removal was found to increase with increase in residence time the removal levelled off above 3 h for cd and co which is the optimum residence time for most adsorption methods 51 52 but continued to decrease up to 4 h in the case of pb cr ni and cu this experiment indicates that more residence time is required for maximum removal of these heavy metal ions than that of 2 h normally required for ocop treatment for removal of arsenic and iron 3 2 analysis of the precipitate for aas analysis of the heavy metals present in the coagulates of ocop the solid obtained from the process was dissolved in aqua regia mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid optimally in a molar ratio of 1 3 the volume of each solution was adjusted to 1 l with distilled water fig 3 shows the plots of the concentrations of the heavy metals in the aqua regia extract of coagulates obtained after the removal experiment of heavy metals by ocop at varying initial concentrations the concentrations of the heavy metals in the extracts of the solid obtained in ocop process have shown good correlation with the initial concentrations of the heavy metals plot of sum of concentrations of the metal in filtrate and in the extract of coagulate against the initial concentrations of the metals have been shown in fig 4 it is interesting to note that the sums of remaining concentration and the concentration observed in the extract were in good agreement with the corresponding initial concentrations for the heavy metal ions within experimental error limits the observed experimental error limits were 1 16 1 14 3 43 0 91 0 42 and 3 36 percent for cd pb ni cr cu and co respectively this indicates a very little escaping of detection by aas by any of the heavy metal the edx estimation of the heavy metals in the solid obtained from the ocop experiment with performed separately for individual metal ions with initial concentration of the metal ions as 5 mg l and residence time of 2 h are shown in fig 5 the spectra obtained for each metal ion showed the presence of the respective elements while the percentage composition with respect to weight of the cd pb ni cr cu and co in the precipitates or coagulates were 6 39 21 82 2 32 2 13 13 87 and 7 54 percent respectively the atomic percentage were 1 15 2 33 0 82 0 70 3 95 and 2 90 percent respectively supporting information table s1 the observed disagreement in atomic percentage may be attributed to difference in removal of the individual metal ions and inhomogeneous nature of the mixtures the xrd pattern of the solid coagulates of ocop method in the absence of the heavy metals can be seen elsewhere 45 supporting information figure s1 while the xrd pattern of the solid obtained from ocop treatment in the presence of co fig 6 f showed a highly amorphous nature of the coagulated solid like that obtained in absence of any of the heavy metals the xrd spectra of the solids obtained in the presence of ni cr and cu indicated formation of partially amorphous solids and the xrd patterns of the solid formed in the presence of cd and pb indicated highly crystalline solids fig 6a f the xrd spectra with the plane value h k l of the solid coagulates obtained in presence of the heavy metals with initial concentrations of 5 mg l obtained during the present ocop experiments are shown in fig 6 the xrd of the solid obtained in the presence of cd showed sharp peaks at 2θ 30 42 1 0 3 60 8 2 1 5 and 63 07 1 1 6 due to mn3o4 complex jcpds no 652776 800382 652776 and 800382 651298 respectively as can be seen in fig 6a peaks observed at 2θ 36 49 4 0 0 43 8 4 0 1 49 89 3 0 2 and 58 1 5 2 1 were due to the presence of mno2 compound in the coagulates jcpds no 721982 651298 721982 651298 and 530633 respectively the pattern at 2θ 40 17 2 1 0 48 06 4 1 1 and 75 12 2 0 2 confirms the existence of geothite feooh jcpds no 810464 cadmium oxide cdo2 formation resembles with the xrd pattern at 2θ 65 69 3 2 1 jcpds no 781125 and complexes cd0 1mn0 9o and cd2mn3o8 also resembles with xrd pattern at 2θ 40 19 2 1 0 jcpds no 896000 and 61 56 3 3 1 jcpds no 721428 respectively the xrd spectra of the solid obtained in the presence of pb fig 6b shows peaks at 2θ 20 10 1 1 0 35 62 1 1 0 40 82 1 1 3 43 50 1 1 4 45 83 1 3 3 47 04 2 1 3 and 49 04 1 4 2 jcpds no 897047 898103 898104 897047 898103 897047 898103 897047 897407 897407 897407 and 897407 respectively as evidences of formation of iron oxide fe2o3 in the solid xrd peaks at 2θ 34 65 0 2 1 jcpds no 810463 indicates presence of goethite feooh xrd peak at 2θ 29 12 1 0 0 36 19 2 0 0 62 67 3 1 1 and 64 10 2 0 1 jcpds no 440872 652873 040686 870663 and 440872 respectively are the evidences for the elemental precipitation co precipitation of pb with coagulates xrd pattern at 2θ 56 40 3 0 4 and 59 2 5 2 1 jcpds no 898912 reveals the formation of the compound pb fe mn 12o19 the xrd spectra obtained in the presence of ni fig 6c shows peaks at 2θ 30 20 2 2 0 and 30 25 2 2 0 jcpds no 862267 893080 indicative of formation of nife2o4 and nio compound respectively xrd pattern at 2θ 34 6 0 2 1 jcpds no 810463 evidences the formation of feooh in the coagulates fig 6d represents the xrd pattern in the presence of cr the xrd peak at 2θ 26 89 0 11 0 jcpds no 361330 indicates formation of chromium oxide cr3o8 during the experiment xrd pattern at 2θ 35 62 1 1 0 jcpds no 898103 is due to iron oxide fe2o3 fig 6e represents the xrd pattern of coagulates obtained in the presence of cu xrd peak at 2θ 31 28 0 6 6 jcpds no 752146 791546 and 390246 is due to the formation of cu feo2 xrd peak at 2θ 35 22 1 1 1 jcpds no 892530 evidences co precipitation of the cu ions with coagulates 3 3 mechanism of removal co being very similar to iron gave amorphous solids like that containing iron alone produced in absence of any heavy metal presence of ni cr and cu in the water leads to formation of some crystalline compounds of nife2o4 and nio cr3o8 and cu feo2 respectively the presence of cd leads to formation of highly crystalline compounds of cdo2 cd0 1mn0 9o and cd2mn3o8 in addition to facilitating formation of crystalline feooh mno2 and mn3o4 similarly the presence of pb in the solid coagulates indicates formation of pb fe mn 12o19 in addition to facilitating formation of crystalline fe2o3 and feooh the xrd analysis complements the understanding of the order of ease of removal of the heavy metals in the ocop treatment cd co ni cu cr pb as mentioned earlier in section 3 1 cd2 ion being a soft acid 51 is least adsorbed onto feooh and mno2 and is removed mainly through precipitation of crystalline cdo2 cd0 1mn0 9o and cd2mn3o8 resulting in least removal among the chosen heavy metals formation of cdo2 may be possible due to the oxidation of cd2 to cd4 by addition kmno4 because kmno4 which is well known strong oxidising agent formations of the complexes cd0 1mn0 9o and cd2mn3o8 are possible because in these complexes oxidation state of cd is 2 and in water generally heavy metals precipitates as oxides and hydroxides 53 54 co is removed only by adsorption onto amorphous feooh and mno2 and therefore removed much more than cd but comparatively less than the other moderately hard acid metal ions ni is removed better than co due to formation of come crystalline nife2o4 and nio in addition to adsorption in water heavy metals like ni2 form hydroxide or oxide at higher ph 55 the formation of nife2o4 may result from conversion of nio due during heating and drying of the coagulates before analysis this heating effect is also reported in several articles according to the following eq 1 55 56 1 2feooh ni oh 2 α fe2o3 ni0 nife2o4 the removal of cu2 pb2 and cd2 may also be facilitated by co precipitations with the iron hydroxides or oxide such as feooh and fe2o3 57 58 cu is probably adsorbed stronger than co and ni due to its smaller size cr is adsorbed very strongly due to its hard acidic nature as mentioned earlier the highest removal of pb may be attributed to co precipitation along with precipitation of highly crystalline pb fe mn 12o19 in addition to moderate adsorption as a moderately hard acid 50 4 conclusion the present study shows that the low cost ocop method which efficiently removes arsenic iron and manganese from water can also remove other heavy metals very well the removal of the chosen heavy metals from initial concentration of 2 mg l by the method has been found to increase in the order cd 79 0 co 94 8 ni 94 4 cu 98 0 cr 98 3 pb 99 5 adsorption of the heavy metal ions with the amorphous coagulates of iron oxides is the major mechanism for removal of ni cr cu and co on the other hand while cd and pb are themselves removed predominantly through precipitation the presence of these ions also facilitates precipitation of crystalline compounds of iron and manganese a relatively lower removal percentage of cd by ocop is due to the soft acidic character as cd2 ion forms weak bonding with the oxide coagulates while ocop can remove as fe and mn within 2 h the removal of the heavy metals take a longer time 3 4 h the most interesting finding of the present study is that the low cost and simple ocop method is capable of efficiently removing heavy metals of cd co ni cu cr and pb along with removal of as fe and mn in one goes acknowledgements rkd thanks the dst wti

groundwater has been studied nahco3 kmno4 and fecl3 are used in ocop as ph conditioner oxidant and coagulant respectively the effects of variation of initial concentration and residence time on the

in addition to removal by precipitations of oxy complexes in cases of cd and pb the relatively lower removal of cd has been attributed to its soft acidic nature and higher removal of cr is due to its

keywords heavy metals removal oxidation coagulation adsorption nahco3 kmno4 fecl3 1 introduction groundwater is the vital resource necessary for all aspects of mankind and ecosystem survival 1 one of the most imperative environmental issues today is ground water contamination and among the wide diversity of contaminants affecting water resources heavy metals receive particular concern considering their strong toxicity even at low concentrations 2 metals or elements with an atomic density greater than 6 g cm3 are heavy metal which is one of the most tenacious pollutants found in groundwater 3 unlike organic pollutants the majority of heavy metals do not degrade and accumulate throughout the food chain producing potential risk to human health risks and ecological balance 3 4 some metals generally exists nature due to erosion and weathering of parent rocks spread into groundwater 5 release of leachates in to groundwater from domestic and industrial solid waste is another source of metal ion contamination in groundwater 5 industries like metal plating mining operations fertilizer industries tanneries batteries paper industries and pesticides pharmaceuticals hospitals etc directly or indirectly discharge heavy metal wastewaters into the environment especially in developing countries polluting surface water and groundwater 6 7 several metals concern us because of occupational or residential exposure 8 although small amounts of these are common in our environment and diet and some of them are necessary for good health large amounts of most of them may cause acute or chronic toxicity 8 the common hazardous metals found in groundwater are as fe mn hg pb cr cd ni and cu 4 9 11 presently india is facing critical water supply and drinking water quality problems there is evidence of prevailing contamination of water resources by heavy metals in many areas of india 10 the concentrations of metals in the surface water of the river ganga in west bengal is reported to follow the order fe mn ni cr pb zn cu cd 10 the problem of arsenic and other heavy metals in groundwater and related health hazards in assam a north eastern state of india is now receiving wide attention 9 borah et al reported that the ground water of the tea garden belt of darrang district of assam is contaminated with cadmium lead iron and manganese 12 13 buragohain et al studied the seasonal variations of heavy metals of groundwater in dhemaji district assam and found the concentrations of aluminium lead and cadmium to be significantly elevated 14 singh reported very high arsenic contamination in groundwater of jorhat golaghat and lakhimpur districts in assam 15 a high percentage of iron contamination 77 in the tube well waters of the region indicates the severity of the heavy metal pollution in the region 15 among the chemical contaminants of groundwater arsenic has become a major threat to the life of human being and useful microorganisms 16 manganese and iron are essential elements to a certain level only but they are also unwanted due to aesthetic plumbing or health problems at higher concentrations 17 18 excessive concentrations of lead cobalt cadmium and nickel can cause variety of harmful health effects even sometime cause death 19 cd ii is a potent neurotoxic metal and is known to cause kidney damage renal dysfunction bone degeneration lung inefficiency liver damage and hypertension in humans 20 though cobalt co is a key constituent of cobalamin vitamin b12 the excess intake of co results toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on human health 19 excess concentration of hexavalent chromium cr vi found in groundwater is acutely toxic carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic 21 24 ingestion of copper at high dose causes health effect on human body such as lesions in the central nervous system and liver and kidney damage or wilson s disease 25 lead poisoning through drinking water in human body causes damage of kidney liver and brain nervous system reproductive system and causes anaemia sickness or death 26 severe exposure to lead has been associated with sterility abortion stillbirth and neonatal deaths 27 nickel exposure to drinking water causes allergic skin reaction weight gain weakness and damage to lungs the nervous system and mucous membranes 28 it is utmost necessary to remove heavy metals stated above from groundwater before drinking the world health organisation who sets guideline values of the heavy metals of pb cr ni cu and cd as 0 01 mg l 0 05 mg l 0 07 mg l 2 0 mg l 0 003 mg l respectively for drinking water 29 33 among various processes reported for arsenic removal process based on adsorption oxidation coagulation ion exchange electrocoagulation application of nanomaterials etc are commonly used 34 kamaraj et al reported that electrocoagulation process for the removal of pb2 from water using magnesium and galvanized iron as anode and cathode results in maximum removal efficiency of 99 3 at a ph of 7 0 at a current density 0 8 a dm2 with an energy consumption of 0 72 kw h m3 35 ion exchange is also a frequently used method to remove metal ions from contaminated water 36 in hydroxide precipitation process the incorporation of coagulants like iron salts alum and some polymers may improve heavy metal separation from wastewater and groundwater 36 electrocoagulation electro floatation electrodeposition is good process however they need application of current with electrodes increasing the cost of the process for heavy metals removal 36 37 amuda et al reported that addition of ferric chloride alone results significant removal of total cr up to 91 which is increased to 95 on addition of polymer with ferric chloride 38 activated carbon and carbon nanotubes cnt have also been used as adsorbent to remove heavy metals from water li et al achieved 74 8 removal efficiency of cu by using cnts and 83 3 by using cnts ac from initial cu2 concentration of 20 mgl 1 at ph 5 0 and adsorbent dose of 0 05 g 39 using chemically enhanced primary treatment with 40 mg l of fecl3 and 0 5 mg l of anionic polymer stretches the best removal of chromium copper nickel lead and zinc this study by johnson et al 2008 40 showed ferric chloride to be more effective than alum for metal ion capture from wastewater aziz et al 2008 investigated that more than 80 of cd pb zn ni cu and cr iii with an initial concentration of 2 mg l can be removed by limestone at a final ph of 8 5 41 hydroxide precipitation process using ca oh 2 and naoh in removing cu and cr iii ions from wastewater was evaluated by mirbagheri and hosseini 2005 42 maximum precipitation of cr iii occurred at ph 8 7 with the addition of ca oh 2 and the concentration of chromate was reduced from 30 mg l to 0 01 mg l the cu was removed by aeration and at an optimum ph of about 12 0 by ca oh 2 and naoh from 48 51 mg l to 0 694 mg l 43 in hydroxide precipitation process the addition of coagulants such as alum iron salts and organic polymers can enhance the removal of heavy metals from wastewater zouboulis and katsoyiannis 2002 44 showed the coagulation by alum or ferric chloride to be enhanced by some organic polymers for 99 removal of arsenic though there are some successful methods for removal of different heavy metals from water they cannot efficiently remove arsenic present as unionised h3aso3 at normal ph ion exchange method also removes heavy metals very well but the process needs high cost resin effective under specific conditions and electricity to push the inlet water with required force moreover as such ion exchange cannot remove arsenic present as unionised h3aso3 at normal ph though reverse osmosis ro can remove all dissolved contaminants from water it is unsuitable for treatment of water with moderate or low total dissolved substance in addition to that ro is a costly method and cannot be used without electricity thus a simple method which can remove the heavy metals together with as at an affordable cost without needing electricity is not available a low cost efficient and safe method for removal of arsenic based on oxidation coagulation adsorption at optimized ph ocop with easy operational procedure reported by our research group efficiently removes fe and mn also simultaneously along with as 45 47 the ocop method which involves addition of small doses of nahco3 kmno4 and fecl3 to the contaminated water as ph conditioner oxidant and coagulant respectively has been gaining popularity in india especially in rural assam 46 a modified ocop by our research group 37 and another method based on sequential addition of permanganate and ferric iron by ahmad et al 2018 48 have shown removal of arsenic to undetectable level or below 1 μg l the ocop method was also reported to reduce the concentrations of certain heavy metal ions such as iron and manganese in the treated water 49 50 however the removal of the other commonly found heavy metals by the ocop method was not studied in detail though similar methods based on coagulation and adsorption are capable of removing the heavy metals to satisfactory level it will be better to have a single method capable of removing heavy metals also along with arsenic thus considering the relevance of a low cost and simple method that can comprehensively remove the heavy metals together with as in arsenite state and the increasing popularity of the ocop method for removing as and fe it was thought worthwhile to carry out a detail study of removal of the other heavy metals by the ocop method though oxidation may not be necessary for removal of some of the heavy metals we have retained the dose of kmno4 for all of the chosen heavy metals in order to examine their removal simultaneously along with arsenic iron and manganese in a single ocop process removal of six common heavy metals viz pb cd cu cr ni and co is included in this study 2 materials and method 2 1 reagents nahco3 fecl3

initial concentrations of each of cu ii cr vi ni ii cd ii pb ii and co ii respectively in separate mugs the filtrate was collected after varying residence time from 1 to 4 h all the filtrates obtained after the experiments were analysed by aas to determine the remaining concentrations of the heavy metals the filtrates were preserved after acidifying with hcl acid to keep the ph below 2 for determination of metal ion concentrations by aas the solids obtained during the ocop experiments were collected in petri dish after filtration allowed to dry in hot air circulating oven at 70 c for 5 min and kept overnight in a desiccator at room temperature finally solid powder samples were prepared by grinding the dried solid with the help of a glass mortar 3 results and discussions 3 1 removal of the heavy metals fig 1 shows removal of the hazardous heavy metal namely cd pb ni cr co and co from contaminated groundwater with variation of initial concentration of the metal ions from 2 mg l to 10 mg l interestingly all six metal ions have been found to be removed considerably after the ocop treatment the percentage of removal of all heavy metals increased with decrease in the initial concentration of the heavy metals the removal of the metals from equal initial concentration of 2 mg l was found to increase in the order cd 79 0 co 94 8 ni 94 4 cu 98 0 cr 98 3 pb 99 5 the removal of pb is competitive with 99 3 reported with electrocoagulation 35 the observed 98 3 removal of total cr is far better than 91 reported with ferric chloride alone and 95 reported with ferric chloride and polymer 37 98 cu removal by the present method is also far better than reported 74 8 removal with cnts and 83 3 removal with cnts ac 39 in ocop method the mild alkaline ph provided by nahco3 may favour precipitation of the heavy metals 36 the present results are also better than reported 80 removal of cd pb zn ni cu and cr iii from an initial concentration of 2 mg l by limestone with a final ph of 8 5 which is in the higher side of the acceptable range of ph for drinking water 41 thus the ocop method with a removal efficiency of 94 4 99 5 and with a final ph of 7 3 removes cd pb ni cr cu and co also very well from drinking water the observed low removal of cd may be attributed to weaker binding adsorption to oxygen of feooh coagulates or mno2 precipitates formed during ocop treatment due to its soft acidic nature 50 on the other hand cr being a hard acid 50 is removed very well due to its strong binding feooh and mno2 further evidences are required to explain the observed order of ease of removal of the other heavy metal ions the initial concentration ranges of the heavy metals used in this study were above the concentration range in which they occur in groundwater due to limitation of the atomic absorption spectrophotometer in detecting the metal ions in microgram per litre level however the percentage removals of the metal ions were found to increase gradually with decrease in initial concentrations of the metal ions pb and cd are reported to be present up to 0 215 mg l and 0 110 mg l respectively in groundwater considering the percentage removals of pb and cd to be at least equal to that observed at initial concentration of 2 mg l the estimated remaining concentrations of the metal ions after ocop treatment are 0 001 mg l and 0 024 mg l against their who guideline values of 0 01 mg l and 0 003 mg l respectively the heavy metal ions of pb cr cu ni and cd are estimated to be removed below their respective who guideline values from initial concentrations of at least 2 mg l 7 5 mg l 80 mg l 0 81 mg l and 0 014 mg l respectively literatures reveals that heavy metal concentration in natural groundwater is usually found below 2 mg l 28 33 and therefore the ocop method with 94 4 99 5 of removal is highly efficient for removal of heavy metals from groundwater thus ocop is capable of removing pb cr cu co and ni to safe level from their respective ranges of concentrations in which they generally occur in groundwater except for cd fig 2 shows the results of removal of these heavy metals from initial concentration of 5 mg l by ocop method with variation of residence time up to 4 h removal was found to increase with increase in residence time the removal levelled off above 3 h for cd and co which is the optimum residence time for most adsorption methods 51 52 but continued to decrease up to 4 h in the case of pb cr ni and cu this experiment indicates that more residence time is required for maximum removal of these heavy metal ions than that of 2 h normally required for ocop treatment for removal of arsenic and iron 3 2 analysis of the precipitate for aas analysis of the heavy metals present in the coagulates of ocop the solid obtained from the process was dissolved in aqua regia mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid optimally in a molar ratio of 1 3 the volume of each solution was adjusted to 1 l with distilled water fig 3 shows the plots of the concentrations of the heavy metals in the aqua regia extract of coagulates obtained after the removal experiment of heavy metals by ocop at varying initial concentrations the concentrations of the heavy metals in the extracts of the solid obtained in ocop process have shown good correlation with the initial concentrations of the heavy metals plot of sum of concentrations of the metal in filtrate and in the extract of coagulate against the initial concentrations of the metals have been shown in fig 4 it is interesting to note that the sums of remaining concentration and the concentration observed in the extract were in good agreement with the corresponding initial concentrations for the heavy metal ions within experimental error limits the observed experimental error limits were 1 16 1 14 3 43 0 91 0 42 and 3 36 percent for cd pb ni cr cu and co respectively this indicates a very little escaping of detection by aas by any of the heavy metal the edx estimation of the heavy metals in the solid obtained from the ocop experiment with performed separately for individual metal ions with initial concentration of the metal ions as 5 mg l and residence time of 2 h are shown in fig 5 the spectra obtained for each metal ion showed the presence of the respective elements while the percentage composition with respect to weight of the cd pb ni cr cu and co in the precipitates or coagulates were 6 39 21 82 2 32 2 13 13 87 and 7 54 percent respectively the atomic percentage were 1 15 2 33 0 82 0 70 3 95 and 2 90 percent respectively supporting information table s1 the observed disagreement in atomic percentage may be attributed to difference in removal of the individual metal ions and inhomogeneous nature of the mixtures the xrd pattern of the solid coagulates of ocop method in the absence of the heavy metals can be seen elsewhere 45 supporting information figure s1 while the xrd pattern of the solid obtained from ocop treatment in the presence of co fig 6 f showed a highly amorphous nature of the coagulated solid like that obtained in absence of any of the heavy metals the xrd spectra of the solids obtained in the presence of ni cr and cu indicated formation of partially amorphous solids and the xrd patterns of the solid formed in the presence of cd and pb indicated highly crystalline solids fig 6a f the xrd spectra with the plane value h k l of the solid coagulates obtained in presence of the heavy metals with initial concentrations of 5 mg l obtained during the present ocop experiments are shown in fig 6 the xrd of the solid obtained in the presence of cd showed sharp peaks at 2θ 30 42 1 0 3 60 8 2 1 5 and 63 07 1 1 6 due to mn3o4 complex jcpds no 652776 800382 652776 and 800382 651298 respectively as can be seen in fig 6a peaks observed at 2θ 36 49 4 0 0 43 8 4 0 1 49 89 3 0 2 and 58 1 5 2 1 were due to the presence of mno2 compound in the coagulates jcpds no 721982 651298 721982 651298 and

2θ 30 20 2 2 0 and 30 25 2 2 0 jcpds no 862267 893080 indicative of formation of nife2o4 and nio compound respectively xrd pattern at 2θ 34 6 0 2 1 jcpds no 810463 evidences the formation of feooh in the coagulates fig 6d represents the xrd pattern in the presence of cr the xrd peak at 2θ 26 89 0 11 0 jcpds no 361330 indicates formation of chromium oxide cr3o8 during the experiment xrd pattern at 2θ 35 62 1 1 0 jcpds no 898103 is due to iron oxide fe2o3 fig 6e represents the xrd pattern of coagulates obtained in the presence of cu xrd peak at 2θ 31 28 0 6 6 jcpds no 752146 791546 and 390246 is due to the formation of cu feo2 xrd peak at 2θ 35 22 1 1 1 jcpds no 892530 evidences co precipitation of the cu ions with coagulates 3 3 mechanism of removal co being very similar to iron gave amorphous solids like that containing iron alone produced in absence of any heavy metal presence of ni cr and cu in the water leads to formation of some crystalline compounds of nife2o4 and nio cr3o8 and cu feo2 respectively the presence of cd leads to formation of highly crystalline compounds of cdo2 cd0 1mn0 9o and cd2mn3o8 in addition to facilitating formation of crystalline feooh mno2 and mn3o4 similarly the presence of pb in the solid coagulates indicates formation of pb fe mn 12o19 in addition to facilitating formation of crystalline fe2o3 and feooh the xrd analysis complements the understanding of the order of ease of removal of the heavy metals in the ocop treatment cd co ni cu cr pb as mentioned earlier in section 3 1 cd2 ion being a soft acid 51 is least adsorbed onto feooh and mno2 and is removed mainly through precipitation of crystalline cdo2 cd0 1mn0 9o and cd2mn3o8 resulting in least removal among the chosen heavy metals formation of cdo2 may be possible due to the oxidation of cd2 to cd4 by addition kmno4 because kmno4 which is well known strong oxidising agent formations of the complexes cd0 1mn0 9o and cd2mn3o8 are possible because in these complexes oxidation state of cd is 2 and in water generally heavy metals precipitates as oxides and hydroxides 53 54 co is removed only by adsorption onto amorphous feooh and mno2 and therefore removed much more than cd but comparatively less than the other moderately hard acid metal ions ni is removed better than co due to formation of come crystalline nife2o4 and nio in addition to adsorption in water heavy metals like ni2 form hydroxide or oxide at higher ph 55 the formation of nife2o4 may result from conversion of nio due during heating and drying of the coagulates before analysis this heating effect is also reported in several articles according to the following eq 1 55 56 1 2feooh ni oh 2 α fe2o3 ni0 nife2o4 the removal of cu2 pb2 and cd2 may also be facilitated by co precipitations with the iron hydroxides or oxide such as feooh and fe2o3 57 58 cu is probably adsorbed stronger than co and ni due to its smaller size cr is adsorbed very strongly due to its hard acidic nature as mentioned earlier the highest removal of pb may be attributed to co precipitation along with precipitation of highly crystalline pb fe mn 12o19 in addition to moderate adsorption as a moderately hard acid 50 4 conclusion the present study shows that the low cost ocop method which efficiently removes arsenic iron and manganese from water can also remove other heavy metals very well the removal of the chosen heavy metals from initial concentration of 2 mg l by the method has been found to increase in the order cd 79 0 co 94 8 ni 94 4 cu 98 0 cr 98 3 pb 99 5 adsorption of the heavy metal ions with the amorphous coagulates of iron oxides is the major mechanism for removal of ni cr cu and co on the other hand while cd and pb are themselves removed predominantly through precipitation the presence of these ions also facilitates precipitation of crystalline compounds of iron and manganese a relatively lower removal percentage of cd by ocop is due to the soft acidic character as cd2 ion forms weak bonding with the oxide coagulates while ocop can remove as fe and mn within 2 h the removal of the heavy metals take a longer time 3 4 h the most interesting finding of the present study is that the low cost and simple ocop method is capable of efficiently removing heavy metals of cd co ni cu cr and pb along with removal of as fe and mn in one goes acknowledgements rkd thanks the dst wti
