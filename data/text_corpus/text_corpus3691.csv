18455,in this study the performance of lacoo3 lco catalytic ozonation was evaluated comprehensively including the degradation efficiency of benzotriazole bza as a typical emerging pollutant toxic bromate reduction and the disinfection by products dbps precursors removal ability in effluent organic matter efom as well as efom reactive activity in catalytic ozonation additionally the reduction of toxic halogenated by products in catalytic ozonation was reported which was not focused on previous researches before results showed that lco catalytic ozonation improved the removal efficiency of bza uv254 and suva via enhanced ho formation interestingly lco catalytic ozonation showed the ability on the reduction of aldehydes and toxic halogenated organic by products moreover the formed trichloromethane tcm bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dichloroacetamide dcacam decreased significantly in catalytic ozonation catalytic ozonation was also able to remove dbps precursors to decline the formation of dbps such as tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm trichloroacetonitrile tcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm this process was involved in the transformation of efom in catalytic ozonation which was confirmed by multi spectrum methods two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos and hetero spectral 2d cos in summary lco was shown to be an effective catalyst to improve the performance of the sole ozonation on the removal of emerging contaminants and dbps precursors as well as toxic by products reduction additionally the strategy of toxic by products reduction in catalytic ozonation was proposed results indicated this technology was an important contribution on removal of refractory organics and formation of toxic by products in water supply and wastewater treatment industry graphical abstract image 1 keywords benzotriazole catalytic ozonation disinfection by products effluent organic matter two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 1 introduction due to the excellent oxidizing properties of ozone that is able to oxidize resistant microorganisms through direct or indirect reactions carbajo et al 2007 ozonation is often used in drinking water or wastewater treatment plants wwtps for taste and odor removal and organic micro pollutant degradation afzal et al 2017 however toxic by products are often formed in ozonation which is of major concern von gunten 2003a when a water matrix contains bromide br a harmful inorganic by product bromate bro3 is formed through a combination of direct oxidation by molecular ozone and indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radical ho von gunten 2003b additionally undesirable aldehydes and carboxylic acids as organic by products was formed through the reaction between molecular ozone and effluent organic matter efom in secondary effluent of wwtps papageorgiou et al 2014 these short chain by products are relatively reactive and volatile and some of them have been classified as possible carcinogens compounds zhang et al 2018 meanwhile these compounds increased the assimilable organic carbon aoc or biodegradable fraction of the organic matter as bdoc biodegradable dissolved organic carbon which would increase the bacterial regrowth potential von gunten 2003a moreover the ozone molecular reacted with halogen ions to produce hypochlorous acid hclo clo or hypobromous acid hobr obr von gunten 2003b which reacted with efom to form toxic halogenated organic by products ozonation may also increase the precursors of disinfection by products dbps leading to formation of more dbps especially for n dbps heeb et al 2014 heterogeneous catalytic ozonation with solid catalysts has been considered as a practical and efficient alternative technique to overcome these drawbacks li et al 2015 several efficient catalysts including cexzr1 xo2 yang et al 2011 hzsm 5 zhang et al 2011 mnox al2o3 nie et al 2013 β feooh al2o3 nie et al 2014 fe al ldh al2o3 nie et al 2015 and ce mcm 48 li et al 2015 have been used in bro3 elimination during enhanced ozonation where only cexzr1 xo2 hzsm 5 and fe al ldh al2o3 were used in real surface water or wasterwater data scarcity limited catalsyt s application zhang et al reported that feooh showed a slight efficiency on reduction of the formation of total aldehydes from the hydrophobic acid hoa fraction and neutral hon fraction but produced more total aldehydes from the hydrophilic acid hia and base hib fractions zhang et al 2008 catalytic ozonation was also reported as an efficient oxidation process for removing dbps precursors when tio2 molnar et al 2012 ru active carbon wang et al 2009 fe mn oxide chen and wang 2014 tio2 α al2o3 chen and wang 2014 or fe cu mcm 41 chen et al 2018 was used based on above literature review catalytic ozonation is suitable for emering organics degradation in drinking water or municipal domestic sewage treatment however the formation of toxic halogenated by products in catalytic ozonation of wastewaters are also unclear in previous studies perovskite type oxides including mesoporous lafeo3 lamno3 afzal et al 2017 laco mn o3 orge et al 2013 lati0 15cu0 85o3 carbajo et al 2007 and lafe co o3 zhang et al 2018 showed activity in catalytic ozonation for degradation of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps dyes oxalic acid and industrial wastewater due to the unique characteristics of perovskite type oxide afzal et al 2017 additionally the synchronous ppcps degradation and reduction of bro3 was achieved by lacoo3 lco catalytic ozonation zhang et al 2018 however the above studies only presented efficient ability on refractory organics degradation and bro3 reduction it is necessary to evaluate the performance on toxic by products reduction in catalytic ozonation with perovskite type oxides detailed which would justify the feasibility of perovskite type oxides in drinking water or wastewater purification by catalytic ozonation therefore in this study it was evaluated the performance of lacoo3 catalytic ozonation in detailed including the micro pollutant removal performance and the reduction of toxic by products of bro3 small molecular weight carbonyl compounds and dbps precursors additionally efom reaction activity in catalytic ozonation was also investigated by multi spectrum methods including two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos and 1h nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr to clarify the organic components transformation in efom results of this study provided a feasible method for the evaluation of lacoo3 catalytic ozonation in wastewater or reclaimed water advanced treatment as well as the strategy of toxic by products reduction in catalytic ozonation 2 materials and methods 2 1 matrix samples from wwtps wastewater samples were collected from the effluent of primary and secondary clarifiers in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in beijing china collected samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters and immediately stored at 4 c dissolved fraction of effluent were obtained to evaluate the effect of organic substance on the degradation of the emerging pollutant in mixed efom matrix solution and the reduction of toxic by products by lco catalytic ozonation as well as the transformation of organic components in efom to obtain accepted and suitable values of cod 60 3 mg l and doc 9 0 mg l of the matrix the primary and secondary effluents were mixed and the mixture proportion was 1 5 information regarding wwtps and water quality parameters of the primary and secondary effluents are shown in text s1 and table s1 2 2 catalytic ozonation procedure all catalytic ozonation tests were conducted in a 500 ml glass reactor efficient volume 300 ml at room temperature under semi continuous mode ozone gas was generated using a standard laboratory ozone generator 3s a5 beijing tonglin gaoke technology beijing china using pure oxygen source and was fed into the bottom of the glass reactor the aqueous ozone concentration in the working solution was adjusted through the electric current of the ozone generator the glass reactor was filled with mixed effluent spiked with benzotriazole bza 100 μg l br 100 μg l and lco catalyst 0 25 g l that was synthesized by a sol gel method in the lab zhang et al 2018 the matrix solution ph was 7 39 and was not adjusted as the effluent showed enough buffer capacity excess ozone gas was absorbed with potassium iodide solution certain samples were withdrawn for water quality analysis at prescribed intervals and the residual ozone was removed by bubbling nitrogen gas into the solution to stop the reaction after purging the residual ozone samples were disinfected using naclo solution the disinfection procedure is shown detailed in text s2 all experiments were conducted in duplicate and standard deviations have been shown in figures and tables as error bars 2 3 analytical methods residual bza was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc

shimadzu japan detailed information regarding the methods used for the above analyses is shown in text s3 characterization of efom reaction in mixed effluent in catalytic ozonation was conducted based on uv vis absorbance molecular weight mw distribution synchronous fluorescence sf spectrum combination of two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectrum fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy with 2d cos hetero spectral 2d cos combined with sf and ft ir spectrum and 1h nmr spectrum detailed information regarding these analyses is provided in text s4 3 results 3 1 performance of organics degradation generally the sole ozonation showed complete degradation of bza after 20 min with a reaction kinetic constant k app of 0 1462 min 1 inset in fig 1 while the significant increase of k app cata 0 2141 min 1 was observed in lco catalytic ozonation however the surface adsorption of lco was very low less than 3 indicating that the surface catalytic reaction resulted in bza degradation the degradation efficiency of uv254 was 63 3 in the sole ozonation which was improved by catalytic ozonation to 68 1 fig 1 b accordingly suva showed a greater decrease in response to catalytic ozonation 68 2 degradation efficiency than ozonation alone 62 7 degradation efficiency fig 1 b however no mineralization was observed in catalytic ozonation 3 2 formation of toxic by products fig 2 a showed that bro3 increased with the reaction time passed then formed a plateau in both the sole ozonation and catalytic ozonation after 120 min bro3 in catalytic ozonation only decreased 7 3 compared with the sole ozonation catalytic ozonation with lco did not show good ability on bro3 reduction aldehydes and oxalic acid have been received widespread attention as important toxic by products formed in ozonation zhang et al 2008 in this study three kinds of aldehydes simple aldehydes formaldehyde fa acetaldehyde ace and propanal pro dialdehyde glyoxal gly and keto aldehyde methyl glyoxal mgly were identified in catalytic ozonation table 1 the generation yields of them in catalytic ozonation are shown in text s5 in the mixed matrix total aldehydes was 39 1 μg l this yield increased dramatically in the sole ozonation as o3 and reaction time increased total aldehydes increased firstly then decreased better reduction performance of total aldehydes in catalytic ozonation was achieved at lower ozone dose 1 0 mg l as o3 increased total aldehydes increased as the over dose of ozone catalytic ozonation with lco was able to reduce oxalic acid oa when o3 was 2 0 and 5 0 mg l detailed information is shown in fig s1 and text s6 the organic by products were also investigated in this study during the sole ozonation the presence of cl br in solution was transformed to hocl ocl or hobr obr as shown in eqs s 5 s 20 in table s4 von gunten 2003b yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2015a the formed hocl ocl or hobr obr in solution was able to convert efom to toxic halogenated by products heeb et al 2014 however previous studies on catalytic ozonation were not focused on the formation of toxic halogenated organic by products firstly tox was used to evaluate the halogen substitution on efom in catalytic ozonation in the matrix solution cl 121 mg l and without any br tox was 34 μg l as the presence of some halogenated organics in effluent fig 2 b it should be noted that tox increased from 34 to 68 μg l after the sole ozonation and similar tox was observed in catalytic ozonation to evaluate effect of br on tox formation br 100 μg l was added after that tox increased to 126 μg l in the sole ozonation fig 2 b interestingly tox decreased to 61 μg l in lco catalytic ozonation good performance on the reduction of toxic by products containing halogen in the presence of br was observed in catalytic ozonation which was a significant development on the sole ozonation and was not reported before halogenated organic by products including trihalomethanes thms i e trichloromethane tcm and bromodichloromethane bdcm haloacetonitriles hans i e dichloroacetonitrile dcan and bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and haloacetamides hacams i e dichloroacetamide dcacam and trichloroacetamide tcacam were identified in catalytic ozonation when br 100 μg l table 2 in mixed effluent their total amounts identified in this study was 23 1 μg l in the sole ozonation this value increased to 32 2 μg l at 90 min when o3 1 0 mg l as the increasing of the reaction time and o3 total amounts increased dramatically in catalytic ozonation total amounts decreased significantly when o3 2 0 mg l compared with sole ozonation as o3 continued to increase to 5 0 mg l the good reduction of total halogenated by products was also observed especially at 90 min the formation yields of identified halogenated organic by products in catalytic ozonation are shown in text s7 3 3 dbps precursors degradation herein the degradation of dbps precursors was expressed by dbps formation potentials dbps fps after chlorination by overdose free chlorine and enough disinfection time as shown in table 3 total dbps fps was 348 0 μg l after chlorination of the mixed matrix interestingly the sole ozonation reduced total dbps fps and the reduction performance increased as o3 increased however catalytic ozonation by lco did not show any development on the reduction of total dbps fps results suggested that different dbps precursors might be transformed chemically in catalytic ozonation which was confirmed by variations in the structure and chemical properties of dbps precursors in catalytic ozonation this will be discussed in depth in part 4 3 two kinds of thms including tcm and bdcm were identified in this study fps of tcm and bdcm in the mixed matrix after chlorination were 137 5 μg l and 28 6 μg l respectively table 3 moreover their fps decreased when mixed effluent was ozonized especially tcm reduced to 77 4 μg l when o3 5 0 mg l catalytic ozonation with lco showed better efficiency on the reduction of tcm fp and bdcm fp than the sole ozonation bcan dcan and trichloroacetonitrile tcan were also identified fps of bcan dcan and tcan formed from the chlorination of mixed matrix were 16 1 90 9 and 55 9 μg l table 3 respectively after ozonation tcan fp decreased to 16 0 μg l when o3 5 0 mg l interestingly bcan fp and dcan fp decreased at lower ozone doses 1 0 and 2 0 mg l increased to 12 2 and 100 4 μg l when o3 5 0 mg l respectively catalytic ozonation with lco developed the reduction performance of bcan fp when o3 1 0 and 2 0 mg l and the significant degradation of tcan precursor was also observed however catalytic ozonation showed no performance on dcan fp reduction but increased it dcacam and tcacam as emerging dbps were identified here table 3 but their fps were too low which were effectively reduced in ozonation especially for dcacam as o3 increased the reduction effect was more significant however almost no reduction was observed for tcacam the introduction of lco improved the reduction performance of dcacam but also showed no effect on tcacam this is the first study to report degradation of hacams precursor in catalytic ozonation being similar to hacams the ozonation degraded the trichloronitromethane tcnm precursor and this degradation increased with increasing o3 table 3 this was very significant when o3 5 0 mg l in sole ozonation when o3 2 0 or 5 0 mg l catalytic ozonation by lco showed more significant contribution on the reduction of tcnm fp in summary lco catalytic ozonation showed good ability on the reduction of fp of tcm bcan tcan dcacam and tcnm however the introduction of lco exhibited no effect on tcacam precursor degradation what s more dcan fp was promoted in the presence of lco the structure variation of dbps precursors might be account for these results in catalytic ozonation which will be discussed in part 4 3 3 4 reaction activity of efom in catalytic ozonation 3 4 1 uv vis absorbance spectrum properties to further understand the importance of the reaction activity of efom in the mixed effluent in catalytic ozonation and the role of efom in dbps formation the broad uv vis spectrum of samples obtained in catalytic ozonation of mixed effluent were measured uv vis spectrum suggested that highly conjugated organic substances such as aromatic compounds decreased in catalytic ozonation which agreed with results of uv254 and suva fig 1 b additionally easier oxidation of aromatic acids in efom might be finished in catalytic ozonation as shown in fig s2 and text s8 3 4 2 molecular weight distribution properties the mw distribution range of the mixed efom solution showed mw 4 kda and a high mw of 12 589 da fig s3 a lco catalytic ozonation not only degraded of high mw substances 12 589 da completely but also contributed to greater degradation of substances with lower mw mw 0 5 kda this process was more significant than that in ozonation alone fig s3 b which was also reported in feooh catalytic ozonation zhang et al 2008 detailed information is shown in fig s3 and text s9 3 4 3 fluorescence spectrum properties in the mixed matrix sf spectrum showed peaks at 250 and 276 nm which were ascribed to tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances respectively moreover additional peaks at 340 and 370 nm were ascribed to fulvic like and humic like substances fig 3 a respectively jin et al 2016 after the deconvoluted of above four peaks in original sf spectrum the removal efficiency of corresponding components was shown in fig 3 b the sole ozonation showed significant removal efficiency for efom substances especially for fulvic like substances 85 removal efficiency and humic like substances 90 removal efficiency 56 of the tryptophan like substances were removed in the sole ozonation however tyrosine like substances were hard to be degraded by the sole ozonation with only 2 removal efficiency catalytic ozonation with lco improved efom degradation especially for tryptophan like substances increasing 12 degradation efficiency than the sole ozonation in addition catalytic ozonation also showed good removal ability on fulvic like substances with 87 removal efficiency and humic like substances with 92 degradation ability being similar to results of sf spectrum eem spectrum result suggested that efom mainly contained tryptophan like substances a small amount of tyrosine like fulvic like and humic like components neither the sole ozonation nor catalytic ozonation degraded tyrosine like substances fig s4 and text s10 catalytic ozonation with lco promoted the degradation efficiency of tryptophan like fulvic like and humic like components 3 4 4 chemical functional groups properties according to ft ir spectrum the presence of protein like compounds esters ethers phenols carbohydrates and aromatic substances were observed in the mixed efom matrix fig s5 text s11 and table s7 protein like substances phenols and aromatic structures were destroyed in the sole ozonation which was also found in a previous study by ft ir analysis racar et al 2017 in catalytic ozonation lco accelerated the removal of carboxylic acids protein like and aromatic substances significantly which easily observed in ft ir spectrum compared with sf and eem spectrums the above profile of chemical functional groups was also supported by the 1h nmr spectrum fig s6 and text s12 greater degradation of aliphatic hydrocarbons esters amino acids carboxylic acids and aromatic structures was observed in lco catalytic ozonation than that in the sole ozonation suggesting that the presence of lco promoted the degradation and chemical transformation of efom significantly 4 discussion 4 1 reduction of toxic by products 4 1 1 bro3 catalytic ozonation showed worse ability to reduce bro3 in the mixture matrix fig 2 a than that was observed in a previous study using bza solution as the matrix zhang et al 2018 previously lco was found to accelerate the production of ho2 o2 and to generate more h2o2 contributing to the reduction of bro3 zhang et al 2018 additionally the surface hydroxyl groups on lco facilitated the reduction of bro3 in catalytic ozonation of bza previously zhang et al 2018 however the formed h2o2 might be consumed by efom in the mixed matrix ai et al 2017 resulting in the worse ability on bro3 reduction inorganic anions in the mixture matrix affected the ligand exchange with the surface hydroxyl groups eq s 23 in table s4 liu et al 2013 and the consumption of surface hydroxyl groups decreased the bro3 reduction 4 1 2 aldehydes it has been reported that the molecular ozone cleaved larger organic molecules into smaller ones and reacted with unsaturated aliphatic chain compounds or aromatic groups of efom to produce carbonyl compounds papageorgiou et al 2014 the increasing total aldehydes observed in ozonation alone table 1 may be due to the further oxidation of unsaturated components or aromatic groups with the molecular ozone and radical fig s5 in catalytic ozonation a good reduction of aldehydes was achieved when o3 1 0 mg l the developed formation of ho in the presence of lco zhang et al 2018 may degrade aldehydes but higher o3 promoted the formation of aldehydes due to the further oxidation of efom by the over dosed ozone resulted in an increase of aldehydes catalytic ozonation with goethite also increased total aldehydes and acetone from hia and hib compared with the sole ozonation but produced a slight decrease from hoa and hon fractions zhang et al 2008 4 1 3 halogenated organic by products for halogenated organic by products the sole ozonation increased tox in the presence of only cl fig 2 b in the sole ozonation chlorine radicals and hocl ocl were formed through the reaction of generated ho with excess chloride ions in wastewater as shown in eqs s 5 s 11 and the reaction rate constant for ho and cl is about 103 m 1s 1 at neutral ph eqs s 5 and s 5 according to the previous study von gunten 2003b the formed chlorine radicals and hocl ocl would oxidize or substitute the organics in efom and led to an undesirable increase in tox catalytic ozonation showed no reduction on tox formation in presence of only cl however the formation of hocl ocl and chlorine radicals was promoted in lco catalytic ozonation due to the presence of ho zhang et al 2018 eqs s 5 s 11 which increased tox conversely the formed tox would also be degraded by more ho in catalytic ozonation the above result might lead to no reduction of tox in lco catalytic ozonation after the addition of br tox increased dramatically in ozonation alone which was consistent with results that halogenated organic by products increased in ozonation alone of humic acid in the presence of br due to the formation of chbr3 haag and holgné 1983 firstly efom served as a target of br and hobr obr attacking leading to the formation of halogenated organic by products von gunten 2003b and increasing tox eqs s 12 s 22 additionally the formation of new clbr eqs s 24 and s 25 in the addition of br also promoted the generation of tox through reaction between efom and halogenated radicals xie et al 2016 interestingly catalytic ozonation showed remarkable tox reduction in the presence of br lco catalytic ozonation accelerated the formation of ho zhang et al 2018 and promoted structural transformation without any degradation fig 1 b this might decrease efom reaction activity with br and hobr obr furthermore the formed halogenated organic by products could be further degraded by the ho formed in lco catalytic ozonation these pathways decreased tox in catalytic ozonation in this study some volatile halogenated organic by products were identified in the sole ozonation the higher ozone dose and longer reaction time decreased tcm and bdcm table 2 the formed tcm and bdcm may be further degraded at higher ozone dose the presence of lco increased ho and led to lower tcm and bdcm the similar reaction resulted in that catalytic ozonation also showed better performance for reduction of hans and hacams at higher ozone doses 4 2 insight into efom reactivity in catalytic ozonation with 2d cos to investigate the fate of efom in the mixed effluent in catalytic ozonation 2d cos of sf spectrum were applied firstly the synchronous map fig 4 a displayed an obvious auto peak located at the diagonal line at 276 nm tryptophan like substances with a lower intensity peak at 340 nm fluvic like substances jin et al 2016 according to noda s rule text s4 the higher intensity of auto peak at 276 nm suggested that tryptophan like substances were more susceptible and more easily oxidized in catalytic ozonation than fluvic like substances with a lower intensity of auto peak at 340 nm herein both cross peaks at 340 276 and 370 276 were characterized with positive signal suggesting that the variation in tryptophan like fluvic like and humic like substances jin et al 2016 was in the same direction while the fluorescent intensity decreased simultaneously these results also indicated that all substances in the mixed matrix were oxidized simultaneously with no transformation when the asynchronous mapping was conducted fig 4 b the spectrum was characterized with positive cross peaks at 340 276 and 370 276 according to noda s rule text s4 the sequential order of peaks generated by efom in catalytic ozonation of mixed effluent was 340 nm 276 nm and 370 nm 276 nm demonstrating that fluvic like and humic like substances might be oxidized first in catalytic ozonation after which tryptophan like components in mixed effluent were degraded secondly 2d cos of ft ir was used to investigate variations in functional groups in catalytic ozonation three auto peaks in the synchronous spectrum were observed at 880 1384 and 1637 cm 1 fig 4 c corresponding to c h bond in the aromatic structure c h bond in the methyl structure and cc co in the protein like substance respectively rodriguez et al 2016 the highest intensity auto peak at 880 nm indicated that the c h bond in the aromatic structure was more susceptible in catalytic ozonation and more easily degraded positive cross peaks at 880 1384 1637 and 1384 1637 were also observed suggesting that protein like compounds carbohydrates and aromatic substances in efom decreased simultaneously in catalytic ozonation and that there was no mutual transformation of functional groups observed in the asynchronous spectrum fig 4 d cross peaks at 880 1210 1384 1637 1033 1210 1384 1637 1210 1135 1384 and 1503 1210 1384 1637 were all positive in addition a new peak was found at 1135 cm 1 that was related to the group of c c in carbohydrates racar et al 2017 the observed new peak indicated that 2d cos was able to improve the resolution of ft ir spectrum and to solve peak overlapping moreover several negative cross peaks were found at 1135 880 1503 and 1384 880 1003 1503 1637 variation in the observed peaks chemical functional bond in catalytic ozonation followed in the order of 880 1503 1003 1210 1637 1135 1384 indicating that catalytic ozonation degraded aromatic structures in efom firstly then oxidized protein like substances and carbohydrates a previous study also showed that unsaturated compounds preferably reacted with the molecular ozone than aliphatic like compounds deeudomwongsa et al 2017 but was not shown in detailed as this study to further investigate the variations of functional groups in each component in catalytic ozonation the hetero spectral 2d cos between sf and ft ir spectrum was obtained including the synchronous and asynchronous maps in the synchronous map fig 4 e several positive peaks at 880 1003 1210 1503 and 1637 cm 1 were observed in the horizontal direction along the fluorescence wavelength at 276 nm indicating that c h and cc bonds 880 and 1503 cm 1 in the aromatic structures c o groups 1003 cm 1 c o groups in esters and ethers 1210 cm 1 and co 1637 cm 1 in protein like substances rodriguez et al 2016 were derived from the same origin with tryptophan like substances 276 nm in the synthetic matrix moreover two positive peaks at 880 cm 1 340 nm and 1210 cm 1 340 nm were observed suggesting the presence of c h bond in aromatic structures 880 cm 1 and c o group in esters ethers and phenols 1210 cm 1 showed a similar origin to fluvic like substances xiao et al 2017 only the c h bond in the aromatic structure 880 cm 1 showed the same origin with humic like components according to the positive peak at 880 cm 1 370 nm in other words fluvic like and humic like substances mainly contained aromatic structures which was in accordance with results of previous studies that showed that fluvic like and humic like substances exhibited high aromaticity and contributions from functional groups with conjugated bonds deeudomwongsa et al 2017 in the asynchronous map fig 4 f cross peaks were identified at 880 1003 1135 1210 1503 1637 cm 1 276 nm with a positive signal indicating that the aromatic functional groups 880 and 1503 cm 1 c o group 1003 cm 1 c c group 1135 cm 1 c o group in esters ethers and phenols 1210 cm 1 and cc co 1637 cm 1 were precedent to changes in tryptophan like substances 276 nm the negative cross peak at 3434 cm 1 276 nm suggested that o h groups was changed more slowly in tryptophan like substances by catalytic ozonation the positive peaks at 880 1210 cm 1 340 nm and 880 1210 cm 1 370 nm indicated that variations in aromatic structures 880 cm 1 and c o groups in esters ethers and phenols 1210 cm 1 in fluvic like and humic like substances varied firstly while the negative peaks at 3434 cm 1 340 370 nm revealed that o h groups in fluvic like and humic like substances likely changed more slowly taking the sequential variation in 2d cos of sf ft ir spectrum and hetero spectral 2d cos together the variation in efom substances in catalytic ozonation likely followed a preferential order of aromatic functional groups in fluvic like and humic like substances aromatic functional groups in tryptophan like substances carbohydrates in tryptophan like substances in summary the combination of 2d cos and hetero spectral analyses clearly confirmed the oxidation sequence of efom in catalytic ozonation ozonation and catalytic ozonation preferentially oxidized high aromaticity substances such as humic like and fluvic like substances than tryptophan like substances this comprehensive method confirmed the transformation pathway of efom in catalytic ozonation detailed and showed the ozonation sequence of chemical functional groups in each substance in efom aromatic groups in fluvic like and humic like substances aromatic groups in tryptophan like substances carbohydrates in tryptophan like substances this is the first report of ho induced transformation between efom fractions and functional groups in catalytic ozonation using 2d cos and hetero spectral analyses 4 3 dbps precursors degradation the hydrophobic fraction in efom was rich in aromatic compounds such as humic like and fluvic like substances showing higher potential to form thms than the hydrophilic fraction chiang et al 2009 unlike thms precursor hans precursor mainly originated from the hydrophilic fraction containing nitrogen jin et al 2016 furthermore protein like substances including aromatic amino acids were an important source of hacams as important nitrogen dbps zhou et al 2015b herein the identified hydrophobic fraction in humic like and fluvic like substances fig 3 a and fig s4 a in the mixed matrix served as precursor of thms ozonation favorably oxidized aromatic functional groups in fluvic like and humic like substances which was confirmed by multi spectrum analyses fig 4 this reaction decreased thms fps in the sole ozonation additionally lco catalytic ozonation accelerated the degradation of fluvic like substances fig 3 b and fig s4 d which also resulted in a slight decrease of thms fps table 3 these results were in agreement with the finding that better removal efficiency of thms precursor was achieved in tio2 catalytic ozonation molnar et al 2012 in the sole ozonation the hydrophilic fraction mainly involving protein like substances wen et al 2010 in mixed effluent was degraded fig 3 a and fig s4 b when o3 was lower resulting in decreased hans fps table 3 when o3 was higher the hydrophobic fraction of efom such as humic like and fluvic like substances might have been transformed to hydrophilic compounds chiang et al 2009 leading to increased hans fps this finding was remarkable due to the formation of ho in the presence of lco accelerated transformation of the hydrophobic fraction to a hydrophilic fraction molnar et al 2012 in addition tio2 catalytic ozonation also promoted the generation of a hydrophilic fraction forming more hans molnar et al 2012 the increased degradation of protein like substances reported as hacams precursor in lco catalytic ozonation was also observed fig 3 a and fig s4 c in accordance with previous reports zhou et al 2015b the increasing o3 and presence of lco catalyst enhanced this degradation significantly table 3 which would decrease hacams fp in the sole ozonation the transformation from the hydrophobic to the hydrophilic fraction was reported before jin et al 2016 the hydrophobic fraction contained precursor of thms while the latter contained hans precursor the presence of lco accelerated the above transformation promoting the degradation of thms precursor but increasing the levels of han fps however catalytic ozonation did not decrease total dbps fps owing to the transformation of different dbps precursors in catalytic ozonation similar results were also found in ru ac catalytic ozonation wang et al 2009 the above result confirmed lco catalytic ozonation was a promoting technology in wastewater reclaimed process 4 4 strategy of decreasing toxic by products in catalytic ozonation with the focus of this study the feasibility of lco catalytic ozonation in wastewater reclaiming was investigated meanwhile the strategy of decreasing toxic by products in catalytic ozonation was proposed based above result lco as an efficient catalyst was able to be used in micro pollutant degradation in wastewater purification even at lower ozone 1 0 mg l additionally in order to decrease toxic by products generated from the ozonation the optimal parameters on total aldehydes degradation was observed in catalytic ozonation under lower ozone 1 0 mg l and shorter reaction time 90 min better reduction on ace pro and mgly formation was also found compared with sole ozonation as expected lco catalytic ozonation greatly inhibited total halogenated organic by products formation with ozone 2 0 mg l especially for the reduction of nitrogen containing by products hans and hacams catalytic ozonation enhanced the degradation of thms precursors especially at higher ozone 5 0 mg l meanwhile better reduction of hans fps was observed in catalytic ozonation when ozone 2 0 mg l the optimal parameters on the reduction of hacams fps was ozone 5 0 mg l in both the sole ozonation and catalytic ozonation summarily when wastewater included higher halogen ion and lower total nitrogen the optimal parameters for the reduction of aldehydes halogenated organic by products and thms fps was achieved at lower o3 1 0 mg l in catalytic ozonation for wastewater containing higher total nitrogen the presence of lco with ozone 2 0 mg l was able to be used to reduce halogenated organic by products and n dbps formation 5 conclusion the degradation of micro pollutant benzotriazole bza reduction of toxic by products removal of dbps precursors and reaction activity of efom in catalytic ozonation were investigated several highlight viewpoints were obtained as below lacoo3 catalytic ozonation promoted the removal of bza and reduced the formation of aldehydes and oxalic acid as important toxic by products in the sole ozonation furthermore the halogenated organic by products formed in the sole ozonation were significantly reduced by catalytic ozonation as the first report in this field however this technology was not able to efficiently reduce the formed bro3 in the efom matrix additionally catalytic ozonation also showed ability on removing the precursor of ruled dpbs multi spectrum methods and their corresponding two dimensional correlation spectrums were used to identify the reaction activity of efom in catalytic ozonation the highly conjugated hydrophobic fluvic like and humic like fractions were oxidized prior to catalytic ozonation and the structure of residual efom was dominated by hydrophilic substances the above structural transformation of efom led to decreased dbps fps the obtained highlight results suggested that catalytic ozonation with lacoo3 did not only complete micro pollutant degradation but also declined the formation yields of toxic by products including aldehydes oxalic acid the halogenated organic by products and its derived dbps in chlorination disinfection as an efficient enhanced technology for purification and reusing domestic sewage finally the strategy on toxic by products reduction in catalytic ozonation were also proposed which is considered reasonable for using lco catalytic ozonation in purification and reusing domestic sewage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18455,in this study the performance of lacoo3 lco catalytic ozonation was evaluated comprehensively including the degradation efficiency of benzotriazole bza as a typical emerging pollutant toxic bromate reduction and the disinfection by products dbps precursors removal ability in effluent organic matter efom as well as efom reactive activity in catalytic ozonation additionally the reduction of toxic halogenated by products in catalytic ozonation was reported which was not focused on previous researches before results showed that lco catalytic ozonation improved the removal efficiency of bza uv254 and suva via enhanced ho formation interestingly lco catalytic ozonation showed the ability on the reduction of aldehydes and toxic halogenated organic by products moreover the formed trichloromethane tcm bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dichloroacetamide dcacam decreased significantly in catalytic ozonation catalytic ozonation was also able to remove dbps precursors to decline the formation of dbps such as tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm trichloroacetonitrile tcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm this process was involved in the transformation of efom in catalytic ozonation which was confirmed by multi spectrum methods two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos and hetero spectral 2d cos in summary lco was shown to be an effective catalyst to improve the performance of the sole ozonation on the removal of emerging contaminants and dbps precursors as well as toxic by products reduction additionally the strategy of toxic by products reduction in catalytic ozonation was proposed results indicated this technology was an important contribution on removal of refractory organics and formation of toxic by products in water supply and wastewater treatment industry graphical abstract image 1 keywords benzotriazole catalytic ozonation disinfection by products effluent organic matter two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 1 introduction due to the excellent oxidizing properties of ozone that is able to oxidize resistant microorganisms through direct or indirect reactions carbajo et al 2007 ozonation is often used in drinking water or wastewater treatment plants wwtps for taste and odor removal and organic micro pollutant degradation afzal et al 2017 however toxic by products are often formed in ozonation which is of major concern von gunten 2003a when a water matrix contains bromide br a harmful inorganic by product bromate bro3 is formed through a combination of direct oxidation by molecular ozone and indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radical ho von gunten 2003b additionally undesirable aldehydes and carboxylic acids as organic by products was formed through the reaction between molecular ozone and effluent organic matter efom in secondary effluent of wwtps papageorgiou et al 2014 these short chain by products are relatively reactive and volatile and some of them have been classified as possible carcinogens compounds zhang et al 2018 meanwhile these compounds increased the assimilable organic carbon aoc or biodegradable fraction of the organic matter as bdoc biodegradable dissolved organic carbon which would increase the bacterial regrowth potential von gunten 2003a moreover the ozone molecular reacted with halogen ions to produce hypochlorous acid hclo clo or hypobromous acid hobr obr von gunten 2003b which reacted with efom to form toxic halogenated organic by products ozonation may also increase the precursors of disinfection by products dbps leading to formation of more dbps especially for n dbps heeb et al 2014 heterogeneous catalytic ozonation with solid catalysts has been considered as a practical and efficient alternative technique to overcome these drawbacks li et al 2015 several efficient catalysts including cexzr1 xo2 yang et al 2011 hzsm 5 zhang et al 2011 mnox al2o3 nie et al 2013 β feooh al2o3 nie et al 2014 fe al ldh al2o3 nie et al 2015 and ce mcm 48 li et al 2015 have been used in bro3 elimination during enhanced ozonation where only cexzr1 xo2 hzsm 5 and fe al ldh al2o3 were used in real surface water or wasterwater data scarcity limited catalsyt s application zhang et al reported that feooh showed a slight efficiency on reduction of the formation of total aldehydes from the hydrophobic acid hoa fraction and neutral hon fraction but produced more total aldehydes from the hydrophilic acid hia and base hib fractions zhang et al 2008 catalytic ozonation was also reported as an efficient oxidation process for removing dbps precursors when tio2 molnar et al 2012 ru active carbon wang et al 2009 fe mn oxide chen and wang 2014 tio2 α al2o3 chen and wang 2014 or fe cu mcm 41 chen et al 2018 was used based on above literature review catalytic ozonation is suitable for emering organics degradation in drinking water or municipal domestic sewage treatment however the formation of toxic halogenated by products in catalytic ozonation of wastewaters are also unclear in previous studies perovskite type oxides including mesoporous lafeo3 lamno3 afzal et al 2017 laco mn o3 orge et al 2013 lati0 15cu0 85o3 carbajo et al 2007 and lafe co o3 zhang et al 2018 showed activity in catalytic ozonation for degradation of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps dyes oxalic acid and industrial wastewater due to the unique characteristics of perovskite type oxide afzal et al 2017 additionally the synchronous ppcps degradation and reduction of bro3 was achieved by lacoo3 lco catalytic ozonation zhang et al 2018 however the above studies only presented efficient ability on refractory organics degradation and bro3 reduction it is necessary to evaluate the performance on toxic by products reduction in catalytic ozonation with perovskite type oxides detailed which would justify the feasibility of perovskite type oxides in drinking water or wastewater purification by catalytic ozonation therefore in this study it was evaluated the performance of lacoo3 catalytic ozonation in detailed including the micro pollutant removal performance and the reduction of toxic by products of bro3 small molecular weight carbonyl compounds and dbps precursors additionally efom reaction activity in catalytic ozonation was also investigated by multi spectrum methods including two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos and 1h nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr to clarify the organic components transformation in efom results of this study provided a feasible method for the evaluation of lacoo3 catalytic ozonation in wastewater or reclaimed water advanced treatment as well as the strategy of toxic by products reduction in catalytic ozonation 2 materials and methods 2 1 matrix samples from wwtps wastewater samples were collected from the effluent of primary and secondary clarifiers in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in beijing china collected samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters and immediately stored at 4 c dissolved fraction of effluent were obtained to evaluate the effect of organic substance on the degradation of the emerging pollutant in mixed efom matrix solution and the reduction of toxic by products by lco catalytic ozonation as well as the transformation of organic components in efom to obtain accepted and suitable values of cod 60 3 mg l and doc 9 0 mg l of the matrix the primary and secondary effluents were mixed and the mixture proportion was 1 5 information regarding wwtps and water quality parameters of the primary and secondary effluents are shown in text s1 and table s1 2 2 catalytic ozonation procedure all catalytic ozonation tests were conducted in a 500 ml glass reactor efficient volume 300 ml at room temperature under semi continuous mode ozone gas was generated using a standard laboratory ozone generator 3s a5 beijing tonglin gaoke technology beijing china using pure oxygen source and was fed into the bottom of the glass reactor the aqueous ozone concentration in the working solution was adjusted through the electric current of the ozone generator the glass reactor was filled with mixed effluent spiked with benzotriazole bza 100 μg l br 100 μg l and lco catalyst 0 25 g l that was synthesized by a sol gel method in the lab zhang et al 2018 the matrix solution ph was 7 39 and was not adjusted as the effluent showed enough buffer capacity excess ozone gas was absorbed with potassium iodide solution certain samples were withdrawn for water quality analysis at prescribed intervals and the residual ozone was removed by bubbling nitrogen gas into the solution to stop the reaction after purging the residual ozone samples were disinfected using naclo solution the disinfection procedure is shown detailed in text s2 all experiments were conducted in duplicate and standard deviations have been shown in figures and tables as error bars 2 3 analytical methods residual bza was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters corporation usa bro3 and oxalic acid formed in catalytic ozonated samples was measured directly by ion chromatography ics 3000 dionax usa aldehydes and dbps were extracted using methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy gc ms agilent 7890a gc 5975c msd usa according to the united states environmental protection agency usepa method munch and hautman 1990 munch et al 1999 respectively total organic halogen tox was determined using a total organic halogens analyzer multi x 2500 analytikjena germany doc was measured using a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan detailed information regarding the methods used for the above analyses is shown in text s3 characterization of efom reaction in mixed effluent in catalytic ozonation was conducted based on uv vis absorbance molecular weight mw distribution synchronous fluorescence sf spectrum combination of two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectrum fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy with 2d cos hetero spectral 2d cos combined with sf and ft ir spectrum and 1h nmr spectrum detailed information regarding these analyses is provided in text s4 3 results 3 1 performance of organics degradation generally the sole ozonation showed complete degradation of bza after 20 min with a reaction kinetic constant k app of 0 1462 min 1 inset in fig 1 while the significant increase of k app cata 0 2141 min 1 was observed in lco catalytic ozonation however the surface adsorption of lco was very low less than 3 indicating that the surface catalytic reaction resulted in bza degradation the degradation efficiency of uv254 was 63 3 in the sole ozonation which was improved by catalytic ozonation to 68 1 fig 1 b accordingly suva showed a greater decrease in response to catalytic ozonation 68 2 degradation efficiency than ozonation alone 62 7 degradation efficiency fig 1 b however no mineralization was observed in catalytic ozonation 3 2 formation of toxic by products fig 2 a showed that bro3 increased with the reaction time passed then formed a plateau in both the sole ozonation and catalytic ozonation after 120 min bro3 in catalytic ozonation only decreased 7 3 compared with the sole ozonation catalytic ozonation with lco did not show good ability on bro3 reduction aldehydes and oxalic acid have been received widespread attention as important toxic by products formed in ozonation zhang et al 2008 in this study three kinds of aldehydes simple aldehydes formaldehyde fa acetaldehyde ace and propanal pro dialdehyde glyoxal gly and keto aldehyde methyl glyoxal mgly were identified in catalytic ozonation table 1 the generation yields of them in catalytic ozonation are shown in text s5 in the mixed matrix total aldehydes was 39 1 μg l this yield increased dramatically in the sole ozonation as o3 and reaction time increased total aldehydes increased firstly then decreased better reduction performance of total aldehydes in catalytic ozonation was achieved at lower ozone dose 1 0 mg l as o3 increased total aldehydes increased as the over dose of ozone catalytic ozonation with lco was able to reduce oxalic acid oa when o3 was 2 0 and 5 0 mg l detailed information is shown in fig s1 and text s6 the organic by products were also investigated in this study during the sole ozonation the presence of cl br in solution was transformed to hocl ocl or hobr obr as shown in eqs s 5 s 20 in table s4 von gunten 2003b yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2015a the formed hocl ocl or hobr obr in solution was able to convert efom to toxic halogenated by products heeb et al 2014 however previous studies on catalytic ozonation were not focused on the formation of toxic halogenated organic by products firstly tox was used to evaluate the halogen substitution on efom in catalytic ozonation in the matrix solution cl 121 mg l and without any br tox was 34 μg l as the presence of some halogenated organics in effluent fig 2 b it should be noted that tox increased from 34 to 68 μg l after the sole ozonation and similar tox was observed in catalytic ozonation to evaluate effect of br on tox formation br 100 μg l was added after that tox increased to 126 μg l in the sole ozonation fig 2 b interestingly tox decreased to 61 μg l in lco catalytic ozonation good performance on the reduction of toxic by products containing halogen in the presence of br was observed in catalytic ozonation which was a significant development on the sole ozonation and was not reported before halogenated organic by products including trihalomethanes thms i e trichloromethane tcm and bromodichloromethane bdcm haloacetonitriles hans i e dichloroacetonitrile dcan and bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and haloacetamides hacams i e dichloroacetamide dcacam and trichloroacetamide tcacam were identified in catalytic ozonation when br 100 μg l table 2 in mixed effluent their total amounts identified in this study was 23 1 μg l in the sole ozonation this value increased to 32 2 μg l at 90 min when o3 1 0 mg l as the increasing of the reaction time and o3 total amounts increased dramatically in catalytic ozonation total amounts decreased significantly when o3 2 0 mg l compared with sole ozonation as o3 continued to increase to 5 0 mg l the good reduction of total halogenated by products was also observed especially at 90 min the formation yields of identified halogenated organic by products in catalytic ozonation are shown in text s7 3 3 dbps precursors degradation herein the degradation of dbps precursors was expressed by dbps formation potentials dbps fps after chlorination by overdose free chlorine and enough disinfection time as shown in table 3 total dbps fps was 348 0 μg l after chlorination of the mixed matrix interestingly the sole ozonation reduced total dbps fps and the reduction performance increased as o3 increased however catalytic ozonation by lco did not show any development on the reduction of total dbps fps results suggested that different dbps precursors might be transformed chemically in catalytic ozonation which was confirmed by variations in the structure and chemical properties of dbps precursors in catalytic ozonation this will be discussed in depth in part 4 3 two kinds of thms including tcm and bdcm were identified in this study fps of tcm and bdcm in the mixed matrix after chlorination were 137 5 μg l and 28 6 μg l respectively table 3 moreover their fps decreased when mixed effluent was ozonized especially tcm reduced to 77 4 μg l when o3 5 0 mg l catalytic ozonation with lco showed better efficiency on the reduction of tcm fp and bdcm fp than the sole ozonation bcan dcan and trichloroacetonitrile tcan were also identified fps of bcan dcan and tcan formed from the chlorination of mixed matrix were 16 1 90 9 and 55 9 μg l table 3 respectively after ozonation tcan fp decreased to 16 0 μg l when o3 5 0 mg l interestingly bcan fp and dcan fp decreased at lower ozone doses 1 0 and 2 0 mg l increased to 12 2 and 100 4 μg l when o3 5 0 mg l respectively catalytic ozonation with lco developed the reduction performance of bcan fp when o3 1 0 and 2 0 mg l and the significant degradation of tcan precursor was also observed however catalytic ozonation showed no performance on dcan fp reduction but increased it dcacam and tcacam as emerging dbps were identified here table 3 but their fps were too low which were effectively reduced in ozonation especially for dcacam as o3 increased the reduction effect was more significant however almost no reduction was observed for tcacam the introduction of lco improved the reduction performance of dcacam but also showed no effect on tcacam this is the first study to report degradation of hacams precursor in catalytic ozonation being similar to hacams the ozonation degraded the trichloronitromethane tcnm precursor and this degradation increased with increasing o3 table 3 this was very significant when o3 5 0 mg l in sole ozonation when o3 2 0 or 5 0 mg l catalytic ozonation by lco showed more significant contribution on the reduction of tcnm fp in summary lco catalytic ozonation showed good ability on the reduction of fp of tcm bcan tcan dcacam and tcnm however the introduction of lco exhibited no effect on tcacam precursor degradation what s more dcan fp was promoted in the presence of lco the structure variation of dbps precursors might be account for these results in catalytic ozonation which will be discussed in part 4 3 3 4 reaction activity of efom in catalytic ozonation 3 4 1 uv vis absorbance spectrum properties to further understand the importance of the reaction activity of efom in the mixed effluent in catalytic ozonation and the role of efom in dbps formation the broad uv vis spectrum of samples obtained in catalytic ozonation of mixed effluent were measured uv vis spectrum suggested that highly conjugated organic substances such as aromatic compounds decreased in catalytic ozonation which agreed with results of uv254 and suva fig 1 b additionally easier oxidation of aromatic acids in efom might be finished in catalytic ozonation as shown in fig s2 and text s8 3 4 2 molecular weight distribution properties the mw distribution range of the mixed efom solution showed mw 4 kda and a high mw of 12 589 da fig s3 a lco catalytic ozonation not only degraded of high mw substances 12 589 da completely but also contributed to greater degradation of substances with lower mw mw 0 5 kda this process was more significant than that in ozonation alone fig s3 b which was also reported in feooh catalytic ozonation zhang et al 2008 detailed information is shown in fig s3 and text s9 3 4 3 fluorescence spectrum properties in the mixed matrix sf spectrum showed peaks at 250 and 276 nm which were ascribed to tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances respectively moreover additional peaks at 340 and 370 nm were ascribed to fulvic like and humic like substances fig 3 a respectively jin et al 2016 after the deconvoluted of above four peaks in original sf spectrum the removal efficiency of corresponding components was shown in fig 3 b the sole ozonation showed significant removal efficiency for efom substances especially for fulvic like substances 85 removal efficiency and humic like substances 90 removal efficiency 56 of the tryptophan like substances were removed in the sole ozonation however tyrosine like substances were hard to be degraded by the sole ozonation with only 2 removal efficiency catalytic ozonation with lco improved efom degradation especially for tryptophan like substances increasing 12 degradation efficiency than the sole ozonation in addition catalytic ozonation also showed good removal ability on fulvic like substances with 87 removal efficiency and humic like substances with 92 degradation ability being similar to results of sf spectrum eem spectrum result suggested that efom mainly contained tryptophan like substances a small amount of tyrosine like fulvic like and humic like components neither the sole ozonation nor catalytic ozonation degraded tyrosine like substances fig s4 and text s10 catalytic ozonation with lco promoted the degradation efficiency of tryptophan like fulvic like and humic like components 3 4 4 chemical functional groups properties according to ft ir spectrum the presence of protein like compounds esters ethers phenols carbohydrates and aromatic substances were observed in the mixed efom matrix fig s5 text s11 and table s7 protein like substances phenols and aromatic structures were destroyed in the sole ozonation which was also found in a previous study by ft ir analysis racar et al 2017 in catalytic ozonation lco accelerated the removal of carboxylic acids protein like and aromatic substances significantly which easily observed in ft ir spectrum compared with sf and eem spectrums the above profile of chemical functional groups was also supported by the 1h nmr spectrum fig s6 and text s12 greater degradation of aliphatic hydrocarbons esters amino acids carboxylic acids and aromatic structures was observed in lco catalytic ozonation than that in the sole ozonation suggesting that the presence of lco promoted the degradation and chemical transformation of efom significantly 4 discussion 4 1 reduction of toxic by products 4 1 1 bro3 catalytic ozonation showed worse ability to reduce bro3 in the mixture matrix fig 2 a than that was observed in a previous study using bza solution as the matrix zhang et al 2018 previously lco was found to accelerate the production of ho2 o2 and to generate more h2o2 contributing to the reduction of bro3 zhang et al 2018 additionally the surface hydroxyl groups on lco facilitated the reduction of bro3 in catalytic ozonation of bza previously zhang et al 2018 however the formed h2o2 might be consumed by efom in the mixed matrix ai et al 2017 resulting in the worse ability on bro3 reduction inorganic anions in the mixture matrix affected the ligand exchange with the surface hydroxyl groups eq s 23 in table s4 liu et al 2013 and the consumption of surface hydroxyl groups decreased the bro3 reduction 4 1 2 aldehydes it has been reported that the molecular ozone cleaved larger organic molecules into smaller ones and reacted with unsaturated aliphatic chain compounds or aromatic groups of efom to produce carbonyl compounds papageorgiou et al 2014 the increasing total aldehydes observed in ozonation alone table 1 may be due to the further oxidation of unsaturated components or aromatic groups with the molecular ozone and radical fig s5 in catalytic ozonation a good reduction of aldehydes was achieved when o3 1 0 mg l the developed formation of ho in the presence of lco zhang et al 2018 may degrade aldehydes but higher o3 promoted the formation of aldehydes due to the further oxidation of efom by the over dosed ozone resulted in an increase of aldehydes catalytic ozonation with goethite also increased total aldehydes and acetone from hia and hib compared with the sole ozonation but produced a slight decrease from hoa and hon fractions zhang et al 2008 4 1 3 halogenated organic by products for halogenated organic by products the sole ozonation increased tox in the presence of only cl fig 2 b in the sole ozonation chlorine radicals and hocl ocl were formed through the reaction of generated ho with excess chloride ions in wastewater as shown in eqs s 5 s 11 and the reaction rate constant for ho and cl is about 103 m 1s 1 at neutral ph eqs s 5 and s 5 according to the previous study von gunten 2003b the formed chlorine radicals and hocl ocl would oxidize or substitute the organics in efom and led to an undesirable increase in tox catalytic ozonation showed no reduction on tox formation in presence of only cl however the formation of hocl ocl and chlorine radicals was promoted in lco catalytic ozonation due to the presence of ho zhang et al 2018 eqs s 5 s 11 which increased tox conversely the formed tox would also be degraded by more ho in catalytic ozonation the above result might lead to no reduction of tox in lco catalytic ozonation after the addition of br tox increased dramatically in ozonation alone which was consistent with results that halogenated organic by products increased in ozonation alone of humic acid in the presence of br due to the formation of chbr3 haag and holgné 1983 firstly efom served as a target of br and hobr obr attacking leading to the formation of halogenated organic by products von gunten 2003b and increasing tox eqs s 12 s 22 additionally the formation of new clbr eqs s 24 and s 25 in the addition of br also promoted the generation of tox through reaction between efom and halogenated radicals xie et al 2016 interestingly catalytic ozonation showed remarkable tox reduction in the presence of br lco catalytic ozonation accelerated the formation of ho zhang et al 2018 and promoted structural transformation without any degradation fig 1 b this might decrease efom reaction activity with br and hobr obr furthermore the formed halogenated organic by products could be further degraded by the ho formed in lco catalytic ozonation these pathways decreased tox in catalytic ozonation in this study some volatile halogenated organic by products were identified in the sole ozonation the higher ozone dose and longer reaction time decreased tcm and bdcm table 2 the formed tcm and bdcm may be further degraded at higher ozone dose the presence of lco increased ho and led to lower tcm and bdcm the similar reaction resulted in that catalytic ozonation also showed better performance for reduction of hans and hacams at higher ozone doses 4 2 insight into efom reactivity in catalytic ozonation with 2d cos to investigate the fate of efom in the mixed effluent in catalytic ozonation 2d cos of sf spectrum were applied firstly the synchronous map fig 4 a displayed an obvious auto peak located at the diagonal line at 276 nm tryptophan like substances with a lower intensity peak at 340 nm fluvic like substances jin et al 2016 according to noda s rule text s4 the higher intensity of auto peak at 276 nm suggested that tryptophan like substances were more susceptible and more easily oxidized in catalytic ozonation than fluvic like substances with a lower intensity of auto peak at 340 nm herein both cross peaks at 340 276 and 370 276 were characterized with positive signal suggesting that the variation in tryptophan like fluvic like and humic like substances jin et al 2016 was in the same direction while the fluorescent intensity decreased simultaneously these results also indicated that all substances in the mixed matrix were oxidized simultaneously with no transformation when the asynchronous mapping was conducted fig 4 b the spectrum was characterized with positive cross peaks at 340 276 and 370 276 according to noda s rule text s4 the sequential order of peaks generated by efom in catalytic ozonation of mixed effluent was 340 nm 276 nm and 370 nm 276 nm demonstrating that fluvic like and humic like substances might be oxidized first in catalytic ozonation after which tryptophan like components in mixed effluent were degraded secondly 2d cos of ft ir was used to investigate variations in functional groups in catalytic ozonation three auto peaks in the synchronous spectrum were observed at 880 1384 and 1637 cm 1 fig 4 c corresponding to c h bond in the aromatic structure c h bond in the methyl structure and cc co in the protein like substance respectively rodriguez et al 2016 the highest intensity auto peak at 880 nm indicated that the c h bond in the aromatic structure was more susceptible in catalytic ozonation and more easily degraded positive cross peaks at 880 1384 1637 and 1384 1637 were also observed suggesting that protein like compounds carbohydrates and aromatic substances in efom decreased simultaneously in catalytic ozonation and that there was no mutual transformation of functional groups observed in the asynchronous spectrum fig 4 d cross peaks at 880 1210 1384 1637 1033 1210 1384 1637 1210 1135 1384 and 1503 1210 1384 1637 were all positive in addition a new peak was found at 1135 cm 1 that was related to the group of c c in carbohydrates racar et al 2017 the observed new peak indicated that 2d cos was able to improve the resolution of ft ir spectrum and to solve peak overlapping moreover several negative cross peaks were found at 1135 880 1503 and 1384 880 1003 1503 1637 variation in the observed peaks chemical functional bond in catalytic ozonation followed in the order of 880 1503 1003 1210 1637 1135 1384 indicating that catalytic ozonation degraded aromatic structures in efom firstly then oxidized protein like substances and carbohydrates a previous study also showed that unsaturated compounds preferably reacted with the molecular ozone than aliphatic like compounds deeudomwongsa et al 2017 but was not shown in detailed as this study to further investigate the variations of functional groups in each component in catalytic ozonation the hetero spectral 2d cos between sf and ft ir spectrum was obtained including the synchronous and asynchronous maps in the synchronous map fig 4 e several positive peaks at 880 1003 1210 1503 and 1637 cm 1 were observed in the horizontal direction along the fluorescence wavelength at 276 nm indicating that c h and cc bonds 880 and 1503 cm 1 in the aromatic structures c o groups 1003 cm 1 c o groups in esters and ethers 1210 cm 1 and co 1637 cm 1 in protein like substances rodriguez et al 2016 were derived from the same origin with tryptophan like substances 276 nm in the synthetic matrix moreover two positive peaks at 880 cm 1 340 nm and 1210 cm 1 340 nm were observed suggesting the presence of c h bond in aromatic structures 880 cm 1 and c o group in esters ethers and phenols 1210 cm 1 showed a similar origin to fluvic like substances xiao et al 2017 only the c h bond in the aromatic structure 880 cm 1 showed the same origin with humic like components according to the positive peak at 880 cm 1 370 nm in other words fluvic like and humic like substances mainly contained aromatic structures which was in accordance with results of previous studies that showed that fluvic like and humic like substances exhibited high aromaticity and contributions from functional groups with conjugated bonds deeudomwongsa et al 2017 in the asynchronous map fig 4 f cross peaks were identified at 880 1003 1135 1210 1503 1637 cm 1 276 nm with a positive signal indicating that the aromatic functional groups 880 and 1503 cm 1 c o group 1003 cm 1 c c group 1135 cm 1 c o group in esters ethers and phenols 1210 cm 1 and cc co 1637 cm 1 were precedent to changes in tryptophan like substances 276 nm the negative cross peak at 3434 cm 1 276 nm suggested that o h groups was changed more slowly in tryptophan like substances by catalytic ozonation the positive peaks at 880 1210 cm 1 340 nm and 880 1210 cm 1 370 nm indicated that variations in aromatic structures 880 cm 1 and c o groups in esters ethers and phenols 1210 cm 1 in fluvic like and humic like substances varied firstly while the negative peaks at 3434 cm 1 340 370 nm revealed that o h groups in fluvic like and humic like substances likely changed more slowly taking the sequential variation in 2d cos of sf ft ir spectrum and hetero spectral 2d cos together the variation in efom substances in catalytic ozonation likely followed a preferential order of aromatic functional groups in fluvic like and humic like substances aromatic functional groups in tryptophan like substances carbohydrates in tryptophan like substances in summary the combination of 2d cos and hetero spectral analyses clearly confirmed the oxidation sequence of efom in catalytic ozonation ozonation and catalytic ozonation preferentially oxidized high aromaticity substances such as humic like and fluvic like substances than tryptophan like substances this comprehensive method confirmed the transformation pathway of efom in catalytic ozonation detailed and showed the ozonation sequence of chemical functional groups in each substance in efom aromatic groups in fluvic like and humic like substances aromatic groups in tryptophan like substances carbohydrates in tryptophan like substances this is the first report of ho induced transformation between efom fractions and functional groups in catalytic ozonation using 2d cos and hetero spectral analyses 4 3 dbps precursors degradation the hydrophobic fraction in efom was rich in aromatic compounds such as humic like and fluvic like substances showing higher potential to form thms than the hydrophilic fraction chiang et al 2009 unlike thms precursor hans precursor mainly originated from the hydrophilic fraction containing nitrogen jin et al 2016 furthermore protein like substances including aromatic amino acids were an important source of hacams as important nitrogen dbps zhou et al 2015b herein the identified hydrophobic fraction in humic like and fluvic like substances fig 3 a and fig s4 a in the mixed matrix served as precursor of thms ozonation favorably oxidized aromatic functional groups in fluvic like and humic like substances which was confirmed by multi spectrum analyses fig 4 this reaction decreased thms fps in the sole ozonation additionally lco catalytic ozonation accelerated the degradation of fluvic like substances fig 3 b and fig s4 d which also resulted in a slight decrease of thms fps table 3 these results were in agreement with the finding that better removal efficiency of thms precursor was achieved in tio2 catalytic ozonation molnar et al 2012 in the sole ozonation the hydrophilic fraction mainly involving protein like substances wen et al 2010 in mixed effluent was degraded fig 3 a and fig s4 b when o3 was lower resulting in decreased hans fps table 3 when o3 was higher the hydrophobic fraction of efom such as humic like and fluvic like substances might have been transformed to hydrophilic compounds chiang et al 2009 leading to increased hans fps this finding was remarkable due to the formation of ho in the presence of lco accelerated transformation of the hydrophobic fraction to a hydrophilic fraction molnar et al 2012 in addition tio2 catalytic ozonation also promoted the generation of a hydrophilic fraction forming more hans molnar et al 2012 the increased degradation of protein like substances reported as hacams precursor in lco catalytic ozonation was also observed fig 3 a and fig s4 c in accordance with previous reports zhou et al 2015b the increasing o3 and presence of lco catalyst enhanced this degradation significantly table 3 which would decrease hacams fp in the sole ozonation the transformation from the hydrophobic to the hydrophilic fraction was reported before jin et al 2016 the hydrophobic fraction contained precursor of thms while the latter contained hans precursor the presence of lco accelerated the above transformation promoting the degradation of thms precursor but increasing the levels of han fps however catalytic ozonation did not decrease total dbps fps owing to the transformation of different dbps precursors in catalytic ozonation similar results were also found in ru ac catalytic ozonation wang et al 2009 the above result confirmed lco catalytic ozonation was a promoting technology in wastewater reclaimed process 4 4 strategy of decreasing toxic by products in catalytic ozonation with the focus of this study the feasibility of lco catalytic ozonation in wastewater reclaiming was investigated meanwhile the strategy of decreasing toxic by products in catalytic ozonation was proposed based above result lco as an efficient catalyst was able to be used in micro pollutant degradation in wastewater purification even at lower ozone 1 0 mg l additionally in order to decrease toxic by products generated from the ozonation the optimal parameters on total aldehydes degradation was observed in catalytic ozonation under lower ozone 1 0 mg l and shorter reaction time 90 min better reduction on ace pro and mgly formation was also found compared with sole ozonation as expected lco catalytic ozonation greatly inhibited total halogenated organic by products formation with ozone 2 0 mg l especially for the reduction of nitrogen containing by products hans and hacams catalytic ozonation enhanced the degradation of thms precursors especially at higher ozone 5 0 mg l meanwhile better reduction of hans fps was observed in catalytic ozonation when ozone 2 0 mg l the optimal parameters on the reduction of hacams fps was ozone 5 0 mg l in both the sole ozonation and catalytic ozonation summarily when wastewater included higher halogen ion and lower total nitrogen the optimal parameters for the reduction of aldehydes halogenated organic by products and thms fps was achieved at lower o3 1 0 mg l in catalytic ozonation for wastewater containing higher total nitrogen the presence of lco with ozone 2 0 mg l was able to be used to reduce halogenated organic by products and n dbps formation 5 conclusion the degradation of micro pollutant benzotriazole bza reduction of toxic by products removal of dbps precursors and reaction activity of efom in catalytic ozonation were investigated several highlight viewpoints were obtained as below lacoo3 catalytic ozonation promoted the removal of bza and reduced the formation of aldehydes and oxalic acid as important toxic by products in the sole ozonation furthermore the halogenated organic by products formed in the sole ozonation were significantly reduced by catalytic ozonation as the first report in this field however this technology was not able to efficiently reduce the formed bro3 in the efom matrix additionally catalytic ozonation also showed ability on removing the precursor of ruled dpbs multi spectrum methods and their corresponding two dimensional correlation spectrums were used to identify the reaction activity of efom in catalytic ozonation the highly conjugated hydrophobic fluvic like and humic like fractions were oxidized prior to catalytic ozonation and the structure of residual efom was dominated by hydrophilic substances the above structural transformation of efom led to decreased dbps fps the obtained highlight results suggested that catalytic ozonation with lacoo3 did not only complete micro pollutant degradation but also declined the formation yields of toxic by products including aldehydes oxalic acid the halogenated organic by products and its derived dbps in chlorination disinfection as an efficient enhanced technology for purification and reusing domestic sewage finally the strategy on toxic by products reduction in catalytic ozonation were also proposed which is considered reasonable for using lco catalytic ozonation in purification and reusing domestic sewage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18456,the ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led has recently emerged as a new uv source it offers design flexibility due to its small size and ability to alter its radiation profile in view of the variety of design possibilities for a uv led reactor a computational model could be of great value for simulating the reactor and providing insight into its performance given the uv led s ability to emit various radiation wavelengths and because it is a directional uv source the challenges of simulation for uv leds are greater than those for uv lamps which typically have a single wavelength and an almost radial radiation profile this study proposes a method of simulating uv led reactors in the eulerian framework through the integration of the kinetic hydrodynamic and radiation models representing uv led systems additionally the concept of an ideal uv led system is proposed which can provide insight into the efficiency of any uv led reactor design concept the integrated model of reactor performance is evaluated through experimental studies of challenge organisms e g escherichia coli and ms2 in two uv led reactors under different operating conditions including flow rates flow regimes radiant powers and uv led configurations the close agreement between the numerical predictions and experimental data demonstrates the ability of the proposed method to simulate uv led reactor performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv led computational modeling uv led reactor performance ideal uv led reactor design efficiency 1 introduction recently the ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led has emerged as a new uv source that can address the shortcomings of the uv lamp in water treatment systems a uv led is a solid state semiconductor device that emits uv radiation instantly when connected to direct current dc owing to its fast start up the uv led can easily handle intermittent water use moreover due to its low dc power requirement it can run on batteries or solar cells and this feature makes it a viable alternative for remote areas that do not have continuous access to electricity uv led technology offers design flexibility because of its small package size a few mm in addition to being small uv leds have two features that differentiate them from uv lamps the first is that the radiation profile of uv leds can be modified using optical lenses taghipour 2018 or reflectors collins et al 2017 this feature promises a better radiation hydrodynamics interaction which is essential to achieving high uv reactor performance the second feature relates to uv led flexibility in terms of emanating the desired wavelengths this characteristic enables the uv led s emission spectrum to be tailored to a given photoreaction taghipour 2013 in order to achieve higher photoreactivation rates than those of mercury vapor uv lamps to fully and optimally benefit from the distinctive features of uv led technology for water disinfection it is necessary to investigate the interaction of three complex phenomena hydrodynamics radiation and kinetics that taken together serve as an indication of reactor performance with regards to uv lamp reactors several models have been proposed for radiation distribution e g jacobm and dranoff 1970 irazoqui et al 1973 blatchley 1997 liu et al 2004 and the kinetic rate constants of microbial inactivation have been measured using uv lamp collimated beam device bolton and linden 2003 it has been shown that the reactor hydrodynamics radiation and kinetics can be integrated and solved by a numerical simulator such as the computational fluid dynamics cfd software package for uv reactor modeling e g wright and lawryshyn 2000 chiu et al 1999 e r blatchley et al 2008 j j ducoste liu and linden 2005 sozzi and taghipour 2006 elyasi and taghipour 2006 the challenges associated with the development of an integrated model for simulating uv led reactors however are greater than those associated with uv lamp reactors for example specific features such as the radiation patterns and polychromatic radiation outputs of various uv leds kheyrandish et al 2017 should be considered while modeling the reactor radiation and kinetics several experimental studies have investigated the efficacy of uv leds for water disinfection würtele et al 2011 oguma et al 2013 hessling et al 2016 zyara et al 2017 however further studies need to be conducted to identify the design concepts that lead to a better radiation hydrodynamics interaction and ultimately a higher reactor performance a computational model is required to integrate the three aforementioned phenomena in order to illustrate how any specific uv led reactor concept performs and to provide insight into reactor design and performance generally uv reactors can be simulated in lagrangian or eulerian frameworks e g lyn et al 1999 chiu et al 1999 wright and lawryshyn 2000 j j ducoste liu and linden 2005 sozzi and taghipour 2006 y a lawryshyn and hofmann 2015 elyasi and taghipour 2006 in the lagrangian method after obtaining the flow field by solving the equation of mass and momentum conservation microorganisms particles as a dispersed phase are released and their trajectories are computed considering the newtonian equation of motions microorganisms receive uv energy along their paths and the accumulated uv energy which determines their overall inactivation is computed by considering radiation distribution along the particles trajectories in the eulerian method the conservation equations of mass and momentum along with species mass conservation equations are solved the comparison of the average microorganism values at the inlet and outlet determines the overall performance of the uv reactor lyn et al 1999 ducoste et al 2005 the eulerian model could be advanced to obtain the species concentration profiles and the local rate of reactor performance elyasi and taghipour 2006 sozzi and taghipour 2006 which are critical pieces of information for reactor design and optimization a flow through uv led reactor in the lagrangian framework was simulated using a simplified uv led radiation model and the potential of a simulation tool for the performance analysis of a uv led reactor was demonstrated jenny et al 2014 2015 yet to our knowledge no published study has addressed the simulation of a flow through uv led reactor in the eulerian framework eulerian based modeling reveals valuable information such as the concentration and accumulated fluence profiles for the entire reactor whereas lagrangian modeling does not provide such information an important insight provided by the computational modeling of uv reactors is its prediction of the maximum fluence that a uv reactor can deliver by comparing the delivered fluence with the maximum fluence the design efficiency elyasi and taghipour 2006 pan and orava 2007 or mixing efficiency bolton 2000 of a uv reactor is obtained which indicates the room for design improvement generally the delivered fluence can be increased by improving the hydrodynamics and or radiation profiles of a uv led reactor for example when the radiation profile is fixed the maximum fluence could be achieved if the fluid is completely mixed within the reactor f m a x h bolton 2000 when the assumption of completely mixed flow holds if the radiation profile of such a reactor is improved e g by rearranging the leds the performance can improve even further f m a x r the maximum fluence of a uv led reactor can increase further if the entire radiant energy of the uv led is preserved within the reactor resulting in the ultimate fluence fu which indicates the highest fluence that a uv led reactor can deliver this article formulates the ultimate fluence that can be delivered by an ideal uv led reactor and it explains the calculation of the maximum fluence and performance efficiency for any particular reactor design concept further this article proposes a methodology for the development of a model for the simulation of uv led reactors in the eulerian framework additionally it demonstrates the application of this simulation tool to the modeling of two cylindrical flow through uv led reactors comprising four uv leds as a case study the uv led is modeled as a point source according to its specific radiation pattern and radiation distribution is obtained by considering the refraction reflection and absorption that take place in various media through the reactor the ability of the model to predict reactor performance is evaluated using biodosimetry with escherichia coli atcc 11229 and ms2 atcc 15597 b1 as the challenge microorganisms it is shown that the developed model could predict the overall reactor performance accurately under a range of conditions including different flow rates flow regimes uv led arrangements and uv intensities the model presented here can be applied to the virtual prototyping of different reactor configurations and the optimization of reactor design and operation to achieve superior performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 calculation of maximum uv led reactor performance the inactivation of microorganisms in a uv reactor is a function of the uv fluence delivered to microorganisms where uv fluence is the product of fluence rate multiplied by exposure time an ideal uv reactor preserves the entirety of the uv energy and delivers the same fluence i e f u to all microorganisms whereas a non ideal uv reactor partly preserves the radiant energy and delivers a wide range of fluences to the water flow because preserving the entirety of the uv energy may not be practical part of the energy is typically lost to the reactor walls maximum performance can still be obtained by delivering maximum fluence to a reactor geometry that does not preserve the entirety of the energy a general approach can be taken to the quantification of the maximum deliverable fluence of a non ideal uv reactor with a known geometry and fluence rate distribution for such a reactor the maximum performance takes place when all the microorganisms are exposed to the volumetric average fluence rate for a time span equal to the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor i e v q where v is the reactor volume and q is the flow rate such performance could be obtained if the fluid is completely mixed within the reactor hence by calculating the volume weighted average fluence rate e 0 the maximum deliverable fluence resulting from the mixed flow assumption f m a x h is determined according to equation 1 bolton 2000 1 f m a x h e 0 v q the calculation of the maximum fluence of a non ideal uv led reactor depends on e 0 which is obtained by radiation modeling however unlike a non ideal reactor the ultimate performance of an ideal uv led reactor can be calculated without carrying out radiation modeling and by considering only the entire energy input that is preserved in the reactor a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr or a plug flow reactor pfr that harvests all the photons for microbial inactivation are two types of ideal flow through uv led reactors in a cstr where the microorganism suspension is completely mixed even if the fully preserved radiation distribution is non uniform all the microorganisms will be exposed to the same level of radiant energy as for the pfr because all the microorganisms spend the same time in the reactor and the reactor is radially completely mixed they receive the same fluence regardless of the radiation distribution inside the reactor one example for the pfr could be an infinitely long cylinder equipped with a collimating lens that without energy loss captures and collimates all the photons over the cross section of the pfr fig 1 in such a pfr the uv rays and the fluid have opposite but parallel directions resulting in the same value for the optical length λ and reactor length l here the distance that the uv rays travel before leaving the reactor is called optical length λ in the following section this virtual reactor is used to derive a mathematical formula for calculating the ultimate fluence f u 2 1 1 approach for the determination of an ideal uv led reactor efficiency when all the photons are collimated the fluence rate on the pipe cross section will be equal to p a where p w and a m 2 are the sum of each uv led s germicidal output powers and the area of the pipe s lateral cross section respectively in a pfr the hrt s is a l q where l m is the length of the reactor and q m 3 s is the flow rate in such a pfr all the microorganisms will remain in the reactor for a duration equivalent to the hrt and they receive the fluence rate of p a w m 2 assuming there is no absorption in the medium considering the effect of the uv absorption in water fluence j m 2 at each cross section with the thickness of δx will be equal to p δ x q 10 α x or p δ x q e ln 10 α x where x m is the distance from the one end of the pipe and α 1 m is the uv absorption coefficient of the water fig 1 in this regard this reactor will deliver the fluence of 0 l p dx q e ln 10 α x to microorganisms up to the length of l if the absorption coefficient is zero the delivered fluence will be p l q however taking into account uv absorption of water not 100 uv transmittance the following equation represents the delivered fluence in a cylindrical reactor up to the length of l 2 f l p q 1 10 α l ln 10 α in equation 2 another perspective can be considered the logarithmic mean of power p along the reactor length reaches to the microbial suspension therefore f l will be equal to p l q where p is equal to p 1 10 α λ ln 10 α λ p is the germicidal power of the uv led source and λ optical length is equal to l in this configuration if the length of the pfr is infinite then all the uv energy is cultivated for inactivation and the reactor delivers ultimate fluence f u equation 3 equation 3 correlates f u to germicidal power p flow rate q and absorption coefficient α all of which are available prior to the reactor design so the ultimate fluence can be estimated for a given uv led reactor by knowing the aforementioned parameters 3 f u p ln 10 α q 2 2 numerical procedures fluid flow uv energy distribution and inactivation kinetics impact the performance of a uv reactor appropriate models are needed to capture each of these phenomena and to integrate them in order to simulate the overall behavior of a uv reactor in this section relevant models of fluid kinetics and radiation along with a procedure for their integration are presented 2 2 1 fluid flow model in the eulerian framework the microbial species live and inactivated are treated as chemical substances with the same properties as the water because the movement and properties of microorganisms have a negligible impact on the flow field the velocity and pressure distributions are obtained by solving the governing equations of the mass equation 4 and momentum equation 5 conservation bird et al 2007 considering the properties of the water in equations 4 and 5 υ ρ p τ g a n d f are velocity the density of water pressure viscous stress tensor gravitational acceleration and external body force respectively 4 ν 0 5 ρ ν ν p τ ρ g f given that microorganisms are much larger than water molecules the molecular diffusion of microorganisms into the water is deemed negligible ducoste et al 2005 elyasi and taghipour 2006 therefore equations 6 and 7 represent the species mass conservation in steady state laminar and turbulent flow regimes bird et al 2007 when the species turbulent schmitt number ϑ t is 0 7 respectively in equations 6 and 7 xi and si are the species mass fraction and the source term respectively the source term represents the volumetric reaction rate of microorganisms and is explained in the following section 6 ρ x i ν s i 7 ρx i ν ϑ t 0 7 2 ρx i s i 2 2 2 kinetic model microbial inactivation is a function of uv fluence f and the inactivation rate constant k for example in chick watson microbial inactivation model equation 8 hijnen et al 2006 f n 0 and n are uv fluence the number of microorganisms before uv exposure and the number after exposure respectively 8 log n n 0 k f by rearranging and substituting the concentration ratio c c 0 for the microbial survival ratio n n 0 and the product of e 0 and t for f fluence is a product of fluence rate e 0 and exposure time t in equation 8 the following equation is obtained 9 c c 0 10 k e 0 t where c 0 k g m 3 and c k g m 3 are the concentrations of microorganisms before and after uv exposure respectively equation 9 correlates the concentration of microorganisms to the exposure time under a constant fluence rate in a completely mixed reactor the derivative of equation 9 with respect to time equation 10 yields the volumetric rate of microbial inactivation k g m 3 s as seen the volumetric reaction rate equation 10 with respect to the microbial concentration c is a first order kinetic and its magnitude depends on the local concentration c the fluence rate e 0 and the inactivation rate constant k 10 d c d t ln 10 e 0 k c 2 2 3 radiation model to determine the fluence rate across the reactor the radiation profile of the uv source and the phenomena mainly responsible for impacting the propagation of uv rays through different media are considered regarding the modeling of the radiation source a polynomial function is initially fit to the uv led s normalized radiation profile the radiant power is then measured using an integrated sphere to convert the normalized profile to the actual one in a typical uv reactor and in this study the uv leds are separated from the water by a quartz window fig 2 and uv leds are stuck to the external surface of the quartz window given the size of uv leds the dye emitting region of the uv led was assumed to be 500 μm away from the quartz window for the purposes of simulation reflection and refraction from through air quartz water interfaces were considered moreover reflection from internal surfaces due to fresnel s law was taken into consideration the details of radiation modeling have been explained elsewhere keshavarzfathy and taghipour 2019 in short equation 11 was used to obtain fluence rate e 0 across the reactor 11 e 0 θ i θ l 1 l 2 l 3 2 1 r 1 1 r 2 e κ 1 l 1 κ 2 l 2 κ 2 l 3 in equation 11 θ is the polar angle i θ is the actual uv led radiation profile r 1 and r 2 are respectively the amount of reflected energy from the air quartz and quartz water interfaces l and κ are the length that a ray travels in the i t h medium and the absorption coefficient of the i t h medium respectively subscripts refer to the number of the medium presented in fig 2 the amount of reflected radiant energy from the internal wall of the reactor was calculated by applying fresnel s law to the energy reaching the surface and the direction of the reflected rays the green dashed vector in fig 2 was determined by inverting the ray direction the blue vector in water in fig 2 along the wall normal vector 2 2 4 strategies for adjusting the volumetric reaction rate equation 10 is a general formula that can be applied to the simulation of any uv reactor however the two parameters e 0 and k need to be adjusted because uv leds could have different emission spectra which in turn impacts k in this study e coli and ms2 were chosen as model organisms with different k values the k represents the slope of the fluence response curve at any given fluence because microorganisms particularly bacteria have repair mechanisms li et al 2017 zimmer and slawson 2002 they tend to exhibit the shoulder effect at low fluences consequently e coli s fluence response data usually do not follow a linear pattern similar to ms2 fig 3 rather it tends to illustrate a s shaped pattern that starts with a shoulder phase at the low fluences a semi log phase in the middle and tailing saturation phase at high fluences to address the non linearity of e coli kinetic data its fluence response curve was captured by means of two linear functions to differentiate the rates of reaction during its shoulder and semi log phases according to equation 10 another parameter that influences the magnitude of the volumetric reaction rate is the local fluence rate e 0 when multiple uv leds with different peak wavelengths are used to irradiate water the rate of inactivation is influenced by the combined effects of each individual uv led because the disinfection capacity of a uv led depends on its emission spectrum multiple kinetic data and source terms are required to simulate the reactor which complicates the simulation to address this problem the germicidal powers of uv leds were used to calculate the fluence rate the germicidal power of a uv source expresses the ratio of the effectiveness of that uv source compared to that of a low pressure uv lamp emitting at 254 nm in short the germicidal power of a uv source is the convolution of its spectral power distribution and the action spectra of a microorganism using the uv led s germicidal factor one is able to convert the radiant power of a uv led to that of a low pressure uv lamp 254 nm therefore the reliable fluence response data obtained by a collimated beam apparatus using a lp uv lamp can be used as an acceptable approximation for obtaining reliable kinetic data in this study the challenge organisms 254 nm kinetic data which were obtained by following bolton s method bolton and linden 2003 were collected from the literature malayeri et al 2016 and the average of the collected data was selected for the simulation the upper and lower bounds show the maximum and minimum fluence that lead to a given log inactivation fig 3 the fluence response data can also be obtained for any uv led and microorganism using the standard protocol for uv led microbial inactivation calculation kheyrandish et al 2018 2 2 5 geometrical model mesh structure and boundary condition in this study two uv led reactors as shown in fig 4 were simulated the ansys 18 2 simulation package was used to build and discretize the problem domains of the two reactors with and without a diffuser hereafter reactor 1 and reactor 2 fig 4 via 742539 hexahedral and 1047222 tetrahedral cells respectively mesh size provided grid independent results as further mesh refinement had a negligible impact on the final solutions fully developed boundary condition was applied to the inlet pressure outlet and no slip boundary conditions were imposed on the outlet and internal walls respectively the mass fraction of microorganisms at the inlet was set to one additionally zero diffusive flux of species was specified on the walls 2 2 6 numerical solution method and strategy ansys fluent was employed to read the mesh and to perform the simulation two user defined functions were developed and integrated into ansys fluent to compute the source terms in the species mass conservation equations and fluence rate distribution laminar and realizable k ε models from the hydrodynamic sub models were selected for reactor 1 and reactor 2 respectively the simplec was selected for the pressure velocity coupling the second order upwind was chosen for pressure and momentum and quick for species under spatial discretization finally 0 7 was used for the species under relaxation factor the convergence of the results was approved once the errors of two successive iterations for the scaled residuals were less than 10 6 because the movement of microorganisms does not change the velocity distribution the velocity field was initially obtained and kept frozen and the species mass conservation equations were then solved 2 3 experimental methods the uv led reactor consisted of a 5 cm plexiglass pipe with a length of 17 cm to incorporate four uv leds fig 4 to assess the performance of the reactor in a wider range of hydrodynamics a 2 cm circular object henceforth called the diffuser was fixed on the axis of the reactor by a narrow rod fig 4 the uv leds were separated from the water using a 3 mm thick commercial grade quartz sheet technical glass product inc to effectively control the temperature of each uv led during operation the heat dissipation was managed by means of a combination of a thermoelectric cooler a heatsink and a fan the inlet and outlet pipes id 1 cm were aligned with the axis of the reactor to eliminate the effect of entrance length and allow the fully developed flow to enter the reactor an inlet pipe with a length of 20 cm was chosen to maintain the homogeneity of the microbial suspension i e e coli or ms2 throughout the experiment the suspension inside the feeding tank was stirred continuously using a mixer the initial concentration of the microbial suspension in the feeding tank was typically 106 cfu ml or pfu ml the uv transmittance uvt of the suspension was measured at 270 nm using a spectrometer cary 100 uv vis the flow was pumped to the reactor by a peristaltic pump masterflex analog pump system cole parmer instrument company and a pulse dampener masterflex pulse dampener cole parmer instrument company was installed after the pump to dampen the flow fluctuation the samples were collected at the outlet and kept in the dark and cultivated shortly after the sample collection 2 3 1 characterization of uv leds four uv leds with the balloon shaped radiation profile but each with slightly different emission spectra and various power outputs fig 5 were selected for irradiating the reactor the leds radiant flux was measured using an integrating sphere ic2 stellarnet inc coupled to a spectrometer stellarnet inc black comet uv vis via a subminiature assembly sma fiber optic the uv leds outputs were measured at 350 ma and 400 ma using the integrating sphere considering the uv leds power current relationship which was provided by the manufacturer each uv led s output at the current of interest e g 375 ma or 180 ma was calculated by interpolation of the measured values considering the input power and the measured outputs the wall plug efficiencies of led1 led2 led3 and led4 were 0 40 0 26 0 31 and 0 43 respectively 3 results and discussion the simulation predictions were evaluated experimentally using two uv led reactors with e coli and ms2 under different operating conditions such as different flow rates flow regimes radiation intensities and radiation distributions this section presents the numerical and experimental results and it provides a detailed discussion of the uv led reactor performance and design modification it concludes with a discussion of the design efficiency of the uv led reactors 3 1 the effect of flow rate the disinfection capacity of a uv reactor can be reported as a reduction equivalent fluence ref the ref is determined by inputting the measured log inactivation into the uv dose response curve usepa 2006 in other words the ref represents the average amount of uv fluence delivered to the water because the delivered uv fluence determines the efficiency of a uv reactor it was selected instead of log inactivation which depends on the type microorganism to compare the performance of the reactor in different conditions fig 6 shows that 3 log10 inactivation of e coli i e ref 6 2 m j c m 2 happened at the flow rate of 90 ml min when all the uv leds were operating at 375 5 ma the log10 inactivation dropped sharply to 1 44 log10 ref 4 2 m j c m 2 when the flow rate changed to 120 ml min when the flow rate increased further and reached 150 ml min the e coli inactivation dropped to 0 97 log10 ref 3 6 m j c m 2 when the flow rate was increased by 33 and 67 with respect to 90 ml min the equivalent dose fluence delivered by the reactor decreased by 32 and 42 respectively as fig 6 shows simulation results agreed well with the measurements in all the flow rates and the model captured this non linearity of inverse inactivation versus flow rate it was observed that utilizing the inactivation function for the reactor simulation led to slight overprediction the difference between the simulations and the average of measurements for the flow rates of 90 ml min 120 ml min and 150 ml min was 2 5 10 5 and 9 0 respectively nonetheless all the simulations fell within the standard deviation of the experimental measurements the inactivation results can be further understood by examining the distribution of flow radiation and the delivered dose in the reactor fig 7 a shows the velocity contours on the longitudinal cross section of reactor 1 at the 150 ml min flow rate the water moves quickly along the axis of reactor 1 and the water recirculates in the region between the central axis and the walls due to the pressure difference as a result of the recirculation a relatively higher residence time for the water is expected in that region fig 7 b shows that the fluence rate distribution is not uniform and decreases at greater distances from the uv led because the refractive indices of the water i e 1 37 and the plexiglass i e 1 5 are close to each other which leads to a large amount of incident energy leaving the reactor the reflection from the walls does not significantly alter the fluence rate distribution fig 7 c displays a highly concentrated stream of e coli passing through the central section while the rest of the reactor contains much less concentration due to the flow recirculation and longer residence time at greater distances from the uv leds principal direction near the wall where a relatively low fluence rate is available the water has a lower microorganism concentration than the central section the locally delivered fluence displayed in fig 7 d can explain this observation in our model each computational cell is analogous to an ideal cstr the efficacy of which is determined by the residence time and delivered fluence rate in other words local performance can be related to the delivered fluence in each computational cell from this perspective this reactor can be divided into three sections near uv leds the middle section and far from uv leds fig 7 d shows that near uv leds where the water has high residence time and receives a high fluence rate the rate of inactivation is high i e high fluence in the middle section due to short residence time and a relatively low fluence rate the reactor performs poorly finally far from uv leds although a lower fluence rate than in the middle section is received the high fluence is delivered to microorganisms due to higher residence time the local fluence determines the performance of each cell however it should be noted that the overall performance of a uv reactor depends on the accumulated fluence microorganisms receive different amounts of uv energy depending on their trajectories within the reactor and the sum of all the locally delivered fluences yields the accumulated fluence received by each microorganism the accumulated fluence distribution shows how microorganisms receive uv energy along their trajectories so the effect of any change on local performance will appear in the accumulated fluence in the eulerian framework the concentration of microorganisms represents the history of the interaction of hydrodynamics radiation and kinetics across the reactor therefore using the microorganism s fluence response curve e g fig 3 the accumulated delivered fluence across the reactor can be obtained fig 7 e displays the accumulated fluence across the reactor the accumulated fluence decreases slightly at the top and adjacent to the walls because the water recirculates and brings back a portion of untreated microorganisms the amount of accumulated fluence in the middle section is far less than that of other sections showing the area that diminishes the reactor performance this information along with the local delivered fluence facilitates the identification of areas of low performance in the reactor such areas can then be minimized by implementing changes in the reactor design for example if the low fluence in one area results from short residence time i e high velocity the flow pattern in the reactor can be modified by applying flow modifiers similarly if the low fluence results from a low fluence rate the uv leds can be rearranged to generate a better radiant power distribution 3 2 the effect of radiation magnitude and distribution unlike the power of uv lamps that of uv leds can be easily adjusted this capability of uv leds enables the tailoring of their outputs to the target microorganism which results in operational flexibility and energy saving another element of the uv led system s operational flexibility relates to its fast start up capability because uv leds have no warm up time they can be turned on and off instantly consequently the number of operating uv leds in the system can be managed based on the flow rate in this section the ability of the simulation method to capture the behavior of the reactor under different outputs and configurations of uv leds is presented to investigate the effect of radiant power on performance the forward current of uv leds was halved at the flow rate of 90 ml min which resulted in a 48 reduction in the uv leds outputs although the outputs became approximately halved the overall log10 removal decreased by 67 fig 8 the analysis of performance in terms of delivered fluence showed that when the output decreased by 48 the ref decreased by 43 for an ideal reactor e g a plug flow reactor the reduction in uv power output linearly reduces the delivered fluence to the microorganisms bolton 2000 however in practice since uv reactors are non ideal microorganisms receive a variety of uv fluences resulting in a very complex behavior between the lamp power and ref the relationship between ref and lamp power becomes more complex during the treatment of microorganisms with shoulder effect because the reactor performance is influenced by two different kinetic rate constants in a separate set of experiments the effect of uv led arrangement on the reactor performance was studied this experiment investigated the contribution of led1 and led4 to the overall inactivation at the flow rate of 90 ml min and investigated whether the model is capable of predicting such a contribution the experiments showed that 1 7 log10 ref 4 5 m j c m 2 could be achieved by the two leds and this was closely predicted by the model which was 1 6 log10 ref 4 4 m j c m 2 the close agreement between the simulation and experiments showed the potential of this technique for assessing each element of the reactor the circuit of uv leds can be designed in such a way to turn the uv leds on and off independently in order to meet the target ref in different flow rates 3 3 the effect of hydrodynamics the simulation results of reactor 1 revealed that the central area d2 in fig 7 d inside the reactor diminished the overall reactor performance a diffuser was placed to divert the water from the central area to modify the flow and prevent the high velocity flow jet at the reactor center according to the simulation predictions reactor 2 could disinfect e coli at the flow rate of 250 ml min beyond the detection limit therefore ms2 as a more uv resistant organism was chosen for the experimental studies as a result of the flow modification reactor 2 could achieve 1 35 and 0 79 log10 of ms2 inactivation fig 9 or 25 m j c m 2 and 11 5 m j c m 2 in terms of ref at 250 ml min and 600 ml min respectively given that reactor 2 outperformed reactor 1 under the same operating conditions the overall improvement can be attributed solely to hydrodynamic effects the velocity contours on the longitudinal cross section of reactor 2 fig 10 a show that the flow is diverted from the central part after hitting the diffuser and that water moves toward the reactor s wall and then recombines somewhere near the outlet as a result of the flow distribution microorganisms pass near uv led and are exposed to the highest uv fluence rate inside the reactor fig 10 b both reactor 1 and reactor 2 deliver the same amount of uv fluence to the water in reactor 1 microorganisms that stay inside the reactor for a long time receive high uv fluence whereas those pass through the central part accumulate low fluences since the overall performance is primarily determined by low fluence streams reactor 1 performs poorly in reactor 2 the diffuser mixes the water and reduces the variance of uv dose among microorganism this leads to a tighter accumulated fluence distribution and consequently higher performance bolton 2000 lawryshyn and hofmann 2015 wols et al 2011 wright and lawryshyn 2000 fig 10 c shows the normalized concentration distribution on the longitudinal cross section of reactor 2 there is a significant difference between the concentration of ms2 before and after the diffuser fig 10 c due to the water recirculation before the diffuser the ms2 concentration decreases considerably and in contrast to the case of reactor 1 there is not a highly concentrated area around the axis of reactor 2 after the diffuser however the water is disinfected gradually with higher inactivation in an area close to the uv leds as the figure shows the concentration distribution is not uniform despite the diffuser spreads microorganisms across the lateral cross section because fluence rate attenuates along the principal direction of uv leds microorganisms that pass under the diffuser and are far from uv leds experience lower rates of inactivation compared to those pass near uv leds fig 10 c therefore concentration distributions over the lateral cross sections are not uniform as explained above the local performance of a uv reactor equates with local fluence in this study a computational cell that receives low fluence is called a dark cell and a series of dark cells is called a dark channel a dark channel forms either when the fluid residence time is very short or the local fluence rate is negligible not every dark channel has the same negative impact on the performance of a uv reactor the one that bridges the inlet and outlet drastically reduces overall disinfection efficiency because this channel bypasses a large number of microorganisms in our case study reactor 1 has high local fluence everywhere except the central part d2 in fig 7 where the water has high velocity the diffuser impedes the formation of the channel by diverting the water consequently the dark blue region around the central part of reactor 1 fig 7 d disappears in reactor 2 fig 10 d however the local fluence is not quite uniformly distributed across reactor 2 for example the delivered fluences are greater near uv leds high fluence rate and the back of the diffuser high residence time than in the rest of the reactor although some dark areas of reactor 1 were eliminated in reactor 2 due to the diffuser the dark regions that form as a result of the low radiant energy remain in the reactor fig 10 b2 uv rays bend toward the normal axis of the uv led due to refraction and are attenuated because of reflection at the air quartz water interfaces and the absorption thus the radiation profile of the uv led appeared similar to a cone fig 10 b2 only a very small portion of radiation energy reaches beyond its radiation cone consequently some areas in the reactor receive low radiation and perform poorly the dark areas between uv leds fig 10 b do not contribute significantly to the reactor performance however microorganisms that pass through those areas have a chance of being exposed to uv along their trajectories in contrast the dark areas that form on the lateral cross sections continue in the path of water from the inlet all the way to the outlet causing a notable reduction of the overall performance it should be noted that because the body of the reactor is not reflective and most of the radiation energy is lost at the reactor s internal surfaces the reflection has a negligible impact on the received energy particularly in the region between uv leds fig 10 b iso volume is the volume of all the mesh elements in the domain that falls within a specified range of a variable value fig 11 a shows the regions iso volume with the normalized concentration of 0 1 1 across reactor 2 at 250 ml min there is a strong correlation between the position of dark regions on the lateral cross sections and the highly concentrated stream of microorganisms pink color in fig 11 b such correlation indicates the importance of the concentration profile in recognizing the worst dark channels in the uv reactor which is essential information for reactor modification 3 4 reactor efficiency as noted above reactor 2 significantly outperformed reactor 1 despite similar geometry volume the same radiant profile and power of uv leds the better performance of reactor 2 can be attributed to the improved hydrodynamics as explained in the introduction the performance of a uv led reactor can be increased by enhancing the hydrodynamics and or radiation profiles of the reactor for example if the current radiation profile of reactor 1 or reactor 2 remains unchanged the maximum fluence is obtained if the water is completely mixed within the reactor bolton 2000 elyasi and taghipour 2006 pan and orava 2007 here this type of maximum fluence that results from hydrodynamic enhancement is shown by f max h if the arrangement of uv leds in the reactors changes in such a way that uv rays of leds are collimated along the reactor length similar to fig 1 the maximum fluence increases further the maximum fluence that results from radiation improvement along with the completely mixed flow assumption is shown by f m a x r finally if the radiant energy is fully preserved within the reactors and the reactor behaves similarly to a cstr or pfr the ultimate fluence is obtained f u the efficiency of a uv reactor design can be determined by dividing ref by the maximum fluence equation 12 depending on the type of maximum fluence the design efficiency carries a different meaning 12 η x r e f f m a x x x h r u table 1 presents ref f m a x h f m a x r and f u of reactor 1 and reactor 2 at the two flow rates of 250 ml min and 600 ml min the ref which represents the average of experimentally delivered fluence to the water was back calculated using a 254 nm fluence response curve of ms2 ref can be obtained based on experimental or simulation results because ms2 inactivation by reactor 1 fell below the detection limit the corresponding simulation result was used for the calculation of ref the f m a x h was calculated when e 0 was 0 44 m w c m 2 and the hrts for the flow rates of 250 ml min and 600 ml min were 82 7 s and 34 4 s respectively the f m a x r was calculated according to equation 2 by considering 43 3 mw total germicidal power the decadic absorption coefficient of 8 77 10 3 c m 1 and l of 17 cm finally the f u was calculated using equation 3 table 1 shows that the ref of reactor 2 24 9 m j c m 2 was significantly higher than that of reactor 1 2 6 m j c m 2 indicating the impact of the diffuser on the enhancement of the hydrodynamics as a result of the hydrodynamic alteration the η h increased from 7 in reactor 1 to 68 in reactor 2 when the flow rate increased the η h or mixing efficiency reached 76 overall when the flow rate increases in a reactor the variance of the uv fluence distribution necessarily reduces lawryshyn and hofmann 2015 wols et al 2011 further better mixing in general could result in different elements of fluid being exposed to both high and low areas of fluence rates within a reactor these factors lead to a narrower accumulated fluence distribution and consequently a higher performance the quantity of η h indicates that the hydrodynamics can still be improved to achieve greater performance as seen f m a x r at the flow rate of 250 ml min is close to 150 m j c m 2 which is approximately 3 7 times greater than the corresponding f m a x h the large difference implies that a considerable amount of uv energy is dissipated to the walls which can be avoided by rearranging the uv leds although f m a x r is higher than f m a x h it is still less than f u comparing f m a x r with f u shows that 30 of ultimate performance can be obtained from this reactor if all the radiant power is collimated and the fluid is fully mixed based on this finding to cultivate more radiant energy for the inactivation if the rays are collimated along the axis of the reactor the length of the reactor can be increased or the radiant energy can be retained using reflective material 3 5 radiant power calculation a crucial aspect of the implementation of a uv system is its energy consumption one of the main applications of equation 3 is the calculation of the input power p i n p u t to deliver a targeted fluence as explained above the germicidal power of a radiation source is the product of its radiant power and germicidal factor g f so the radiant power can be calculated by knowing the uv source s germicidal factor in addition the wall plug efficiency wpe of the uv source should be considered because a portion of input power converts to radiant energy and the rest is lost mainly as heat taking all the factors into consideration the following equation describes the amount of input power needed to obtain a desired fluence in an ideal uv reactor 13 1 p i n p u t i d e a l 1 f u g f w p e ln 10 q α substituting equation 12 in equation 13 yields the input power needed to deliver a targeted fluence f t in any real uv reactor equation 13 14 p i n p u t r e a l f t η u ln 10 α q g f w p e the innate differences between uv sources are their germicidal factors and wpes the difference between uv reactors however relates to their design factor i e η as inferred from equation 14 a decent uv source has higher wpe and g f and enables the achievement of a greater design efficiency i e η u this study s approach of applying the eulerian simulation for identifying poorly performing areas and their elimination can be applied to any uv led system in order to enhance the design efficiency of the reactor further the profile of concentration in the reactor can be utilized to track and evaluate the pathways resulting in the delivery of low fluence to the fluid and the reactor outlet innovative design concepts along with the help of a reactor modeling tool for design optimization promise greater design efficiencies of next generation uv reactors 4 conclusion this study proposed an approach to modeling uv led reactors in the eulerian framework the germicidal factors of uv leds were calculated and used to homogenize the germicidal radiant power outputs of uv leds this practical approach reduced the complexity of the simulation and eliminated the necessity of developing kinetic data for each uv led based on its wavelength distribution the close predictions of experimental results showed the ability of the proposed modeling approach for uv led reactor simulation moreover the study explained and discussed the performance of uv led reactors and methods for design modifications it was shown that the fluence at each computational cell determines the local performance within a uv led reactor the low fluence paths particularly those that extend from the reactor s inlet to its outlet resulting in the carrying of a high concentration of microorganisms to the outlet drastically reduce the overall performance and have to be modified for enhanced performance although the local fluence is crucial information for identifying and eliminating the low performing regions inside the reactor simultaneous analysis of the local fluence and concentration profiles are necessary during the design modification process and reactor optimization generally the ref of a uv led reactor is always less than f u taking into account the non ideal hydrodynamics and radiation distribution as well as the radiant energy loss preserving the uv rays within the reactor and elegantly cultivating them for photoreaction are necessary to achieve higher performance making the internal surfaces of a uv led reactor uv reflective as well as completely mixing the water may result in high performance alternatively aligning the uv rays with the flow direction while matching the radiant power and velocity may be a suitable option as

18456,the ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led has recently emerged as a new uv source it offers design flexibility due to its small size and ability to alter its radiation profile in view of the variety of design possibilities for a uv led reactor a computational model could be of great value for simulating the reactor and providing insight into its performance given the uv led s ability to emit various radiation wavelengths and because it is a directional uv source the challenges of simulation for uv leds are greater than those for uv lamps which typically have a single wavelength and an almost radial radiation profile this study proposes a method of simulating uv led reactors in the eulerian framework through the integration of the kinetic hydrodynamic and radiation models representing uv led systems additionally the concept of an ideal uv led system is proposed which can provide insight into the efficiency of any uv led reactor design concept the integrated model of reactor performance is evaluated through experimental studies of challenge organisms e g escherichia coli and ms2 in two uv led reactors under different operating conditions including flow rates flow regimes radiant powers and uv led configurations the close agreement between the numerical predictions and experimental data demonstrates the ability of the proposed method to simulate uv led reactor performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv led computational modeling uv led reactor performance ideal uv led reactor design efficiency 1 introduction recently the ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led has emerged as a new uv source that can address the shortcomings of the uv lamp in water treatment systems a uv led is a solid state semiconductor device that emits uv radiation instantly when connected to direct current dc owing to its fast start up the uv led can easily handle intermittent water use moreover due to its low dc power requirement it can run on batteries or solar cells and this feature makes it a viable alternative for remote areas that do not have continuous access to electricity uv led technology offers design flexibility because of its small package size a few mm in addition to being small uv leds have two features that differentiate them from uv lamps the first is that the radiation profile of uv leds can be modified using optical lenses taghipour 2018 or reflectors collins et al 2017 this feature promises a better radiation hydrodynamics interaction which is essential to achieving high uv reactor performance the second feature relates to uv led flexibility in terms of emanating the desired wavelengths this characteristic enables the uv led s emission spectrum to be tailored to a given photoreaction taghipour 2013 in order to achieve higher photoreactivation rates than those of mercury vapor uv lamps to fully and optimally benefit from the distinctive features of uv led technology for water disinfection it is necessary to investigate the interaction of three complex phenomena hydrodynamics radiation and kinetics that taken together serve as an indication of reactor performance with regards to uv lamp reactors several models have been proposed for radiation distribution e g jacobm and dranoff 1970 irazoqui et al 1973 blatchley 1997 liu et al 2004 and the kinetic rate constants of microbial inactivation have been measured using uv lamp collimated beam device bolton and linden 2003 it has been shown that the reactor hydrodynamics radiation and kinetics can be integrated and solved by a numerical simulator such as the computational fluid dynamics cfd software package for uv reactor modeling e g wright and lawryshyn 2000 chiu et al 1999 e r blatchley et al 2008 j j ducoste liu and linden 2005 sozzi and taghipour 2006 elyasi and taghipour 2006 the challenges associated with the development of an integrated model for simulating uv led reactors however are greater than those associated with uv lamp reactors for example specific features such as the radiation patterns and polychromatic radiation outputs of various uv leds kheyrandish et al 2017 should be considered while modeling the reactor radiation and kinetics several experimental studies have investigated the efficacy of uv leds for water disinfection würtele et al 2011 oguma et al 2013 hessling et al 2016 zyara et al 2017 however further studies need to be conducted to identify the design concepts that lead to a better radiation hydrodynamics interaction and ultimately a higher reactor performance a computational model is required to integrate the three aforementioned phenomena in order to illustrate how any specific uv led reactor concept performs and to provide insight into reactor design and performance generally uv reactors can be simulated in lagrangian or eulerian frameworks e g lyn et al 1999 chiu et al 1999 wright and lawryshyn 2000 j j ducoste liu and linden 2005 sozzi and taghipour 2006 y a lawryshyn and hofmann 2015 elyasi and taghipour 2006 in the lagrangian method after obtaining the flow field by solving the equation of mass and momentum conservation microorganisms particles as a dispersed phase are released and their trajectories are computed considering the newtonian equation of motions microorganisms receive uv energy along their paths and the accumulated uv energy which determines their overall inactivation is computed by considering radiation distribution along the particles trajectories in the eulerian method the conservation equations of mass and momentum along with species mass conservation equations are solved the comparison of the average microorganism values at the inlet and outlet determines the overall performance of the uv reactor lyn et al 1999 ducoste et al 2005 the eulerian model could be advanced to obtain the species concentration profiles and the local rate of reactor performance elyasi and taghipour 2006 sozzi and taghipour 2006 which are critical pieces of information for reactor design and optimization a flow through uv led reactor in the lagrangian framework was simulated using a simplified uv led radiation model and the potential of a simulation tool for the performance analysis of a uv led reactor was demonstrated jenny et al 2014 2015 yet to our knowledge no published study has addressed the simulation of a flow through uv led reactor in the eulerian framework eulerian based modeling reveals valuable information such as the concentration and accumulated fluence profiles for the entire reactor whereas lagrangian modeling does not provide such information an important insight provided by the computational modeling of uv reactors is its prediction of the maximum fluence that a uv reactor can deliver by comparing the delivered fluence with the maximum fluence the design efficiency elyasi and taghipour 2006 pan and orava 2007 or mixing efficiency bolton 2000 of a uv reactor is obtained which indicates the room for design improvement generally the delivered fluence can be increased by improving the hydrodynamics and or radiation profiles of a uv led reactor for example when the radiation profile is fixed the maximum fluence could be achieved if the fluid is completely mixed within the reactor f m a x h bolton 2000 when the assumption of completely mixed flow holds if the radiation profile of such a reactor is improved e g by rearranging the leds the performance can improve even further f m a x r the maximum fluence of a uv led reactor can increase further if the entire radiant energy of the uv led is preserved within the reactor resulting in the ultimate fluence fu which indicates the highest fluence that a uv led reactor can deliver this article formulates the ultimate fluence that can be delivered by an ideal uv led reactor and it explains the calculation of the maximum fluence and performance efficiency for any particular reactor design concept further this article proposes a methodology for the development of a model for the simulation of uv led reactors in the eulerian framework additionally it demonstrates the application of this simulation tool to the modeling of two cylindrical flow through uv led reactors comprising four uv leds as a case study the uv led is modeled as a point source according to its specific radiation pattern and radiation distribution is obtained by considering the refraction reflection and absorption that take place in various media through the reactor the ability of the model to predict reactor performance is evaluated using biodosimetry with escherichia coli atcc 11229 and ms2 atcc 15597 b1 as the challenge microorganisms it is shown that the developed model could predict the overall reactor performance accurately under a range of conditions including different flow rates flow regimes uv led arrangements and uv intensities the model presented here can be applied to the virtual prototyping of different reactor configurations and the optimization of reactor design and operation to achieve superior performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 calculation of maximum uv led reactor performance the inactivation of microorganisms in a uv reactor is a function of the uv fluence delivered to microorganisms where uv fluence is the product of fluence rate multiplied by exposure time an ideal uv reactor preserves the entirety of the uv energy and delivers the same fluence i e f u to all microorganisms whereas a non ideal uv reactor partly preserves the radiant energy and delivers a wide range of fluences to the water flow because preserving the entirety of the uv energy may not be practical part of the energy is typically lost to the reactor walls maximum performance can still be obtained by delivering maximum fluence to a reactor geometry that does not preserve the entirety of the energy a general approach can be taken to the quantification of the maximum deliverable fluence of a non ideal uv reactor with a known geometry and fluence rate distribution for such a reactor the maximum performance takes place when all the microorganisms are exposed to the volumetric average fluence rate for a time span equal to the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor i e v q where v is the reactor volume and q is the flow rate such performance could be obtained if the fluid is completely mixed within the reactor hence by calculating the volume weighted average fluence rate e 0 the maximum deliverable fluence resulting from the mixed flow assumption f m a x h is determined according to equation 1 bolton 2000 1 f m a x h e 0 v q the calculation of the maximum fluence of a non ideal uv led reactor depends on e 0 which is obtained by radiation modeling however unlike a non ideal reactor the ultimate performance of an ideal uv led reactor can be calculated without carrying out radiation modeling and by considering only the entire energy input that is preserved in the reactor a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr or a plug flow reactor pfr that harvests all the photons for microbial inactivation are two types of ideal flow through uv led reactors in a cstr where the microorganism suspension is completely mixed even if the fully preserved radiation distribution is non uniform all the microorganisms will be exposed to the same level of radiant energy as for the pfr because all the microorganisms spend the same time in the reactor and the reactor is radially completely mixed they receive the same fluence regardless of the radiation distribution inside the reactor one example for the pfr could be an infinitely long cylinder equipped with a collimating lens that without energy loss captures and collimates all the photons over the cross section of the pfr fig 1 in such a pfr the uv rays and the fluid have opposite but parallel directions resulting in the same value for the optical length λ and reactor length l here the distance that the uv rays travel before leaving the reactor is called optical length λ in the following section this virtual reactor is used to derive a mathematical formula for calculating the ultimate fluence f u 2 1 1 approach for the determination of an ideal uv led reactor efficiency when all the photons are collimated the fluence rate on the pipe cross section will be equal to p a where p w and a m 2 are the sum of each uv led s germicidal output powers and the area of the pipe s lateral cross section respectively in a pfr the hrt s is a l q where l m is the length of the reactor and q m 3 s is the flow rate in such a pfr all the microorganisms will remain in the reactor for a duration equivalent to the hrt and they receive the fluence rate of p a w m 2 assuming there is no absorption in the medium considering the effect of the uv absorption in water fluence j m 2 at each cross section with the thickness of δx will be equal to p δ x q 10 α x or p δ x q e ln 10 α x where x m is the distance from the one end of the pipe and α 1 m is the uv absorption coefficient of the water fig 1 in this regard this reactor will deliver the fluence of 0 l p dx q e ln 10 α x to microorganisms up to the length of l if the absorption coefficient is zero the delivered fluence will be p l q however taking into account uv absorption of water not 100 uv transmittance the following equation represents the delivered fluence in a cylindrical reactor up to the length of l 2 f l p q 1 10 α l ln 10 α in equation 2 another perspective can be considered the logarithmic mean of power p along the reactor length reaches to the microbial suspension therefore f l will be equal to p l q where p is equal to p 1 10 α λ ln 10 α λ p is the germicidal power of the uv led source and λ optical length is equal to l in this configuration if the length of the pfr is infinite then all the uv energy is cultivated for inactivation and the reactor delivers ultimate fluence f u equation 3 equation 3 correlates f u to germicidal power p flow rate q and absorption coefficient α all of which are available prior to the reactor design so the ultimate fluence can be estimated for a given uv led reactor by knowing the aforementioned parameters 3 f u p ln 10 α q 2 2 numerical procedures fluid flow uv energy distribution and inactivation kinetics impact the performance of a uv reactor appropriate models are needed to capture each of these phenomena and to integrate them in order to simulate the overall behavior of a uv reactor in this section relevant models of fluid kinetics and radiation along with a procedure for their integration are presented 2 2 1 fluid flow model in the eulerian framework the microbial species live and inactivated are treated as chemical substances with the same properties as the water because the movement and properties of microorganisms have a negligible impact on the flow field the velocity and pressure distributions are obtained by solving the governing equations of the mass equation 4 and momentum equation 5 conservation bird et al 2007 considering the properties of the water in equations 4 and 5 υ ρ p τ g a n d f are velocity the density of water pressure viscous stress tensor gravitational acceleration and external body force respectively 4 ν 0 5 ρ ν ν p τ ρ g f given that microorganisms are much larger than water molecules the molecular diffusion of microorganisms into the water is deemed negligible ducoste et al 2005 elyasi and taghipour 2006 therefore equations 6 and 7 represent the species mass conservation in steady state laminar and turbulent flow regimes bird et al 2007 when the species turbulent schmitt number ϑ t is 0 7 respectively in equations 6 and 7 xi and si are the species mass fraction and the source term respectively the source term represents the volumetric reaction rate of microorganisms and is explained in the following section 6 ρ x i ν s i 7 ρx i ν ϑ t 0 7 2 ρx i s i 2 2 2 kinetic model microbial inactivation is a function of uv fluence f and the inactivation rate constant k for example in chick watson microbial inactivation model equation 8 hijnen et al 2006 f n 0 and n are uv fluence the number of microorganisms before uv exposure and the number after exposure respectively 8 log n n 0 k f by rearranging and substituting the concentration ratio c c 0 for the microbial survival ratio n n 0 and the product of e 0 and t for f fluence is a product of fluence rate e 0 and exposure time t in equation 8 the following equation is obtained 9 c c 0 10 k e 0 t where c 0 k g m 3 and c k g m 3 are the concentrations of microorganisms before and after uv exposure respectively equation 9 correlates the concentration of microorganisms to the exposure time under a constant fluence rate in a completely mixed reactor the derivative of equation 9 with respect to time equation 10 yields the volumetric rate of microbial inactivation k g m 3 s as seen the volumetric reaction rate equation 10 with respect to the microbial concentration c is a first order kinetic and its magnitude depends on the local concentration c the fluence rate e 0 and the inactivation rate constant k 10 d c d t ln 10 e 0 k c 2 2 3 radiation model to determine the fluence rate across the reactor the radiation profile of the uv source and the phenomena mainly responsible for impacting the propagation of uv rays through different media are considered regarding the modeling of the radiation source a polynomial function is initially fit to the uv led s normalized radiation profile the radiant power is then measured using an integrated sphere to convert the normalized profile to the actual one in a typical uv reactor and in this study the uv leds are separated from the water by a quartz window fig 2 and uv leds are stuck to the external surface of the quartz window given the size of uv leds the dye emitting region of the uv led was assumed to be 500 μm away from the quartz window for the purposes of simulation reflection and refraction from through air quartz water interfaces were considered moreover reflection from internal surfaces due to fresnel s law was taken into consideration the details of radiation modeling have been explained elsewhere keshavarzfathy and taghipour 2019 in short equation 11 was used to obtain fluence rate e 0 across the reactor 11 e 0 θ i θ l 1 l 2 l 3 2 1 r 1 1 r 2 e κ 1 l 1 κ 2 l 2 κ 2 l 3 in equation 11 θ is the polar angle i θ is the actual uv led radiation profile r 1 and r 2 are respectively the amount of reflected energy from the air quartz and quartz water interfaces l and κ are the length that a ray travels in the i t h medium and the absorption coefficient of the i t h medium respectively subscripts refer to the number of the medium presented in fig 2 the amount of reflected radiant energy from the internal wall of the reactor was calculated by applying fresnel s law to the energy reaching the surface and the direction of the reflected rays the green dashed vector in fig 2 was determined by inverting the ray direction the blue vector in water in fig 2 along the wall normal vector 2 2 4 strategies for adjusting the volumetric reaction rate equation 10 is a general formula that can be applied to the simulation of any uv reactor however the two parameters e 0 and k need to be adjusted because uv leds could have different emission spectra which in turn impacts k in this study e coli and ms2 were chosen as model organisms with different k values the k represents the slope of the fluence response curve at any given fluence because microorganisms particularly bacteria have repair mechanisms li et al 2017 zimmer and slawson 2002 they tend to exhibit the shoulder effect at low fluences consequently e coli s fluence response data usually do not follow a linear pattern similar to ms2 fig 3 rather it tends to illustrate a s shaped pattern that starts with a shoulder phase at the low fluences a semi log phase in the middle and tailing saturation phase at high fluences to address the non linearity of e coli kinetic data its fluence response curve was captured by means of two linear functions to differentiate the rates of reaction during its shoulder and semi log phases according to equation 10 another parameter that influences the magnitude of the volumetric reaction rate is the local fluence rate e 0 when multiple uv leds with different peak wavelengths are used to irradiate water the rate of inactivation is influenced by the combined effects of each individual uv led because the disinfection capacity of a uv led depends on its emission spectrum multiple kinetic data and source terms are required to simulate the reactor which complicates the simulation to address this problem the germicidal powers of uv leds were used to calculate the fluence rate the germicidal power of a uv source expresses the ratio of the effectiveness of that uv source compared to that of a low pressure uv lamp emitting at 254 nm in short the germicidal power of a uv source is the convolution of its spectral power distribution and the action spectra of a microorganism using the uv led s germicidal factor one is able to convert the radiant power of a uv led to that of a low pressure uv lamp 254 nm therefore the reliable fluence response data obtained by a collimated beam apparatus using a lp uv lamp can be used as an acceptable approximation for obtaining reliable kinetic data in this study the challenge organisms 254 nm kinetic data which were obtained by following bolton s method bolton and linden 2003 were collected from the literature malayeri et al 2016 and the average of the collected data was selected for the simulation the upper and lower bounds show the maximum and minimum fluence that lead to a given log inactivation fig 3 the fluence response data can also be obtained for any uv led and microorganism using the standard protocol for uv led microbial inactivation calculation kheyrandish et al 2018 2 2 5 geometrical model mesh structure and boundary condition in this study two uv led reactors as shown in fig 4 were simulated the ansys 18 2 simulation package was used to build and discretize the problem domains of the two reactors with and without a diffuser hereafter reactor 1 and reactor 2 fig 4 via 742539 hexahedral and 1047222 tetrahedral cells respectively mesh size provided grid independent results as further mesh refinement had a negligible impact on the final solutions fully developed boundary condition was applied to the inlet pressure outlet and no slip boundary conditions were imposed on the outlet and internal walls respectively the mass fraction of microorganisms at the inlet was set to one additionally zero diffusive flux of species was specified on the walls 2 2 6 numerical solution method and strategy ansys fluent was employed to read the mesh and to perform the simulation two user defined functions were developed and integrated into ansys fluent to compute the source terms in the species mass conservation equations and fluence rate distribution laminar and realizable k ε models from the hydrodynamic sub models were selected for reactor 1 and reactor 2 respectively the simplec was selected for the pressure velocity coupling the second order upwind was chosen for pressure and momentum and quick for species under spatial discretization finally 0 7 was used for the species under relaxation factor the convergence of the results was approved once the errors of two successive iterations for the scaled residuals were less than 10 6 because the movement of microorganisms does not change the velocity distribution the velocity field was initially obtained and kept frozen and the species mass conservation equations were then solved 2 3 experimental methods the uv led reactor consisted of a 5 cm plexiglass pipe with a length of 17 cm to incorporate four uv leds fig 4 to assess the performance of the reactor in a wider range of hydrodynamics a 2 cm circular object henceforth called the diffuser was fixed on the axis of the reactor by a narrow rod fig 4 the uv leds were separated from the water using a 3 mm thick commercial grade quartz sheet technical glass product inc to effectively control the temperature of each uv led during operation the heat dissipation was managed by means of a combination of a thermoelectric cooler a heatsink and a fan the inlet and outlet pipes id 1 cm were aligned with the axis of the reactor to eliminate the effect of entrance length and allow the fully developed flow to enter the reactor an inlet pipe with a length of 20 cm was chosen to maintain the homogeneity of the microbial suspension i e e coli or ms2 throughout the experiment the suspension inside the feeding tank was stirred continuously using a mixer the initial concentration of the microbial suspension in the feeding tank was typically 106 cfu ml or pfu ml the uv transmittance uvt of the suspension was measured at 270 nm using a spectrometer cary 100 uv vis the flow was pumped to the reactor by a peristaltic pump masterflex analog pump system cole parmer instrument company and a pulse dampener masterflex pulse dampener cole parmer instrument company was installed after the pump to dampen the flow fluctuation the samples were collected at the outlet and kept in the dark and cultivated shortly after the sample collection 2 3 1 characterization of uv leds four uv leds with the balloon shaped radiation profile but each with slightly different emission spectra and various power outputs fig 5 were selected for irradiating the reactor the leds radiant flux was measured using an integrating sphere ic2 stellarnet inc coupled to a spectrometer stellarnet inc black comet uv vis via a subminiature assembly sma fiber optic the uv leds outputs were measured at 350 ma and 400 ma using the integrating sphere considering the uv leds power current relationship which was provided by the manufacturer each uv led s output at the current of interest e g 375 ma or 180 ma was calculated by interpolation of the measured values considering the input power and the measured outputs the wall plug efficiencies of led1 led2 led3 and led4 were 0 40 0 26 0 31 and 0 43 respectively 3 results and discussion the simulation predictions were evaluated experimentally using two uv led reactors with e coli and ms2 under different operating conditions such as different flow rates flow regimes radiation intensities and radiation distributions this section presents the numerical and experimental results and it provides a detailed discussion of the uv led reactor performance and design modification it concludes with a discussion of the design efficiency of the uv led reactors 3 1 the effect of flow rate the disinfection capacity of a uv reactor can be reported as a reduction equivalent fluence ref the ref is determined by inputting the measured log inactivation into the uv dose response curve usepa 2006 in other words the ref represents the average amount of uv fluence delivered to the water because the delivered uv fluence determines the efficiency of a uv reactor it was selected instead of log inactivation which depends on the type microorganism to compare the performance of the reactor in different conditions fig 6 shows that 3 log10 inactivation of e coli i e ref 6 2 m j c m 2 happened at the flow rate of 90 ml min when all the uv leds were operating at 375 5 ma the log10 inactivation dropped sharply to 1 44 log10 ref 4 2 m j c m 2 when the flow rate changed to 120 ml min when the flow rate increased further and reached 150 ml min the e coli inactivation dropped to 0 97 log10 ref 3 6 m j c m 2 when the flow rate was increased by 33 and 67 with respect to 90 ml min the equivalent dose fluence delivered by the reactor decreased by 32 and 42 respectively as fig 6 shows simulation results agreed well with the measurements in all the flow rates and the model captured this non linearity of inverse inactivation versus flow rate it was observed that utilizing the inactivation function for the reactor simulation led to slight overprediction the difference between the simulations and the average of measurements for the flow rates of 90 ml min 120 ml min and 150 ml min was 2 5 10 5 and 9 0 respectively nonetheless all the simulations fell within the standard deviation of the experimental measurements the inactivation results can be further understood by examining the distribution of flow radiation and the delivered dose in the reactor fig 7 a shows the velocity contours on the longitudinal cross section of reactor 1 at the 150 ml min flow rate the water moves quickly along the axis of reactor 1 and the water recirculates in the region between the central axis and the walls due to the pressure difference as a result of the recirculation a relatively higher residence time for the water is expected in that region fig 7 b shows that the fluence rate distribution is not uniform and decreases at greater distances from the uv led because the refractive indices of the water i e 1 37 and the plexiglass i e 1 5 are close to each other which leads to a large amount of incident energy leaving the reactor the reflection from the walls does not significantly alter the fluence rate distribution fig 7 c displays a highly concentrated stream of e coli passing through the central section while the rest of the reactor contains much less concentration due to the flow recirculation and longer residence time at greater distances from the uv leds principal direction near the wall where a relatively low fluence rate is available the water has a lower microorganism concentration than the central section the locally delivered fluence displayed in fig 7 d can explain this observation in our model each computational cell is analogous to an ideal cstr the efficacy of which is determined by the residence time and delivered fluence rate in other words local performance can be related to the delivered fluence in each computational cell from this perspective this reactor can be divided into three sections near uv leds the middle section and far from uv leds fig 7 d shows that near uv leds where the water has high residence time and receives a high fluence rate the rate of inactivation is high i e high fluence in the middle section due to short residence time and a relatively low fluence rate the reactor performs poorly finally far from uv leds although a lower fluence rate than in the middle section is received the high fluence is delivered to microorganisms due to higher residence time the local fluence determines the performance of each cell however it should be noted that the overall performance of a uv reactor depends on the accumulated fluence microorganisms receive different amounts of uv energy depending on their trajectories within the reactor and the sum of all the locally delivered fluences yields the accumulated fluence received by each microorganism the accumulated fluence distribution shows how microorganisms receive uv energy along their trajectories so the effect of any change on local performance will appear in the accumulated fluence in the eulerian framework the concentration of microorganisms represents the history of the interaction of hydrodynamics radiation and kinetics across the reactor therefore using the microorganism s fluence response curve e g fig 3 the accumulated delivered fluence across the reactor can be obtained fig 7 e displays the accumulated fluence across the reactor the accumulated fluence decreases slightly at the top and adjacent to the walls because the water recirculates and brings back a portion of untreated microorganisms the amount of accumulated fluence in the middle section is far less than that of other sections showing the area that diminishes the reactor performance this information along with the local delivered fluence facilitates the identification of areas of low performance in the reactor such areas can then be minimized by implementing changes in the reactor design for example if the low fluence in one area results from short residence time i e high velocity the flow pattern in the reactor can be modified by applying flow modifiers similarly if the low fluence results from a low fluence rate the uv leds can be rearranged to generate a better radiant power distribution 3 2 the effect of radiation magnitude and distribution unlike the power of uv lamps that of uv leds can be easily adjusted this capability of uv leds enables the tailoring of their outputs to the target microorganism which results in operational flexibility and energy saving another element of the uv led system s operational flexibility relates to its fast start up capability because uv leds have no warm up time they can be turned on and off instantly consequently the number of operating uv leds in the system can be managed based on the flow rate in this section the ability of the simulation method to capture the behavior of the reactor under different outputs and configurations of uv leds is presented to investigate the effect of radiant power on performance the forward current of uv leds was halved at the flow rate of 90 ml min which resulted in a 48 reduction in the uv leds outputs although the outputs became approximately halved the overall log10 removal decreased by 67 fig 8 the analysis of performance in terms of delivered fluence showed that when the output decreased by 48 the ref decreased by 43 for an ideal reactor e g a plug flow reactor the reduction in uv power output linearly reduces the delivered fluence to the microorganisms bolton 2000 however in practice since uv reactors are non ideal microorganisms receive a variety of uv fluences resulting in a very complex behavior between the lamp power and ref the relationship between ref and lamp power becomes more complex during the treatment of microorganisms with shoulder effect because the reactor performance is influenced by two different kinetic rate constants in a separate set of experiments the effect of uv led arrangement on the reactor performance was studied this experiment investigated the contribution of led1 and led4 to the overall inactivation at the flow rate of 90 ml min and investigated whether the model is capable of predicting such a contribution the experiments showed that 1 7 log10 ref 4 5 m j c m 2 could be achieved by the two leds and this was closely predicted by the model which was 1 6 log10 ref 4 4 m j c m 2 the close agreement between the simulation and experiments showed the potential of this technique for assessing each element of the reactor the circuit of uv leds can be designed in such a way to turn the uv leds on and off independently in order to meet the target ref in different flow rates 3 3 the effect of hydrodynamics the simulation results of reactor 1 revealed that the central area d2 in fig 7 d inside the reactor diminished the overall reactor performance a diffuser was placed to divert the water from the central area to modify the flow and prevent the high velocity flow jet at the reactor center according to the simulation predictions reactor 2 could disinfect e coli at the flow rate of 250 ml min beyond the detection limit therefore ms2 as a more uv resistant organism was chosen for the experimental studies as a result of the flow modification reactor 2 could achieve 1 35 and 0 79 log10 of ms2 inactivation fig 9 or 25 m j c m 2 and 11 5 m j c m 2 in terms of ref at 250 ml min and 600 ml min respectively given that reactor 2 outperformed reactor 1 under the same operating conditions the overall improvement can be attributed solely to hydrodynamic effects the velocity contours on the longitudinal cross section of reactor 2 fig 10 a show that the flow is diverted from the central part after hitting the diffuser and that water moves toward the reactor s wall and then recombines somewhere near the outlet as a result of the flow distribution microorganisms pass near uv led and are exposed to the highest uv fluence rate inside the reactor fig 10 b both reactor 1 and reactor 2 deliver the same amount of uv fluence to the water in reactor 1 microorganisms that stay inside the reactor for a long time receive high uv fluence whereas those pass through the central part accumulate low fluences since the overall performance is primarily determined by low fluence streams reactor 1 performs poorly in reactor 2 the diffuser mixes the water and reduces the variance of uv dose among microorganism this leads to a tighter accumulated fluence distribution and consequently higher performance bolton 2000 lawryshyn and hofmann 2015 wols et al 2011 wright and lawryshyn 2000 fig 10 c shows the normalized concentration distribution on the longitudinal cross section of reactor 2 there is a significant difference between the concentration of ms2 before and after the diffuser fig 10 c due to the water recirculation before the diffuser the ms2 concentration decreases considerably and in contrast to the case of reactor 1 there is not a highly concentrated area around the axis of reactor 2 after the diffuser however the water is disinfected gradually with higher inactivation in an area close to the uv leds as the figure shows the concentration distribution is not uniform despite the diffuser spreads microorganisms across the lateral cross section because fluence rate attenuates along the principal direction of uv leds microorganisms that pass under the diffuser and are far from uv leds experience lower rates of inactivation compared to those pass near uv leds fig 10 c therefore concentration distributions over the lateral cross sections are not uniform as explained above the local performance of a uv reactor equates with local fluence in this study a computational cell that receives low fluence is called a dark cell and a series of dark cells is called a dark channel a dark channel forms either when the fluid residence time is very short or the local fluence rate is negligible not every dark channel has the same negative impact on the performance of a uv reactor the one that bridges the inlet and outlet drastically reduces overall disinfection efficiency because this channel bypasses a large number of microorganisms in our case study reactor 1 has high local fluence everywhere except the central part d2 in fig 7 where the water has high velocity the diffuser impedes the formation of the channel by diverting the water consequently the dark blue region around the central part of reactor 1 fig 7 d disappears in reactor 2 fig 10 d however the local fluence is not quite uniformly distributed across reactor 2 for example the delivered fluences are greater near uv leds high fluence rate and the back of the diffuser high residence time than in the rest of the reactor although some dark areas of reactor 1 were eliminated in reactor 2 due to the diffuser the dark regions that form as a result of the low radiant energy remain in the reactor fig 10 b2 uv rays bend toward the normal axis of the uv led due to refraction and are attenuated because of reflection at the air quartz water interfaces and the absorption thus the radiation profile of the uv led appeared similar to a cone fig 10 b2 only a very small portion of radiation energy reaches beyond its radiation cone consequently some areas in the reactor receive low radiation and perform poorly the dark areas between uv leds fig 10 b do not contribute significantly to the reactor performance however microorganisms that pass through those areas have a chance of being exposed to uv along their trajectories in contrast the dark areas that form on the lateral cross sections continue in the path of water from the inlet all the way to the outlet causing a notable reduction of the overall performance it should be noted that because the body of the reactor is not reflective and most of the radiation energy is lost at the reactor s internal surfaces the reflection has a negligible impact on the received energy particularly in the region between uv leds fig 10 b iso volume is the volume of all the mesh elements in the domain that falls within a specified range of a variable value fig 11 a shows the regions iso volume with the normalized concentration of 0 1 1 across reactor 2 at 250 ml min there is a strong correlation between the position of dark regions on the lateral cross sections and the highly concentrated stream of microorganisms pink color in fig 11 b such correlation indicates the importance of the concentration profile in recognizing the worst dark channels in the uv reactor which is essential information for reactor modification 3 4 reactor efficiency as noted above reactor 2 significantly outperformed reactor 1 despite similar geometry volume the same radiant profile and power of uv leds the better performance of reactor 2 can be attributed to the improved hydrodynamics as explained in the introduction the performance of a uv led reactor can be increased by enhancing the hydrodynamics and or radiation profiles of the reactor for example if the current radiation profile of reactor 1 or reactor 2 remains unchanged the maximum fluence is obtained if the water is completely mixed within the reactor bolton 2000 elyasi and taghipour 2006 pan and orava 2007 here this type of maximum fluence that results from hydrodynamic enhancement is shown by f max h if the arrangement of uv leds in the reactors changes in such a way that uv rays of leds are collimated along the reactor length similar to fig 1 the maximum fluence increases further the maximum fluence that results from radiation improvement along with the completely mixed flow assumption is shown by f m a x r finally if the radiant energy is fully preserved within the reactors and the reactor behaves similarly to a cstr or pfr the ultimate fluence is obtained f u the efficiency of a uv reactor design can be determined by dividing ref by the maximum fluence equation 12 depending on the type of maximum fluence the design efficiency carries a different meaning 12 η x r e f f m a x x x h r u table 1 presents ref f m a x h f m a x r and f u of reactor 1 and reactor 2 at the two flow rates of 250 ml min and 600 ml min the ref which represents the average of experimentally delivered fluence to the water was back calculated using a 254 nm fluence response curve of ms2 ref can be obtained based on experimental or simulation results because ms2 inactivation by reactor 1 fell below the detection limit the corresponding simulation result was used for the calculation of ref the f m a x h was calculated when e 0 was 0 44 m w c m 2 and the hrts for the flow rates of 250 ml min and 600 ml min were 82 7 s and 34 4 s respectively the f m a x r was calculated according to equation 2 by considering 43 3 mw total germicidal power the decadic absorption coefficient of 8 77 10 3 c m 1 and l of 17 cm finally the f u was calculated using equation 3 table 1 shows that the ref of reactor 2 24 9 m j c m 2 was significantly higher than that of reactor 1 2 6 m j c m 2 indicating the impact of the diffuser on the enhancement of the hydrodynamics as a result of the hydrodynamic alteration the η h increased from 7 in reactor 1 to 68 in reactor 2 when the flow rate increased the η h or mixing efficiency reached 76 overall when the flow rate increases in a reactor the variance of the uv fluence distribution necessarily reduces lawryshyn and hofmann 2015 wols et al 2011 further better mixing in general could result in different elements of fluid being exposed to both high and low areas of fluence rates within a reactor these factors lead to a narrower accumulated fluence distribution and consequently a higher performance the quantity of η h indicates that the hydrodynamics can still be improved to achieve greater performance as seen f m a x r at the flow rate of 250 ml min is close to 150 m j c m 2 which is approximately 3 7 times greater than the corresponding f m a x h the large difference implies that a considerable amount of uv energy is dissipated to the walls which can be avoided by rearranging the uv leds although f m a x r is higher than f m a x h it is still less than f u comparing f m a x r with f u shows that 30 of ultimate performance can be obtained from this reactor if all the radiant power is collimated and the fluid is fully mixed based on this finding to cultivate more radiant energy for the inactivation if the rays are collimated along the axis of the reactor the length of the reactor can be increased or the radiant energy can be retained using reflective material 3 5 radiant power calculation a crucial aspect of the implementation of a uv system is its energy consumption one of the main applications of equation 3 is the calculation of the input power p i n p u t to deliver a targeted fluence as explained above the germicidal power of a radiation source is the product of its radiant power and germicidal factor g f so the radiant power can be calculated by knowing the uv source s germicidal factor in addition the wall plug efficiency wpe of the uv source should be considered because a portion of input power converts to radiant energy and the rest is lost mainly as heat taking all the factors into consideration the following equation describes the amount of input power needed to obtain a desired fluence in an ideal uv reactor 13 1 p i n p u t i d e a l 1 f u g f w p e ln 10 q α substituting equation 12 in equation 13 yields the input power needed to deliver a targeted fluence f t in any real uv reactor equation 13 14 p i n p u t r e a l f t η u ln 10 α q g f w p e the innate differences between uv sources are their germicidal factors and wpes the difference between uv reactors however relates to their design factor i e η as inferred from equation 14 a decent uv source has higher wpe and g f and enables the achievement of a greater design efficiency i e η u this study s approach of applying the eulerian simulation for identifying poorly performing areas and their elimination can be applied to any uv led system in order to enhance the design efficiency of the reactor further the profile of concentration in the reactor can be utilized to track and evaluate the pathways resulting in the delivery of low fluence to the fluid and the reactor outlet innovative design concepts along with the help of a reactor modeling tool for design optimization promise greater design efficiencies of next generation uv reactors 4 conclusion this study proposed an approach to modeling uv led reactors in the eulerian framework the germicidal factors of uv leds were calculated and used to homogenize the germicidal radiant power outputs of uv leds this practical approach reduced the complexity of the simulation and eliminated the necessity of developing kinetic data for each uv led based on its wavelength distribution the close predictions of experimental results showed the ability of the proposed modeling approach for uv led reactor simulation moreover the study explained and discussed the performance of uv led reactors and methods for design modifications it was shown that the fluence at each computational cell determines the local performance within a uv led reactor the low fluence paths particularly those that extend from the reactor s inlet to its outlet resulting in the carrying of a high concentration of microorganisms to the outlet drastically reduce the overall performance and have to be modified for enhanced performance although the local fluence is crucial information for identifying and eliminating the low performing regions inside the reactor simultaneous analysis of the local fluence and concentration profiles are necessary during the design modification process and reactor optimization generally the ref of a uv led reactor is always less than f u taking into account the non ideal hydrodynamics and radiation distribution as well as the radiant energy loss preserving the uv rays within the reactor and elegantly cultivating them for photoreaction are necessary to achieve higher performance making the internal surfaces of a uv led reactor uv reflective as well as completely mixing the water may result in high performance alternatively aligning the uv rays with the flow direction while matching the radiant power and velocity may be a suitable option as

18457,this paper deals with the removal of two last resort antibiotics namely imipenem and meropenem in aqueous solutions employing heterogeneous photocatalysis with tio2 under natural solar radiation at pilot plant scale it was found that tio2 photocatalysis is a very efficient technique for the degradation of both compounds in aqueous solutions albeit it s relatively low quantum efficiency at the experimental conditions employed in the present work compound parabolic collectors photoreactor the optimal tio2 concentration was about 50 mg l 1 experiments conducted in various aqueous matrices lead to the conclusion that the method can be applied to real aqueous matrices such as natural waters and wastewaters the comparison of tio2 photocatalysis and natural photolysis showed an important decrease of the accumulated energy required to achieve the complete removal of both antibiotics which in terms of normalized illumination time t30w represented a reduction of 50 min for imipenem and 60 min for meropenem graphical abstract image 1 keywords tio2 photocatalysis aqueous matrices carbapemen antibiotics imipenem meropenem 1 introduction antimicrobial resistance amr has been detected in all parts of the world and it is one of the most significant challenges to the global public health today davies and davies 2010 laxminarayan et al 2013 holmes et al 2016 o neill 2016 vikesland et al 2017 who 2019 eu 2019 cdc 2019 moreover the problem is increasing and is expected to have a severe impact on the public health in the near future indeed according to the world health organization who the increasing resistance to antimicrobials is the most significant global concern for the public health and who has highlighted the need for coordinated action to minimize the emergence and spread of amr who 2019 in recent years antimicrobial resistant bacteria are responsible for tens to hundreds of thousands of deaths in various parts of the world including europe eu 2019 and the usa cdc 2019 while if action is not taken it is estimated that several million additional lives will be lost each year prematurely because of amr o neill 2016 kostyanev et al 2019 moreover the costs associated with antibiotic resistant infections exceed several billion euros and dollars per year in europe and in the usa respectively vikesland et al 2017 eu 2019 cdc 2019 because of the relatively rapid spread of antibiotic resistance it has been expressed the fear that our globalized society is progressively entering a post antibiotic era and therefore measures should be taken to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance vikesland et al 2017 who 2019 eu 2019 cdc 2019 it should be noted that although the development of antibiotic resistance is an ancient natural evolution phenomenon d costa et al 2011 its development and spread is being accelerated by different human factors such as overuse and misuse of antimicrobial medicines in both human and veterinary medicine inadequate or non existent programs for infection prevention and control poor quality medication weak laboratory capacity inadequate surveillance and insufficient regulation of the use of antimicrobial drugs who 2019 eu 2019 cdc 2019 since antimicrobial resistant microorganisms have been found in people animals food and the environment who 2019 it has been widely understood that to combat the problem of amr requires the systems thinking approach of the so called one health perspective vikesland et al 2017 who 2019 eu 2019 cdc 2019 according to which the environment and in particular the aquatic environment plays a very crucial role in the evolution and spread of amr allen et al 2010 berendonk et al 2015 vikesland et al 2017 who 2019 eu 2019 cdc 2019 it has also been well established that sewage treatment plants stps are hot spots for the development and spread of amr as well as for the release of antibiotics to the aquatic environment michael et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013 yang et al 2017 manaia et al 2018 tran et al 2018 danner et al 2019 because conventional treatment methods applied to stps are not effective for the removal of micro pollutants including antimicrobials as well as antimicrobial resistant bacteria and genes at this point it should be emphasized that one of the objectives of the so called one health action plan of the european union against amr is to support the development of various advanced treatment technologies that enable the efficient and rapid degradation of antimicrobials in wastewater and the environment and thereby reduce the spread of amr eu 2019 antibiotic consumption has been recognized as one of the key drivers for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance indeed it has been well established that there is a clear association between antibiotics consumption and the development and spread of antibiotic resistance i e increased consumption of antibiotics results in increased antibiotic resistance levels bell et al 2014 ecdc efsa ema 2015 ecdc efsa ema 2017 chatterjee et al 2018 in the past few decades global antibiotic consumption as well as antibiotic consumption rate has been increased substantially van boeckel et al 2014 klein et al 2018 resistancemap 2019 moreover the development of novel antibiotic is rather slow and therefore antibiotics are becoming a so called endangered species butler et al 2017 however although antimicrobial consumption is an important driver for increasing antimicrobial resistance levels reduction of antimicrobial consumption will not be sufficient to effectively control the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance because the dominant contributing factor appears to be the spread of resistant strains and genes collignon et al 2018 therefore additional measures should be taken to reduce antimicrobial resistance levels including efficient water and wastewater treatment among others collignon et al 2018 eu 2019 as a result of the increased consumption and use of antibiotics their release into the aquatic environment has also been increased indeed in recent years antibiotics are considered as contaminants of emerging concern due to their continuous input and persistence in the aquatic environment since the 1980s several classes of antibiotics including both human and veterinary antibiotics have been identified in the aquatic environment at concentrations typically in the range from ng l 1 to μg l 1 hirsch et al 1999 kümmerer 2009 homem and santos 2011 carvalho and santos 2016 yang et al 2017 patel et al 2019 danner et al 2019 indeed antibiotics have been identified all over the world and in almost any existing aquatic ecosystem including lakes carvalho and santos 2016 sousa et al 2018 yang et al 2018 rivers carvalho and santos 2016 desbiolles et al 2018 sousa et al 2018 groundwater lapworth et al 2012 sui et al 2015 carvalho and santos 2016 yang et al 2017 sousa et al 2018 seawater alygizakis et al 2016 carvalho and santos 2016 desbiolles et al 2018 even drinking water yang et al 2017 however it has been found that the presence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment even at such relatively low concentrations is capable of inducing the evolution of antibiotic resistance andersson and hughes 2014 therefore advance treatment methods should be applied for the efficient removal of antibiotics from the effluents of stps and consequently from the aquatic environment eu 2019 among the various classes of antibiotics in recent years special emphasis has been given to carbapenem antibiotics papp wallace et al 2011 katzung 2018 carbapenems are synthetic β lactam antibiotics that contain the characteristic four membered 2 azetidinone ring fused with a five membered dihydropyrrole ring their mode of action against bacteria involves the inactivation of the terminal step of bacterial cell wall synthesis and they have a wider spectrum of activity against bacteria in comparison with the typical β lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins therefore they are considered one of the most reliable last resort antibiotics used for the treatment against serious infections caused by gram negative bacteria however the emergence and spread of resistance mechanisms to carbapenems pose a major threat for infection control and treatment worldwide indeed several carbapenem resistant bacteria and genes producing carbapemenases are increasingly being reported over the last two decades walsh et al 2005 cantón et al 2012 nordmann et al 2012 albiger et al 2015 grundmann et al 2017 logan and weinstein 2017 wilson and török 2018 kostyanev et al 2019 carbapemenases are hydrolyzing β lactam enzymes i e β lactamases that facilitate the rapid addition of a water molecule across the β lactam bond of the carbapemen antibiotics thus rendering carbapenems ineffective against cell wall synthesis of the bacteria bush and bradford 2019 it should be noted that the who was requested by the member states to develop a global priority pathogens list of antibiotic resistant bacteria to help in prioritizing the research and development of new and effective antibiotic treatments this list has been recently published establishing a catalogue of 12 families of bacteria that pose the greatest threat to human health who 2017 pseudomonas aeruginosa acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacteriaceae which are carbapenem resistant bacteria are classified as critical in this list i e with the highest priority for example according to the who resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae which is a common intestinal bacterium that can cause life threatening infections to last resort antibiotics such as carbapenems has spread to all regions of the world and in some countries carbapenem antibiotics do not work in more than half of people treated for k pneumoniae infections who 2019 of particular concern is the finding that in recent years the consumption of last resort antibiotics including carbapenems has been rapidly increasing across all country income groups van boeckel et al 2014 klein et al 2018 resistancemap 2019 in addition increased consumption of carbapenem antibiotics has been associated with the emergence and spread of carbapenem resistance wilson and török 2018 although recently some novel antibiotics are being developed including combinations of β lactam β lactamase inhibitors docquier and mangani 2018 and some other drug combinations tyers and wright 2019 as well as metallo β lactamase inhibitors wang et al 2018 it is absolutely essential to preserve the efficacy of existing antibacterial drugs such as carbapenems as much as possible nordmann et al 2012 carbapenem antibiotics are excreted via the kidney papp wallace et al 2011 katzung 2018 so that they finally reach stps end eventually end up in the aquatic environment indeed recently meropenem has been found in stps influents and effluents tran et al 2016a 2016b le et al 2018 and imipenem was found in hospital wastewater effluents szekeres et al 2017 while in another recent study the concentration of imipenem in a hospital wastewater effluent was predicted to be in the order of a few μg l 1 ory et al 2019 as it was mentioned above the prevention of these pharmaceuticals arriving surface water bodies is a key factor to control antibiotic resistance in recent years several advanced treatment methods have been successfully applied for the removal of various contaminants of emerging concern including antibiotics from aqueous matrices among these methods special emphasis has been given to various advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozone oxidation fenton and photo fenton oxidation heterogeneous photocatalysis and uvc h2o2 among others stefan 2018 aops are oxidative techniques based on the intermediacy of various reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals ho stefan 2018 heterogeneous tio2 photocatalysis is a mild oxidation technique which has been extensively studied in recent years for the elimination of various organic micro pollutants in the aqueous phase including pharmaceutical compounds and in particular antibiotics michael et al 2013 kanakaraju et al 2018 stefan 2018 patel et al 2019 in a previous study by our research group we investigated the photochemical degradation of two representative carbapenem antibiotics namely imipenem and meropenem under solar radiation in aqueous solutions cabrera reina et al 2018 the aim of the present work was the application of solar tio2 photocatalysis under natural solar radiation to remove imipenem and meropenem from water at low concentration and at pilot plant scale the influence of catalyst load as well as water matrix characteristics on treatment kinetics has been studied and the corresponding photonic efficiencies have been calculated finally normalized illumination times and energy requirements have been computed and compared with those of direct photolysis under natural solar radiation in the absence of tio2 to the best of our knowledge the photocatalytic degradation of the above carbapenem antibiotics has not been reported in the literature yet 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents

obtained from sigma aldrich heterogeneous photocatalytic experiments were carried out using slurry suspensions of aeroxide p25 tio2 specific surface area 35 65 m2 g 1 kindly supplied by evonik industries the assays used to study the effect of catalyst concentration were carried out in ultrapure water which was obtained from a millipore water purification system milli q afterwards the effect of water matrix was assessed using i ultrapure water upw initial ph 7 4 ii river water rw initial ph 8 5 and iii simulated wwtp effluent ww initial ph 7 7 river water was collected from the andarax river when flowing close to the location of padules almería spain the constituents of the simulated wwtp effluent each of them obtained from sigma aldrich are given in detail elsewhere sánchez pérez et al 2017 the main general characteristics of each aqueous matrix are given in table 1 the initial concentration was 1 575 μmol l 1 i e 500 0 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively so that these assays could be compared with existing photolysis experiments cabrera reina et al 2018 aqueous solutions were prepared daily just before the start of the decontamination assays to avoid deviations of the initial concentrations it should be highlighted that no organic solvents were used during the preparation of the aqueous solutions because the presence of organic solvents may quench the various photo generated chemical species li et al 2017 2 2 solar irradiation experiments heterogeneous photocatalytic experiments were carried out under natural solar radiation in a solar detoxification pilot plant located in ciesol solar energy research center almería spain based on compound parabolic collectors cpc as shown schematically in fig 2 and described in detail elsewhere cabrera reina et al 2018 briefly the cpc photoreactor consists of two twin glass tubes fitted onto the focus of two cpc mirrors and the whole system is fitted on a platform modules are facing south and tilted 37 local latitude to maximize annual energy collection the total illuminated surface of each photoreactor is 0 42 m2 while the total and the illuminated volume are v 7 l and v i 4 77 l respectively experiments were carried out in batch mode during which the aqueous solutions were recirculated through the photoreactors by means of a centrifugal pump the incident fluence rate in the uva region of the electromagnetic spectrum e o in w m 2 defined as the radiant power in the uva region incident from all directions onto a small sphere divided by the cross sectional area of that sphere braslavsky 2007 was monitored employing a delta ohm uv radiometer lp uva 02 av spectral response range from 327 nm to 384 nm also mounted on the platform and tilted at 37 it should be noted that the efficiency of a natural solar reactor depends on the solar radiant power absorbed by the reaction system and therefore on the incident solar radiant power consequently the direct comparison between experiments in terms of treatment time is appropriate only if these experiments are carried out in identical systems and simultaneously therefore as it was mentioned in our previous work cabrera reina et al 2018 experiments under natural solar radiation were carried out either in parallel or on successive days at about the same times consequently the average uva fluence rate of each experimental run did not differ significantly from one experiment to the other thus allowing their direct comparison in terms of treatment time in a typical experimental run tio2 was loaded in the recirculation tanks of the cpc system at the desired initial concentration and the resulting aqueous suspensions were recirculated in the dark for 15 min before uncovering the cpc system samples periodically taken from the photochemical reactor were centrifuged to remove suspended tio2 particles and then analyzed for residual carbapenems concentration control experiments were performed for evaluating antibiotics adsorption onto the catalyst surface under the same initial conditions used in the photocatalytic experiments the results showed approximately a 10 adsorption for all the evaluated catalyst concentrations i e 10 20 50 and 100 mg l 1 for each experimental run the flow of incident radiation on the photochemical reactor in the wavelength range from 300 to 400 nm i 0 λ in mol l 1 min 1 or einstein l 1 min 1 was calculated according to the following equation 1 i 0 λ e n p o 0 s v where e n p o 0 is the incident photon fluence rate on a

calculate the accumulated energy per volume needed to reach a particular degradation level q uv in j l 1 according to the following equation 2 q uv n q uv n 1 e o aver n s v δt δt t n t n 1 where q uv

carbapenems degradation profiles were carried out in an hplc system equipped with a zorbax eclipse xdb c18 analytical column 1 8 μm 4 6 50 mm agilent and coupled with a uv detector series 1200 agilent technologies further details about the analytical method can be found elsewhere cabrera reina et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 tio2 assisted photocatalytic degradation under solar irradiation the heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of imipenem and meropenem was studied in aqueous solutions in upw under natural solar radiation in the presence of tio2 aeroxide p25 experiments were conducted in the cpc system in the presence of 10 mg l 1 tio2 at inherent solution ph in the presence of 10 mg l 1 tio2 inherent solution ph was approximately 6 6 while the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 575 μmol l 1 i e 500 0 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 respectively as can be seen in fig 3 the degradation of both compounds upon solar irradiation in the presence of tio2 proceeded relatively fast for example the removal of imipenem was approximately 75 after 60 min solar irradiation in the presence of tio2 while the degradation of meropenem was slightly faster and about the same percentage of decay i e 75 was achieved after 45 min irradiation moreover the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural solar radiation in the presence of tio2 was much faster than in the corresponding direct photolysis experiments for comparison reasons the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural solar radiation is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials as it was published in our previous work cabrera reina et al 2018 additional experiments were carried out to assess the degree of mineralization as described in detail in section s1 in the supplementary materials it was found that after prolonged irradiation the degree of mineralization was rather low thus indicating that some rather stable transformation products were formed τhere are two mechanisms which contribute simultaneously to the photochemical degradation of both compounds namely i direct photolysis under solar radiation as described in detail in our previous work cabrera reina et al 2018 and ii photocatalytic degradation which takes place through various intermediate reactive chemical species generated upon illumination of tio2 in aqueous suspensions the detailed mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants upon irradiation of aqueous tio2 suspensions has been discussed extensively in the scientific literature stefan 2018 schneider et al 2014 hoffman et al 1995 very briefly upon illumination of aqueous tio2 suspensions with irradiation energy equal to or greater than the band gap energy of the semiconductor valence band holes and conduction band electrons are generated these photogenerated chemical species can either recombine to liberate heat or make their separate ways to the surface of tio2 where they can react with species adsorbed onto the catalyst surface thus leading to various reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals stefan 2018 schneider et al 2014 hoffman et al 1995 these reactive oxygen species as well as the photogenerated valence band holes can oxidize most of the organic pollutants commonly found in water and wastewaters including pharmaceutical compounds kanakaraju et al 2018 patel et al 2019 overall these two mechanisms i e direct photolysis under solar radiation and photocatalytic degradation in the presence of tio2 contribute to accelerating the photochemical degradation of both carbapenem antibiotics significantly 3 2 effect of tio2 concentration the concentration of tio2 in slurry photocatalytic processes is an important factor that can influence the degradation of the organic pollutants strongly herrmann 2010 indeed several studies have indicated that the rate of the heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of various organic pollutants in aqueous solutions initially increases with increasing catalyst loading and then usually reaches a plateau at higher catalyst concentration or even decreases at excessive catalyst loadings because of radiation scattering and screening effects kisch and bahnemann 2015 herrmann 2010 therefore due to its significance the effect of tio2 loading on the photocatalytic degradation of imipenem and meropenem was investigated in aqueous solutions in upw under natural solar radiation in the presence of various concentrations of tio2 experiments were conducted in the cpc system by varying tio2 loading in the range from 10 to 100 mg l 1 at inherent solution ph in the presence of higher concentrations of tio2 such as 50 and 100 mg l 1 inherent solution ph was approximately 5 5 the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 575 μmol l 1 i e 500 0 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 respectively and the results are also shown in fig 3 moreover for each experimental run the pseudo first order rate constants of the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds were calculated and then the initial reaction rates r 0 in mol l 1 min 1 have been computed by multiplying the pseudo first order rate constants with the initial concentration of each compound the results are shown in table 2 while fig 4 shows the plot of the initial reaction rate of each compound as a function of catalyst concentration as can be seen the initial reaction rates of the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds increased with increasing catalyst concentration up to approximately 50 mg l 1 after which r 0 remained practically constant the increase in photocatalytic reaction rate with increasing catalyst loading indicates a heterogeneous catalytic regime since the fraction of incident radiation absorbed by the semiconductor progressively increases in suspensions containing higher amounts of tio2 herrmann 2010 however the initial reaction rates of the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds reached a plateau at about 50 mg l 1 tio2 loading the catalyst concentration above which reaction rate levels off depends on several factors such as reactor geometry substrate concentration wavelength and intensity of radiation source and corresponds to the point where all catalyst particles i e all the surface exposed are fully illuminated herrmann 2010 at higher concentrations a screening effect of excess particles occurs thus masking part of the photosensitive surface and consequently hindering radiation penetration and as a result the initial reaction rate reaches a plateau as can be seen in fig 4 in this study the optimal initial reaction rate was 78 0 and 6 53 nmol l 1 min 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively while the optimal tio2 concentration at which subsequent photocatalytic experiments were conducted was about 50 mg l 1 at this point it should be emphasized that the optimal initial reaction rate and the optimal tio2 concentration depend on the absorbed radiation intensity and the geometry of the photocatalytic reactor kisch and bahnemann 2015 moreover the optimum photocatalyst loading is also determined by the concentration of the target pollutants in the aqueous matrix indeed treatment of industrial wastewater where the concentrations of the target pollutants are in the order of mg l 1 usually several hundreds of mg l 1 of the photocatalyst are required on the other hand the removal of contaminants of emerging concern which are present in the aqueous matrix at the sub mg l 1 level can be achieved with substantially lower tio2 concentrations prieto rodriguez et al 2012 consequently very different concentrations of tio2 have been reported as optimum values for example kaneco et al 2009 studied the removal of thiram at an initial concentration of 5 mg l 1 in a pyrex reaction vessel 100 ml finding the best degradation rates when using 8 mg l 1 of tio2 while minero et al 1996 recommended 200 mg l 1 of tio2 for treating pentachlorophenol in a helioman reactor therefore the optimal photocatalyst concentration has to be determined in each particular case as far as the energy requirements are concerned the use of heterogeneous photocatalysis decreased the solar energy required to bring about the degradation of both compounds with respect to natural photolysis more specifically the quv needed to achieve over 80 removal of imipenem and meropenem using 50 mg l 1 of tio2 was approximately 2 2 kj l 1 while this value increased to approximately 8 7 kj l 1 when the experiment was carried out under natural solar radiation in the absence of tio2 in terms of the normalized illumination time t30w imipenem and meropenem can be removed after 46 min and 49 min respectively when using heterogeneous photocatalysis while these values increased to 98 min and 105 min respectively under natural solar radiation in the absence of tio2 thus the energies and treatment times needed to degrade both antibiotics in aqueous solutions were substantially decreased in the presence of tio2 under natural solar radiation 3 3 apparent quantum yield or photonic efficiency as have been discussed in detail in the literature kisch and bahnemann 2015 measuring the quantum yield of a photocatalytic process requires measuring the intensity of the radiation absorbed by the photocatalyst unfortunately this measurement is difficult for a heterogeneous system since it should be taken into account not only the absorption of radiation by the photocatalyst but also scattering and reflection of radiation by the suspended particles of the photocatalyst kisch and bahnemann 2015 therefore to overcome this problem several approaches have been proposed including measuring the so called apparent quantum yield or photonic efficiency ζ p λ dimensionless or mol einstein 1 of the photocatalytic process according to the following equation kisch and bahnemann 2015 4 ζ p λ r 0 i 0 λ where r 0 is the initial rate of the photocatalytic reaction in mol l 1 min 1 and i 0 λ is the flow of incident radiation on the photochemical reactor in the wavelength range from 300 to 400 nm in mol l 1 min 1 or einstein l 1 min 1 it should be noted that comparing photonic efficiencies is only possible if radiation absorption is the same in each experimental run and this is rather unlikely to occur in different photochemical reactors kisch and bahnemann 2015 however if the experiments are carried out in the same photochemical reactor and at catalyst concentrations which do not differ significantly between them it is likely that radiation absorption is the same for all experimental runs in the present work the above assumption was considered to be valid since the experiments were carried out in the same photochemical reactor at various catalyst concentrations which did not differ substantially between them in addition it should be emphasized once more that at the experiments conducted at different tio2 concentrations the average uva irradiance of each experimental run did not differ significantly from one experiment to the other based on the above the photonic efficiencies of the photocatalytic degradation of imipenem and meropenem were calculated and the results are given in fig 4 and table 2 as expected the photonic efficiencies of the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds follow the same trend as the initial reaction rate the photonic efficiency at the optimal tio2 concentration i e 50 mg l 1 tio2 was 8 7 10 5 and 7 3 10 6 mol e 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively these values are very low mainly for two reasons i as mentioned above in the calculation of the photonic efficiencies we didn t take into account losses of radiation due to reflection and scattering of incident radiation which has been reported to range from 13 to 76 of the total incident photon flux kisch and bahnemann 2015 and ii it is well known in the literature that the main process which takes place after the photochemical generation of valence band holes and conduction band electrons is their recombination to liberate heat either in the bulk or on the surface of the photocatalyst schneider et al 2014 hoffman et al 1995 thus reducing the apparent quantum yield of the process substantially 3 4 effect of the water matrix in a final set of photocatalysis experiments the effect of the water matrix was studied therefore additional photocatalysis experiments were carried out in two aqueous matrices namely in river water rw and in simulated mwwtp effluent ww and the results were compared with those obtained in upw experiments were conducted in the cpc system at an initial concentration of 1 260 μmol l 1 i e 400 0 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively and at 50 mg l 1 tio2 loading this concentration was selected based on the above mentioned results of the tio2 load experimental series the results are shown in fig 5 while the initial reaction rates and the corresponding photonic efficiencies for both compounds are given in table 2 as can be seen the initial reaction rates and the corresponding photonic efficiencies were slightly decreased when the experiments were carried out in ww and rw this reduction in the photocatalytic activity was obviously due to the consumption of the various photogenerated reactive chemical species formed upon irradiation of the aqueous tio2 suspensions by the various organic and inorganic components of the aqueous matrices more specifically for imipenem the initial reaction rate decreased from 78 0 to 83 0 nmol l 1 min 1 which were the values obtained in ultrapure water with 50 and 100 mg l 1 of tio2 respectively to 47 8 and 43 1 nmol l 1 min 1 which were the values obtained in river water and simulated wwtp effluent respectively in addition for meropenem the initial reaction rate decreased from 6 53 to 6 75 nmol l 1 min 1 to 4 90 and 4 95 nmol l 1 min 1 respectively for both compounds the results obtained in rw as well as in simulated wwtp effluent using 50 mg l 1 of tio2 were similar to those obtained in upw using 20 mg l 1 of tio2 from the above results it can be concluded that the reduction in the photocatalytic efficiency for the experiments carried out in rw and simulated wwtp effluent was rather small to insignificant which means that photocatalysis can be applied to real aqueous matrices such as natural waters and wastewaters without any significant reduction in the photocatalytic activity as occurred in ultrapure water in terms of the energy requirements heterogeneous photocatalysis improved treatment efficiency with respect to natural photolysis more specifically for the photocatalytic degradation of imipenem in the presence of 50 mg l 1 tio2 in simulated wwtp effluent and rw the quv needed to achieve over 80 reduction was approximately 3 3 kj l 1 while for meropenem the quv needed to achieve over 70 reduction was approximately 2 2 kj l 1 4 conclusions and added value the conclusions drawn for the present study can be summarized as follows heterogeneous tio2 photocatalysis is a very efficient technique for the degradation of imipenem and meropenem antibiotics in aqueous solutions under natural solar radiation the degradation of both compounds in aqueous solutions upon solar irradiation in the presence of tio2 proceeded much faster than during photolysis and the energy requirements were decreased approximately by half at the experimental conditions employed in the present work the optimum tio2 concentration for the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds upon illumination with solar radiation in aqueous solutions in ultrapure water was 50 mg l 1 the photonic efficiencies of the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds in aqueous solutions under solar radiation and at the optimal tio2 concentration were in the order of 10 5 to 10 6 mol e 1 these rather low values can be attributed to losses of radiation due to reflection and scattering of incident radiation as well as due to the recombination of the photo generated valence band holes and conduction band electrons of tio2 the initial reaction rates and the corresponding photonic efficiencies were decreased when the experiments were carried out in simulated wwtp effluent and river water this reduction in the photocatalytic activity was obviously due to the consumption of the various photogenerated reactive chemical species formed upon irradiation of the aqueous tio2 suspensions by the various organic and inorganic components of the aqueous matrices the results obtained both in river water and simulated wwtp effluent using 50 mg l 1 of tio2 were similar to those obtained with 20 mg l 1 of tio2 in ultrapure water moreover the added value and the originality of our work can be summarized as follows the fate of the carbapenem antibiotics in the environment is critical indeed carbapenems are of particular interest since they belong to the group of last resort antibiotics therefore it is essential to gather information about possible treatment methods aiming at their elimination from aqueous matrices to the best of our knowledge the photocatalytic degradation of the target carbapenem antibiotics has not been reported in the literature yet the experiments were carried out under natural radiation but also at a pilot plant scale while the photoreactor used is available in just a few research groups the operation conditions employed are close to actual situations while the selected initial concentrations of both compounds are

18457,this paper deals with the removal of two last resort antibiotics namely imipenem and meropenem in aqueous solutions employing heterogeneous photocatalysis with tio2 under natural solar radiation at pilot plant scale it was found that tio2 photocatalysis is a very efficient technique for the degradation of both compounds in aqueous solutions albeit it s relatively low quantum efficiency at the experimental conditions employed in the present work compound parabolic collectors photoreactor the optimal tio2 concentration was about 50 mg l 1 experiments conducted in various aqueous matrices lead to the conclusion that the method can be applied to real aqueous matrices such as natural waters and wastewaters the comparison of tio2 photocatalysis and natural photolysis showed an important decrease of the accumulated energy required to achieve the complete removal of both antibiotics which in terms of normalized illumination time t30w represented a reduction of 50 min for imipenem and 60 min for meropenem graphical abstract image 1 keywords tio2 photocatalysis aqueous matrices carbapemen antibiotics imipenem meropenem 1 introduction antimicrobial resistance amr has been detected in all parts of the world and it is one of the most significant challenges to the global public health today davies and davies 2010 laxminarayan et al 2013 holmes et al 2016 o neill 2016 vikesland et al 2017 who 2019 eu 2019 cdc 2019 moreover the problem is increasing and is expected to have a severe impact on the public health in the near future indeed according to the world health organization who the increasing resistance to antimicrobials is the most significant global concern for the public health and who has highlighted the need for coordinated action to minimize the emergence and spread of amr who 2019 in recent years antimicrobial resistant bacteria are responsible for tens to hundreds of thousands of deaths in various parts of the world including europe eu 2019 and the usa cdc 2019 while if action is not taken it is estimated that several million additional lives will be lost each year prematurely because of amr o neill 2016 kostyanev et al 2019 moreover the costs associated with antibiotic resistant infections exceed several billion euros and dollars per year in europe and in the usa respectively vikesland et al 2017 eu 2019 cdc 2019 because of the relatively rapid spread of antibiotic resistance it has been expressed the fear that our globalized society is progressively entering a post antibiotic era and therefore measures should be taken to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance vikesland et al 2017 who 2019 eu 2019 cdc 2019 it should be noted that although the development of antibiotic resistance is an ancient natural evolution phenomenon d costa et al 2011 its development and spread is being accelerated by different human factors such as overuse and misuse of antimicrobial medicines in both human and veterinary medicine inadequate or non existent programs for infection prevention and control poor quality medication weak laboratory capacity inadequate surveillance and insufficient regulation of the use of antimicrobial drugs who 2019 eu 2019 cdc 2019 since antimicrobial resistant microorganisms have been found in people animals food and the environment who 2019 it has been widely understood that to combat the problem of amr requires the systems thinking approach of the so called one health perspective vikesland et al 2017 who 2019 eu 2019 cdc 2019 according to which the environment and in particular the aquatic environment plays a very crucial role in the evolution and spread of amr allen et al 2010 berendonk et al 2015 vikesland et al 2017 who 2019 eu 2019 cdc 2019 it has also been well established that sewage treatment plants stps are hot spots for the development and spread of amr as well as for the release of antibiotics to the aquatic environment michael et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013 yang et al 2017 manaia et al 2018 tran et al 2018 danner et al 2019 because conventional treatment methods applied to stps are not effective for the removal of micro pollutants including antimicrobials as well as antimicrobial resistant bacteria and genes at this point it should be emphasized that one of the objectives of the so called one health action plan of the european union against amr is to support the development of various advanced treatment technologies that enable the efficient and rapid degradation of antimicrobials in wastewater and the environment and thereby reduce the spread of amr eu 2019 antibiotic consumption has been recognized as one of the key drivers for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance indeed it has been well established that there is a clear association between antibiotics consumption and the development and spread of antibiotic resistance i e increased consumption of antibiotics results in increased antibiotic resistance levels bell et al 2014 ecdc efsa ema 2015 ecdc efsa ema 2017 chatterjee et al 2018 in the past few decades global antibiotic consumption as well as antibiotic consumption rate has been increased substantially van boeckel et al 2014 klein et al 2018 resistancemap 2019 moreover the development of novel antibiotic is rather slow and therefore antibiotics are becoming a so called endangered species butler et al 2017 however although antimicrobial consumption is an important driver for increasing antimicrobial resistance levels reduction of antimicrobial consumption will not be sufficient to effectively control the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance because the dominant contributing factor appears to be the spread of resistant strains and genes collignon et al 2018 therefore additional measures should be taken to reduce antimicrobial resistance levels including efficient water and wastewater treatment among others collignon et al 2018 eu 2019 as a result of the increased consumption and use of antibiotics their release into the aquatic environment has also been increased indeed in recent years antibiotics are considered as contaminants of emerging concern due to their continuous input and persistence in the aquatic environment since the 1980s several classes of antibiotics including both human and veterinary antibiotics have been identified in the aquatic environment at concentrations typically in the range from ng l 1 to μg l 1 hirsch et al 1999 kümmerer 2009 homem and santos 2011 carvalho and santos 2016 yang et al 2017 patel et al 2019 danner et al 2019 indeed antibiotics have been identified all over the world and in almost any existing aquatic ecosystem including lakes carvalho and santos 2016 sousa et al 2018 yang et al 2018 rivers carvalho and santos 2016 desbiolles et al 2018 sousa et al 2018 groundwater lapworth et al 2012 sui et al 2015 carvalho and santos 2016 yang et al 2017 sousa et al 2018 seawater alygizakis et al 2016 carvalho and santos 2016 desbiolles et al 2018 even drinking water yang et al 2017 however it has been found that the presence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment even at such relatively low concentrations is capable of inducing the evolution of antibiotic resistance andersson and hughes 2014 therefore advance treatment methods should be applied for the efficient removal of antibiotics from the effluents of stps and consequently from the aquatic environment eu 2019 among the various classes of antibiotics in recent years special emphasis has been given to carbapenem antibiotics papp wallace et al 2011 katzung 2018 carbapenems are synthetic β lactam antibiotics that contain the characteristic four membered 2 azetidinone ring fused with a five membered dihydropyrrole ring their mode of action against bacteria involves the inactivation of the terminal step of bacterial cell wall synthesis and they have a wider spectrum of activity against bacteria in comparison with the typical β lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins therefore they are considered one of the most reliable last resort antibiotics used for the treatment against serious infections caused by gram negative bacteria however the emergence and spread of resistance mechanisms to carbapenems pose a major threat for infection control and treatment worldwide indeed several carbapenem resistant bacteria and genes producing carbapemenases are increasingly being reported over the last two decades walsh et al 2005 cantón et al 2012 nordmann et al 2012 albiger et al 2015 grundmann et al 2017 logan and weinstein 2017 wilson and török 2018 kostyanev et al 2019 carbapemenases are hydrolyzing β lactam enzymes i e β lactamases that facilitate the rapid addition of a water molecule across the β lactam bond of the carbapemen antibiotics thus rendering carbapenems ineffective against cell wall synthesis of the bacteria bush and bradford 2019 it should be noted that the who was requested by the member states to develop a global priority pathogens list of antibiotic resistant bacteria to help in prioritizing the research and development of new and effective antibiotic treatments this list has been recently published establishing a catalogue of 12 families of bacteria that pose the greatest threat to human health who 2017 pseudomonas aeruginosa acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacteriaceae which are carbapenem resistant bacteria are classified as critical in this list i e with the highest priority for example according to the who resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae which is a common intestinal bacterium that can cause life threatening infections to last resort antibiotics such as carbapenems has spread to all regions of the world and in some countries carbapenem antibiotics do not work in more than half of people treated for k pneumoniae infections who 2019 of particular concern is the finding that in recent years the consumption of last resort antibiotics including carbapenems has been rapidly increasing across all country income groups van boeckel et al 2014 klein et al 2018 resistancemap 2019 in addition increased consumption of carbapenem antibiotics has been associated with the emergence and spread of carbapenem resistance wilson and török 2018 although recently some novel antibiotics are being developed including combinations of β lactam β lactamase inhibitors docquier and mangani 2018 and some other drug combinations tyers and wright 2019 as well as metallo β lactamase inhibitors wang et al 2018 it is absolutely essential to preserve the efficacy of existing antibacterial drugs such as carbapenems as much as possible nordmann et al 2012 carbapenem antibiotics are excreted via the kidney papp wallace et al 2011 katzung 2018 so that they finally reach stps end eventually end up in the aquatic environment indeed recently meropenem has been found in stps influents and effluents tran et al 2016a 2016b le et al 2018 and imipenem was found in hospital wastewater effluents szekeres et al 2017 while in another recent study the concentration of imipenem in a hospital wastewater effluent was predicted to be in the order of a few μg l 1 ory et al 2019 as it was mentioned above the prevention of these pharmaceuticals arriving surface water bodies is a key factor to control antibiotic resistance in recent years several advanced treatment methods have been successfully applied for the removal of various contaminants of emerging concern including antibiotics from aqueous matrices among these methods special emphasis has been given to various advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozone oxidation fenton and photo fenton oxidation heterogeneous photocatalysis and uvc h2o2 among others stefan 2018 aops are oxidative techniques based on the intermediacy of various reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals ho stefan 2018 heterogeneous tio2 photocatalysis is a mild oxidation technique which has been extensively studied in recent years for the elimination of various organic micro pollutants in the aqueous phase including pharmaceutical compounds and in particular antibiotics michael et al 2013 kanakaraju et al 2018 stefan 2018 patel et al 2019 in a previous study by our research group we investigated the photochemical degradation of two representative carbapenem antibiotics namely imipenem and meropenem under solar radiation in aqueous solutions cabrera reina et al 2018 the aim of the present work was the application of solar tio2 photocatalysis under natural solar radiation to remove imipenem and meropenem from water at low concentration and at pilot plant scale the influence of catalyst load as well as water matrix characteristics on treatment kinetics has been studied and the corresponding photonic efficiencies have been calculated finally normalized illumination times and energy requirements have been computed and compared with those of direct photolysis under natural solar radiation in the absence of tio2 to the best of our knowledge the photocatalytic degradation of the above carbapenem antibiotics has not been reported in the literature yet 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents

obtained from sigma aldrich heterogeneous photocatalytic experiments were carried out using slurry suspensions of aeroxide p25 tio2 specific surface area 35 65 m2 g 1 kindly supplied by evonik industries the assays used to study the effect of catalyst concentration were carried out in ultrapure water which was obtained from a millipore water purification system milli q afterwards the effect of water matrix was assessed using i ultrapure water upw initial ph 7 4 ii river water rw initial ph 8 5 and iii simulated wwtp effluent ww initial ph 7 7 river water was collected from the andarax river when flowing close to the location of padules almería spain the constituents of the simulated wwtp effluent each of them obtained from sigma aldrich are given in detail elsewhere sánchez pérez et al 2017 the main general characteristics of each aqueous matrix are given in table 1 the initial concentration was 1 575 μmol l 1 i e 500 0 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively so that these assays could be compared with existing photolysis experiments cabrera reina et al 2018 aqueous solutions were prepared daily just before the start of the decontamination assays to avoid deviations of the initial concentrations it should be highlighted that no organic solvents were used during the preparation of the aqueous solutions because the presence of organic solvents may quench the various photo generated chemical species li et al 2017 2 2 solar irradiation experiments heterogeneous photocatalytic experiments were carried out under natural solar radiation in a solar detoxification pilot plant located in ciesol solar energy research center almería spain based on compound parabolic collectors cpc as shown schematically in fig 2 and described in detail elsewhere cabrera reina et al 2018 briefly the cpc photoreactor consists of two twin glass tubes fitted onto the focus of two cpc mirrors and the whole system is fitted on a platform modules are facing south and tilted 37 local latitude to maximize annual energy collection the total illuminated surface of each photoreactor is 0 42 m2 while the total and the illuminated volume are v 7 l and v i 4 77 l respectively experiments were carried out in batch mode during which the aqueous solutions were recirculated through the photoreactors by means of a centrifugal pump the incident fluence rate in the uva region of the electromagnetic spectrum e o in w m 2 defined as the radiant power in the uva region incident from all directions onto a small sphere divided by the cross sectional area of that sphere braslavsky 2007 was monitored employing a delta ohm uv radiometer lp uva 02 av spectral response range from 327 nm to 384 nm also mounted on the platform and tilted at 37 it should be noted that the efficiency of a natural solar reactor depends on the solar radiant power absorbed by the reaction system and therefore on the incident solar radiant power consequently the direct comparison between experiments in terms of treatment time is appropriate only if these experiments are carried out in identical systems and simultaneously therefore as it was mentioned in our previous work cabrera reina et al 2018 experiments under natural solar radiation were carried out either in parallel or on successive days at about the same times consequently the average uva fluence rate of each experimental run did not differ significantly from one experiment to the other thus allowing their direct comparison in terms of treatment time in a typical experimental run tio2 was loaded in the recirculation tanks of the cpc system at the desired initial concentration and the resulting aqueous suspensions were recirculated in the dark for 15 min before uncovering the cpc system samples periodically taken from the photochemical reactor were centrifuged to remove suspended tio2 particles and then analyzed for residual carbapenems concentration control experiments were performed for evaluating antibiotics adsorption onto the catalyst surface under the same initial conditions used in the photocatalytic experiments the results showed approximately a 10 adsorption for all the evaluated catalyst concentrations i e 10 20 50 and 100 mg l 1 for each experimental run the flow of incident radiation on the photochemical reactor in the wavelength range from 300 to 400 nm i 0 λ in mol l 1 min 1 or einstein l 1 min 1 was calculated according to the following equation 1 i 0 λ e n p o 0 s v where e n p o 0 is the incident photon fluence rate on a

calculate the accumulated energy per volume needed to reach a particular degradation level q uv in j l 1 according to the following equation 2 q uv n q uv n 1 e o aver n s v δt δt t n t n 1 where q uv

carbapenems degradation profiles were carried out in an hplc system equipped with a zorbax eclipse xdb c18 analytical column 1 8 μm 4 6 50 mm agilent and coupled with a uv detector series 1200 agilent technologies further details about the analytical method can be found elsewhere cabrera reina et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 tio2 assisted photocatalytic degradation under solar irradiation the heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of imipenem and meropenem was studied in aqueous solutions in upw under natural solar radiation in the presence of tio2 aeroxide p25 experiments were conducted in the cpc system in the presence of 10 mg l 1 tio2 at inherent solution ph in the presence of 10 mg l 1 tio2 inherent solution ph was approximately 6 6 while the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 575 μmol l 1 i e 500 0 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 respectively as can be seen in fig 3 the degradation of both compounds upon solar irradiation in the presence of tio2 proceeded relatively fast for example the removal of imipenem was approximately 75 after 60 min solar irradiation in the presence of tio2 while the degradation of meropenem was slightly faster and about the same percentage of decay i e 75 was achieved after 45 min irradiation moreover the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural solar radiation in the presence of tio2 was much faster than in the corresponding direct photolysis experiments for comparison reasons the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural solar radiation is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials as it was published in our previous work cabrera reina et al 2018 additional experiments were carried out to assess the degree of mineralization as described in detail in section s1 in the supplementary materials it was found that after prolonged irradiation the degree of mineralization was rather low thus indicating that some rather stable transformation products were formed τhere are two mechanisms which contribute simultaneously to the photochemical degradation of both compounds namely i direct photolysis under solar radiation as described in detail in our previous work cabrera reina et al 2018 and ii photocatalytic degradation which takes place through various intermediate reactive chemical species generated upon illumination of tio2 in aqueous suspensions the detailed mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants upon irradiation of aqueous tio2 suspensions has been discussed extensively in the scientific literature stefan 2018 schneider et al 2014 hoffman et al 1995 very briefly upon illumination of aqueous tio2 suspensions with irradiation energy equal to or greater than the band gap energy of the semiconductor valence band holes and conduction band electrons are generated these photogenerated chemical species can either recombine to liberate heat or make their separate ways to the surface of tio2 where they can react with species adsorbed onto the catalyst surface thus leading to various reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals stefan 2018 schneider et al 2014 hoffman et al 1995 these reactive oxygen species as well as the photogenerated valence band holes can oxidize most of the organic pollutants commonly found in water and wastewaters including pharmaceutical compounds kanakaraju et al 2018 patel et al 2019 overall these two mechanisms i e direct photolysis under solar radiation and photocatalytic degradation in the presence of tio2 contribute to accelerating the photochemical degradation of both carbapenem antibiotics significantly 3 2 effect of tio2 concentration the concentration of tio2 in slurry photocatalytic processes is an important factor that can influence the degradation of the organic pollutants strongly herrmann 2010 indeed several studies have indicated that the rate of the heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of various organic pollutants in aqueous solutions initially increases with increasing catalyst loading and then usually reaches a plateau at higher catalyst concentration or even decreases at excessive catalyst loadings because of radiation scattering and screening effects kisch and bahnemann 2015 herrmann 2010 therefore due to its significance the effect of tio2 loading on the photocatalytic degradation of imipenem and meropenem was investigated in aqueous solutions in upw under natural solar radiation in the presence of various concentrations of tio2 experiments were conducted in the cpc system by varying tio2 loading in the range from 10 to 100 mg l 1 at inherent solution ph in the presence of higher concentrations of tio2 such as 50 and 100 mg l 1 inherent solution ph was approximately 5 5 the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 575 μmol l 1 i e 500 0 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 respectively and the results are also shown in fig 3 moreover for each experimental run the pseudo first order rate constants of the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds were calculated and then the initial reaction rates r 0 in mol l 1 min 1 have been computed by multiplying the pseudo first order rate constants with the initial concentration of each compound the results are shown in table 2 while fig 4 shows the plot of the initial reaction rate of each compound as a function of catalyst concentration as can be seen the initial reaction rates of the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds increased with increasing catalyst concentration up to approximately 50 mg l 1 after which r 0 remained practically constant the increase in photocatalytic reaction rate with increasing catalyst loading indicates a heterogeneous catalytic regime since the fraction of incident radiation absorbed by the semiconductor progressively increases in suspensions containing higher amounts of tio2 herrmann 2010 however the initial reaction rates of the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds reached a plateau at about 50 mg l 1 tio2 loading the catalyst concentration above which reaction rate levels off depends on several factors such as reactor geometry substrate concentration wavelength and intensity of radiation source and corresponds to the point where all catalyst particles i e all the surface exposed are fully illuminated herrmann 2010 at higher concentrations a screening effect of excess particles occurs thus masking part of the photosensitive surface and consequently hindering radiation penetration and as a result the initial reaction rate reaches a plateau as can be seen in fig 4 in this study the optimal initial reaction rate was 78 0 and 6 53 nmol l 1 min 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively while the optimal tio2 concentration at which subsequent photocatalytic experiments were conducted was about 50 mg l 1 at this point it should be emphasized that the optimal initial reaction rate and the optimal tio2 concentration depend on the absorbed radiation intensity and the geometry of the photocatalytic reactor kisch and bahnemann 2015 moreover the optimum photocatalyst loading is also determined by the concentration of the target pollutants in the aqueous matrix indeed treatment of industrial wastewater where the concentrations of the target pollutants are in the order of mg l 1 usually several hundreds of mg l 1 of the photocatalyst are required on the other hand the removal of contaminants of emerging concern which are present in the aqueous matrix at the sub mg l 1 level can be achieved with substantially lower tio2 concentrations prieto rodriguez et al 2012 consequently very different concentrations of tio2 have been reported as optimum values for example kaneco et al 2009 studied the removal of thiram at an initial concentration of 5 mg l 1 in a pyrex reaction vessel 100 ml finding the best degradation rates when using 8 mg l 1 of tio2 while minero et al 1996 recommended 200 mg l 1 of tio2 for treating pentachlorophenol in a helioman reactor therefore the optimal photocatalyst concentration has to be determined in each particular case as far as the energy requirements are concerned the use of heterogeneous photocatalysis decreased the solar energy required to bring about the degradation of both compounds with respect to natural photolysis more specifically the quv needed to achieve over 80 removal of imipenem and meropenem using 50 mg l 1 of tio2 was approximately 2 2 kj l 1 while this value increased to approximately 8 7 kj l 1 when the experiment was carried out under natural solar radiation in the absence of tio2 in terms of the normalized illumination time t30w imipenem and meropenem can be removed after 46 min and 49 min respectively when using heterogeneous photocatalysis while these values increased to 98 min and 105 min respectively under natural solar radiation in the absence of tio2 thus the energies and treatment times needed to degrade both antibiotics in aqueous solutions were substantially decreased in the presence of tio2 under natural solar radiation 3 3 apparent quantum yield or photonic efficiency as have been discussed in detail in the literature kisch and bahnemann 2015 measuring the quantum yield of a photocatalytic process requires measuring the intensity of the radiation absorbed by the photocatalyst unfortunately this measurement is difficult for a heterogeneous system since it should be taken into account not only the absorption of radiation by the photocatalyst but also scattering and reflection of radiation by the suspended particles of the photocatalyst kisch and bahnemann 2015 therefore to overcome this problem several approaches have been proposed including measuring the so called apparent quantum yield or photonic efficiency ζ p λ dimensionless or mol einstein 1 of the photocatalytic process according to the following equation kisch and bahnemann 2015 4 ζ p λ r 0 i 0 λ where r 0 is the initial rate of the photocatalytic reaction in mol l 1 min 1 and i 0 λ is the flow of incident radiation on the photochemical reactor in the wavelength range from 300 to 400 nm in mol l 1 min 1 or einstein l 1 min 1 it should be noted that comparing photonic efficiencies is only possible if radiation absorption is the same in each experimental run and this is rather unlikely to occur in different photochemical reactors kisch and bahnemann 2015 however if the experiments are carried out in the same photochemical reactor and at catalyst concentrations which do not differ significantly between them it is likely that radiation absorption is the same for all experimental runs in the present work the above assumption was considered to be valid since the experiments were carried out in the same photochemical reactor at various catalyst concentrations which did not differ substantially between them in addition it should be emphasized once more that at the experiments conducted at different tio2 concentrations the average uva irradiance of each experimental run did not differ significantly from one experiment to the other based on the above the photonic efficiencies of the photocatalytic degradation of imipenem and meropenem were calculated and the results are given in fig 4 and table 2 as expected the photonic efficiencies of the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds follow the same trend as the initial reaction rate the photonic efficiency at the optimal tio2 concentration i e 50 mg l 1 tio2 was 8 7 10 5 and 7 3 10 6 mol e 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively these values are very low mainly for two reasons i as mentioned above in the calculation of the photonic efficiencies we didn t take into account losses of radiation due to reflection and scattering of incident radiation which has been reported to range from 13 to 76 of the total incident photon flux kisch and bahnemann 2015 and ii it is well known in the literature that the main process which takes place after the photochemical generation of valence band holes and conduction band electrons is their recombination to liberate heat either in the bulk or on the surface of the photocatalyst schneider et al 2014 hoffman et al 1995 thus reducing the apparent quantum yield of the process substantially 3 4 effect of the water matrix in a final set of photocatalysis experiments the effect of the water matrix was studied therefore additional photocatalysis experiments were carried out in two aqueous matrices namely in river water rw and in simulated mwwtp effluent ww and the results were compared with those obtained in upw experiments were conducted in the cpc system at an initial concentration of 1 260 μmol l 1 i e 400 0 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively and at 50 mg l 1 tio2 loading this concentration was selected based on the above mentioned results of the tio2 load experimental series the results are shown in fig 5 while the initial reaction rates and the corresponding photonic efficiencies for both compounds are given in table 2 as can be seen the initial reaction rates and the corresponding photonic efficiencies were slightly decreased when the experiments were carried out in ww and rw this reduction in the photocatalytic activity was obviously due to the consumption of the various photogenerated reactive chemical species formed upon irradiation of the aqueous tio2 suspensions by the various organic and inorganic components of the aqueous matrices more specifically for imipenem the initial reaction rate decreased from 78 0 to 83 0 nmol l 1 min 1 which were the values obtained in ultrapure water with 50 and 100 mg l 1 of tio2 respectively to 47 8 and 43 1 nmol l 1 min 1 which were the values obtained in river water and simulated wwtp effluent respectively in addition for meropenem the initial reaction rate decreased from 6 53 to 6 75 nmol l 1 min 1 to 4 90 and 4 95 nmol l 1 min 1 respectively for both compounds the results obtained in rw as well as in simulated wwtp effluent using 50 mg l 1 of tio2 were similar to those obtained in upw using 20 mg l 1 of tio2 from the above results it can be concluded that the reduction in the photocatalytic efficiency for the experiments carried out in rw and simulated wwtp effluent was rather small to insignificant which means that photocatalysis can be applied to real aqueous matrices such as natural waters and wastewaters without any significant reduction in the photocatalytic activity as occurred in ultrapure water in terms of the energy requirements heterogeneous photocatalysis improved treatment efficiency with respect to natural photolysis more specifically for the photocatalytic degradation of imipenem in the presence of 50 mg l 1 tio2 in simulated wwtp effluent and rw the quv needed to achieve over 80 reduction was approximately 3 3 kj l 1 while for meropenem the quv needed to achieve over 70 reduction was approximately 2 2 kj l 1 4 conclusions and added value the conclusions drawn for the present study can be summarized as follows heterogeneous tio2 photocatalysis is a very efficient technique for the degradation of imipenem and meropenem antibiotics in aqueous solutions under natural solar radiation the degradation of both compounds in aqueous solutions upon solar irradiation in the presence of tio2 proceeded much faster than during photolysis and the energy requirements were decreased approximately by half at the experimental conditions employed in the present work the optimum tio2 concentration for the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds upon illumination with solar radiation in aqueous solutions in ultrapure water was 50 mg l 1 the photonic efficiencies of the photocatalytic degradation of both compounds in aqueous solutions under solar radiation and at the optimal tio2 concentration were in the order of 10 5 to 10 6 mol e 1 these rather low values can be attributed to losses of radiation due to reflection and scattering of incident radiation as well as due to the recombination of the photo generated valence band holes and conduction band electrons of tio2 the initial reaction rates and the corresponding photonic efficiencies were decreased when the experiments were carried out in simulated wwtp effluent and river water this reduction in the photocatalytic activity was obviously due to the consumption of the various photogenerated reactive chemical species formed upon irradiation of the aqueous tio2 suspensions by the various organic and inorganic components of the aqueous matrices the results obtained both in river water and simulated wwtp effluent using 50 mg l 1 of tio2 were similar to those obtained with 20 mg l 1 of tio2 in ultrapure water moreover the added value and the originality of our work can be summarized as follows the fate of the carbapenem antibiotics in the environment is critical indeed carbapenems are of particular interest since they belong to the group of last resort antibiotics therefore it is essential to gather information about possible treatment methods aiming at their elimination from aqueous matrices to the best of our knowledge the photocatalytic degradation of the target carbapenem antibiotics has not been reported in the literature yet the experiments were carried out under natural radiation but also at a pilot plant scale while the photoreactor used is available in just a few research groups the operation conditions employed are close to actual situations while the selected initial concentrations of both compounds are

the effluent accounting for 72 10 of influent cod such high methane losses not only originated from increased methane solubility at low temperature but were also attributed to increased methanogenic activity in membrane biofilms smith et al 2015 given the strong negative correlation between operational temperature and effluent dissolved methane downstream treatment to mitigate methane release is especially critical at psychrophilic conditions methane driven mfcs reported to date have been operated at room temperature gao et al 2017 20 c chen and smith 2018 30 c mcanulty et al 2017 myung et al

substrates e g acetate have reported reduced power density at decreasing temperature which ranged from a relatively minor decrease of 8 33 when switching from 32 to 20 c liu et al 2005 to a significant decrease of 92 1 when switching from 35 to 4 c larrosa guerrero et al 2010 for instance cheng et al reported a linear power density reduction of 33 4 mw c in mfcs initially operated at 30

2011 jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 zhang et al 2014 at lower temperatures the leading hypothesis for higher ce is that greater organic matter is diverted to exoelectrogens at low temperatures as competing heterotrophic bacteria i e non exoelectrogens are severely suppressed by the temperature decrease jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 liu et al observed an increase in power density in a dual chamber mfc transitioned from 25 c to 15 c and suggested that lower anodic resistance at 25 c reduced power output liu et al 2013 several studies have also identified a negative correlation between temperature and startup time 30 h 144 h at 30 c min et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 60 h 504 h at 15 22 c cheng et al 2011 min et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 and no appreciable voltage over 80 days at 4 and 6 c cheng et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 however mfcs have been successfully transitioned to low temperature after initial startup at higher temperature cheng et al 2011 such phenomenon infer that exoelectrogens can sustain activity at low temperature if initially acclimated to elevated temperatures although our mechanistic understanding of extracellular electron transfer is still evolving transfer rates are likely affected by temperature dependent parameters such as cathode potential liu et al 2005 anode potential impedance due to anodic biofilm development zhang et al 2014 microbial community structure mei et al 2017 electrolyte conductivity del campo et al 2013 electrochemical reaction rates wang et al 2008 and others to date no study has investigated the impact of operational temperature on performance of methane driven mfcs we previously reported a microbial interaction between aerobic methanotroph methylomonas in a cathode biofilm and geobacter in an anode biofilm in methane driven air cathode mfcs at 20 c where formate and or acetate served as the electron shuttle between the two microbial populations chen and smith 2018 up to 85 dissolved methane removal was achieved resulting in the generation of 0 55 0 06 v though aerobic methanotrophs have been reported as active in various cold ecosystems trotsenko and khmelenina 2005 exoelectrogens such as geobacter sulfurreducens have optimal growth rate at mesophilic temperatures caccavo et al 1994 to evaluate methane driven mfc performance and microbial community adaptation to varying operational temperatures two replicate air cathode mfcs were sequentially operated at 25 20 15 10 and 5 c anode and cathode biofilm samples were obtained at the end of each operational temperature activity of methanotrophs

ecocloth contect inc spartanburg sc were applied to limit excess oxygen diffusion and potential short circuiting the mfcs were initially inoculated with primary clarifier effluent obtained from the hyperion wastewater treatment plant los angeles ca operated in batch mode with acetate as the sole electron donor and then transitioned to continuous mode operation at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h on a synthetic anaerobic effluent containing dissolved methane at 20 c chen and smith 2018 we previously evaluated hrts of 4 8 and 16 h but elected to operate both mfcs at 8 h here the mfcs were operated in a temperature controlled incubator drosophila incubator genesee scientific ca a synthetic anaerobic effluent si table 1 was temperature controlled by immersion in a water bath connected to a chiller lindberg blue m shaking water bath thermo fisher scientific waltham ma the synthetic anaerobic effluent was first purged vigorously with a gaseous blend of 80 methane and 20 carbon dioxide by volume for 15 min to remove dissolved oxygen and saturate the media with dissolved methane during operation the media was continuously sparged with the same gaseous blend of 80 methane and 20 carbon dioxide at 10 20 ml min to ensure anaerobic conditions were maintained both mfcs were initially operated at 20 c until reaching stable performance i e voltage production of 0 5 0

both mfcs voltage was measured across 1000 ω external resistance via data acquisition device di245 dataq akron oh dissolved methane concentrations were quantified by collecting influent and effluent samples in gas tight syringes and equilibrating dissolved gases into an equal volume nitrogen headspace by vigorously shaking for 1 min the gas phase of the syringe was then injected into a 10 ml

30m 0 53 mm x 20 μm and a flame ionization detector the instrument was operated at the following temperatures inlet at 250 c oven at 150 c and detector at 250 c one ml of sample was manually injected dissolved methane concentration was calculated as described previously chen and smith 2018 influent and effluent dissolved methane were monitored on a daily basis 2 2 sequencing and rt qpcr anode and cathode biofilm samples were collected at the end of each operational temperature specifically at least 1 mg anode cathode biomass sample was collected at each temperature except at 20 c anode biofilm biomass together with the carbon brush was cut from the anode while cathode biofilm biomass was scraped from the cathode separator cloth on the surface facing the anode dna and rna were extracted using pre baked 1 mm diameter zirconium beads with a bead beater mini beadbeater 24 biospec products bartlesville ok the maxwell lev 16 dna blood kit and simply rna blood kit promega madison wi were

were prepared as described previously chen and smith 2018 microbial community structure was evaluated via illumina miseq paired end sequencing targeting the v4 region of the 16s rrna genes library preparation and sequencing was done by the microbial systems molecular biology laboratory msmbl university of michigan ann arbor mi 2 3 bioinformatics mothur was used to process illumina miseq sequencing data to generate operational taxonomic units otus kozich et al 2013 after quality filtering alignment with silva reference database pruesse et al 2007 and chimera removal by the vsearch algorithm rognes et al 2016 an average of 54796 19408 sequence reads per sample were generated with minimum and maximum sequences of 22931 and 100106 next 22931 reads were randomly subsampled from each sample before conducting otu based clustering analysis using the 3 average neighbor cutoff resulting in 1990 distinct otus across all samples and an average of 340 31 otus per sample microbial community dissimilarity represented by thetayc yue and clayton 2005 was visualized via non metric multidimensional scaling nmds otus were binned into phylotypes based on their taxonomic classification kozich et al 2013 at the genus level resulting in 311 phylotypes across all samples to characterize microbial propensity for colonization on the anode or cathode the lefse tool was applied to the phylotype data where a linear discriminant analysis lda score 2 was deemed significant segata et al 2011 further spearman s rank correlation spearman 1904 was calculated between phylotypes 1 within the anode microbial community 2 within the cathode microbial community and 3 between the anode and cathode communities to evaluate interactions between populations in both biofilms microbial network analysis plots were generated based on spearman s rank correlation coefficients of probability 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 voltage production abruptly decreased at 10 c after both replicate mfcs demonstrated stable voltage production on the synthetic anaerobic effluent at 20 c operational temperature for both mfcs was increased to 25 c mfc a generated a higher voltage averaging 0 603 0 017 v relative to mfc b averaging 0 463 0 093 v fig 1a mfc a voltage decreased by 11 4 when operational temperature was decreased to 20 c 0 534 0 038 v and decreased further by 4 12 at 15 c 0 512 0 108 v mfc b exhibited higher variability in voltage production at 25 c but voltage production became more stable at 20 and 15 c resulting in an average voltage of 0 536 0 073 and 0 569 0 054 v respectively therefore mfc b voltage production increased by 15 8 when temperature was decreased from 25 to 20 c and by an additional 6 16 from 20 to 15 c variability in mfc b voltage production may have originated from instability in the microbial community and lower microbial diversity relative to other operational temperatures si table 3 notably both mfcs experienced an abrupt decrease in voltage at 10 c decreasing to 0 196 0 040 and 0 261 0 093 v for mfc a and b respectively as temperature was further decreased to 5 c voltage production continued to decrease to 0 156 0 039 v and 0 190 0 066 v for mfc a and b respectively overall voltage production decreased by 51 2 64 3 at 10 c and further decreased by 19 2 24 6 at 5 c when compared with 10 c although other studies have demonstrated increases in voltage production at lower operational temperatures cheng et al 2011 jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 zhang et al 2014 the methane driven mfcs investigated here were operated at significantly lower organic loading rates higher organic loading rates likely favor competition between exoelectrogens and heterotrophic bacteria resulting in higher voltage production at lower temperatures if heterotrophs are inhibited to a greater extent than exoelectrogens jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 the observed abrupt decrease in voltage production at 10 and 5 c in our study strongly suggests that exoelectrogenic activity was suppressed at such low temperatures at the highest voltage production 0 603 0 017 v power density was 60 6 mw m2 if normalized to cathode area 60 cm2 and is consistent with power density reported in our previous work chen and smith 2018 higher power densities have been reported in dual chamber mfcs 419 5 5 9 mw m2 via employing a gas diffusion electrode yu et al 2018 and as high as 4700 800 mw m2 when using a genetically engineered archaeal strain performing reverse methanogenesis yamasaki et al 2018 given that the mfcs operated here produced similar voltage to previous studies chen and smith 2018 mcanulty et al 2017 yamasaki et al 2018 yu et al 2018 cathode area is likely the design parameter restricting power density power density decreased to 6 40 and 11 4 mw m2 at 10 c in mfc a and b respectively ce also decreased significantly for mfc a and b as temperature decreased ce at 25 20 and 15 c averaged 6 90 0 94 and 6 19 1 45 for mfc a and b respectively whereas it significantly decreased at 10 and 5 c to an average of 2 10 0 70 and 2 75 1 27 for mfc a and b respectively ce at 25 20 and 15 c is similar to what we previously reported chen and smith 2018 higher ce 65 9 13 2 to 90 10 has been reported in other methane driven mfcs relying on interactions between geobacter and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme mcanulty et al 2017 or methanogenic archaea performing reverse methanogenesis yu et al 2018 the lower ce reported here is due to electrons being lost during conversion of methane to intermediate metabolites e g methanol and formate by aerobic methanotrophs and scavenging of metabolites by heterotrophs chen and smith 2018 hanson and hanson 1996 myung et al 2018 3 2 dissolved methane removal efficiency was relatively stable across operational temperature as operational temperature decreased influent dissolved methane increased from 14 5 0 8 mg l to 21 7 0 9 mg l fig 1 b due to increased methane solubility relative to theoretical dissolved methane concentrations derived from henry s law measured influent concentrations were 19 0 4 1 lower on average possibly due to inefficiencies in sample collection across all operational temperatures dissolved methane removal efficiencies were fairly stable although a slight decreasing trend was observed from 66 4 to 58 8 and 63 3 53 0 for mfc a and b respectively across the temperature decrease from 25 to 5 c fig 1c conversely absolute dissolved methane removal increased from 9 57 to 9 07 mg l at 25 c to 13 8 and 11 6 mg l at 5 c for mfc a and b respectively exhibiting a negative linear correlation with temperature r2 of 0 8864 and 0 7749 for mfc a and b respectively fig 1c this correlation was due to increased dissolved methane loading and relatively stable dissolved methane removal efficiency notably dissolved methane removal efficiency exhibited higher variability at 5 c table 1 likely originating from instability in aerobic methanotrophic activity at such low operational temperature hanson and hanson 1996 in contrast to literature investigating mfcs for energy recovery from gaseous methane our objective here is to both mitigate fugitive dissolved methane emissions to the atmosphere and recover embedded energy from anaerobic effluents in our previous work we observed a positive correlation between hrt and dissolved methane removal efficiency likely due to increased oxygen diffusion through the cathode per methane loading at longer hrts future research should evaluate alternative strategies to improve removal efficiency as 70 dissolved methane removal is likely needed to achieve comparable greenhouse gas emissions footprint relative to activated sludge processes smith et al 2014 3 3 distinct microbial communities were observed on the anode and cathode a distinct spatial distribution of key microbial populations was observed with aerobic methanotrophs colonizing the oxygen rich cathode separator and exoelectrogens colonizing the anode although voltage production decreased at the lower operational temperatures 10 and 5 c relative activity of geobacter spp normalized to 16s rrna copies in the anode biomass did not demonstrate a corresponding decrease for either mfc fig 2 a relative activity of methanotrophs inferred by the ratio of pmoa transcripts to 16s rrna copies in cathode biomass exhibited a plateau corroborating the observed stable dissolved methane removal fig 2b it is important to note that normalizing to 16s rrna has limitations in that activity ratios are relative to total community activity which was certainly affected by operational temperature stable geobacter spp relative activity particularly for mfc a despite the observed decrease in voltage production may indicate that other microbial populations in the anode community were similarly impacted by the decreased temperature absolute as opposed to relative activity measurements would likely provide more granularity in future research sequencing of 16s rrna genes in anode and cathode biofilm communities corroborated the distinct colonization of geobacter spp and methanotrophic bacteria on the anode and cathode respectively evident from rt qpcr data exoelectrogens in anode samples were identified belonging to geobacter 3 otus and ferribacterium zhang et al 2012 fig 3 across sequencing data from four operational temperatures 25 15 10 and 5 c total relative abundance of exoelectrogens ranged from 13 3 to 46 1 in anode samples exoelectrogens were also detected in cathode samples but at less than 2 29 relative abundance with the highest relative abundance being observed at 25 c in mfc b geobacter has been observed as an electrotroph on the cathode of mfcs gregory et al 2004 and it may have performed a similar function in our system at elevated temperature total relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs methylomonas and methylobacillus ranged from 5 86 to 21 6 in cathode samples methanotrophs were also detected in select anode samples and were as high as 10 0 relative abundance 10 c in mfc a a recent study observed aerobic methanotrophs acting as exoelectrogens tanaka et al 2018 but that seems unlikely to be occurring here given the inconsistency in methanotroph detection across anode samples distinct distribution of these key microbial populations implicates specific micro environments inside methane driven mfcs and agrees with our previous findings an interaction between cathodic methanotrophs and anodic exoelectrogens powers methane driven mfcs chen and smith 2018 distinct colonization was also evident for other microbial populations within the top 30 most abundant otus at the genus level fig 3 several fermentative populations were identified primarily in anode samples including acetobacteirum psychrosinus and propionivibrio comprising up to 15 5 relative abundance but only 1 36 relative abundance in cathode samples spearman s rank correlation revealed a positive relationship between fermentative bacteria and exoelectrogens p 0 8095 ρ 0 015 suggesting that fermentative bacteria may play a role in system performance by converting methanotrophic intermediate metabolites i e methanol formaldehyde and formate to readily biodegradable organics for exoelectrogens as described previously chen and smith 2018 myung et al 2018 conversely several otus were observed consistently at similar relative abundance in both anode and cathode samples such as simplicispia flavobacterium bradyhizobium diaphorobacter and ferruginibacter fig 3 their potential roles in bioelectrochemical systems requires further investigation non metric multidimensional scaling nmds plots were generated based on the thetayc distance matrix to visualize dissimilarity between microbial community structure across different operational temperatures anode and cathode samples formed distinct clusters given their unique metabolic properties si fig 1 in general the cathode microbial communities in mfc a and b displayed a higher similarity across the four operational temperatures than the anode microbial communities suggesting greater microbial adaptation to temperature by the anode community the anode communities were also distinctly clustered for mfc a and b likely resulting in the observed differences in voltage production between the replicate systems 3 4 network analysis revealed anode and cathode microbial community interactions lda scores were determined at the genus level to identify populations showing discriminative distribution on either the anode or cathode si fig 2 spearman s rank correlations were performed on genera with lda scores 2 to investigate potential microbial interactions amongst genera found on the anode cathode and between both communities si table 2 within the anode community fig 4 a several genera positively correlated with exoelectrogens for example acetobacterium ha et al 2007 capable of converting methanol formate and lactate to acetate positively correlated with geobacter two additional fermentative bacteria psychrosinus and propionivibrio were both positively correlated with geobacter and another potential exoelectrogen desulfovibrio zhao et al 2008 kalyuzhnaya et al reported a fermentation based methanotrophy process that produced lactate as a methanotrophic product kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 the fermenters positively correlated with geobacter on the anode may have been performing a similar function by converting produced lactate to acetate such findings implicates another indirect interaction between methanotrophs and exoelectrogens via fermentative bacteria in addition to their direct interaction chen and smith 2018 within the cathode community fig 4 b all identified significant correlations were negative most genera identified here were heterotrophic bacteria that have been identified in methane fed environments sphingomonas devosia kim et al 2014 stenotrophomonas costa et al 2000 and phenylobacterium šantl et al 2013 though methanotrophs can provide organics to cathodic heterotrophs the negative correlations between methylomonas and terrimonas su et al 2014 a potential methane oxidizer with other heterotrophs might be due to the complex methanotroph heterotroph interactions involving mutual competition for oxygen further heterotrophs rely on methanotrophic metabolites or microbial decay products hršak and begonja 2000 the highest number of significant correlations were observed between genera on the anode and cathode fig 4 c positive correlations were observed between terrimonas and both acetobacterium and psychrosinus providing further evidence that methanotrophic metabolites produced on the cathode were transported to the anode and consumed by fermentative bacteria in addition positive correlation between methylomonas and anaerosinus suggests that readily biodegradable organics generated by cathode methanotrophs were likely also scavenged by heterotrophic bacteria on the anode rather than exoelectrogens thereby reducing ce 3 5 voltage production and coulombic efficiency correlated with microbial diversity on the anode relative abundance of geobacter spp on the anode did not significantly correlate with voltage production in our study or in another study of an mfc operated on acetate and wastewater heidrich et al 2018 operational temperatures have been observed to influence microbial diversity in mfcs mei et al 2017 and therefore we evaluated if a similar relationship occurred in our systems it is important to note that substrate type can influence mfc power density ahn and logan 2010 and microbial diversity for example in comparable mfcs operated on acetate and wastewater although diversity was higher for the acetate fed mfc performance correlated with microbial diversity for only the wastewater fed mfc heidrich et al 2018 unlike acetate and wastewater methane conversion to electricity in mfcs requires a more complex microbial community involving diverse metabolic processes chen and smith 2018 gao et al 2017 mcanulty et al 2017 myung et al 2018 in our work microbial diversity of the anode for both mfc a and b si table 3 correlated with voltage production and ce across the operational temperature range p 0 7988 ρ 0 05 table 1 whereas microbial diversity of the cathode did not correlate with either performance metric therefore the anode microbial community is likely more influential in governing process performance thus the observations here corroborate other work heidrich et al 2018 suggesting that anode microbial diversity rather than exoelectrogen abundance activity is a significant factor in mfc performance 4 conclusion voltage production was relatively stable across the three highest operational temperatures 25 20 and 15 c for both mfcs 0 540 0 087 v and 0 516 0 069 v but abruptly decreased at 10 c dissolved methane removal efficiency remained relatively stable ranging from 66 4 to 58 8 and 63 6 to 53 0 in mfc a and b respectively however average absolute dissolved methane removal increased from 9 57 to 13 8 and 9 07 to 11 6 mg l as temperature decreased due to increased methane solubility rt qpcr results and 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed distinct colonization of methanotrophs and exoelectrogens on the cathode and anode respectively spearman s rank correlation suggested that fermentative bacteria play a role by facilitating interactions between methanotrophs and exoelectrogens anode microbial diversity in both mfcs was positively correlated with voltage production and ce suggesting that anode diversity is an important parameter in performance at varying temperatures overall this work indicates that mfcs can provide relatively stable methane removal

processes smith et al 2015 although the vast majority of engineered anaerobic systems are operated at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures mainstream anaerobic processes must be operated at

although high rate anaerobic processes have been implemented at the full scale in hot climates substantial research efforts are now underway to develop processes suitable for temperate climates that feature seasonally low psychrophilic temperatures smith et al 2012 however low temperatures exacerbate dissolved methane losses by increasing methane solubility and potentially methane supersaturation in anaerobic effluents chen et al 2018 smith et al 2015 for example smith et al evaluated anmbrs at multiple psychrophilic temperatures ranging from 15 to 3 c and observed a strong negative

mfc transitioned from 25 c to 15 c and suggested that lower anodic resistance at 25 c reduced power output liu et al 2013 several studies have also identified a negative correlation between temperature and startup time 30 h 144 h at 30 c min et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 60 h 504 h at 15 22 c cheng et al 2011 min et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 and no appreciable voltage over 80 days at 4 and 6 c cheng et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 however mfcs have been successfully transitioned to low temperature after initial startup at higher temperature cheng et al 2011 such phenomenon infer that exoelectrogens can sustain activity at low temperature if initially acclimated to elevated temperatures although our mechanistic understanding of extracellular electron transfer is still evolving transfer rates are likely affected by temperature dependent parameters such as cathode potential liu et al 2005 anode potential impedance due to anodic biofilm development zhang et al 2014 microbial community structure mei et al 2017 electrolyte conductivity del campo et al 2013 electrochemical reaction rates wang et al 2008 and others to date no study has investigated the impact of operational temperature on performance of methane driven mfcs we previously reported a microbial interaction between aerobic methanotroph methylomonas in a cathode biofilm and geobacter in an anode biofilm in methane driven air cathode mfcs at 20 c where formate and or acetate served as the electron shuttle between the two microbial populations chen and smith 2018 up to 85 dissolved methane removal was achieved resulting in the generation of 0 55 0 06 v though aerobic methanotrophs have been reported as active in various cold ecosystems trotsenko and khmelenina 2005 exoelectrogens such as geobacter sulfurreducens have optimal growth rate at mesophilic temperatures caccavo et al 1994 to evaluate methane driven mfc performance and microbial community adaptation to varying operational temperatures two replicate air cathode mfcs were sequentially operated at 25 20 15 10 and 5 c anode and cathode biofilm samples were obtained at the end of each operational temperature activity of methanotrophs

sequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 mfc configuration operation and monitoring two replicate air cathode mfcs with a 240 ml working volume were operated previously on a synthetic anaerobic effluent

fibers were soaked in a solution of ammonium peroxydisulfate 200 g l 1 and concentrated sulfuric acid 100 ml l 1 for 15 min before assembly feng et al 2010 the cathode was comprised of a carbon cloth 30 wet proofing carbon cloth cc4 wet proofed fuel cell earth woburn ma and pretreated as described previously cheng et al 2006 between the anode and cathode two layers of fabric cloth amplitude ecocloth contect inc spartanburg sc were applied to limit excess oxygen diffusion and potential short circuiting the mfcs were initially inoculated with primary clarifier effluent obtained from the hyperion wastewater treatment plant los angeles ca operated in batch mode with acetate as the sole electron donor and then transitioned to continuous mode operation at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h on a synthetic anaerobic effluent containing dissolved methane at 20 c chen and smith 2018 we previously evaluated hrts of 4 8 and 16 h but elected to operate both mfcs at 8 h here the mfcs were operated in a temperature controlled incubator drosophila incubator genesee scientific ca a synthetic anaerobic effluent si table 1 was temperature controlled by immersion in a water bath connected to a chiller lindberg blue m shaking water bath thermo fisher scientific waltham ma the synthetic anaerobic effluent was first purged vigorously with a gaseous blend of 80 methane and 20 carbon dioxide by volume for 15 min to remove dissolved oxygen and saturate the media with dissolved methane during operation the media was continuously sparged with the same gaseous blend of 80 methane and 20 carbon dioxide at 10 20 ml min to ensure anaerobic conditions were maintained both mfcs were initially operated at 20 c until reaching stable performance i e voltage production of 0 5 0 1 v and dissolve methane removal efficiency of 60 5 the mfcs were subsequently subjected to five consecutive temperatures of 25 20 15 10 and 5 c for at least 1 week at each temperature from day 54 for both mfcs voltage was measured across 1000 ω external resistance via data acquisition device di245 dataq akron oh dissolved methane concentrations were quantified by collecting influent and effluent samples in gas tight syringes and equilibrating dissolved gases into an equal volume nitrogen headspace by vigorously shaking for 1 min the gas phase of the syringe was then injected into a 10 ml water filled sampling vial displacing the water the resultant gas samples were analyzed by a gas chromatograph trace 1310 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma equipped with a traceplot tg bond q column 30m 0 53 mm x 20 μm and a flame ionization detector the instrument was operated at the following temperatures inlet at 250 c oven at 150 c and detector at 250 c one ml of sample was manually injected dissolved methane concentration was calculated as described previously chen and smith 2018 influent and effluent dissolved methane were monitored on a daily basis 2 2 sequencing and rt qpcr anode and cathode biofilm samples were collected at the end of each operational temperature specifically at least 1 mg anode cathode biomass sample was collected at each temperature except at 20 c anode biofilm biomass together with the carbon brush was cut from the anode while cathode biofilm biomass was scraped from the cathode separator cloth on the surface facing the anode dna and rna were extracted using pre baked 1 mm diameter zirconium beads with a bead beater mini beadbeater 24 biospec products bartlesville ok the maxwell lev 16 dna blood kit and simply rna blood kit promega madison wi were used according to manufacturer s instructions for the rna extracts potential residual contaminating dna was removed via the invitrogen dna free dna removal kit following manufacturer s instruction thermo fisher scientific waltham ma dna and rna extracts were quantified via the quant ittm picogreen dsdna and ribogreen rna assay kits thermo fisher scientific waltham ma using spectrophotometry biospectrometer fluorescence eppendorf germany after that rna was reverse transcribed to complementary dna promega goscript reverse transcription system madison wi before conducting reverse transcription quantitative pcr in which geobacter spp 16s rrna particulate methane monooxygenase pmoa a functional gene of methanotrophs and universal 16s rrna copy number were quantified chen and smith 2018 specifically three sets of primers geo564f aagcgttgttcggawttat and geo840r ggcactgcaggggtcaata cummings et al 2003 a189f ggngactgggacttctgg and mb661r ccggmgcaacgtcyttacc bourne et al 2001

biotium 0 3 μm for forward and reverse primers 1 μl cdna template and dnase rnase free water amplifications were performed on a lightcycler 96 instrument roche molecular systems inc rt qpcr standards were prepared as described previously chen and smith 2018 microbial community structure was evaluated via illumina miseq paired end sequencing targeting the v4 region of the 16s rrna genes library preparation and sequencing was done by the microbial systems molecular biology laboratory msmbl university of michigan ann arbor mi 2 3 bioinformatics mothur was used to process illumina miseq sequencing data to generate operational taxonomic units otus kozich et al 2013 after quality filtering alignment with silva reference database pruesse et al 2007 and chimera removal by the vsearch algorithm rognes et al 2016 an average of 54796 19408 sequence reads per sample were generated with minimum and maximum sequences of 22931 and 100106 next 22931 reads were randomly subsampled from each sample before conducting otu based clustering analysis using the 3 average neighbor cutoff resulting in 1990 distinct otus across all samples and an average of 340 31 otus per sample microbial community dissimilarity represented by thetayc yue and clayton 2005 was visualized via non metric multidimensional scaling nmds otus were binned into phylotypes based on their taxonomic classification kozich et al 2013 at the genus level resulting in 311 phylotypes across all samples to characterize microbial propensity for colonization on the anode or cathode the lefse tool was applied to the phylotype data where a linear discriminant analysis lda score 2 was deemed significant segata et al 2011 further spearman s rank correlation spearman 1904 was calculated between phylotypes 1 within the anode microbial community 2 within the cathode microbial community and 3 between the anode and cathode communities to evaluate interactions between populations in both biofilms microbial network analysis plots were generated based on spearman s rank correlation coefficients of probability 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 voltage production abruptly decreased at 10 c after both replicate mfcs demonstrated stable voltage production on the synthetic anaerobic effluent at 20 c operational temperature for both mfcs was increased to 25 c mfc a generated a higher voltage averaging 0 603 0 017 v relative to mfc b averaging 0 463 0 093 v fig 1a mfc a voltage decreased by 11 4 when operational temperature was decreased to 20 c 0 534 0 038 v and decreased further by 4 12 at 15 c 0 512 0 108 v mfc b exhibited higher variability in voltage production at 25 c but voltage production became more stable at 20 and 15 c resulting in an average voltage of 0 536 0 073 and 0 569 0 054 v respectively therefore mfc b voltage production increased by 15 8 when temperature was decreased from 25 to 20 c and by an additional 6 16 from 20 to 15 c variability in mfc b voltage production may have originated from instability in the microbial community and lower microbial diversity relative to other operational temperatures si table 3 notably both mfcs experienced an abrupt decrease in voltage at 10 c decreasing to 0 196 0 040 and 0 261 0 093 v for mfc a and b respectively as temperature was further decreased to 5 c voltage production continued to decrease to 0 156 0 039 v and 0 190 0 066 v for mfc a and b respectively overall voltage production decreased by 51 2 64 3 at 10 c and further decreased by 19 2 24 6 at 5 c when compared with 10 c although other studies have demonstrated increases in voltage production at lower operational temperatures cheng et al 2011 jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 zhang et al 2014 the methane driven mfcs investigated here were operated at significantly lower organic loading rates higher organic loading rates likely favor competition between exoelectrogens and heterotrophic bacteria resulting in higher voltage production at lower temperatures if heterotrophs are inhibited to a greater extent than exoelectrogens jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 the observed abrupt decrease in voltage production at 10 and 5 c in our study strongly suggests that exoelectrogenic activity was suppressed at such low temperatures at the highest voltage production 0 603 0 017 v power density was 60 6 mw m2 if normalized to cathode area 60 cm2 and is consistent with power density reported in our previous work chen and smith 2018 higher power densities have been reported in dual chamber mfcs 419 5 5 9 mw m2 via employing a gas diffusion electrode yu et al 2018 and as high as 4700 800 mw m2 when using a genetically engineered archaeal strain performing reverse methanogenesis yamasaki et al 2018 given that the mfcs operated here produced similar voltage to previous studies chen and smith 2018 mcanulty et al 2017 yamasaki et al 2018 yu et al 2018 cathode area is likely the design parameter restricting power density power density decreased to 6 40 and 11 4 mw m2 at 10 c in mfc a and b respectively ce also decreased significantly for mfc a and b as temperature decreased ce at 25 20 and 15 c averaged 6 90 0 94 and 6 19 1 45 for mfc a and b respectively whereas it significantly decreased at 10 and 5 c to an average of 2 10 0 70 and 2 75 1 27 for mfc a and b respectively ce at 25 20 and 15 c is similar to what we previously reported chen and smith 2018 higher ce 65 9 13 2 to 90 10 has been reported in other methane driven mfcs relying on interactions between geobacter and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme mcanulty et al 2017 or methanogenic archaea performing reverse methanogenesis yu et al 2018 the lower ce reported here is due to electrons being lost during conversion of methane to intermediate metabolites e g methanol and formate by aerobic methanotrophs and scavenging of metabolites by heterotrophs chen and smith 2018 hanson and hanson 1996 myung et al 2018 3 2 dissolved methane removal efficiency was relatively stable across operational temperature as operational temperature decreased influent dissolved methane increased from 14 5 0 8 mg l to 21 7 0 9 mg l fig 1 b due to increased methane solubility relative to theoretical dissolved methane concentrations derived from henry s law measured influent concentrations were 19 0 4 1 lower on average possibly due to inefficiencies in sample collection across all operational temperatures dissolved methane removal efficiencies were fairly stable although a slight decreasing trend was observed from 66 4 to 58 8 and 63 3 53 0 for mfc a and b respectively across the temperature decrease from 25 to 5 c fig 1c conversely absolute dissolved methane removal increased from 9 57 to 9 07 mg l at 25 c to 13 8 and 11 6 mg l at 5 c for mfc a and b respectively exhibiting a negative linear correlation with temperature r2 of 0 8864 and 0 7749 for mfc a and b respectively fig 1c this correlation was due to increased dissolved methane loading and relatively stable dissolved methane removal efficiency notably dissolved methane removal efficiency exhibited higher variability at 5 c table 1 likely originating from instability in aerobic methanotrophic activity at such low operational temperature hanson and hanson 1996 in contrast to literature investigating mfcs for energy recovery from gaseous methane our objective here is to both mitigate fugitive dissolved methane emissions to the atmosphere and recover embedded energy from anaerobic effluents in our previous work we observed a positive correlation between hrt and dissolved methane removal efficiency likely due to increased oxygen diffusion through the cathode per methane loading at longer hrts future research should evaluate alternative strategies to improve removal efficiency as 70 dissolved methane removal is likely needed to achieve comparable greenhouse gas emissions footprint relative to activated sludge processes smith et al 2014 3 3 distinct microbial communities were observed on the anode and cathode a distinct spatial distribution of key microbial populations was observed with aerobic methanotrophs colonizing the oxygen rich cathode separator and exoelectrogens colonizing the anode although voltage production decreased at the lower operational temperatures 10 and 5 c relative activity of geobacter spp normalized to 16s rrna copies in the anode biomass did not demonstrate a corresponding decrease for either mfc fig 2 a relative activity of methanotrophs inferred by the ratio of pmoa transcripts to 16s rrna copies in cathode biomass exhibited a plateau corroborating the observed stable dissolved methane removal fig 2b it is important to note that normalizing to 16s rrna has limitations in that activity ratios are relative to total community activity which was certainly affected by operational temperature stable geobacter spp relative activity particularly for mfc a despite the observed decrease in voltage production may indicate that other microbial populations in the anode community were similarly impacted by the decreased temperature absolute as opposed to relative activity measurements would likely provide more granularity in future research sequencing of 16s rrna genes in anode and cathode biofilm communities corroborated the distinct colonization of geobacter spp and methanotrophic bacteria on the anode and cathode respectively evident from rt qpcr data exoelectrogens in anode samples were identified belonging to geobacter 3 otus and ferribacterium zhang et al 2012 fig 3 across sequencing data from four operational temperatures 25 15 10 and 5 c total relative abundance of exoelectrogens ranged from 13 3 to 46 1 in anode samples exoelectrogens were also detected in cathode samples but at less than 2 29 relative abundance with the highest relative abundance being observed at 25 c in mfc b geobacter has been observed as an electrotroph on the cathode of mfcs gregory et al 2004 and it may have performed a similar function in our system at elevated temperature total relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs methylomonas and methylobacillus ranged from 5 86 to 21 6 in cathode samples methanotrophs were also detected in select anode samples and were as high as 10 0 relative abundance 10 c in mfc a a recent study observed aerobic methanotrophs acting as exoelectrogens tanaka et al 2018 but that seems unlikely to be occurring here given the inconsistency in methanotroph detection across anode samples distinct distribution of these key microbial populations implicates specific micro environments inside methane driven mfcs and agrees with our previous findings an interaction between cathodic methanotrophs and anodic exoelectrogens powers methane driven mfcs chen and smith 2018 distinct colonization was also evident for other microbial populations within the top 30 most abundant otus at the genus level fig 3 several fermentative populations were identified primarily in anode samples including acetobacteirum psychrosinus and propionivibrio comprising up to 15 5 relative abundance but only 1 36 relative abundance in cathode samples spearman s rank correlation revealed a positive relationship between fermentative bacteria and exoelectrogens p 0 8095 ρ 0 015 suggesting that fermentative bacteria may play a role in system performance by converting methanotrophic intermediate metabolites i e methanol formaldehyde and formate to readily biodegradable organics for exoelectrogens as described previously chen and smith 2018 myung et al 2018 conversely several otus were observed consistently at similar relative abundance in both anode and cathode samples such as simplicispia flavobacterium bradyhizobium diaphorobacter and ferruginibacter fig 3 their potential roles in bioelectrochemical systems requires further investigation non metric multidimensional scaling nmds plots were generated based on the thetayc distance matrix to visualize dissimilarity between microbial community structure across different operational temperatures anode and cathode samples formed distinct clusters given their unique metabolic properties si fig 1 in general the cathode microbial communities in mfc a and b displayed a higher similarity across the four operational temperatures than the anode microbial communities suggesting greater microbial adaptation to temperature by the anode community the anode communities were also distinctly clustered for mfc a and b likely resulting in the observed differences in voltage production between the replicate systems 3 4 network analysis revealed anode and cathode microbial community interactions lda scores were determined at the genus level to identify populations showing discriminative distribution on either the anode or cathode si fig 2 spearman s rank correlations were performed on genera with lda scores 2 to investigate potential microbial interactions amongst genera found on the anode cathode and between both communities si table 2 within the anode community fig 4 a several genera positively correlated with exoelectrogens for example acetobacterium ha et al 2007 capable of converting methanol formate and lactate to acetate positively correlated with geobacter two additional fermentative bacteria psychrosinus and propionivibrio were both positively correlated with geobacter and another potential exoelectrogen desulfovibrio zhao et al 2008 kalyuzhnaya et al reported a fermentation based methanotrophy process that produced lactate as a methanotrophic product kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 the fermenters positively correlated with geobacter on the anode may have been performing a similar function by converting produced lactate to acetate such findings implicates another indirect interaction between methanotrophs and exoelectrogens via fermentative bacteria in addition to their direct interaction chen and smith 2018 within the cathode community fig 4 b all identified significant correlations were negative most genera identified here were heterotrophic bacteria that have been identified in methane fed environments sphingomonas devosia kim et al 2014 stenotrophomonas costa et al 2000 and phenylobacterium šantl et al 2013 though methanotrophs can provide organics to cathodic heterotrophs the negative correlations between methylomonas and terrimonas su et al 2014 a potential methane oxidizer with other heterotrophs might be due to the complex methanotroph heterotroph interactions involving mutual competition for oxygen further heterotrophs rely on methanotrophic metabolites or microbial decay products hršak and begonja 2000 the highest number of significant correlations were observed between genera on the anode and cathode fig 4 c positive correlations were observed between terrimonas and both acetobacterium and psychrosinus providing further evidence that methanotrophic metabolites produced on the cathode were transported to the anode and consumed by fermentative bacteria in addition positive correlation between methylomonas and anaerosinus suggests that readily biodegradable organics generated by cathode methanotrophs were likely also scavenged by heterotrophic bacteria on the anode rather than exoelectrogens thereby reducing ce 3 5 voltage production and coulombic efficiency correlated with microbial diversity on the anode relative abundance of geobacter spp on the anode did not significantly correlate with voltage production in our study or in another study of an mfc operated on acetate and wastewater heidrich et al 2018 operational temperatures have been observed to influence microbial diversity in mfcs mei et al 2017 and therefore we evaluated if a similar relationship occurred in our systems it is important to note that substrate type can influence mfc power density ahn and logan 2010 and microbial diversity for example in comparable mfcs operated on acetate and wastewater although diversity was higher for the acetate fed mfc performance correlated with microbial diversity for only the wastewater fed mfc heidrich et al 2018 unlike acetate and wastewater methane conversion to electricity in mfcs requires a more complex microbial community involving diverse metabolic processes chen and smith 2018 gao et al 2017 mcanulty et al 2017 myung et al 2018 in our work microbial diversity of the anode for both mfc a and b si table 3 correlated with voltage production and ce across the operational temperature range p 0 7988 ρ 0 05 table 1 whereas microbial diversity of the cathode did not correlate with either performance metric therefore the anode microbial community is likely more influential in governing process performance thus the observations here corroborate other work heidrich et al 2018 suggesting that anode microbial diversity rather than exoelectrogen abundance activity is a significant factor in mfc performance 4 conclusion voltage production was relatively stable across the three highest operational temperatures 25 20 and 15 c for both mfcs 0 540 0 087 v and 0 516 0 069 v but abruptly decreased at 10 c dissolved methane removal efficiency remained relatively stable ranging from 66 4 to 58 8 and 63 6 to 53 0 in mfc a and b respectively however average absolute dissolved methane removal increased from 9 57 to 13 8 and 9 07 to 11 6 mg l as temperature decreased due to increased methane solubility rt qpcr results and 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed distinct colonization of methanotrophs and exoelectrogens on the cathode and anode respectively spearman s rank correlation suggested that fermentative bacteria play a role by facilitating interactions between methanotrophs and exoelectrogens anode microbial diversity in both mfcs was positively correlated with voltage production and ce suggesting that anode diversity is an important parameter in performance at varying temperatures overall this work indicates that mfcs can provide relatively stable methane removal

18459,the inclusion of omics data into water quality monitoring programs is being considered to help alleviate the growing threat to water resources and ecosystem services despite the increasing need the biological early warning system bews the widely used real time water quality monitoring system does not currently incorporate omics information despite that metabolomics is a highly sensitive indicator of organism health and stress we examined daphnia magna metabolomics which is the analysis of small molecules in living d magna as a potential water quality parameter for incorporation in the bews the concentrations of 24 metabolites were measured with changes in water quality and variation of metabolite abundances was compared within and between conditions age dependent monitoring revealed that matured individuals older than 8 days are appropriate model organisms for monitoring based on their low metabolomic variation as compared to younger daphnids hourly monitoring of metabolic variability and regulation under ambient and starved conditions demonstrated the rapid and sensitive detection of nutritional changes moreover the metabolomic dysregulation due to exposure to the pollutant propranolol was also observed by integrating all the observations we found that the d magna metabolome is a sensitive and useful parameter for detecting water quality changes and how these alter the function of keystone organisms as such this metabolomics based framework is applicable to bews and highlights the beneficial advantages of integrating biomolecular and apical endpoint observations for enhanced performance in biomonitoring programs graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality monitoring metabolomics time course monitoring 1 introduction with increasing pollution risk and shifts in nutrients grimm et al 2008 the development of a sensitive and rapid water quality monitoring tool is needed to manage and secure water resources and the services that these ecosystems provide the biological early warning system bews is a real time monitoring tool which has been successfully applied for the rapid detection of sudden water quality changes in various water resources bae and park 2014 the system quantifies multiple biological responses of caged organisms in a time series manner and defines whether the test organism is under contamination stress to predict water quality bae and park 2014 currently biological parameters of macro biota used in bews are mostly limited to physical responses of indicator species such as movement bownik 2017 as such there is potential to incorporate more recent methods of assessing how changes in water quality can alter the health of water dwelling organisms rapid advances in omics technology have improved the sensitivity of biomolecular analysis for the detection of subtle changes in living organisms santos et al 2018 omics technologies such as genomics transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics are used extensively to investigate molecular level impacts to environmentally relevant organisms which are not detected by traditional biological endpoints beale et al 2017 santos et al 2018 the molecular level responses are detected rapidly before the apical endpoints due to various environmental changes villeneuve et al 2014 therefore the integration of omics with the bews may potentially provide rapidness as well as sensitivity to environmental quality monitoring to our knowledge there have not been any studies that evaluate the potential integration of omics within the framework of the bews the bews uses time course monitoring unlike studies that have tried to include omics to water quality assessment with a single time point monitoring approach beale et al 2017 metabolomics which is the analysis of small molecule metabolites in living organisms is a sensitive and promising tool to study environment organism interactions poynton et al 2011 metabolomic studies have shown the capability to detect disruption by low level sub lethal pollution and to provide mechanistic insights on toxicity mechanisms using keystone indicator species such as daphnia magna poynton et al 2011 kariuki et al 2017 the high sensitivity to environmental change offers immense potential as an environmental quality parameter for the bews alternatively the metabolome of a living organism is regulated by environmental variation even under ambient conditions such as diurnal changes or nutritional fluctuations dyar and eckel mahan 2017 high variation in the metabolome could prevent the integration of metabolomics data in real time monitoring but these parameters must be tested and constrained as with behavioral parameters which are the most widely accepted parameters in the monitoring system bownik 2017 moreover the high sensitivity of metabolomics to the small changes might contribute to improved understanding of ambient variation which is a cause of false pollution detection in bews van der schalie et al 2001 based on this this study investigates the metabolic variation and regulation of d magna within the framework of bews we targeted 24 metabolites from the d magna metabolome using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and performed comparative analysis of time course metabolic regulation under different conditions firstly different life stages of d magna were monitored and examined for differences between ages subsequently the time series regulation of the targeted metabolites under different conditions days feeding conditions generations and exposures to a model pollutant propranolol was compared to examine differences between the ambient and stressed conditions propranolol was employed at one low and one high sub lethal effective concentration to evaluate the sensitivity of metabolomic responses finally the potential use of metabolomic data was evaluated and discussed as a candidate indicator for water quality assessment in the bews 2 materials and methods 2 1 daphnia magna maintenance daphnids were purchased from ward science and have been cultured consistently based on the following description daphnia magna was cultured based on the guidelines of environment canada environment canada 2000 the culture media was prepared by adding vitamin b12 and selenium to dechlorinated tap water the room temperature was controlled at 22 1 c and the light and dark conditions were maintained as 16 h of day and 8 h of night for all experiments an algae species chlorella vulgaris was provided daily as a nutrient source during the whole daphnid sampling period for every experiment algae was provided at a constant and specific time 4 5 p m to minimize any variation due to feeding schedules 2 2 daphnia magna experiments this study was comprised of three different experiments with different variables and sampling times summarized in fig 1 the first experiment experiment 1 aimed to elucidate the dynamics of metabolic variation and regulation by age and to determine the range of ages with the least variation in metabolite concentrations for this experiment d magna were consistently maintained under ambient conditions and were sampled at a specified time 2 p m on different days for detection of metabolites in neonates and immature daphnids samples were pooled into four replicates 20 10 10 5 3 3 2 2 and 2 daphnids per sample at 1 3 5 8 10 12 15 17 and 19th day after birth to ensure that metabolite concentrations were above quantification limits in the second experiment experiment 2 the ambient regulation of metabolites and the impact of time day and starvation was investigated adult d magna 13 days old were sampled hourly under both ambient and starved conditions for four days days 1 2 7 and 8 and one day day 3 respectively hourly daphnid sampling was performed in triplicate 7 times per day from 10 a m to 4 p m 11 a m 4 p m for day 1 as shown in fig 1 days 1 and 2 were subsequently maintained under ambient conditions to create a starvation stress condition on day 3 the nutrition source c vulgaris was suspended after day 2 and the starved individuals were sampled on day 3 after day 3 daphnids were allowed to recover from the nutritionally stressed conditions for three days where algae was provided under ambient conditions for the last two days days 7 and 8 daphnids were sampled under ambient conditions after the recovery period during the same times to assess the metabolic changes the third experiment experiment 3 examined the impact of propranolol exposure by sampling daphnids in ambient and propranolol exposed conditions at two different concentrations propranolol hydrochloride 99 was purchased from sigma aldrich the experiment 3 was performed at a separate generation of d magna culture propranolol is an emerging pollutant has been detected frequently and is relatively well studied in d magna jeong et al 2015 roberts and thomas 2006 wagner et al 2017 the concentrations of propranolol solutions were 18 μg l and 4350 μg l and correspond to the sub lethal and lethal concentrations in 48 h exposure studies jeong et al 2015 wagner et al 2017 as bews aims to serve as an early warning of water pollution the entire propranolol exposure period was shorter 6 h than the period used in a traditional acute exposure test which is typically 24 or 48 h weber 1991 the hourly d magna sampling started 1 h after the propranolol exposure was initiated and ended after 6 h exposure fig 1 the sampling was performed in six replicates and no lethality was observed during the exposure period 2 3 sample preparation and metabolite extraction after collection individual d magna were rinsed with deionized water followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen the frozen daphnids were stored in 2 ml plastic microtubes at 20 c until metabolite extraction daphnia metabolite extraction methods were adapted from wu et al 2008 with minor modifications solvents and reagents used for metabolite extractions and analyses which included water acetonitrile chloroform and formic acid were all lc ms grade 99 and purchased from fisher scientific standard compounds listed in table s1 were purchased from sigma aldrich fisher scientific alfa aesar bdh chemicals cambridge isotope laboratories inc and bioshop canada inc and were of 98 purity frozen daphnia samples were lyophilized using a freeze dryer subsequently the dried samples were combined with 140 μl of a mixture of methanol and water 5 2 v v ratio containing the internal standards used for metabolite quantification table s1 the samples were then homogenized using a motorized pellet pestle fisher scientific and 50 μl of water and 100 μl of chloroform were added to the tissue homogenate chloroform was used to purify the polar extract of water and methanol mixture by isolating the lipophilic contents from the tissue extract the homogenates were sonicated for 10 min after sonication the samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 c and 12500 rpm the supernatant was then diluted with water 20 times and filtered using a syringeless filter mini prep whatman before analysis by lc coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer all extraction procedures were performed on ice to preserve sample integrity 2 4 metabolite quantification using lc ms ms metabolites were selected based on accepted and published methods used in metabolomics wei et al 2010 the metabolites measured in this study are also indicative of dynamic changes to d magna biochemistry and health zhang et al 2017 metabolite quantification was performed using a lc ms ms system agilent 6420a triple quadrupole ms with 1260 lc system equipped with ultra aq c18 column 3 μm x 100 mm 4 6 mm electrospray ionization esi was employed in a polarity switching mode for both positive and negative ion modes with multiple reaction monitoring mrm for targeted metabolite quantification table s1 mobile phases were water and acetonitrile 0 1 formic acid was added to both mobile phases and a flow rate of 0 5 ml min was used lc separation was performed using a gradient program of 5 acetonitrile at 0 min which reached 40 60 80 and 5 at 5 6 9 and 10 min respectively followed by 10 min of equilibrium time the parameters for lc ms ms were as follows drying gas temperature of 300 c drying gas flow rate of 6 l min nebulizer pressure of 15 psi and capillary voltage of 4000 v calibration curves for metabolite quantification were generated using standards at 5 to 11 consecutive concentration points with r2 values ranging from 0 9935 to 0 9998 for quality control standard samples at a low and high level of calibration were chosen and analyzed in 5 replicates for accuracy and precision measurements recovery rates of the metabolite extraction procedure were also measured by extracting a sub set of samples n 6 where known standard concentrations were added before the extraction accuracy was observed within 80 120 and precision was less than 20 of the relative standard deviation parameters including accuracy precision limit of quantification and recovery rates are listed in table s2 to correct for the range of extraction recovery for different metabolites a mixture of internal standards were added to the tubes containing daphnid samples before the extraction all of samples quantified for metabolites had signal to noise ratio of integrated peaks higher than 10 blanks were run after every 20 sample runs to check for sample carry over which was not detected 2 5 quantification of propranolol in exposure media using lc ms ms the dissolved concentrations of propranolol in exposure solutions were confirmed table s3 by lc ms ms analysis equipped with zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 1 8 μm x 50 mm 2 1 mm an external standard was used for propranolol concentration quantification in detail the propranolol was eluted from the column with the isocratic flow of mobile phase of water and acetonitrile 30 70 containing 0 1 formic acid in both mobile phases the analytical separation was performed for 5 min at 1 ml min flow rate esi positive mode was applied and the precursor and product ions monitored were 260 and 183 respectively the parameters for lc ms ms analysis were as follows drying gas temperature of 300 c drying gas flow rate of 11 l min nebulizer pressure of 45 psi and capillary voltage of 1000 v 2 6 data analysis the measured metabolite absolute concentrations in each daphnid were calculated based on internal standard method using agilent mass hunter software version b 08 00 in addition to the absolute concentration which indicates absolute abundance the normalized abundance of a metabolite was calculated by dividing the absolute concentration by the total concentration of all the metabolites observed per daphnid the normalized abundance is dependent on concentrations of the other metabolites therefore the calculated normalized abundance provides additional biological insight than absolute concentration alone which is independent of concentrations of the other metabolites principal component analysis pca was performed to identify age dependent variation of metabolite abundance and find a range of ages with the smallest variation fig 2 in the pca scores plots the clusters of samples are based on data similarity and the loadings plot illustrates how much each metabolite abundance contributes to the data separation to understand the deviation of metabolite abundances across sampling times under ambient conditions and days in experiment 2 the ratio of standard deviation to mean coefficient of variation cv was calculated for both absolute and normalized metabolite abundances observed in different sampling hours of four ambient days fig 3 fig s1 to compare time regulation between days the absolute and normalized metabolite abundances were rescaled by dividing by daily averages and the full result of abundance comparison between days is shown in figs s2 and s3 fig 4 illustrates metabolites with periodicity in the inter day comparison of the normalized abundance the hourly change of normalized metabolite abundances were compared between ambient and starvation conditions fig 5 in addition to the comparison between ambient and propranolol exposed conditions fig 6 bews requires a control reference data set aquired when the organism is under non stressful conditions to compare with currently aquired response data and define whether the current organism is under stressful or non stressful ambient conditions to evaluate the use of ambient metabolomic data as a control reference data set normalized metabolite abundances under non stressful conditions aquired during experiments 2 and 3 were plotted with data under stressful conditions of starvation and propranolol exposure in the experiments 2 and 3 on one heat map fig 7 all of statistical analyses were performed using r statistical package team 2015 the ggplot2 package was used for graphical material generation wickham 2010 for the comparision of normalized abundance from figs 4 7 the metabolite abundances were rescaled by dividing by daily averages 3 results 3 1 daphnia magna metabolite variation across developmental stages the variation between the normalized abundances of metabolites at different ages were analyzed using pca and are shown in fig 2 the pca scores plot in fig 2a shows that the metabolite abundances in the younger d magna individuals are distinguishable from the older individuals along principal components pcs 1 and 2 both pc1 and pc2 individually explain deviations among developing neonates 1 5 days old and between matured individuals 8 19 days old from the loadings plot of pc1 in fig 2b arginine histidine and lysine are majorly contributing for and negatively correlated with the data separation from 1 to 5 days old in terms of abundance arginine and histidine with lysine consist of half of the targeted metabolites in d magna and their composition rate decreases as d magna grows the pc2 loadings plot indicates that the metabolites lysine tyrosine and adenosine monophosphate are the most differentiated metabolites between the matured individuals 3 2 hourly and daily variation of metabolites under ambient conditions because daphnia adults showed relatively lower metabolomic variation metabolite concentration regulation was monitored hourly under ambient and nutrient limited conditions and compared to assess how time and day and nutritional conditions control metabolic variability using adult daphnids 13 days old to better understand the variation and regulatory characteristics under ambient conditions the variation of metabolite abundances for four ambient days days 1 2 7 and 8 in experiment 2 was calculated as cv as described in the methods section fig 3 shows histograms of cvs of the absolute and normalized abundances across days and times as cv is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean smaller cvs of metabolite abundances across days or hours represent relatively consistent regulation the histograms in fig 3 show that cv is overall lower with normalized abundance than absolute concentration by both of day and time based on the cv heat maps of absolute and normalized metabolite abundances fig s1 it is found that the metabolites conserved low cvs by time is generally with low cvs by days as well for absolute concentration arginine histidine and proline are categorized as the most consistent metabolites with cvs less than 0 37 for normalized abundance cvs of proline lysine arginine valine leucine and isoleucine are less than 0 29 across days and times daily average normalization of the metabolite abundance facilitates inter day comparisons of metabolite abundances by rescaling the daily baselines to the same level 1 from the graphs of inter day regulation comparison figs s2 and s3 a small number of metabolites were discovered to have similar time course regulation patterns in metabolite abundance changes between days fig 4 shows the metabolites with a similar regulation pattern proline is the metabolite showing relatively strong periodicity of time dependent metabolite abundance change among all days fig 4 tyrosine asparagine and glutamine show some similarity over both days fig 4 for example glutamine has a similar time pattern between the 7th and 8th days but not the 1st and 2nd days 3 3 impact of starvation on metabolic variation given the control reference data set of normalized metabolite abundances by the ambient conditions on days 1 2 7 and 8 nutrient stress on the day 3 was contrasted to examine whether metabolite regulation reflects the depletion of nutrient sources in an assumption that the data is analyzed in a real time manner like bews a student s t test was applied to compare the rescaled normalized abundances in the starved day 3 to the control data day 1 2 7 and 8 as results significant differences based on false discovery rate adjusted p value fdr were observed by starvation for select metabolites table 1 this indicates that starvation altered the metabolome more significantly than daily variation under ambient conditions fig 5 displays the example of metabolite abundance regulation differentiated by starvation compared to the regulation in ambient condition all data for absolute and normalized abundance regulation of 24 metabolites are shown in figs s2 and s3 among the metabolites with significantly differentiated variation by starvation table 1 adenosine monophosphate fig 5 was the most quickly frequently and severely dysregulated metabolite 3 4 impact of propranolol exposure daphnids were separately exposed to control media and media containing propranolol at two different concentrations experiment 3 fig 6 illustrates the hourly regulation of normalized metabolite abundances significantly affected fdr 0 05 by propranolol exposures in the hourly comparison between groups exposed to control media and media containing propranolol interestingly three different metabolites were affected by propranolol exposure at different time points and concentrations cysteine leucine and isoleucine show dysregulation at 3 4 h later from the propranolol exposure initiation as described in fig 6 to evaluate the identical contrast approach used in experiment 2 utilizing the previously acquired control reference data for four ambient days in experiment 2 a student s t test was performed to distinguish propranolol exposed or non exposed groups in experiment 3 from the control reference data in experiment 2 table s4 lists fdrs of the student s t tests and shows that not only the propranolol exposed also control media exposed group in experiment 3 have significantly different metabolic regulation compared to the control reference data in experiment 2 as the experiment 2 and 3 were performed in separate generations it seems that generational deviation contributed to the differentiation of the normalized metabolite abundance for more comprehensive data comparison the heat map was generated by combining means of all the observed normalized abundances of this study which was additionally rescaled by daily averages fig 7 the heat map confirms the normalized abundances differentiated by starvation and propranolol exposures as well as generation of d magna culture by integrating all the observed normalized metabolite abundances into a heat map fig 7 the highest and most frequent metabolomic variation was observed under the starvation stress and there are observable variations between propranolol and non propranolol exposed groups as well 4 discussion 4 1 age dependent metabolite profiles and its implication for bews the pca scores plot in fig 2a reveals that the metabolite profile in the younger d magna individuals are distinguishable from the older individuals it is believed that the growth of d magna occurs most sharply from birth to about 6 days chopelet et al 2008 in our culture egg clutches start to be generated from 5 to 6 days old and a first neonate birth typically occurred 2 3 days later once the first reproduction cycle starts the cycle repeats for the entire lifespan of the matured daphnids as such the differentiated metabolite profiles along pc1 and 2 are likely related to neonate development and reproduction capacity of d magna arginine histidine lysine tyrosine and adenosine monophosphate were shown in the loading plots for pc1 and pc2 fig 2b that contribute to data separation richness and significant depletion of arginine histidine and lysine supports that these are fundamental metabolites for intensive maturation and growth other studies have shown that arginine and histidine are functional amino acids which play crucial roles for growth and development for a variety of species ingle 2011 wu et al 2004 a decrease in the abundance of the metabolites during maturation of d magna is comparable to the observation in pieris brassicae which exhibits decreases of arginine histidine and lysine with age lawrence 1990 the contribution of lysine is suspected to be linked to repeated embryogenesis lysine was reported as one of the major essential amino acids for embryonic development for another crustacean homarus gammarus rosa et al 2005 and is one of the most differentiated metabolites for the neonate development period in the present study tyrosine is believed to be related to the molting activity because it is the most predominant amino acid in the exoskeleton of crawfish which is also a crustacean no et al 1989 the change in adenosine monophosphate abundance is likely related to the alteration on energy demands from reproduction and molting cycles hardie 2011 our results are also similar to that reported for another daphnia species daphnia similis where metabolic profiles were observed to be age dependent zhang et al 2017 daphnia magna at different ages has a separate advantage in terms of utility in assays for example the youngest neonate 24 and 48 h is so sensitive to pollutant exposures that it is accepted as a model organism in traditional acute toxicity tests weber 1991 from the perspective of bews application data from the matured individuals with lower deviation is more beneficial as the lower variation under ambient conditions might secure larger contrast of abnormal metabolomic changes by environmental stresses based on the findings from experiment 1 the use of adult d magna is recommended to reduce ambient variation of control data 4 2 overall deviation and daily periodicity of metabolite abundances and its implications for bews comparison of overall variation of metabolite abundance regulation across days and times fig 3 shows lower cv with normalized abundance than absolute concentration theoretically a low variation of the normalized abundances the proportion of a metabolite to whole metabolome suggests a conserved proportion based on a positive correlation of absolute concentrations between a single metabolite and the entire metabolome in this study only 24 metabolites were quantified which is a select portion of the metabolome however the overall lower cvs of the normalized abundance than absolute concentration in fig 3 implies that metabolomic homeostasis under ambient condition is not only for absolute concentration regulation but also for proportional regulation fig 3 and fig s1 as such the selected metabolites represent several biochemical pathways that when perturbed can be detected the bews requires a defined range of normal responses to contrast with an observed real time response bownik 2017 thus smaller deviation in the control reference data set is beneficial because it provides a consistent baseline and higher contrast capability the smaller cvs of normalized abundances as compared to absolute concentrations of metabolites for four days under ambient conditions demonstrate the advantage of normalized abundance calculation of metabolites based on the bews framework the list of metabolites with high consistency in abundance change with time and day fig s1 requires further studies with higher number of samples and stresses to test the potential of these metabolites as an environmental bioindicators hourly metabolite abundance regulation between days displayed similar patterns and different similarities for select metabolites including proline fig 4 the discovery of conserved periodicity under ambient regulation of the metabolome such as circadian rhythm has been reported for many species dallmann et al 2012 millius and ueda 2017 however the daily time course regulation of the metabolome has never been reported for daphnia the pattern similarity was limited for a small number of metabolites in this study and the number of biological replicates was also limited nevertheless the observation of metabolomic periodicity in d magna is promising but requires further study to evaluate pattern analysis as a data contrast tool for application of metabolomic parameter to bews and is consistent with the rhythmic expression of clock genes in d pulex reported bernatowicz et al 2016 4 3 metabolites potentially usable as environmental bioindicators in bews sensitive responses of adenosine monophosphate regulation to nutrition conditions table 1 and fig 5 provides an example of a potential environmental bioindicator applicable to biomonitoring such as in the bews adenosine monophosphate is directly related to the energy status of a living organism as it is in balance with the energy storage molecule adenosine triphosphate hardie 2011 in cells adenosine triphosphate is generated during cellular respiration and broken down to release energy with a conversion to its precursor adenosine monophosphate hardie 2011 thereby continuous nutrition supply is required to maintain the balance consistently as observed from the relatively consistent time regulation of adenosine monophosphate during the four days of ambient conditions in this context the dramatic change in adenosine monophosphate fig 5 is due to the disruption of the metabolic balance by delayed adenosine triphosphate synthesis with starvation for application to bews the observed responses of adenosine monophosphate to the starvation stress suggest that a metabolite marker chosen based on known stress response observations appears to be potentially useful for water quality monitoring additional parameters providing mechanistic insight to the ambient metabolite variation such as adenosine monophosphate indicating disruption of metabolic balance would compensate for false alarm possibility in bews false pollution detection is of concern for successful data translation of bews because highly sensitive parameters are sometimes unwantedly affected by ambient variation such as temperature or organic matter changes van der schalie et al 2001 as nutritional condition changes are expected as one of sources of the potential false alarms in bews metabolites responsive to the nutritional changes in this study are candidates of the biological parameters applicable to bews table 1 figs s2 and s3 as functions and interactions of metabolites are established within a database wishart et al 2017 the application of metabolite markers to the bews provides a benefit for mechanistic explanation on observed ambient variations therefore the metabolites that are quickly responding to the starvation stress in this study including adenosine monophosphate should be studied further for validation as bioindicators in the bews in the present study propranolol differentiated abundance of select metabolites propranolol an emerging pollutant that inhibits neurotransmitter receptor activity has been shown to significantly alter the d magna metabolome wagner et al 2017 however previous metabolomic studies with a single time monitoring point did not include a low exposure level of 18μg l jeong et al 2018 wagner et al 2017 this low concentration corresponds to the level which does not show any consistent symptoms such as neonate abnormality reproduction and growth but does exhibit a harmful impact on cardiac function in d magna which results in antagonism of β adrenergic receptors specifically targeted by propranolol jeong et al 2015 therefore the rapidly observed metabolomic fluctuation with 18μg l propranolol exposure fig 6 signifies both high sensitivity and physiological relevance of the time course monitoring approach the rapid dysregulation of leucine and isoleucine the branched chain amino acids is consistent with a previous report which observed an increase in the branched chain amino acids 3 h after beta blockage in plasma of cirrhotic patients eriksson and söderman 1992 based on the present and previous studies reporting changes in branched chain amino acids abundance further studies on bioindicator potential of these metabolites to propranolol exposure should be studied further and include a diverse range of aquatic species and pollutants with similar and dissimilar toxic modes of action taken together a heat map integrating all the metabolomic observations in fig 7 demonstrates sensitivity and selectivity of metabolomic responses to environmental quality changes including a starvation and pollutant exposures the detection of highly distinguishable regulation of metabolites in different environmental conditions demonstrates the high utility and potential of using metabolomic markers in bews bews is based on simple but fundamental ecotoxicological theory that biological activity of indicator species is differentiated by exposure to pollutants bownik 2017 metabolomic regulation is a function of the indicator species and is associated with organism health furthermore how metabolite concentrations vary is considered as a sensitive and mode of action specific response to environmental stresses poynton et al 2011 the methods and observations of this study may also serve as fundamental findings for ecotoxicity and motivates further studies for application of metabolomic bioindicators to the bews many more endogenous and exogenous factors are potentially related to the metabolite concentration regulation in d magna and the sensitivity of biological endpoints should be dependent on a type of pollutant based on different toxic modes of action further studies using wider range of conditions and pollutants with a variety of mode of actions would further improve application of the d magna metabolome data to the bews to be applied to field monitoring of bews many challenges remain including difficulty for selection of specific metabolite endpoints optimal data analysis strategies and the limited sample size for metabolite quantification this study has identified select metabolites as bioindicator candidates for specific types of water quality changes including adenosine monophosphate for nutritional depletion and branched chain amino acids for propranolol exposures as this study involved a limited number of metabolites further studies with more metabolic endpoints and inter lab and field validation should be performed to improve the confidence of the proposed bioindicators the methodologies applied in this study can be easily adapted and used in a wide range of future studies data analysis strategies are another consideration however the methods used in metabolomics are not necessarily different from the bews jeon et al 2008 multiple normalization methods need to be tested before determining the optimal algorithm for metabolite response quantification as a higher contrast capacity was observed with the calculated normalized abundance rather than the absolute concentration furthermore hourly monitoring may be challenging to implement and less frequent routine metabolite monitoring or on demand metabolite monitoring may be more practical when including the complementary role of metabolite measurements in combination with the traditional bews endpoints used for water quality monitoring 5 conclusions in this study we highlight and discuss both positive and negative implications regarding the applicability of d magna metabolome data to bews and the potential to use this sensitive tool in biomonitoring programs that are based on the bews framework specific d magna ages for the metabolic variation and regulation monitoring was suggested of 8 days old for matured individuals detectability of nutritional condition changes was observed based on the most distinguishable contrast between ambient and starved conditions propranolol exposures were also found to significantly alter metabolite abundances finally these observations collectively demonstrate the high sensitivity of the d magna metabolome with changes in water quality and in the presence of environmental stresses these findings highlight the immense value of time course d magna

18459,the inclusion of omics data into water quality monitoring programs is being considered to help alleviate the growing threat to water resources and ecosystem services despite the increasing need the biological early warning system bews the widely used real time water quality monitoring system does not currently incorporate omics information despite that metabolomics is a highly sensitive indicator of organism health and stress we examined daphnia magna metabolomics which is the analysis of small molecules in living d magna as a potential water quality parameter for incorporation in the bews the concentrations of 24 metabolites were measured with changes in water quality and variation of metabolite abundances was compared within and between conditions age dependent monitoring revealed that matured individuals older than 8 days are appropriate model organisms for monitoring based on their low metabolomic variation as compared to younger daphnids hourly monitoring of metabolic variability and regulation under ambient and starved conditions demonstrated the rapid and sensitive detection of nutritional changes moreover the metabolomic dysregulation due to exposure to the pollutant propranolol was also observed by integrating all the observations we found that the d magna metabolome is a sensitive and useful parameter for detecting water quality changes and how these alter the function of keystone organisms as such this metabolomics based framework is applicable to bews and highlights the beneficial advantages of integrating biomolecular and apical endpoint observations for enhanced performance in biomonitoring programs graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality monitoring metabolomics time course monitoring 1 introduction with increasing pollution risk and shifts in nutrients grimm et al 2008 the development of a sensitive and rapid water quality monitoring tool is needed to manage and secure water resources and the services that these ecosystems provide the biological early warning system bews is a real time monitoring tool which has been successfully applied for the rapid detection of sudden water quality changes in various water resources bae and park 2014 the system quantifies multiple biological responses of caged organisms in a time series manner and defines whether the test organism is under contamination stress to predict water quality bae and park 2014 currently biological parameters of macro biota used in bews are mostly limited to physical responses of indicator species such as movement bownik 2017 as such there is potential to incorporate more recent methods of assessing how changes in water quality can alter the health of water dwelling organisms rapid advances in omics technology have improved the sensitivity of biomolecular analysis for the detection of subtle changes in living organisms santos et al 2018 omics technologies such as genomics transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics are used extensively to investigate molecular level impacts to environmentally relevant organisms which are not detected by traditional biological endpoints beale et al 2017 santos et al 2018 the molecular level responses are detected rapidly before the apical endpoints due to various environmental changes villeneuve et al 2014 therefore the integration of omics with the bews may potentially provide rapidness as well as sensitivity to environmental quality monitoring to our knowledge there have not been any studies that evaluate the potential integration of omics within the framework of the bews the bews uses time course monitoring unlike studies that have tried to include omics to water quality assessment with a single time point monitoring approach beale et al 2017 metabolomics which is the analysis of small molecule metabolites in living organisms is a sensitive and promising tool to study environment organism interactions poynton et al 2011 metabolomic studies have shown the capability to detect disruption by low level sub lethal pollution and to provide mechanistic insights on toxicity mechanisms using keystone indicator species such as daphnia magna poynton et al 2011 kariuki et al 2017 the high sensitivity to environmental change offers immense potential as an environmental quality parameter for the bews alternatively the metabolome of a living organism is regulated by environmental variation even under ambient conditions such as diurnal changes or nutritional fluctuations dyar and eckel mahan 2017 high variation in the metabolome could prevent the integration of metabolomics data in real time monitoring but these parameters must be tested and constrained as with behavioral parameters which are the most widely accepted parameters in the monitoring system bownik 2017 moreover the high sensitivity of metabolomics to the small changes might contribute to improved understanding of ambient variation which is a cause of false pollution detection in bews van der schalie et al 2001 based on this this study investigates the metabolic variation and regulation of d magna within the framework of bews we targeted 24 metabolites from the d magna metabolome using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and performed comparative analysis of time course metabolic regulation under different conditions firstly different life stages of d magna were monitored and examined for differences between ages subsequently the time series regulation of the targeted metabolites under different conditions days feeding conditions generations and exposures to a model pollutant propranolol was compared to examine differences between the ambient and stressed conditions propranolol was employed at one low and one high sub lethal effective concentration to evaluate the sensitivity of metabolomic responses finally the potential use of metabolomic data was evaluated and discussed as a candidate indicator for water quality assessment in the bews 2 materials and methods 2 1 daphnia magna maintenance daphnids were purchased from ward science and have been cultured consistently based on the following description daphnia magna was cultured based on the guidelines of environment canada environment canada 2000 the culture media was prepared by adding vitamin b12 and selenium to dechlorinated tap water the room temperature was controlled at 22 1 c and the light and dark conditions were maintained as 16 h of day and 8 h of night for all experiments an algae species chlorella vulgaris was provided daily as a nutrient source during the whole daphnid sampling period for every experiment algae was provided at a constant and specific time 4 5 p m to minimize any variation due to feeding schedules 2 2 daphnia magna experiments this study was comprised of three different experiments with different variables and sampling times summarized in fig 1 the first experiment experiment 1 aimed to elucidate the dynamics of metabolic variation and regulation by age and to determine the range of ages with the least variation in metabolite concentrations for this experiment d magna were consistently maintained under ambient conditions and were sampled at a specified time 2 p m on different days for detection of metabolites in neonates and immature daphnids samples were pooled into four replicates 20 10 10 5 3 3 2 2 and 2 daphnids per sample at 1 3 5 8 10 12 15 17 and 19th day after birth to ensure that metabolite concentrations were above quantification limits in the second experiment experiment 2 the ambient regulation of metabolites and the impact of time day and starvation was investigated adult d magna 13 days old were sampled hourly under both ambient and starved conditions for four days days 1 2 7 and 8 and one day day 3 respectively hourly daphnid sampling was performed in triplicate 7 times per day from 10 a m to 4 p m 11 a m 4 p m for day 1 as shown in fig 1 days 1 and 2 were subsequently maintained under ambient conditions to create a starvation stress condition on day 3 the nutrition source c vulgaris was suspended after day 2 and the starved individuals were sampled on day 3 after day 3 daphnids were allowed to recover from the nutritionally stressed conditions for three days where algae was provided under ambient conditions for the last two days days 7 and 8 daphnids were sampled under ambient conditions after the recovery period during the same times to assess the metabolic changes the third experiment experiment 3 examined the impact of propranolol exposure by sampling daphnids in ambient and propranolol exposed conditions at two different concentrations propranolol hydrochloride 99 was purchased from sigma aldrich the experiment 3 was performed at a separate generation of d magna culture propranolol is an emerging pollutant has been detected frequently and is relatively well studied in d magna jeong et al 2015 roberts and thomas 2006 wagner et al 2017 the concentrations of propranolol solutions were 18 μg l and 4350 μg l and correspond to the sub lethal and lethal concentrations in 48 h exposure studies jeong et al 2015 wagner et al 2017 as bews aims to serve as an early warning of water pollution the entire propranolol exposure period was shorter 6 h than the period used in a traditional acute exposure test which is typically 24 or 48 h weber 1991 the hourly d magna sampling started 1 h after the propranolol exposure was initiated and ended after 6 h exposure fig 1 the sampling was performed in six replicates and no lethality was observed during the exposure period 2 3 sample preparation and metabolite extraction after collection individual d magna were rinsed with deionized water followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen the frozen daphnids were stored in 2 ml plastic microtubes at 20 c until metabolite extraction daphnia metabolite extraction methods were adapted from wu et al 2008 with minor modifications solvents and reagents used for metabolite extractions and analyses which included water acetonitrile chloroform and formic acid were all lc ms grade 99 and purchased from fisher scientific standard compounds listed in table s1 were purchased from sigma aldrich fisher scientific alfa aesar bdh chemicals cambridge isotope laboratories inc and bioshop canada inc and were of 98 purity frozen daphnia samples were lyophilized using a freeze dryer subsequently the dried samples were combined with 140 μl of a mixture of methanol and water 5 2 v v ratio containing the internal standards used for metabolite quantification table s1 the samples were then homogenized using a motorized pellet pestle fisher scientific and 50 μl of water and 100 μl of chloroform were added to the tissue homogenate chloroform was used to purify the polar extract of water and methanol mixture by isolating the lipophilic contents from the tissue extract the homogenates were sonicated for 10 min after sonication the samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 c and 12500 rpm the supernatant was then diluted with water 20 times and filtered using a syringeless filter mini prep whatman before analysis by lc coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer all extraction procedures were performed on ice to preserve sample integrity 2 4 metabolite quantification using lc ms ms metabolites were selected based on accepted and published methods used in metabolomics wei et al 2010 the metabolites measured in this study are also indicative of dynamic changes to d magna biochemistry and health zhang et al 2017 metabolite quantification was performed using a lc ms ms system agilent 6420a triple quadrupole ms with 1260 lc system equipped with ultra aq c18 column 3 μm x 100 mm 4 6 mm electrospray ionization esi was employed in a polarity switching mode for both positive and negative ion modes with multiple reaction monitoring mrm for targeted metabolite quantification table s1 mobile phases were water and acetonitrile 0 1 formic acid was added to both mobile phases and a flow rate of 0 5 ml min was used lc separation was performed using a gradient program of 5 acetonitrile at 0 min which reached 40 60 80 and 5 at 5 6 9 and 10 min respectively followed by 10 min of equilibrium time the parameters for lc ms ms were as follows drying gas temperature of 300 c drying gas flow rate of 6 l min nebulizer pressure of 15 psi and capillary voltage of 4000 v calibration curves for metabolite quantification were generated using standards at 5 to 11 consecutive concentration points with r2 values ranging from 0 9935 to 0 9998 for quality control standard samples at a low and high level of calibration were chosen and analyzed in 5 replicates for accuracy and precision measurements recovery rates of the metabolite extraction procedure were also measured by extracting a sub set of samples n 6 where known standard concentrations were added before the extraction accuracy was observed within 80 120 and precision was less than 20 of the relative standard deviation parameters including accuracy precision limit of quantification and recovery rates are listed in table s2 to correct for the range of extraction recovery for different metabolites a mixture of internal standards were added to the tubes containing daphnid samples before the extraction all of samples quantified for metabolites had signal to noise ratio of integrated peaks higher than 10 blanks were run after every 20 sample runs to check for sample carry over which was not detected 2 5 quantification of propranolol in exposure media using lc ms ms the dissolved concentrations of propranolol in exposure solutions were confirmed table s3 by lc ms ms analysis equipped with zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 1 8 μm x 50 mm 2 1 mm an external standard was used for propranolol concentration quantification in detail the propranolol was eluted from the column with the isocratic flow of mobile phase of water and acetonitrile 30 70 containing 0 1 formic acid in both mobile phases the analytical separation was performed for 5 min at 1 ml min flow rate esi positive mode was applied and the precursor and product ions monitored were 260 and 183 respectively the parameters for lc ms ms analysis were as follows drying gas temperature of 300 c drying gas flow rate of 11 l min nebulizer pressure of 45 psi and capillary voltage of 1000 v 2 6 data analysis the measured metabolite absolute concentrations in each daphnid were calculated based on internal standard method using agilent mass hunter software version b 08 00 in addition to the absolute concentration which indicates absolute abundance the normalized abundance of a metabolite was calculated by dividing the absolute concentration by the total concentration of all the metabolites observed per daphnid the normalized abundance is dependent on concentrations of the other metabolites therefore the calculated normalized abundance provides additional biological insight than absolute concentration alone which is independent of concentrations of the other metabolites principal component analysis pca was performed to identify age dependent variation of metabolite abundance and find a range of ages with the smallest variation fig 2 in the pca scores plots the clusters of samples are based on data similarity and the loadings plot illustrates how much each metabolite abundance contributes to the data separation to understand the deviation of metabolite abundances across sampling times under ambient conditions and days in experiment 2 the ratio of standard deviation to mean coefficient of variation cv was calculated for both absolute and normalized metabolite abundances observed in different sampling hours of four ambient days fig 3 fig s1 to compare time regulation between days the absolute and normalized metabolite abundances were rescaled by dividing by daily averages and the full result of abundance comparison between days is shown in figs s2 and s3 fig 4 illustrates metabolites with periodicity in the inter day comparison of the normalized abundance the hourly change of normalized metabolite abundances were compared between ambient and starvation conditions fig 5 in addition to the comparison between ambient and propranolol exposed conditions fig 6 bews requires a control reference data set aquired when the organism is under non stressful conditions to compare with currently aquired response data and define whether the current organism is under stressful or non stressful ambient conditions to evaluate the use of ambient metabolomic data as a control reference data set normalized metabolite abundances under non stressful conditions aquired during experiments 2 and 3 were plotted with data under stressful conditions of starvation and propranolol exposure in the experiments 2 and 3 on one heat map fig 7 all of statistical analyses were performed using r statistical package team 2015 the ggplot2 package was used for graphical material generation wickham 2010 for the comparision of normalized abundance from figs 4 7 the metabolite abundances were rescaled by dividing by daily averages 3 results 3 1 daphnia magna metabolite variation across developmental stages the variation between the normalized abundances of metabolites at different ages were analyzed using pca and are shown in fig 2 the pca scores plot in fig 2a shows that the metabolite abundances in the younger d magna individuals are distinguishable from the older individuals along principal components pcs 1 and 2 both pc1 and pc2 individually explain deviations among developing neonates 1 5 days old and between matured individuals 8 19 days old from the loadings plot of pc1 in fig 2b arginine histidine and lysine are majorly contributing for and negatively correlated with the data separation from 1 to 5 days old in terms of abundance arginine and histidine with lysine consist of half of the targeted metabolites in d magna and their composition rate decreases as d magna grows the pc2 loadings plot indicates that the metabolites lysine tyrosine and adenosine monophosphate are the most differentiated metabolites between the matured individuals 3 2 hourly and daily variation of metabolites under ambient conditions because daphnia adults showed relatively lower metabolomic variation metabolite concentration regulation was monitored hourly under ambient and nutrient limited conditions and compared to assess how time and day and nutritional conditions control metabolic variability using adult daphnids 13 days old to better understand the variation and regulatory characteristics under ambient conditions the variation of metabolite abundances for four ambient days days 1 2 7 and 8 in experiment 2 was calculated as cv as described in the methods section fig 3 shows histograms of cvs of the absolute and normalized abundances across days and times as cv is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean smaller cvs of metabolite abundances across days or hours represent relatively consistent regulation the histograms in fig 3 show that cv is overall lower with normalized abundance than absolute concentration by both of day and time based on the cv heat maps of absolute and normalized metabolite abundances fig s1 it is found that the metabolites conserved low cvs by time is generally with low cvs by days as well for absolute concentration arginine histidine and proline are categorized as the most consistent metabolites with cvs less than 0 37 for normalized abundance cvs of proline lysine arginine valine leucine and isoleucine are less than 0 29 across days and times daily average normalization of the metabolite abundance facilitates inter day comparisons of metabolite abundances by rescaling the daily baselines to the same level 1 from the graphs of inter day regulation comparison figs s2 and s3 a small number of metabolites were discovered to have similar time course regulation patterns in metabolite abundance changes between days fig 4 shows the metabolites with a similar regulation pattern proline is the metabolite showing relatively strong periodicity of time dependent metabolite abundance change among all days fig 4 tyrosine asparagine and glutamine show some similarity over both days fig 4 for example glutamine has a similar time pattern between the 7th and 8th days but not the 1st and 2nd days 3 3 impact of starvation on metabolic variation given the control reference data set of normalized metabolite abundances by the ambient conditions on days 1 2 7 and 8 nutrient stress on the day 3 was contrasted to examine whether metabolite regulation reflects the depletion of nutrient sources in an assumption that the data is analyzed in a real time manner like bews a student s t test was applied to compare the rescaled normalized abundances in the starved day 3 to the control data day 1 2 7 and 8 as results significant differences based on false discovery rate adjusted p value fdr were observed by starvation for select metabolites table 1 this indicates that starvation altered the metabolome more significantly than daily variation under ambient conditions fig 5 displays the example of metabolite abundance regulation differentiated by starvation compared to the regulation in ambient condition all data for absolute and normalized abundance regulation of 24 metabolites are shown in figs s2 and s3 among the metabolites with significantly differentiated variation by starvation table 1 adenosine monophosphate fig 5 was the most quickly frequently and severely dysregulated metabolite 3 4 impact of propranolol exposure daphnids were separately exposed to control media and media containing propranolol at two different concentrations experiment 3 fig 6 illustrates the hourly regulation of normalized metabolite abundances significantly affected fdr 0 05 by propranolol exposures in the hourly comparison between groups exposed to control media and media containing propranolol interestingly three different metabolites were affected by propranolol exposure at different time points and concentrations cysteine leucine and isoleucine show dysregulation at 3 4 h later from the propranolol exposure initiation as described in fig 6 to evaluate the identical contrast approach used in experiment 2 utilizing the previously acquired control reference data for four ambient days in experiment 2 a student s t test was performed to distinguish propranolol exposed or non exposed groups in experiment 3 from the control reference data in experiment 2 table s4 lists fdrs of the student s t tests and shows that not only the propranolol exposed also control media exposed group in experiment 3 have significantly different metabolic regulation compared to the control reference data in experiment 2 as the experiment 2 and 3 were performed in separate generations it seems that generational deviation contributed to the differentiation of the normalized metabolite abundance for more comprehensive data comparison the heat map was generated by combining means of all the observed normalized abundances of this study which was additionally rescaled by daily averages fig 7 the heat map confirms the normalized abundances differentiated by starvation and propranolol exposures as well as generation of d magna culture by integrating all the observed normalized metabolite abundances into a heat map fig 7 the highest and most frequent metabolomic variation was observed under the starvation stress and there are observable variations between propranolol and non propranolol exposed groups as well 4 discussion 4 1 age dependent metabolite profiles and its implication for bews the pca scores plot in fig 2a reveals that the metabolite profile in the younger d magna individuals are distinguishable from the older individuals it is believed that the growth of d magna occurs most sharply from birth to about 6 days chopelet et al 2008 in our culture egg clutches start to be generated from 5 to 6 days old and a first neonate birth typically occurred 2 3 days later once the first reproduction cycle starts the cycle repeats for the entire lifespan of the matured daphnids as such the differentiated metabolite profiles along pc1 and 2 are likely related to neonate development and reproduction capacity of d magna arginine histidine lysine tyrosine and adenosine monophosphate were shown in the loading plots for pc1 and pc2 fig 2b that contribute to data separation richness and significant depletion of arginine histidine and lysine supports that these are fundamental metabolites for intensive maturation and growth other studies have shown that arginine and histidine are functional amino acids which play crucial roles for growth and development for a variety of species ingle 2011 wu et al 2004 a decrease in the abundance of the metabolites during maturation of d magna is comparable to the observation in pieris brassicae which exhibits decreases of arginine histidine and lysine with age lawrence 1990 the contribution of lysine is suspected to be linked to repeated embryogenesis lysine was reported as one of the major essential amino acids for embryonic development for another crustacean homarus gammarus rosa et al 2005 and is one of the most differentiated metabolites for the neonate development period in the present study tyrosine is believed to be related to the molting activity because it is the most predominant amino acid in the exoskeleton of crawfish which is also a crustacean no et al 1989 the change in adenosine monophosphate abundance is likely related to the alteration on energy demands from reproduction and molting cycles hardie 2011 our results are also similar to that reported for another daphnia species daphnia similis where metabolic profiles were observed to be age dependent zhang et al 2017 daphnia magna at different ages has a separate advantage in terms of utility in assays for example the youngest neonate 24 and 48 h is so sensitive to pollutant exposures that it is accepted as a model organism in traditional acute toxicity tests weber 1991 from the perspective of bews application data from the matured individuals with lower deviation is more beneficial as the lower variation under ambient conditions might secure larger contrast of abnormal metabolomic changes by environmental stresses based on the findings from experiment 1 the use of adult d magna is recommended to reduce ambient variation of control data 4 2 overall deviation and daily periodicity of metabolite abundances and its implications for bews comparison of overall variation of metabolite abundance regulation across days and times fig 3 shows lower cv with normalized abundance than absolute concentration theoretically a low variation of the normalized abundances the proportion of a metabolite to whole metabolome suggests a conserved proportion based on a positive correlation of absolute concentrations between a single metabolite and the entire metabolome in this study only 24 metabolites were quantified which is a select portion of the metabolome however the overall lower cvs of the normalized abundance than absolute concentration in fig 3 implies that metabolomic homeostasis under ambient condition is not only for absolute concentration regulation but also for proportional regulation fig 3 and fig s1 as such the selected metabolites represent several biochemical pathways that when perturbed can be detected the bews requires a defined range of normal responses to contrast with an observed real time response bownik 2017 thus smaller deviation in the control reference data set is beneficial because it provides a consistent baseline and higher contrast capability the smaller cvs of normalized abundances as compared to absolute concentrations of metabolites for four days under ambient conditions demonstrate the advantage of normalized abundance calculation of metabolites based on the bews framework the list of metabolites with high consistency in abundance change with time and day fig s1 requires further studies with higher number of samples and stresses to test the potential of these metabolites as an environmental bioindicators hourly metabolite abundance regulation between days displayed similar patterns and different similarities for select metabolites including proline fig 4 the discovery of conserved periodicity under ambient regulation of the metabolome such as circadian rhythm has been reported for many species dallmann et al 2012 millius and ueda 2017 however the daily time course regulation of the metabolome has never been reported for daphnia the pattern similarity was limited for a small number of metabolites in this study and the number of biological replicates was also limited nevertheless the observation of metabolomic periodicity in d magna is promising but requires further study to evaluate pattern analysis as a data contrast tool for application of metabolomic parameter to bews and is consistent with the rhythmic expression of clock genes in d pulex reported bernatowicz et al 2016 4 3 metabolites potentially usable as environmental bioindicators in bews sensitive responses of adenosine monophosphate regulation to nutrition conditions table 1 and fig 5 provides an example of a potential environmental bioindicator applicable to biomonitoring such as in the bews adenosine monophosphate is directly related to the energy status of a living organism as it is in balance with the energy storage molecule adenosine triphosphate hardie 2011 in cells adenosine triphosphate is generated during cellular respiration and broken down to release energy with a conversion to its precursor adenosine monophosphate hardie 2011 thereby continuous nutrition supply is required to maintain the balance consistently as observed from the relatively consistent time regulation of adenosine monophosphate during the four days of ambient conditions in this context the dramatic change in adenosine monophosphate fig 5 is due to the disruption of the metabolic balance by delayed adenosine triphosphate synthesis with starvation for application to bews the observed responses of adenosine monophosphate to the starvation stress suggest that a metabolite marker chosen based on known stress response observations appears to be potentially useful for water quality monitoring additional parameters providing mechanistic insight to the ambient metabolite variation such as adenosine monophosphate indicating disruption of metabolic balance would compensate for false alarm possibility in bews false pollution detection is of concern for successful data translation of bews because highly sensitive parameters are sometimes unwantedly affected by ambient variation such as temperature or organic matter changes van der schalie et al 2001 as nutritional condition changes are expected as one of sources of the potential false alarms in bews metabolites responsive to the nutritional changes in this study are candidates of the biological parameters applicable to bews table 1 figs s2 and s3 as functions and interactions of metabolites are established within a database wishart et al 2017 the application of metabolite markers to the bews provides a benefit for mechanistic explanation on observed ambient variations therefore the metabolites that are quickly responding to the starvation stress in this study including adenosine monophosphate should be studied further for validation as bioindicators in the bews in the present study propranolol differentiated abundance of select metabolites propranolol an emerging pollutant that inhibits neurotransmitter receptor activity has been shown to significantly alter the d magna metabolome wagner et al 2017 however previous metabolomic studies with a single time monitoring point did not include a low exposure level of 18μg l jeong et al 2018 wagner et al 2017 this low concentration corresponds to the level which does not show any consistent symptoms such as neonate abnormality reproduction and growth but does exhibit a harmful impact on cardiac function in d magna which results in antagonism of β adrenergic receptors specifically targeted by propranolol jeong et al 2015 therefore the rapidly observed metabolomic fluctuation with 18μg l propranolol exposure fig 6 signifies both high sensitivity and physiological relevance of the time course monitoring approach the rapid dysregulation of leucine and isoleucine the branched chain amino acids is consistent with a previous report which observed an increase in the branched chain amino acids 3 h after beta blockage in plasma of cirrhotic patients eriksson and söderman 1992 based on the present and previous studies reporting changes in branched chain amino acids abundance further studies on bioindicator potential of these metabolites to propranolol exposure should be studied further and include a diverse range of aquatic species and pollutants with similar and dissimilar toxic modes of action taken together a heat map integrating all the metabolomic observations in fig 7 demonstrates sensitivity and selectivity of metabolomic responses to environmental quality changes including a starvation and pollutant exposures the detection of highly distinguishable regulation of metabolites in different environmental conditions demonstrates the high utility and potential of using metabolomic markers in bews bews is based on simple but fundamental ecotoxicological theory that biological activity of indicator species is differentiated by exposure to pollutants bownik 2017 metabolomic regulation is a function of the indicator species and is associated with organism health furthermore how metabolite concentrations vary is considered as a sensitive and mode of action specific response to environmental stresses poynton et al 2011 the methods and observations of this study may also serve as fundamental findings for ecotoxicity and motivates further studies for application of metabolomic bioindicators to the bews many more endogenous and exogenous factors are potentially related to the metabolite concentration regulation in d magna and the sensitivity of biological endpoints should be dependent on a type of pollutant based on different toxic modes of action further studies using wider range of conditions and pollutants with a variety of mode of actions would further improve application of the d magna metabolome data to the bews to be applied to field monitoring of bews many challenges remain including difficulty for selection of specific metabolite endpoints optimal data analysis strategies and the limited sample size for metabolite quantification this study has identified select metabolites as bioindicator candidates for specific types of water quality changes including adenosine monophosphate for nutritional depletion and branched chain amino acids for propranolol exposures as this study involved a limited number of metabolites further studies with more metabolic endpoints and inter lab and field validation should be performed to improve the confidence of the proposed bioindicators the methodologies applied in this study can be easily adapted and used in a wide range of future studies data analysis strategies are another consideration however the methods used in metabolomics are not necessarily different from the bews jeon et al 2008 multiple normalization methods need to be tested before determining the optimal algorithm for metabolite response quantification as a higher contrast capacity was observed with the calculated normalized abundance rather than the absolute concentration furthermore hourly monitoring may be challenging to implement and less frequent routine metabolite monitoring or on demand metabolite monitoring may be more practical when including the complementary role of metabolite measurements in combination with the traditional bews endpoints used for water quality monitoring 5 conclusions in this study we highlight and discuss both positive and negative implications regarding the applicability of d magna metabolome data to bews and the potential to use this sensitive tool in biomonitoring programs that are based on the bews framework specific d magna ages for the metabolic variation and regulation monitoring was suggested of 8 days old for matured individuals detectability of nutritional condition changes was observed based on the most distinguishable contrast between ambient and starved conditions propranolol exposures were also found to significantly alter metabolite abundances finally these observations collectively demonstrate the high sensitivity of the d magna metabolome with changes in water quality and in the presence of environmental stresses these findings highlight the immense value of time course d magna metabolomics as potential parameter in the bews and the utility of time course metabolomics in water quality biomonitoring programs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
