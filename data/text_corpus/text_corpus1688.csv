8440,study region sub saharan africa study focus water resources availability assessments are highly uncertain due to inadequate observation networks and this is expected to get worse into the future this uncertainty is expected to increase in the future due to climate environmental population and other socio economic development changes new hydrological insights for this region this paper argues for a coordinated effort to provide improved water resources information by water scientists both within the region and from outside it further proposes a unified approach based on hydrological modelling that incorporates realistic measures of uncertainty and that can be applied to the region as a whole using a common methodology the concept is designed to make the best use of all available data sets including local observations as well as emerging global data the suggested approach has scientific credibility based on previous studies is technically feasible and offers a range of long term benefits the overall conclusion is that without a project of this type water resources planning and management decisions in the region will continue to be based on inadequate information and unquantified uncertainties keywords sub saharan africa water resources assessments hydrological modelling uncertainty 1 introduction according to the un the population of sub saharan africa could rise from approximately 1 billion people in 2015 to almost 2 2 billion in 2050 un 2017 coupled with anticipated increases in temperature and uncertain changes in rainfall patterns conway et al 2015 there is a high potential of future threats to water security for people agriculture schuol et al 2008 power generation and the environment vörösmarty et al 2010 the region as a whole may appear to have adequate water resources based on indicators that use long term mean annual runoff data however there are large differences in access to adequate water resources across the region and there are parts of the region where the degree of inter annual variability conway et al 2009 ngcobo et al 2013 is so high that mean values are of little use in estimating the real availability of water resources for example the baseline water stress index from wri aqueduct https www wri org applications maps aqueduct atlas accessed on 31 jan 2019 uses mean annual runoff data from gldas https ntrs nasa gov archive nasa casi ntrs nasa gov 20120010316 pdf accessed on 31 jan 2019 however wri aqueduct also includes information on inter annual variability which improves the value of the total information package one mitigating factor noted by bonsor et al 2011 is that some parts of the sub continent are reliant on groundwater supplies that are less vulnerable to climate change however increased pressure on these supplies for domestic and subsistence agriculture purposes due to population growth could increase the level of vulnerability during early 2018 cape town faced a potential water supply disaster partly associated with a long term drought possibly climate change related otto et al 2018 but also caused by population growth and a lack of foresight in the planning of water supply infrastructure arguably many other cities and rural areas of sub saharan africa could face similar crises in the future https news nationalgeographic com 2018 02 cape town running out of water drought taps shutoff other cities accessed on 31 jan 2019 added to the threats related to the availability of water now and into the future is the fact that large parts of the region are poorly monitored in terms of both hydro climate variables rainfall evaporation surface and ground waters etc as well as water use information and this situation is worsening as hydro meteorological networks continue to decline worldwide stewart 2015 even where for example stream flow gauges do exist there are frequent problems with rating curves gaps in the data or there is little quantitative information about the extent of water use during the period of gauging jarsjö et al 2012 thus many water resources development decisions are necessarily taken with data that are either unreliable inaccurate or just simply absent some of these problems are caused or exacerbated by the limited technical capacity largely associated with inadequate funding within many of the regions national and regional water management agencies hughes 2012 one of the consequences is that the technical designs for a large proportion of water resources development schemes are undertaken by consultants from outside the region which does little to develop local capacity and does not improve the future sustainability of water management as the local agencies are generally unable to build on or modify the development designs to cater for future changes in demand climate or any other factors affecting the schemes there have been a number of initiatives in the quite recent past that have been designed to improve the water management capabilities of parts of the region these include the establishment of the sadc southern africa development community water sector http www sadc int sadc secretariat directorates office deputy executive secretary regional integration infrastructure services sadc water sector as well as a number of transboundary water commissions such as the orange senqu river commission orasecom http wis orasecom org accessed on 29 01 2018 the limpopo watercourse commission limcom http www limpopo riverawarenesskit org accessed on 29 01 2018 the okavango river basin water commission okacom http www okacom org accessed on 29 01 2018 and the zambezi watercourse commission zamcom http zambezicommission org newsite accessed on 29 01 2018 orasecom represents an example of where the importance of adequate data to support management decisions has been clearly recognized and this is clearly evident by the inclusion of a water information system as part of their web site this represents a very comprehensive package of water management related data and the hydrology data are a combination of observed records and simulated data arguably the wealth of information for the orasecom example is related to the long history of regional water resources assessments in south africa also covering lesotho and swaziland starting as long ago as 1977 and culminating in the most recent assessment wr2012 http waterresourceswr2012 co za accessed on 29 01 2018 one of the strengths of this approach is the use of a hydrological model the pitman model pitman 1973 to simulate natural stream flows for 1 946 sub basins varying in size from less than 100 km2 to over 5 000 km2 covering the total area covered existing model setups were therefore available to support the information requirements for the majority of the orange senqu basin what is not clear is whether or not orasecom has the capacity to update these simulations and the information content of its water information system into the future when many changes land use water use and climate are expected to occur there have also been previous studies that have attempted to provide water resources estimates for the region as a whole based on a combination of modelling and observed data unesco 1997 and 2004 schuol et al 2008 mcnally et al 2017 but these typically fall short of the requirements for future water management for different reasons the model setups may not be available for updating and future scenario planning to the practitioners in the region the spatial resolution of the data may be too coarse or not orientated towards basin management units or they simply do not account for some aspects e g details of existing water use of the present day hydrology of the sub basins the inescapable conclusion is that the current situation with respect to future management of water resources for large parts of the region is very uncertain and that interventions are required to both quantify and reduce this uncertainty and to establish a sustainable basis for improved water management this uncertainty stems from the lack of one or more of the following prerequisites that are considered necessary to be able to quantitatively understand the availability of water resources and to make decisions into the future i lack of integration of the data necessary climate stream flow land and water use data etc for assessing water availability in both gauged and ungauged sub basins ii lack of familiarity with or ability to access and process global data sets that can be useful in supporting the relatively scarce local data in water resources assessment studies iii lack of an installed water resources modelling system to be able to estimate water resources availability in ungauged sub basins both now and into the future iv lack of capacity or lack of access to the expertise required to update modelling systems and interpret the results this paper therefore offers a perspective on how these lacks can be addressed and proposes a regional water resources assessment based on a common water resources assessment modelling approach this perspective is based on many years of experience of hydrological modelling and water resources assessment in the region as well as many discussions with scientists and practitioners from within and outside the region one of the key issues that will be highlighted is that water resources assessments in data scarce regions will always be uncertain even if one of the future focus areas is to improve monitoring and data collection and reverse the general decline in observation networks stewart 2015 it can take many years before new hydro meteorological stations can provide enough data to adequately represent patterns of variability particularly when the variability is non stationary milly et al 2008 it is therefore important that the common approach includes measures of uncertainty pappenberger and beven 2006 ivanović and freer 2008 and guidelines for incorporating them into the overall decision making process korteling et al 2012 matrosov et al 2013 pienaar and hughes 2017 this is by no means the first time a project of this nature has been proposed wrc sadc 2001 but unfortunately previous proposals were not implemented 2 structure of a possible intervention while it may be somewhat presumptuous to suggest a project structure without inputs from likely funding agencies or the national hydrological services and water management agencies fig 1 provides one possible structure that is largely based on the technical requirements of the project discussed later the top management part of the structure is therefore only loosely defined but includes two main elements that are considered essential to the credibility and success of a project of this type the first is the need for an independent international review team who can assess the scientific credibility of the project while the second is the need for a regional steering committee whose task would be to ensure that the needs and interests of the national water management agencies as well as the trans boundary basin commissions are being addressed by the project the second level of the proposed structure is made up of a number of teams divided up into thematic teams focused on key technical issues common to all countries and core modelling teams focused on generating the model simulation results for individual countries or groups of countries the thematic areas include data collection collation and processing spatial historical hydro climate data and climate change data and these teams are expected to facilitate access to global data to assist the country teams in quantifying the required model forcing and validation data the other thematic areas are focused on training other project members and future users of the project outputs and it software support the core modelling team responsibilities would be the main modelling tasks plus facilitating access to local hydro climate water use and water infrastructure reservoirs and transfer schemes data it is essential that the core modelling teams should work as closely as possible with the national hydrometric services one possible approach to achieving the latter objective as well as to include a training component is to offer short term 3 6 months internships during the project duration that targets individuals employed in state or transboundary water management agencies the internships would be designed to offer training in both the details of the modelling approach and the use of the outputs for practical purposes the final level of the structure refers to the teams that will provide future support technical training etc to the national and regional water management agencies it is assumed that the establishment of these teams will be a key issue right from the start of the project as they will be critical to the future sustainability of the project outcomes it is also assumed that they will be established within the region i e university research groups state research agencies or local consulting companies this implies that the level of local participation in all of the technical implementation teams but particularly the country teams should be as high as possible the balance between local and non local participation in the various technical teams is difficult to prescribe it is inevitable that the project will benefit from contributions from highly experienced groups and individuals located outside the region and that these will be essential to the success of the project however the key point is that all of the data techniques methods models and software whether existing or developed as part of the project that are utilized to achieve the aims of the project should be properly established and remain within the region this should be a fundamental non negotiable principle underlying the project terms of reference and will inform the way in which all of the technical teams will need to be structured 3 a proposed methodology the basis of the proposed methodology is the use of a common hydrological model to simulate time series of hydrological data primarily stream flow and ground water recharge under natural and impacted conditions that are long enough to represent inter annual variability the model should have been previously demonstrated to be appropriate for simulating the natural hydrology and water resources availability of the region should be able to incorporate uncertainty assessments and should use software that is freely available an additional consideration is the amount of existing experience of the use of the model within institutions located in the region the motivation for a common modelling approach is related partly to the benefits of shared experience and understanding and partly with the efficiency advantages associated with using common data input procedures the proposed model is a version of the pitman monthly time step semi distributed rainfall runoff model pitman 1973 that has been updated on a regular basis and has seen wide use within the region over the last several decades summarized in hughes 2013 one version of the model is currently implemented as a flexible uncertainty model within a more general water resources modelling framework spatsim hughes and forsyth 2006 https www ru ac za iwr research software accessed on 209 01 2018 that includes a gis interface a generic database structure for storing all types of information relevant to water resources analysis and modelling some standard data analysis and summary facilities and links to several models the main justification for proposing this specific model is based on the frequency and geographical area over which it has been applied in one form or another within the region the fact that the original structural design and subsequent modifications have all been orientated towards the conditions found within the sub saharan africa region as well as the fact that some of the technical developments e g uncertainty approaches have been motivated by the extensive research and practice emanating from more developed parts of the world hughes 2016 the full details of the model and a complete review of its application can be found in the citations included with this paper however the following two sub sections provide some further details of the proposed approach 3 1 scientific credibility fig 2 illustrates the structure of the version of the pitman model used by the institute for water research rhodes university south africa and implemented as part of the spatsim framework it represents a compromise between structural complexity and practical value is semi distributed based on sub basins and uses a monthly time step however it has a relatively large parameter space so that the parameters and outputs reflect the full range of hydrological processes expected to occur in sub saharan river basins this includes not only the main catchment runoff processes typically included in hydrological models but also additional components that are important for understanding water resources availability under natural and modified conditions such as surface water groundwater interactions hughes 2004 river wetland interactions hughes et al 2014 and the impacts of small hughes and mantel 2010 and large reservoirs this large parameter space although frequently criticized jakeman and hornberger 1993 perrin et al 2001 is justified to ensure that the parameters are explicitly associated with the way in which different runoff generation and stream flow propagation processes might be modified by environmental hughes 2015a and development changes in a basin hughes 2013 figs 3 and 4 illustrate the uncertainty framework that is used within the spatsim implementation of the pitman model hughes 2015b and which is broadly based on the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue approach beven and binley 2014 and consists of 2 steps in setting up and running the model the first step is concerned only with the simulation of the natural no development effects incremental sub basin stream flows and is based on generating multiple model outputs typically 5 000 using random samples from the initial parameter range space but constraining the outputs using ranges of hydrological response signatures such as mean monthly discharge groundwater recharge and some percentage points on the flow duration curve this approach has become standard practice amongst many hydrologists worldwide yadav et al 2007 euser et al 2013 westerberg et al 2014 nijzink et al 2016 in attempts to ensure that all parts of a basin are simulated in a behavioural way beven 2012 fig 3 illustrates that the saved parameter sets from the first step are then used in the second step to simulate uncertainty ensembles typically 10 000 for the total basin and all of the sub basin linkages the second step can be applied under natural conditions or under developed conditions where the model components that simulate anthropogenic impacts are included one of the key messages is that from a practical water management perspective the uncertainty range should be realistic and this range is always expected to vary within a basin gauged and well understood sub basins would therefore have low uncertainty while others would realistically have much higher uncertainty ranges reflected in the size of the clouds in the lower part of fig 3 the method accommodates these expected differences which will be reflected by the way in which the hydrological response constraints are quantified fig 4 suggests that the processes of setting up the model and validating the results using any observed information is expected to be iterative fenicia et al 2008 and indicates that future scenarios related to either climate or water use or both can then be generated with the model that was established with historical data two key issues addressed in the next sub section in the application of this approach to different regions of the sub continent are the methods and the data that are available to quantify the hydrological response constraints the pitman model has been applied throughout sub saharan africa in the past while the specific uncertainty approach discussed above has been recently applied in several data scarce areas and has been peer reviewed tumbo and hughes 2015 hughes and gray 2017 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 hughes and mazibuko 2018 it is also being applied in a current royal society uk project designed to update the model simulations for the whole congo river basin tshimanga and hughes 2014 table 1 summarises some of the best model performance statistics that have been achieved across these various studies and includes some recent results for the zambezi river apart from sub basins with suspect gauging data often associated with rating curve problems the worst results are found in semi arid areas with complex spatial variations in both climate and runoff response as well as areas with poorly quantified and often non stationary upstream water or land use impacts identifying such basins is important for the effective allocation of the limited funds that are typically available in the countries of the region for improving hydro meteorological data collection 3 2 technical feasibility technical feasibility covers a range of issues associated with the spatial scale at which the model should be applied the availability of model forcing climate data and regional hydrological response data to implement the 2 step approach summarized in figs 3 and 4 the structure of the project designed to cover the whole region as well as the availability of expertise both within and outside the region to contribute to the project the latter two issues were covered in the previous main section table 2 lists all of the countries and their total areas that are considered to be part of sub saharan africa for the purposes of the proposed project the last two columns list the proposed mean sub basin size and the number of sub basins that would be modelled these are based largely on the south african swaziland and lesotho experience where a regional approach has already been successfully applied wr2012 http waterresourceswr2012 co za the wr2012 data cover a range of sub basin sizes from 100 to 5 000 km2 with the size largely determined by topographic climate and vegetation cover variability the royal society uk funded cruhm project https www researchgate net project congo river user hydraulics and morphology cruhm is updating previous pitman model simulations 90 sub basins of the whole congo basin and this will involve some 400 sub basins the total number of sub basins is therefore expected to be about 9 000 and based on the experience of the institute for water research through staff and student involvement with the application of the model it is likely that a reasonably experienced model user could achieve the initial model set ups and validation against observed data for 2 sub basins a day or 4 500 person days for the whole region this suggests that a total of 8 well trained individuals could complete this part of the project in approximately 3 years table 3 however indicates that some existing model set ups using either the current model version or earlier versions are available and could reduce the total resources needed for the whole region the final number of sub basins in the different countries of the region would clearly need to be informed by the requirements of the national and regional water management agencies but table 2 at least provides an initial guideline part of the above time calculation assumes that the data to force and validate the model rainfall potential evaporation and observed stream flow data have been previously prepared and made available to the modelling team this then becomes an important part of the project technical plan where all available sources of data are compiled prior to starting the model setups for any part of the region these data can include local data from the national hydrometric agencies as well as global data sets of climate groundwater recharge and stream flow as well as supporting information such as topography geology soils and vegetation fortunately there is an ever expanding body of experience of global data sets and their applicability in any given region or for specific purposes unesco 1997 2004 kim and jackson 2012 beck et al 2015 beck et al 2017 martens et al 2017 mcnally et al 2017 these data products and this experience will be invaluable for rapidly generating the necessary forcing data in countries where local data are lacking too short unreliable or inaccessible ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 and tumbo and hughes 2015 represent published examples of where the 2 step method has already been applied and illustrate that the methods used to establish the model constraints will be different across the sub continent previous regional modelling studies unesco 1997 schuol et al 2008 beck et al 2015 may not provide complete regional coverage or do not provide stream flow information at an appropriate resolution for local water management but the outputs from these are expected to be very useful for establishing the regional constraints one of the key advantages of the proposed method is the inherent flexibility in the approaches used to quantify the constraints however this also means that the most suitable approach that leads to the most realistic levels of uncertainty will not always be immediately evident and will require further testing and assessment across the region 4 perceived benefits the primary benefit is a database of hydro climate and water management information combining local and global data based on a combination of observed where it exists and modelled data and incorporating realistic estimates of the uncertainty in this information given the combined effects of changes in population socio economic conditions environment and climate information generated at any one time will become out of date very quickly the proposed project would overcome this problem by providing model set ups that can be updated with either new known forcing information or with information on expected future conditions scenario planning almost all of this model forcing information is currently uncertain and this situation is not likely to change into the future it is therefore essential pappenberger and beven 2006 ivanović and freer 2009 that realistic estimates of the uncertainties involved are included as part of the database and that water managers are trained to incorporate these uncertainties into policy planning and management matrosov 2013 the additional benefit of realistic uncertainty estimates is that they can identify the key sources of uncertainty in different parts of the region and therefore target where investments in data collection or method development should be prioritized in a region where there are many trans boundary river basins and shared water resources saruchera and lautze 2016 tilleard and ford 2016 the benefits of a common approach should be self evident assuming that no countries feel that they have been coerced into using an approach that they do not agree with the common approach suggested here should encourage the development of trust in shared information and allow bordering states to focus on the real policy issues of water sharing rather than arguing over the amounts of water that they have to share between them it is likely that arguments will be presented that a single model and particularly one that uses a monthly time step applied at the spatial scales suggested in table 1 cannot address all of the water management needs of a country this includes issues related to flood management well field design water quality dabrowski 2014 and sediment management ndomba et al 2008 irrigation scheduling hydro power design quantifying environmental flow requirements hughes and louw 2010 etc these arguments are fully accepted and it is not suggested that the pitman model can provide all of the necessary information however it can provide the foundation or baseline information on water availability under natural and developed conditions against which the outputs from more specialized models can be compared in the absence of observed data recent studies have also demonstrated that it is possible to use daily rainfall data to disaggregate monthly simulations from any model to daily time steps for use with such as water quality or sediment yield models hughes and slaughter 2015 slaughter et al 2017 the key benefits of the project are therefore associated with generating this baseline information in a region where a very large proportion of the sub basins are ungauged and therefore where there is currently no information against which to compare the outputs of specialized models the section on project structure fig 1 places a great deal of emphasis on training specifically for scientific and technical staff within the region while there have been successful training initiatives in the region in the past and some of these remain active van der zagg 2005 hughes 2012 most of these have focused on educational qualifications or water and sanitation services delivery skills while this proposed project offers opportunities for highly focused vocational training in water resources assessments as well as future employment in the regions water management sector hughes 2012 noted that the skills of well trained post graduates in the region are often under utilised after they complete their degrees and this is partly related to the continued reliance on expertise from outside the region for water availability assessment projects one of the perceived benefits to the region is therefore the further use and development of this cadre of water engineers and scientists as well as to increase the size of this pool of local expertise the benefits of a common modelling approach also plays a role in this regard as this cadre of specialists will be able to share expertise and experiences and further strengthen the water resources estimation capabilities for the region as a whole 5 potential crticisms risks and failures the greatest risk is almost certainly an inability to attract funding for the project while a related risk is that the region s national governments fail to support the project concept due to competing priorities and a lack of appreciation of the potential value of the project outcomes clearly the funding from whatever source is unlikely to be forthcoming without the latter support a further risk to initiating a project of this type lies in the potential for a lack of acceptance of the benefits of a common approach by the national water management agencies of the region this could stem from suspicions that they are being coerced into adopting methods that they had no part in developing or that they have a preference for other methods that they have previously used a related risk is that some of the national hydro climate data collection agencies are reluctant to fully participate in the project and refuse to release their data for use this will not always be a critical risk as these local data may be replaced with global data however it is likely to increase the level of uncertainty in the model setups and final results it is frequently noted that hydrological models cannot be used to replace monitoring data it could be argued therefore that financial and human resources should be committed to improving the monitoring networks rather than a project designed to establish models however monitoring data can never cover all of the basins and sub basins for which future water resource decisions need to be taken monitoring data alone cannot also account for projections of future conditions related to development effects or environmental change any sustainable water management system will therefore require a combination of monitoring data and established models this paper does therefore not suggest that models can replace data only that they can complement the limited data that is typically available in sub saharan africa there is little doubt that the use of the uncertainty approach increases the time and effort required to complete the modelling tasks for the whole region and there is a risk that this component of the project plan could be rejected due to a lack of understanding and appreciation of the future benefits of such an approach ivanović and freer 2009 this risk would have to be over come by targeted presentations that clearly outline the potential benefits and illustrate how uncertain information can be used in planning and management korteling et al 2012 particularly for future conditions given the well known uncertainties in projections associated with changes in climate population growth and socio economic growth there may be parts of the region where the initial modelling results may not be usable due to a high degree of uncertainty associated with inadequacies in one or more components of the model setup e g forcing data validation data or existing water use data however this does not mean that the model will not be useful in the future in such situations the model results could highlight the need for further data collection and understanding of the local situation which could then contribute to reducing future uncertainties in these situations there is simply too little data or understanding to effectively manage the water resources and no model is likely to be of immediate use however attempts to establish a model will highlight these deficiencies and provide an incentive to improve the understanding through targeted data collection to provide the relevant national water agency with further information to improve the model in the future this issue should be a key component of the training and capacity building components of the project to ensure that the models become a sustainable product that can support national and regional water resources assessments 6 conclusions sustainable water resources management in any region depends on many factors that cross several scientific social economic political and engineering disciplines one of the fundamental factors is the quantification of the available resources and the extent to which they can be exploited in a sustainable manner there is currently no consistent approach used within the sub saharan africa region for quantifying water availability the information requirements for individual development projects tends to be generated on an ad hoc basis using many different approaches and frequently by consultants from outside the region this does not encourage the future development of regional expertise and shared experiences and has the potential to generate conflict in trans boundary basins this paper attempts to convince a wide audience of scientists and practitioners that an alternative approach of using a common methodology is not only scientifically credible and technically feasible but also offers many benefits for the future the title of this paper refers to a future crisis in water resources management in sub saharan africa and part of this crisis is likely to be associated with a lack of adequate information about the availability and variability of the resource it is accepted that information alone cannot avert a future crisis and that the ability to use information is as if not more important as the information itself however it is difficult to imagine how any wisely conceived water management policy can be implemented without adequate information and therefore the proposed approach is designed to supply the foundation upon which other developments can build one issue that has been emphasized throughout the paper is that all information on water resources is and will continue to be uncertain even after the proposed project is completed one of the key aspects of the proposal is that this uncertainty must be appropriately quantified and accounted for during future water management practices ivanović and freer 2009 korteling et al 2012 a personal observation is that many of the recent calls for proposals from international funding agencies for water related projects in sub saharan africa relate to inter alia strengthening management and policy development skills addressing some of the socio economic imbalances in access to water and sanitation or adapting to future climate or other environmental changes while all of these are of course critical issues that need to be addressed for future water resources sustainability in the region they also need to be supported by the availability of adequate information upon which to base policy and management decisions arguably this information does not currently exist in a format or at spatial scales that is adequate to provide the necessary support the key question is therefore whether or not the international and regional communities can be convinced that the proposed project is technically appropriate and that the investment required will provide a long term return in terms of a contribution to sustainable water management the paper has provided some suggestions about how the project could be structured but further inputs are required from key role players in the region to ensure that any investment is justified and that the project outcomes are truly supportive of the needs of the region both now and into the future no real attempt has been made to quantify the level of investment required nor the source of the funding however a very rough estimate suggests that the technical scientific components of the project i e not accounting for some of the costs of project administration the participation of the water management agencies of the 18 countries listed in table 1 and their associated travel costs could be completed over a period of 5 years for a total human resource cost of very approximately 5 million euros this sum includes many of the costs of training regional scientists or water managers in the use of the model and the application of the outputs for practical water resources planning or management purposes given the costs and value of some individual water resources development schemes that are known to be under current consideration as well as the future socio economic costs of unforeseen water supply failures this seems like a relatively insignificant amount

of charge at https www ru ac za iwr research spatsim the software installation includes some training material for both the main spatsim package as well as the implementation of the pitman model all

available on request example applications and model set ups can similarly be made available on request from the author of this paper these example set ups will include all the input climate and parameters and results data associated with running the model subject to any restrictions imposed upon the iwr by the original owners of the data conflict of interest statement there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements the author acknowledges the contributions that have been made to a number of post graduate students drawn from various parts of the region over the last 10 to 15 years without these contributions the amount of experience of applying the pitman model would have been substantially less dr jane tanner a former phd student provided some valuable comments on an earlier draft of the paper many of the developments of the model and the uncertainty approaches used would not have been possible without the inspiration provided wittingly or otherwise by many international colleagues specifically thorsten wagener hubert savenije and keith beven mr david forsyth has provided many years of programming support and without this it is doubtful if the developments of spatsim and the pitman model would have been achieved the applications of the pitman model referred to in this paper have been funded by various sources but i would specifically like to acknowledge the water research commission of south africa as well as the carnegie foundation of new york who funded many of the post graduate students through the regional initiative for science education rise over the

8440,study region sub saharan africa study focus water resources availability assessments are highly uncertain due to inadequate observation networks and this is expected to get worse into the future this uncertainty is expected to increase in the future due to climate environmental population and other socio economic development changes new hydrological insights for this region this paper argues for a coordinated effort to provide improved water resources information by water scientists both within the region and from outside it further proposes a unified approach based on hydrological modelling that incorporates realistic measures of uncertainty and that can be applied to the region as a whole using a common methodology the concept is designed to make the best use of all available data sets including local observations as well as emerging global data the suggested approach has scientific credibility based on previous studies is technically feasible and offers a range of long term benefits the overall conclusion is that without a project of this type water resources planning and management decisions in the region will continue to be based on inadequate information and unquantified uncertainties keywords sub saharan africa water resources assessments hydrological modelling uncertainty 1 introduction according to the un the population of sub saharan africa could rise from approximately 1 billion people in 2015 to almost 2 2 billion in 2050 un 2017 coupled with anticipated increases in temperature and uncertain changes in rainfall patterns conway et al 2015 there is a high potential of future threats to water security for people agriculture schuol et al 2008 power generation and the environment vörösmarty et al 2010 the region as a whole may appear to have adequate water resources based on indicators that use long term mean annual runoff data however there are large differences in access to adequate water resources across the region and there are parts of the region where the degree of inter annual variability conway et al 2009 ngcobo et al 2013 is so high that mean values are of little use in estimating the real availability of water resources for example the baseline water stress index from wri aqueduct https www wri org applications maps aqueduct atlas accessed on 31 jan 2019 uses mean annual runoff data from gldas https ntrs nasa gov archive nasa casi ntrs nasa gov 20120010316 pdf accessed on 31 jan 2019 however wri aqueduct also includes information on inter annual variability which improves the value of the total information package one mitigating factor noted by bonsor et al 2011 is that some parts of the sub continent are reliant on groundwater supplies that are less vulnerable to climate change however increased pressure on these supplies for domestic and subsistence agriculture purposes due to population growth could increase the level of vulnerability during early 2018 cape town faced a potential water supply disaster partly associated with a long term drought possibly climate change related otto et al 2018 but also caused by population growth and a lack of foresight in the planning of water supply infrastructure arguably many other cities and rural areas of sub saharan africa could face similar crises in the future https news nationalgeographic com 2018 02 cape town running out of water drought taps shutoff other cities accessed on 31 jan 2019 added to the threats related to the availability of water now and into the future is the fact that large parts of the region are poorly monitored in terms of both hydro climate variables rainfall evaporation surface and ground waters etc as well as water use information and this situation is worsening as hydro meteorological networks continue to decline worldwide stewart 2015 even where for example stream flow gauges do exist there are frequent problems with rating curves gaps in the data or there is little quantitative information about the extent of water use during the period of gauging jarsjö et al 2012 thus many water resources development decisions are necessarily taken with data that are either unreliable inaccurate or just simply absent some of these problems are caused or exacerbated by the limited technical capacity largely associated with inadequate funding within many of the regions national and regional water management agencies hughes 2012 one of the consequences is that the technical designs for a large proportion of water resources development schemes are undertaken by consultants from outside the region which does little to develop local capacity and does not improve the future sustainability of water management as the local agencies are generally unable to build on or modify the development designs to cater for future changes in demand climate or any other factors affecting the schemes there have been a number of initiatives in the quite recent past that have been designed to improve the water management capabilities of parts of the region these include the establishment of the sadc southern africa development community water sector http www sadc int sadc secretariat directorates office deputy executive secretary regional integration infrastructure services sadc water sector as well as a number of transboundary water commissions such as the orange senqu river commission orasecom http wis orasecom org accessed on 29 01 2018 the limpopo watercourse commission limcom http www limpopo riverawarenesskit org accessed on 29 01 2018 the okavango river basin water commission okacom http www okacom org accessed on 29 01 2018 and the zambezi watercourse commission zamcom http zambezicommission org newsite accessed on 29 01 2018 orasecom represents an example of where the importance of adequate data to support management decisions has been clearly recognized and this is clearly evident by the inclusion of a water information system as part of their web site this represents a very comprehensive package of water management related data and the hydrology data are a combination of observed records and simulated data arguably the wealth of information for the orasecom example is related to the long history of regional water resources assessments in south africa also covering lesotho and swaziland starting as long ago as 1977 and culminating in the most recent assessment wr2012 http waterresourceswr2012 co za accessed on 29 01 2018 one of the strengths of this approach is the use of a hydrological model the pitman model pitman 1973 to simulate natural stream flows for 1 946 sub basins varying in size from less than 100 km2 to over 5 000 km2 covering the total area covered existing model setups were therefore available to support the information requirements for the majority of the orange senqu basin what is not clear is whether or not orasecom has the capacity to update these simulations and the information content of its water information system into the future when many changes land use water use and climate are expected to occur there have also been previous studies that have attempted to provide water resources estimates for the region as a whole based on a combination of modelling and observed data unesco 1997 and 2004 schuol et al 2008 mcnally et al 2017 but these typically fall short of the requirements for future water management for different reasons the model setups may not be available for updating and future scenario planning to the practitioners in the region the spatial resolution of the data may be too coarse or not orientated towards basin management units or they simply do not account for some aspects e g details of existing water use of the present day hydrology of the sub basins the inescapable conclusion is that the current situation with respect to future management of water resources for large parts of the region is very uncertain and that interventions are required to both quantify and reduce this uncertainty and to establish a sustainable basis for improved water management this uncertainty stems from the lack of one or more of the following prerequisites that are considered necessary to be able to quantitatively understand the availability of water resources and to make decisions into the future i lack of integration of the data necessary climate stream flow land and water use data etc for assessing water availability in both gauged and ungauged sub basins ii lack of familiarity with or ability to access and process global data sets that can be useful in supporting the relatively scarce local data in water resources assessment studies iii lack of an installed water resources modelling system to be able to estimate water resources availability in ungauged sub basins both now and into the future iv lack of capacity or lack of access to the expertise required to update modelling systems and interpret the results this paper therefore offers a perspective on how these lacks can be addressed and proposes a regional water resources assessment based on a common water resources assessment modelling approach this perspective is based on many years of experience of hydrological modelling and water resources assessment in the region as well as many discussions with scientists and practitioners from within and outside the region one of the key issues that will be highlighted is that water resources assessments in data scarce regions will always be uncertain even if one of the future focus areas is to improve monitoring and data collection and reverse the general decline in observation networks stewart 2015 it can take many years before new hydro meteorological stations can provide enough data to adequately represent patterns of variability particularly when the variability is non stationary milly et al 2008 it is therefore important that the common approach includes measures of uncertainty pappenberger and beven 2006 ivanović and freer 2008 and guidelines for incorporating them into the overall decision making process korteling et al 2012 matrosov et al 2013 pienaar and hughes 2017 this is by no means the first time a project of this nature has been proposed wrc sadc 2001 but unfortunately previous proposals were not implemented 2 structure of a possible intervention while it may be somewhat presumptuous to suggest a project structure without inputs from likely funding agencies or the national hydrological services and water management agencies fig 1 provides one possible structure that is largely based on the technical requirements of the project discussed later the top management part of the structure is therefore only loosely defined but includes two main elements that are considered essential to the credibility and success of a project of this type the first is the need for an independent international review team who can assess the scientific credibility of the project while the second is the need for a regional steering committee whose task would be to ensure that the needs and interests of the national water management agencies as well as the trans boundary basin commissions are being addressed by the project the second level of the proposed structure is made up of a number of teams divided up into thematic teams focused on key technical issues common to all countries and core modelling teams focused on generating the model simulation results for individual countries or groups of countries the thematic areas include data collection collation and processing spatial historical hydro climate data and climate change data and these teams are expected to facilitate access to global data to assist the country teams in quantifying the required model forcing and validation data the other thematic areas are focused on training other project members and future users of the project outputs and it software support the core modelling team responsibilities would be the main modelling tasks plus facilitating access to local hydro climate water use and water infrastructure reservoirs and transfer schemes data it is essential that the core modelling teams should work as closely as possible with the national hydrometric services one possible approach to achieving the latter objective as well as to include a training component is to offer short term 3 6 months internships during the project duration that targets individuals employed in state or transboundary water management agencies the internships would be designed to offer training in both the details of the modelling approach and the use of the outputs for practical purposes the final level of the structure refers to the teams that will provide future support technical training etc to the national and regional water management agencies it is assumed that the establishment of these teams will be a key issue right from the start of the project as they will be critical to the future sustainability of the project outcomes it is also assumed that they will be established within the region i e university research groups state research agencies or local consulting companies this implies that the level of local participation in all of the technical implementation teams but particularly the country teams should be as high as possible the balance between local and non local participation in the various technical teams is difficult to prescribe it is inevitable that the project will benefit from contributions from highly experienced groups and individuals located outside the region and that these will be essential to the success of the project however the key point is that all of the data techniques methods models and software whether existing or developed as part of the project that are utilized to achieve the aims of the project should be properly established and remain within the region this should be a fundamental non negotiable principle underlying the project terms of reference and will inform the way in which all of the technical teams will need to be structured 3 a proposed methodology the basis of the proposed methodology is the use of a common hydrological model to simulate time series of hydrological data primarily stream flow and ground water recharge under natural and impacted conditions that are long enough to represent inter annual variability the model should have been previously demonstrated to be appropriate for simulating the natural hydrology and water resources availability of the region should be able to incorporate uncertainty assessments and should use software that is freely available an additional consideration is the amount of existing experience of the use of the model within institutions located in the region the motivation for a common modelling approach is related partly to the benefits of shared experience and understanding and partly with the efficiency advantages associated with using common data input procedures the proposed model is a version of the pitman monthly time step semi distributed rainfall runoff model pitman 1973 that has been updated on a regular basis and has seen wide use within the region over the last several decades summarized in hughes 2013 one version of the model is currently implemented as a flexible uncertainty model within a more general water resources modelling framework spatsim hughes and forsyth 2006 https www ru ac za iwr research software accessed on 209 01 2018 that includes a gis interface a generic database structure for storing all types of information relevant to water resources analysis and modelling some standard data analysis and summary facilities and links to several models the main justification for proposing this specific model is based on the frequency and geographical area over which it has been applied in one form or another within the region the fact that the original structural design and subsequent modifications have all been orientated towards the conditions found within the sub saharan africa region as well as the fact that some of the technical developments e g uncertainty approaches have been motivated by the extensive research and practice emanating from more developed parts of the world hughes 2016 the full details of the model and a complete review of its application can be found in the citations included with this paper however the following two sub sections provide some further details of the proposed approach 3 1 scientific credibility fig 2 illustrates the structure of the version of the pitman model used by the institute for water research rhodes university south africa and implemented as part of the spatsim framework it represents a compromise between structural complexity and practical value is semi distributed based on sub basins and uses a monthly time step however it has a relatively large parameter space so that the parameters and outputs reflect the full range of hydrological processes expected to occur in sub saharan river basins this includes not only the main catchment runoff processes typically included in hydrological models but also additional components that are important for understanding water resources availability under natural and modified conditions such as surface water groundwater interactions hughes 2004 river wetland interactions hughes et al 2014 and the impacts of small hughes and mantel 2010 and large reservoirs this large parameter space although frequently criticized jakeman and hornberger 1993 perrin et al 2001 is justified to ensure that the parameters are explicitly associated with the way in which different runoff generation and stream flow propagation processes might be modified by environmental hughes 2015a and development changes in a basin hughes 2013 figs 3 and 4 illustrate the uncertainty framework that is used within the spatsim implementation of the pitman model hughes 2015b and which is broadly based on the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue approach beven and binley 2014 and consists of 2 steps in setting up and running the model the first step is concerned only with the simulation of the natural no development effects incremental sub basin stream flows and is based on generating multiple model outputs typically 5 000 using random samples from the initial parameter range space but constraining the outputs using ranges of hydrological response signatures such as mean monthly discharge groundwater recharge and some percentage points on the flow duration curve this approach has become standard practice amongst many hydrologists worldwide yadav et al 2007 euser et al 2013 westerberg et al 2014 nijzink et al 2016 in attempts to ensure that all parts of a basin are simulated in a behavioural way beven 2012 fig 3 illustrates that the saved parameter sets from the first step are then used in the second step to simulate uncertainty ensembles typically 10 000 for the total basin and all of the sub basin linkages the second step can be applied under natural conditions or under developed conditions where the model components that simulate anthropogenic impacts are included one of the key messages is that from a practical water management perspective the uncertainty range should be realistic and this range is always expected to vary within a basin gauged and well understood sub basins would therefore have low uncertainty while others would realistically have much higher uncertainty ranges reflected in the size of the clouds in the lower part of fig 3 the method accommodates these expected differences which will be reflected by the way in which the hydrological response constraints are quantified fig 4 suggests that the processes of setting up the model and validating the results using any observed information is expected to be iterative fenicia et al 2008 and indicates that future scenarios related to either climate or water use or both can then be generated with the model that was established with historical data two key issues addressed in the next sub section in the application of this approach to different regions of the sub continent are the methods and the data that are available to quantify the hydrological response constraints the pitman model has been applied throughout sub saharan africa in the past while the specific uncertainty approach discussed above has been recently applied in several data scarce areas and has been peer reviewed tumbo and hughes 2015 hughes and gray 2017 ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 hughes and mazibuko 2018 it is also being applied in a current royal society uk project designed to update the model simulations for the whole congo river basin tshimanga and hughes 2014 table 1 summarises some of the best model performance statistics that have been achieved across these various studies and includes some recent results for the zambezi river apart from sub basins with suspect gauging data often associated with rating curve problems the worst results are found in semi arid areas with complex spatial variations in both climate and runoff response as well as areas with poorly quantified and often non stationary upstream water or land use impacts identifying such basins is important for the effective allocation of the limited funds that are typically available in the countries of the region for improving hydro meteorological data collection 3 2 technical feasibility technical feasibility covers a range of issues associated with the spatial scale at which the model should be applied the availability of model forcing climate data and regional hydrological response data to implement the 2 step approach summarized in figs 3 and 4 the structure of the project designed to cover the whole region as well as the availability of expertise both within and outside the region to contribute to the project the latter two issues were covered in the previous main section table 2 lists all of the countries and their total areas that are considered to be part of sub saharan africa for the purposes of the proposed project the last two columns list the proposed mean sub basin size and the number of sub basins that would be modelled these are based largely on the south african swaziland and lesotho experience where a regional approach has already been successfully applied wr2012 http waterresourceswr2012 co za the wr2012 data cover a range of sub basin sizes from 100 to 5 000 km2 with the size largely determined by topographic climate and vegetation cover variability the royal society uk funded cruhm project https www researchgate net project congo river user hydraulics and morphology cruhm is updating previous pitman model simulations 90 sub basins of the whole congo basin and this will involve some 400 sub basins the total number of sub basins is therefore expected to be about 9 000 and based on the experience of the institute for water research through staff and student involvement with the application of the model it is likely that a reasonably experienced model user could achieve the initial model set ups and validation against observed data for 2 sub basins a day or 4 500 person days for the whole region this suggests that a total of 8 well trained individuals could complete this part of the project in approximately 3 years table 3 however indicates that some existing model set ups using either the current model version or earlier versions are available and could reduce the total resources needed for the whole region the final number of sub basins in the different countries of the region would clearly need to be informed by the requirements of the national and regional water management agencies but table 2 at least provides an initial guideline part of the above time calculation assumes that the data to force and validate the model rainfall potential evaporation and observed stream flow data have been previously prepared and made available to the modelling team this then becomes an important part of the project technical plan where all available sources of data are compiled prior to starting the model setups for any part of the region these data can include local data from the national hydrometric agencies as well as global data sets of climate groundwater recharge and stream flow as well as supporting information such as topography geology soils and vegetation fortunately there is an ever expanding body of experience of global data sets and their applicability in any given region or for specific purposes unesco 1997 2004 kim and jackson 2012 beck et al 2015 beck et al 2017 martens et al 2017 mcnally et al 2017 these data products and this experience will be invaluable for rapidly generating the necessary forcing data in countries where local data are lacking too short unreliable or inaccessible ndzabandzaba and hughes 2017 and tumbo and hughes 2015 represent published examples of where the 2 step method has already been applied and illustrate that the methods used to establish the model constraints will be different across the sub continent previous regional modelling studies unesco 1997 schuol et al 2008 beck et al 2015 may not provide complete regional coverage or do not provide stream flow information at an appropriate resolution for local water management but the outputs from these are expected to be very useful for establishing the regional constraints one of the key advantages of the proposed method is the inherent flexibility in the approaches used to quantify the constraints however this also means that the most suitable approach that leads to the most realistic levels of uncertainty will not always be immediately evident and will require further testing and assessment across the region 4 perceived benefits the primary benefit is a database of hydro climate and water management information combining local and global data based on a combination of observed where it exists and modelled data and incorporating realistic estimates of the uncertainty in this information given the combined effects of changes in population socio economic conditions environment and climate information generated at any one time will become out of date very quickly the proposed project would overcome this problem by providing model set ups that can be updated with either new known forcing information or with information on expected future conditions scenario planning almost all of this model forcing information is currently uncertain and this situation is not likely to change into the future it is therefore essential pappenberger and beven 2006 ivanović and freer 2009 that realistic estimates of the uncertainties involved are included as part of the database and that water managers are trained to incorporate these uncertainties into policy planning and management matrosov 2013 the additional benefit of realistic uncertainty estimates is that they can identify the key sources of uncertainty in different parts of the region and therefore target where investments in data collection or method development should be prioritized in a region where there are many trans boundary river basins and shared water resources saruchera and lautze 2016 tilleard and ford 2016 the benefits of a common approach should be self evident assuming that no countries feel that they have been coerced into using an approach that they do not agree with the common approach suggested here should encourage the development of trust in shared information and allow bordering states to focus on the real policy issues of water sharing rather than arguing over the amounts of water that they have to share between them it is likely that arguments will be presented that a single model and particularly one that uses a monthly time step applied at the spatial scales suggested in table 1 cannot address all of the water management needs of a country this includes issues related to flood management well field design water quality dabrowski 2014 and sediment management ndomba et al 2008 irrigation scheduling hydro power design quantifying environmental flow requirements hughes and louw 2010 etc these arguments are fully accepted and it is not suggested that the pitman model can provide all of the necessary information however it can provide the foundation or baseline information on water availability under natural and developed conditions against which the outputs from more specialized models can be compared in the absence of observed data recent studies have also demonstrated that it is possible to use daily rainfall data to disaggregate monthly simulations from any model to daily time steps for use with such as water quality or sediment yield models hughes and slaughter 2015 slaughter et al 2017 the key benefits of the project are therefore associated with generating this baseline information in a region where a very large proportion of the sub basins are ungauged and therefore where there is currently no information against which to compare the outputs of specialized models the section on project structure fig 1 places a great deal of emphasis on training specifically for scientific and technical staff within the region while there have been successful training initiatives in the region in the past and some of these remain active van der zagg 2005 hughes 2012 most of these have focused on educational qualifications or water and sanitation services delivery skills while this proposed project offers opportunities for highly focused vocational training in water resources assessments as well as future employment in the regions water management sector hughes 2012 noted that the skills of well trained post graduates in the region are often under utilised after they complete their degrees and this is partly related to the continued reliance on expertise from outside the region for water availability assessment projects one of the perceived benefits to the region is therefore the further use and development of this cadre of water engineers and scientists as well as to increase the size of this pool of local expertise the benefits of a common modelling approach also plays a role in this regard as this cadre of specialists will be able to share expertise and experiences and further strengthen the water resources estimation capabilities for the region as a whole 5 potential crticisms risks and failures the greatest risk is almost certainly an inability to attract funding for the project while a related risk is that the region s national governments fail to support the project concept due to competing priorities and a lack of appreciation of the potential value of the project outcomes clearly the funding from whatever source is unlikely to be forthcoming without the latter support a further risk to initiating a project of this type lies in the potential for a lack of acceptance of the benefits of a common approach by the national water management agencies of the region this could stem from suspicions that they are being coerced into adopting methods that they had no part in developing or that they have a preference for other methods that they have previously used a related risk is that some of the national hydro climate data collection agencies are reluctant to fully participate in the project and refuse to release their data for use this will not always be a critical risk as these local data may be replaced with global data however it is likely to increase the level of uncertainty in the model setups and final results it is frequently noted that hydrological models cannot be used to replace monitoring data it could be argued therefore that financial and human resources should be committed to improving the monitoring networks rather than a project designed to establish models however monitoring data can never cover all of the basins and sub basins for which future water resource decisions need to be taken monitoring data alone cannot also account for projections of future conditions related to development effects or environmental change any sustainable water management system will therefore require a combination of monitoring data and established models this paper does therefore not suggest that models can replace data only that they can complement the limited data that is typically available in sub saharan africa there is little doubt that the use of the uncertainty approach increases the time and effort required to complete the modelling tasks for the whole region and there is a risk that this component of the project plan could be rejected due to a lack of understanding and appreciation of the future benefits of such an approach ivanović and freer 2009 this risk would have to be over come by targeted presentations that clearly outline the potential benefits and illustrate how uncertain information can be used in planning and management korteling et al 2012 particularly for future conditions given the well known uncertainties in projections associated with changes in climate population growth and socio economic growth there may be parts of the region where the initial modelling results may not be usable due to a high degree of uncertainty associated with inadequacies in one or more components of the model setup e g forcing data validation data or existing water use data however this does not mean that the model will not be useful in the future in such situations the model results could highlight the need for further data collection and understanding of the local situation which could then contribute to reducing future uncertainties in these situations there is simply too little data or understanding to effectively manage the water resources and no model is likely to be of immediate use however attempts to establish a model will highlight these deficiencies and provide an incentive to improve the understanding through targeted data collection to provide the relevant national water agency with further information to improve the model in the future this issue should be a key component of the training and capacity building components of the project to ensure that the models become a sustainable product that can support national and regional water resources assessments 6 conclusions sustainable water resources management in any region depends on many factors that cross several scientific social economic political and engineering disciplines one of the fundamental factors is the quantification of the available resources and the extent to which they can be exploited in a sustainable manner there is currently no consistent approach used within the sub saharan africa region for quantifying water availability the information requirements for individual development projects tends to be generated on an ad hoc basis using many different approaches and frequently by consultants from outside the region this does not encourage the future development of regional expertise and shared experiences and has the potential to generate conflict in trans boundary basins this paper attempts to convince a wide audience of scientists and practitioners that an alternative approach of using a common methodology is not only scientifically credible and technically feasible but also offers many benefits for the future the title of this paper refers to a future crisis in water resources management in sub saharan africa and part of this crisis is likely to be associated with a lack of adequate information about the availability and variability of the resource it is accepted that information alone cannot avert a future crisis and that the ability to use information is as if not more important as the information itself however it is difficult to imagine how any wisely conceived water management policy can be implemented without adequate information and therefore the proposed approach is designed to supply the foundation upon which other developments can build one issue that has been emphasized throughout the paper is that all information on water resources is and will continue to be uncertain even after the proposed project is completed one of the key aspects of the proposal is that this uncertainty must be appropriately quantified and accounted for during future water management practices ivanović and freer 2009 korteling et al 2012 a personal observation is that many of the recent calls for proposals from international funding agencies for water related projects in sub saharan africa relate to inter alia strengthening management and policy development skills addressing some of the socio economic imbalances in access to water and sanitation or adapting to future climate or other environmental changes while all of these are of course critical issues that need to be addressed for future water resources sustainability in the region they also need to be supported by the availability of adequate information upon which to base policy and management decisions arguably this information does not currently exist in a format or at spatial scales that is adequate to provide the necessary support the key question is therefore whether or not the international and regional communities can be convinced that the proposed project is technically appropriate and that the investment required will provide a long term return in terms of a contribution to sustainable water management the paper has provided some suggestions about how the project could be structured but further inputs are required from key role players in the region to ensure that any investment is justified and that the project outcomes are truly supportive of the needs of the region both now and into the future no real attempt has been made to quantify the level of investment required nor the source of the funding however a very rough estimate suggests that the technical scientific components of the project i e not accounting for some of the costs of project administration the participation of the water management agencies of the 18 countries listed in table 1 and their associated travel costs could be completed over a period of 5 years for a total human resource cost of very approximately 5 million euros this sum includes many of the costs of training regional scientists or water managers in the use of the model and the application of the outputs for practical water resources planning or management purposes given the costs and value of some individual water resources development schemes that are known to be under current consideration as well as the future socio economic costs of unforeseen water supply failures this seems like a relatively insignificant amount

of charge at https www ru ac za iwr research spatsim the software installation includes some training material for both the main spatsim package as well as the implementation of the pitman model all

interest acknowledgements the author acknowledges the contributions that have been made to a number of post graduate students drawn from various parts of the region over the last 10 to 15 years without these contributions the amount of experience of applying the pitman model would have been substantially less dr jane tanner a former phd student provided some valuable comments on an earlier draft of the paper many of the developments of the model and the uncertainty approaches used would not have been possible without the inspiration provided wittingly or otherwise by many international colleagues specifically thorsten wagener hubert savenije and keith beven mr david forsyth has provided many years of programming support and without this it is doubtful if the developments of spatsim and the pitman model would have been achieved the applications of the pitman model referred to in this paper have been funded by various sources but i would specifically like to acknowledge the water

8441,study region the northern coast of the monterey bay california usa extending from the coastline to 3 5 km offshore study focus three hundred and twenty line kilometers of airborne electromagnetic aem data were acquired offshore these data spanned 20 km of coastline extending up to 3 5 km offshore in water up to 18 m in depth inversion of these data resulted in resistivity models extending to depths between 50 and 200 m below sea level the data were interpreted in conjunction with onshore monitoring well data hydrologic and geologic reports and electrical resistivity tomography ert data to locate the freshwater saltwater interfaces throughout the region a resistivity to water quality transform was established using well based water quality and resistivity logging measurements for resistivity values that could not be converted to water quality with this transform local auxiliary information was used on a case by case basis to interpret the observed features some low resistivity anomalies were identified near the shore at depth which were interpreted to be artifacts of the 1d assumption in the inversion scheme used for these aem data new hydrogeological insights for this region we found that the acquisition of aem data provided valuable information about water quality in the offshore extents of the aquifers a region inaccessible to traditional monitoring methods but one that plays an important role in the modeling prediction and management of saltwater intrusion keywords saltwater intrusion coastal aquifer airborne electromagnetic aem electrical resistivity tomography ert offshore 1 introduction in coastal regions around the world there is a dynamic interface between fresh groundwater and saline ocean water the location and geometry of a freshwater saltwater interface is dictated by density and pressure gradients within the adjacent water bodies as well as all other hydrogeologic conditions that control subsurface flow in many cases both natural and anthropogenic changes in hydrologic systems have resulted in the interface migrating inland in a process called saltwater intrusion saltwater intrusion can have significant economic and ecological impacts johannes 1980 werner et al 2013 michael et al 2017 and therefore is an important issue in coastal groundwater management with 40 of the global population living within 100 km of the coast ciesin 2012 management of coastal groundwater resources is a critical component of achieving global freshwater security a critical step in the management of coastal groundwater resources is mapping and monitoring the distribution of salinity in the subsurface this is typically accomplished using water quality measurements made in wells but there has been increasing recognition of a need to supplement this method in areas with complicated hydrogeologic conditions or where limited well coverage results in large uncertainty in understanding the extent of saltwater intrusion a specific challenge that we address in this study is the need to map the locations of freshwater saltwater interfaces in the offshore region in areas where modeling suggests the imminent threat of saltwater intrusion but no sampling data are available the focus of this study is to assess the use of an airborne geophysical method as a way to locate freshwater saltwater interfaces in the offshore coastal environment in recent years geophysical methods of imaging the subsurface have been shown to be highly effective for large scale exploration and characterization of the extent of saltwater intrusion in coastal environments two methods in particular that have proven successful are ground based electrical resistivity tomography ert and the airborne electromagnetic aem method these methods provide a measure of subsurface electrical resistivity which is highly sensitive to changes in pore fluid salinity and thus are ideally suited to this application de franco et al 2009 martínez et al 2009 zarroca et al 2011 pidlisecky et al 2015 goebel et al 2017 and others have demonstrated the effectiveness of ert for mapping saltwater intrusion onshore both time domain and frequency domain aem methods have been demonstrated to be useful in imaging onshore saltwater intrusion as shown by fitterman and deszcz pan 1998 teatini et al 2011 gunnink et al 2012 jørgensen et al 2012 and others the aem method has the advantage of being able to give extensive spatial coverage relatively rapidly as well as sample areas difficult or impossible to access with other methods one such area is the offshore coastal environment where the use of monitoring wells is impractical given the high cost of installing underwater wells the presence of the seawater has little logistical impact on the ability to collect aem data but there is concern about the impact of the seawater on the data themselves as such a highly conductive feature at the surface could make it difficult to investigate the structures beneath it the capability of aem data to image beneath shallow saltwater bodies in lagoon and offshore environments has been explored in recent studies kirkegaard et al 2011 pedersen et al 2017 these have found that while there is the expected decrease in depth of investigation beneath the conductive seawater and convergence during inversion of the data to obtain the resistivity model can be difficult aem data can still yield useful information for understanding conditions within the offshore extent of aquifers pedersen et al 2017 for example mapped a freshwater lens extending in the subsurface offshore and were able to image to depths of over 80 m in ocean depths of 20 m off the coast of the netherlands these examples have been successful but with a limited number of such studies there is a need for further research in different hydrogeologic settings to better understand the utility of offshore aem data for mapping and monitoring coastal groundwater resources this study was designed to explore the use of aem data to image the subsurface region from the coastline to a distance of up to 3 5 km offshore along the northern coast of monterey bay california this is a region where all of the aquifers are currently experiencing or are threatened by saltwater intrusion three previous geophysical investigations successfully demonstrated the capability of electrical electromagnetic imaging methods to help resolve the distribution of and hydrogeologic controls on saltwater intrusion in this region long offset ert was used in two studies along the coast of monterey bay pidlisecky et al 2015 goebel et al 2017 and aem data were acquired in the salinas valley gottschalk et al 2018 along much of the northern coast of the bay in the soquel creek area ert data in the goebel et al 2017 study were interpreted to show predominantly freshwater in the top 100 mbsl at the shoreline consistent with measurements made in wells inland in those areas where ert and well data indicated that the aquifers were saturated with freshwater onshore the critical question posed by local groundwater managers and the motivation for this study where are the freshwater saltwater interfaces located within the various hydrogeologic units they could be offshore and or could be deeper than the screened intervals of the wells onshore the goal of this study was to locate the freshwater saltwater interfaces in the santa cruz mid county region by complementing onshore well and ert data with offshore aem data where the aem data were used to map out the variation in water quality in the offshore extent of the groundwater aquifers the findings presented here reveal the complex nature of saltwater intrusion in the region and highlight the ability of the aem method to image these complex features offshore a region difficult to access with well based monitoring methods the findings also demonstrate some challenges of this method in coastal environments while specific findings are unique to this study area the insights gained contribute to the assessment of the aem method for offshore coastal hydrogeologic investigations and to the development of this method for investigating similar coastal systems elsewhere in the world 2 study area the location of the study area here referred to as the soquel creek area is in the monterey bay region of california and is shown in fig 1 c and outlined in black in fig 1a and b with limited surface water resources the monterey bay region depends on groundwater to meet 80 of its freshwater needs california water foundation 2014 during times of drought this percentage can increase in the monterey bay region extensive groundwater extraction has lead to significant saltwater intrusion within some of the actively pumped aquifer units with saltwater water observed in monitoring wells more than 16 km inland at some points monterey county water resources agency 2014 while the soquel creek area has not experienced nearly as much saltwater intrusion as found in areas to the south hydraulic head and water quality measurements suggest that saltwater intrusion is still a significant threat in this area hydrometrics 2017 new legislation in the state of california specifically mandates that groundwater resources be managed so as to avoid significant and unreasonable saltwater intrusion into aquifers california department of water resources 2018 characterizing water quality conditions in the offshore extent of aquifers is critical for fully understanding the hydrogeologic system and planning management strategies to meet these new state requirements in the soquel creek area fig 1a shows the study area and surrounding monterey bay region with the location of the offshore aem data acquired in may 2017 lines of data shown in gray were acquired parallel and perpendicular to the coastline with the former so close together that the separate lines are not visible in the figure three hundred and twenty line km of data were acquired along 20 km of the coastline extending up to 3 5 km offshore in water up to 18 m in depth this figure also shows the locations of other geophysical datasets within the region which will be discussed in this paper including ert in green spanning much of the coastline of the bay goebel et al 2017 and onshore aem data in the salinas valley area gottschalk et al 2018 in gray also collected in may 2017 fig 1b shows other key information for the interpretation and contextualization of these data this includes the mapped extent of saltwater intrusion based on well water quality sampling monterey county water resources agency 2017 pajaro valley water management agency 2018 in the salinas valley area this mapped extent is divided into intrusion into the upper and lower aquifers named the 180 ft and 400 ft aquifers respectively with the more inland boundary being that in the 180 ft aquifer it is important to note that these boundaries only show the extent of intrusion as reported by local agencies as interpolated spatial information some intrusion is known to exist near the coast in the north within our study area but is not reported in a way that can be easily presented in this figure fig 1b also shows a selection of the soquel creek monitoring wells closest to the coast within the study area and the location of the monterey bay aquarium research institute s marine monitoring station c1 mbari 2018 a permanent monitoring location offshore where quarterly seawater chemistry measurements are made fig 1c shows a zoomed in view of just the study area showing the spatial relationship between the aem data ert data and monitoring wells discussed in this paper fig 1c includes the names of the monitoring wells as well as markers along the ert line references in the interpretation of these data the geology of the study area consists of two primary water bearing formations the aromas and the purisima underlain by a granitic basement descriptions of properties of these formations are found in column 2 of table 1 department of water resources 2003 within the study area the purisima formation can be further subdivided into a number of hydrostratigraphic units these units are summarized from shallowest to deepest in column 3 of table 1 the subdivision described in table 1 is taken from the groundwater flow model of the region column 4 of table 1 notes the designation aquifer or aquitard of each of these units in the groundwater model extensive discussion on the technical aspects of this model including how the hydrostratigraphic boundaries were selected and what assumptions went into defining these units can be found in hydrometrics 2015 we compare the new finding in this study to the hydrostratigraphic divisions in this model as they are the boundaries that are used in the management of groundwater within the study area to visualize the hydrogeologic structures views of the groundwater model hydrostratigraphy are shown in fig 2 in fig 2 the plan view shows which unit is closest to the surface this model is extrapolated offshore with the offshore region noted in partially transparent gray two cross sections labeled a a and b b on the plan view show the dip of these units the process of saltwater intrusion is sensitive to pumping recharge and hydrogeologic conditions within the soquel creek region there is significant spatial variation in each of these factors as a result this region is likely to have a complicated pattern of intrusion with the freshwater saltwater interfaces located different distances from the coast in the different hydrostratigraphic units or even within a single hydrostratigraphic unit to date onshore mapping of saltwater intrusion using monitoring wells and coastal ert data shows a complicated distribution of fresh and saltwater in the subsurface as shown in fig 1b the coastal monitoring well network has detected intrusion into the upper aquifers in the southern portion of the study area but not the northern portion of the study area furthermore within the portion of the study area where intrusion has been detected well data suggest that the distance from the coast to which saltwater is found inland varies for the different upper aquifers further details on the spatial and temporal patterns of intrusion within this region can be found in hydrometrics 2017 the critical issue motivating this study was the need to extend the mapping of the freshwater saltwater interfaces offshore where there is currently no data to constrain the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces 3 materials and methods 3 1 aem data acquisition processing and inversion on may 23rd 2017 320 line kilometers of aem data were acquired off the coast of the soquel creek area using the dual moment skytem 304m system this system utilizes hardware suspended beneath a helicopter held 30 m above the ground surface a forward modeling study as well as a ground based time domain electromagnetic pilot study were used to determine the utility of an aem survey in this region and to design the best system configuration for an aem acquisition in this setting these studies motivated the use of an extremely low acquisition repetition frequency allowing the system to collect data from 20 μs to very late time gates 20 ms maximizing the depths the system was sensitive to beneath the conductive seawater layer during data acquisition fifteen lines were flown parallel to the shore with 100 m spacing between lines these were connected with 12 tie lines perpendicular to the shore spaced 1 to 2 km apart data acquisition was predominantly limited to the offshore region for two reasons the offshore was the area of greatest interest for understanding the locations of intrusion interfaces in the study area and because much of the onshore portion of the study area consists of urban development over which data acquisition is not permitted according to federal aviation association regulations the data were both automatically and manually processed to remove noisy data minimal processing was required as the conductive seawater and saturated sediments provided a large signal due to the high electromagnetic response from the conductive seawater and the sediments beneath the seafloor even the very late time gates showed signals well above the noise floor additionally the majority of these data were acquired offshore away from common noise sources such as power lines this resulted in high quality data with a high signal to noise ratio throughout this study we have employed the 1d form of aem data inversion an approach that assumes that the subsurface electrical resistivity varies with depth but is laterally uniform this assumption is generally considered appropriate as long as layers do not dip more than 30 auken 2018 the spatial correlation between the data was taken into account using 3d spatial constraints on the 1d inversions this approach is computationally efficient for large datasets such as this one and is well suited to hydrologic applications one limitation of this approach however is an inability to resolve sharp resistivity contrasts across vertical boundaries where the 1d assumption is not valid as shown in heagy et al 2018 1d inversion of data in environments with abrupt lateral changes in resistivity can result in poor resolution of the true resistivity and can introduce artifacts into the final resistivity models along the shoreline where freshwater extends offshore resulting in sharp lateral changes in resistivity between the ocean and the freshwater saturated sediments we observed that the 1d model response had difficulties in fitting the actual measured data which created some model artifacts the data were inverted in aarhus workbench using a 22 layer spatially constrained inversion averaging of the data resulted in a 1d model of the variation in electrical resistivity with depth every 17 m along the flight lines model layer thickness starts at 0 8 m at the surface and increases with depth with a final thickness of 40 m at 200 m depth the maximum depth at which electrical resistivity values were determined the thin layers at the surface were used to ensure that the thickness of the seawater which ranges between 0 and 18 m thick along the offshore flight lines could be modeled as accurately as possible while using a fixed layer thickness inversion this was critical for the inversion of these data as seawater is significantly more conductive than any other material expected to be present in this study area and therefore should produce a large measured signal wherever it was present it was not necessary to constrain the resistivity of the seawater layer within the inversion the final inversion resulted in a data residual a noise normalized rmse between the measured and calculated data of 0 545 this value is below 1 meaning that the data were fit within the noise level the depth of investigation doi is defined as the depth to which models resulting from the inversion of geophysical data can be considered reliable the doi for each of the models was determined using the method outlined in vest christiansen and auken 2012 a universal cumulative sensitivity threshold of 0 1 was applied to determine the doi this is considered the standard threshold in the aarhus workbench software using this threshold the sensitive region of the dataset extends between 50 mbsl and 200 mbsl the shallowest doi occurs furthest offshore where the conductive saline ocean water layer is the thickest and the deepest doi occurs onshore where there are thick packages of resistive material the majority of these models have a doi 100 mbsl with the deepest offshore doi being 165 mbsl this was the spatial variation in doi expected in this study area the highly conductive seawater limits the ability to investigate features beneath the seafloor in the portions of the dataset that are the farthest offshore 3 2 resistivity to water quality transform in order to interpret the data collected to advance the understanding of the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces within the study area a transform between formation resistivity and pore water quality must be established for the purposes of this paper we use the term water quality to qualitatively describe the salinity of the pore water within a saturated sediment ranging from freshwater to seawater as reviewed in knight and endres 2005 the electrical resistivity of a sediment is a function of the resistivity of the solid phase of the sediment and that of the contained pore water typically most of the electrical conduction through a water saturated sediment is through ionic conduction as a result the measured resistivity is highly sensitive to the volume of water filled porosity and salinity with increases in either resulting in a decrease in resistivity the sediment type lithology has an influence on the electrical resistivity through the effect of porosity but can also introduce another conduction mechanism the surface conduction associated with clays results in a decrease in resistivity with an increase in clay content within the aquifers in soquel creek area there is known to be significant variability in both lithology and pore water salinity this makes establishing a transform from resistivity to water quality significantly more difficult than it would be if lithology could be assumed constant because of the unavoidable uncertainty introduced due to variable lithology we adopted an approach whereby we defined two resistivity cutoffs an upper formation resistivity value above which the sediments are interpreted to be freshwater saturated and a lower formation resistivity value below which sediments are interpreted to be saltwater saturated the range of formation resistivity values between these cutoff values could not be easily transformed to water quality as the values within this range could be the result of varying clay content porosity or water salinity for resistivity values within this intermediate range additional information is required for interpretation of water quality the cutoff values for this resistivity to water quality transform were established using data from soquel creek water district coastal monitoring wells where we had measurements of electrical resistivity within the wells in the form of resistivity logs and measurements of water quality given as total dissolved solids tds the resistivity logs were acquired using wireline induction well logging tools either by the soquel creek water district when the wells were installed hydrometrics 2012 pueblo water resources 2007 or in 2014 as part of the goebel et al 2017 study the tds measurements were taken from the tds time series dataset collected and maintained as part of the soquel creek water district and santa cruz mid county groundwater agency s coastal monitoring program hydrometrics 2016 these tds values are collected from the screened intervals within the agencies dedicated coastal monitoring wells at least twice a year and in some cases much more frequently because we needed data spanning the entire range of water quality conditions within the study area freshwater saturated to saltwater saturated we selected a subset of all the available monitoring wells working with the ones that were closest to the coast presuming that they were most likely to have water quality ranging from fresh to saline from this subset we searched for wells with concurrent resistivity logs and tds measurements only four nested well sets met these criteria sc a2 sc a8 sc 8 and sc 9 with a total of 15 separate screened intervals between the four well sets three of these well sets had two different times for which approximately concurrent resistivity and tds data were available schematics for each of these wells showing the depths of screened intervals and the surrounding lithology are shown in fig 3 we sampled the resistivity logs within each of these screened intervals every 1 5 m and paired each of those resistivity values with the tds measurement for the screened interval these measurements thus provide data pairs linking the resistivity of the saturated sediment to the tds of the contained pore water exactly what is needed to develop the relationship between resistivity measured with the aem system and water quality some studies have shown that there can be challenges in comparing the absolute resistivity values measured using surface geophysics and borehole geophysics due to inconsistent well calibration and or difference in the sampled volumes of the two measurements analysis of the well logs in our study area indicates that they are high quality without any calibration issues comparison of collocated aem data and borehole resistivity logs in the salinas valley area where there were significantly more collocated monitoring wells and aem measurements than in the soquel aem area showed good agreement between the resistivity values determined with each method despite the different sampling volumes gottschalk et al 2018 the schematic in fig 3 illustrates one of the issues that complicated establishing the resistivity to water quality transform it can be seen that the screened intervals in these wells range from 6 m to 84 m in length so can extend over more than one lithologic unit it is possible that there is variation in pore water tds between these lithologic units and the tds sampled in the screened interval is an average of that in each of these units in compiling the data pairs the resistivity values in multiple lithologic units were paired with the same single tds value for that screened interval this will increase the observed spread in the resistivity values for any given tds value the impact of this is that the established cutoff values will result in an under estimation of the volumes of the subsurface that are fully freshwater saturated and fully saltwater saturated the compilation of the data from the monitoring wells resulted in 180 resistivity tds data pairs these pairs were then binned into three categories with tds intervals selected based on the potential utility of water for human use tds 10 000 mg l water of limited beneficial use tds 3 000 10 000 mg l water of potential beneficial use tds 0 3 000 mg l potential drinking water these categories were taken from the state water resources control board swrcb 2006 and the united states environmental protection agency us epa 1988 fig 4 shows the histograms of these data on this plot we have noted the annual mean seawater resistivity of 0 256 ohm m measured at 10 m depth at the mbari sampling station c1 the location shown in fig 1b monterey bay aquarium research institute 2017 this value is consistent with global models of surface seawater resistivity tyler et al 2017 as well as measurements made at other mbari stations further offshore this value is considered representative of the seawater resistivity at the time of aem data acquisition as time series of seawater resistivity in the bay show that temporal variability is minimal monthly measurements in 2016 ranged between 0 244 and 0 26 ohm m and the largest anomaly in the monthly data since 1990 was a recorded resistivity of 0 23 ohm m fig 4 shows there were many measurements in the water of beneficial use category tds 3000 mg l very few at higher levels of tds with eight measurements in the water of limited beneficial use category tds 10 000 mg l and no measurements in the water of potential beneficial use category tds 3 000 10 000 mg l this distribution is due to a sampling bias in these data caused by the design of the nested well sets the screened intervals of wells in these well sets were selected such that the deepest well s screened interval is below the depth where saltwater was encountered while drilling the borehole and all subsequent shallower screened intervals were placed where the groundwater was still fresh because of this there are only the eight measurements in the low resistivity range and no measurements in the intermediate range of resistivity values defined as the potential beneficial use category 3000 mg l tds 10 000 mg l given the limited data set the data from this study were combined with a similar dataset compiled from monitoring wells in the salinas valley area gottschalk et al 2018 this region has suffered from significantly more intrusion than the soquel creek area and water quality measurements made in wells here span a wide range of tds values inclusion of these data helped mitigate the sampling bias in the soquel creek well data as they cover a more complete range of the resistivity tds values expected to be imaged by the aem data in the soquel creek area in the salinas valley dataset gottschalk et al discretized the resistivity logs into 15 cm intervals within the screened intervals while the soquel creek resistivity logs were discretized into 1 5 m intervals to account for this difference in discretization when combining these datasets the count in each resistivity bin from the soquel creek dataset was multiplied by a factor of 10 fig 5 shows the combined histograms for the data from monitoring wells in the soquel creek and salinas valley areas this figure shows overlap in the three histograms between 3 and 30 ohm m if the entire area was composed of a single lithological unit and we knew that the water quality measurements were from that unit alone we would expect minimal overlap between the three histograms in the cases of these data however the variable lithology and large screened intervals likely resulting in water quality measurements of each interval which sampling more than one lithologic unit there is significant overlap in these histograms using these combined datasets two cutoff values were determined all resistivity values 3 ohm m are considered to have tds 10 000 mg l and are interpreted to be saltwater saturated sediments or pure seawater and all resistivity values 20 ohm m are considered to have tds 3000 mg l and are interpreted to be freshwater saturated sediments while fig 5 clearly shows that it is possible to have freshwater saturated sediments with resistivity values below 20 ohm m and saltwater saturated sediments with resistivity values above 3 ohm m the intention of these cutoffs is to determine where we can identify with confidence the presence of fresh or saline water there is a small group of resistivity measurements between 20 and 30 ohm m in the 3 000 10 000 mg l tds range but these are considered outliers in this case the isolated cluster of higher resistivity values can be traced back to a single shallow well in the salinas valley dataset looking at the resistivity log over the screened interval of this well there is evidence that the water quality changes within this screened interval despite this interval only having a single water quality measurement as discussed previously this would result in a wider spread in the possible resistivity values assigned to the tds value in that screened interval in this case we can say with confidence that the isolated cluster of higher resistivity values in the 3 000 10 000 mg l tds range have been assigned an inaccurate tds value while the majority of the aem data for this study were collected offshore where sediments would be fully saturated there are two tie lines that extend onshore where unsaturated material above the water table might be encountered in the wells closest to the onshore tie lines the depth to the water table ranges from 1 to 2 mbsl with seasonal variations on the order of 1 m hydrometrics 2017 because these regions will have high resistivity values that could be interpreted as freshwater saturated sediments using the cutoff established above it is also important to also establish a cutoff value above which resistivity values would indicate that the subsurface is unsaturated we adopted the cutoff value established by gottschalk et al 2018 who used a combination of well data and structure in the aem data in the salinas valley area to select a value of 75 ohm m defining all resistivity values above this as indicating unsaturated sediments as an initial assessment of the aem data we produced a histogram of resistivity values from the inversion of the aem data to display the relative volumes of the subsurface sampled by the aem data corresponding to freshwater saturated saltwater saturated and unsaturated sediments we sampled the resistivity models every meter above the doi regardless of model layer thickness the resulting histogram is shown in fig 6 using the defined cutoffs leads us to conclude that 74 25 of the subsurface is saltwater saturated sediments or pure seawater 3 75 is freshwater saturated sediments 0 25 is unsaturated sediments and 21 75 is sediments with water of an undetermined quality the regions with undetermined water quality could be the result of a number of different water quality and lithology combinations and thus will need to be interpreted using additional information such as monitoring wells directly sampling the region or the location of known hydrologic or geologic features in this histogram there is a clear spike around the resistivity of seawater measured as 0 256 ohm m by the mbari c1 marine station resulting from the inverted resistivity models that include a seawater layer we have not attempted to establish a cutoff between seawater and saltwater saturated sediments in the values displayed in the histogram this is because we have very few seawater resistivity measurements and because we expect that the boundaries of the aem resistivity model layers will not perfectly align in all cases with the location of the seafloor as the thicknesses of model layers were fixed in the inversion of these data if the seafloor exists within a model layer the resulting resistivity of that layer will be influenced by both the resistivity of seawater and the resistivity of the underlying sediments 3 3 combined interpretation of ert and aem data the santa cruz mid county groundwater agency aem dataset was predated by another large geophysical survey the collection of ert data on the beach goebel et al 2017 in this study long offset ert data were collected along 40 km of the beach in both a dipole dipole array and gradient array with electrodes spaced every 22 5 m along a 1 8 km active line length these data were processed and inverted to produce resistivity profiles extending down to 280 mbsl with absolute mean percent errors between 7 9 and 12 4 further discussion of the acquisition processing inversion and interpretation of these data can be found in goebel et al 2017 in order to gain the most comprehensive understanding of water quality in the region we wanted to use these onshore ert data in the interpretation of the aem data where the aem data do not extend onshore in our study area we were concerned however that there might be some difference in the data sets simply due to the difference in the physics of the measurements which can result in inconsistencies in the derived resistivity models from the two geophysical methods anschütz et al 2015a b for this reason we elected to first compare data from these two methods in the salinas valley area south of our study area here we had parallel lines of aem and ert data on average less than 50 m apart in an area where we knew based on well data that there was little change in water quality over the distance between these datasets the ert data in the salinas valley area were collected during the same acquisition and using the same methodology that gathered ert data in the soquel creek region the aem data were collected in the salinas valley area within a month of the soquel creek aem data using the same skytem system fig 7 a c show a comparison of the salinas valley aem and ert datasets projected on a north south oriented profile in fig 7a we show the resistivity profile derived from the ert data the ert data have been clipped at their doi a dashed line on top of the ert resistivity profile shows the doi of the aem dataset in fig 7b we take the same 2d plane and show the corresponding resistivity profile derived from the aem data by plotting the closest aem derived resistivity value for each point on the plane we use the same color scale as the ert profile with gray indicating the region falling below the doi in the aem dataset fig 7c shows the difference between the top two plots created by subtracting the ert resistivity values from the aem values we note that difference is plotted on a log scale for both positive and negative differences the region below the doi in the aem dataset is again shown in gray fig 7 shows that overall both the resistivity values and large scale structures mapped with the two methods are very consistent on the right hand side of the two plots we see very good agreement between the aem and ert profiles on the far right of these profiles both show low resistivity in the upper 50 m with a transition to intermediate resistivity below 50 m for the remainder of these two profiles both have low resistivity values in the subsurface below 10 mbsl on the left hand side of the two plots both the aem and ert profiles have low resistivity values along much of the upper 30 m of the subsurface with a transition to intermediate resistivity values below the variable depth at which this transition occurs is consistent between the two profiles there is one difference between the two profiles in the top 10 m of the subsurface that can be attributed to differences in the timing of data acquisition the ert data were acquired in october following the dry season while the aem data were acquired in may following one of the wettest winters on record the red colors in the difference plot in fig 7c indicate that the aem method finds much higher resistivity values than the ert method we conclude that this is due to the presence of significantly more freshwater in the near surface during the aem data acquisition we see one difference between the two datasets that we attribute to the different forms of measurement specifically related to resolution we refer to the area between markers 1 and 2 in the depth range between 25 and 100 m from drillers lithologic logs and water quality data we know that within this zone the thick salinas valley aquitard a clay layer lies above the saltwater intruded 180 ft aquifer in the aem resistivity profile fig 7b these two layers are clearly visible shown as the green clay layer overlying the red saltwater intruded aquifer in the ert profile fig 7a however this whole package appears as a single unit with a resistivity value that falls between those of the two individual layers this difference highlights the established ability of the aem method to resolve small changes in resistivity on the low end of the resistivity spectrum lucius et al 2006 this comparison of the ert and aem datasets in the salinas valley area supports our use of the ert and aem data in the soquel creek area to assist in our interpretation of the variation in water quality in the distance between the two datasets as seen in the comparison above it is important to keep in mind the fact that changes in timing of the data acquisition can lead to changes in resistivity particularly in the very near surface and that there can be differences in the resolution of the two methods 4 results and discussion 4 1 presentation and interpretation of aem inversion results the models produced by inversion of the aem data reveal complex three dimensional resistivity structures in the subsurface we will interpret these structures using the resistivity to water quality transform established above the beach ert survey data from onshore coastal monitoring wells and the mbari marine station the santa cruz mid county groundwater model onshore and offshore and the onshore and offshore digital elevation model dem national ocean and atmospheric association 2012 fig 8 shows a 3d view of the inverted resistivity models from the aem data models have been clipped at their dois resistivity values less than 0 3 ohm m have been omitted removing the seawater layer from this view so as to better highlight the subsurface variability in resistivity the shoreline taken from where the dem was equal to 0 mbls is plotted in black color represents the resistivity values spanning from 0 256 ohm m the annual mean resistivity of the near surface 10 m depth seawater measured at the mbari c1 marine station to 150 ohm m the highest resistivity value found in this study the color bar is also annotated with the cutoff values established in the resistivity to water quality section above in discussing fig 9 and all subsequent figures we describe the presence of saltwater saturated sediments when the resistivity values are below the cut off of 3 ohm m as shown in the color bar and freshwater saturated sediments when the resistivity values are above the cut off of 20 ohm m as shown in the color bar we describe the other regions as being of intermediate resistivity noting that these regions depending on lithology could have water of a quality ranging from saltwater to freshwater this figure shows that there is significant variability in resistivity both laterally and with depth they show that offshore there are portions of the subsurface that can be classified as freshwater saturated as well as portions of the aquifer that can be classified as saltwater saturated fig 9 a h show plan views of the resistivity models derived through inversion of the aem data starting at sea level and extending down 120 mbsl we show shaded dem data in the adjacent onshore region the interval between the depth slices start at 10 m and then increases to 20 m after 40 mbsl for spatial context these data are overlain on a shaded relief image of the onshore dem the resistivity models are only shown above the doi which is the reason why the number of resistivity values the extent of the models decreases with depth there are few locations where the doi exceeded 120 mbsl the figures are annotated with a number of markers that will be referred to in the following discussion an alternate way to view the data in fig 9 is with cross sections which slice the dataset vertically and allow for better visualization of the variation in the resistivity structure with depth the aem 1d models do not lie on a perfectly straight 2d plane in order to make the cross sections we constructed a straight 2d plane coincident with as many of the aem 1d models as possible at locations where the aem models do not lie exactly on this plane the nearest models were plotted on the plane the same procedure was followed in plotting data from nearby wells on the plane the results are 2d cross sections plotting the aem and well data this plotting procedure resulted in a minor apparent mismatch between the dem and the top of the models onshore in some of these figures as the dem was defined exactly of the 2d planes all of the aem models were less than 50 m from the 2d planes and the subsurface geologic structures vary minimally over such a short distance so this plotting approach this has no significant impact on our interpretation fig 10 a c show three such cross sections of the resistivity models perpendicular to the coastline marked as lines x y and z in fig 9 these models are clipped at their dois also layered on fig 10 a c are the dem hydrostratigraphic units from the groundwater model nearby monitoring wells and markers used in the discussion of these data the locations of these cross sections were selected so that they sampled the areas where we see in fig 9 relatively large scale resistivity features let us now refer to the plan sections and cross sections in figs 9 and 10 to interpret features seen within the aem data with the goal of determining water quality in the offshore extent of the groundwater aquifers and the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces in the various hydrostratigraphic units along the coast one easy to interpret feature seen in the aem dataset is the continuous low resistivity layer at the surface offshore which corresponds to the seawater this can be seen in the entire offshore region in fig 9a and in the most distant offshore parts of fig 9b the resistivity values in the seawater layer consistently 0 25 ohm m agree with the near surface 10 m depth annual mean seawater resistivity value of 0 256 ohm m measured at the mbari sampling station c1 the consistency of the resistivity values in this layer across all the aem models is evident in how narrow the peak around 0 25 ohm m is in fig 6 compared to any other peaks in this figure as can be seen in fig 10 a c the lower boundary of the seawater layer as mapped by the aem data aligns very well with the mapped seafloor bathymetry we find that the aem method has accurately captured both the depth and resistivity of the seawater providing evidence of the reliability of the method in this environment we now review the portions of the dataset where the aem data indicate that the subsurface offshore is predominantly saltwater saturated these areas were roughly grouped into the dashed boxes a and b in fig 9 we will begin with a discussion of box a shown in plan view in fig 9 and in cross sections x and y in fig 10a and b interpreting the aem data in these figures using the resistivity to water quality transform shown in the color bar we conclude that most of the sediments offshore in box a are saturated with saltwater the two resistivity cross sections x and y in fig 10a and b display the classic wedge shape associated with saltwater intrusion with the depth at which saltwater saturated sediments are found increasing inland with distance from the shore we see a thick section of freshwater saturated sediments in the upper portion of the onshore aromas formation with evidence that saltwater extends onshore into the sediments within the lower portion of the formation both of the cross sections x and y in fig 10a and b are overlain with the locations of the monitoring wells closest to the cross section with the tds values in their screened intervals annotated alongside the screened interval and the distance between the well and the profile noted above the well the tds values in the aromas formation where the aem data indicate freshwater saturated sediments range from 145 to 364 mg l also indicating freshwater the tds value in the aromas formation where the aem data indicate saltwater saturated sediments is 18 000 mg l also showing saltwater within this formation this agreement between the aem and well data validates our approach to the interpretation of aem data in terms of water quality it also highlights the ability of the aem data to fill in the spatial gaps in the monitoring well network allowing us to track the freshwater saltwater interface in the aromas formation away from the point locations where it is observed in wells in addition to showing saltwater saturated sediments extending onshore in the aromas formation fig 10b shows saltwater extending onshore in the deeper purisima def f unit which is only above the doi for a small number of the models shown in fig 10a the two wells that are screened within this unit both show high tds values again agreeing with our interpretation of the aem data here the aem data can be interpreted as showing saltwater extending at least 1 5 km inland within the def f unit the aem profiles parallel to the coastline within box a in fig 9 show predominantly saltwater in the subsurface offshore while this is useful in determining the water quality of the subsurface offshore they do not allow us to locate the freshwater saltwater interfaces within the hydrogeologic units imaged as in most of box a it appears the interfaces are inland of the closest aem line parallel to the coast 200 m offshore only the two tie lines discussed above which extend onshore are able to directly locate a freshwater saltwater interface and resolve its geometry as it extends from the shoreline onshore within the aromas formation next we will use the combined interpretation of the closest aem profile parallel to the shore and the long offset ert profile along the beach by including the ert dataset in our interpretation of the aem dataset we can bridge the gap between the offshore aem data and the onshore monitoring wells to better constrain the exact location of the freshwater saltwater interface within each of the units imaged by the aem dataset this allows us to maximize the information gained from the new offshore dataset fig 11 a and b show a comparison of the resistivity profiles created from inversion of the onshore ert data and the offshore aem data along the closest flight line parallel to the coast projected on a north south profile the distance between these two profiles is approximately 200 m the ert derived resistivity profile is in fig 11a and the aem derived resistivity profile is in fig 11b both on the same color scale both profiles display results above their respective dois with the doi of the aem dataset shown as a dashed line on the ert profile in both figures the two vertical dashed black lines mark the bounds of box a seen in the plan views in fig 9 the two vertical dashed gray lines show where cross sections x and y seen in fig 10a and b and located in plan view on fig 9 intersect these profiles included on both figures are the hydrostratigraphic units from the groundwater model labeled as named in table 1 and markers 1 to 5 which are referred to in the following discussion for consistency fig 11b is also annotated with the same fw markers used in figs 9 and 10 referencing locations discussed later in the text a comparison of fig 11a and b shows that there are some locations where the two methods show similar resistivity values and structures in the subsurface and some locations where they are quite different in the top few meters of the aem profile is the low resistivity layer corresponding to the seawater layer this is not seen in the ert profile as the data were acquired onshore between markers 1 and 2 the two datasets show similar resistivity structures suggesting that there is little change in the subsurface between these profiles in the top 25 m both profiles predominantly show saltwater saturated sediments yellows through reds though the aem profile consistently shows lower resistivity values than the ert profile possibly suggesting more saline water offshore both then show a zone of intermediate resistivity greens and yellows beginning near the surface below marker 2 and extending to greater depths towards marker 1 this intermediate resistivity zone is much more defined in the aem profile a possible reason for this is that as established in the combined interpretation of ert and aem data section the aem method is better able to resolve small scale changes in resistivity at the low resistivity end of the spectrum than the ert method therefore this intermediate resistivity unit which has a resistivity only a few ohm m higher than the surrounding saltwater saturated sediments in the aem profile is much more clearly defined in the aem profile the fact that neither the ert nor aem profiles contain any resistivity values that fall in the zone classified as freshwater saturated sediments and a significant number of resistivity values that can be classified as saltwater saturated sediments suggest that the intrusion interface is inland of the ert profile this conclusion is consistent with water quality measurements made in monitoring wells as shown in fig 1b saltwater intrusion has been mapped onshore in the aromas formation using well data within this area between markers 2 and 3 in fig 11 the two datasets are quite different the aem profile shows that the subsurface is almost entirely saltwater saturated the ert profile shows saltwater saturated sediments at depth but in the upper 30 m shows freshwater saturated sediments or resistivity values in the intermediate range this difference is interpreted to be the result of these datasets being collected on opposite sides of the freshwater saltwater interface at the surface the location of the ert profile is such that it captures the transition from freshwater saturated to saltwater saturated sediments whereas the aem dataset is seaward of this transition at all depths this interpretation is consistent with the data shown in figs 10a and b where the saltwater saturated sediments extended onshore in the classic wedge shape described by the ghyben herzberg model with a package of freshwater saturated sediments above the intrusion front that increases in thickness moving onshore while it fluctuates somewhat the depth to the saltwater saturated sediments in the ert datasets is relatively constant between markers 2 and 3 using the observed differences between the profiles in fig 11 and the understandings gained from the interpretations of fig 10a and b we conclude that the saltwater saturated sediments seen in the aem data offshore connect to the saltwater saturated sediments seen in the ert data below 30 m in a wedge shape which extends a short distance onshore in the aromas formation between markers 3 and 4 in fig 11b we see saltwater saturated sediments at the top of the aem profile underlain by a region of intermediate resistivity with more saltwater saturated sediments at the base the transition to saltwater saturated sediments at the base of the layer of intermediate resistivity occurs along the boundary of the aromas formation and def f units as mapped in the groundwater model of this region in contrast at the onshore location of the ert profile none of the subsurface is classified as saltwater saturated with the high resistivity values corresponding to freshwater saturated sediments in the top 30 m we can use well data along with these two datasets to develop an understanding of the location of the freshwater saltwater interfaces in the aromas formation and the def f unit within the aromas formation tds measurements in well sc a8 275 m from the shore indicate freshwater based on the well data and ert profile we can conclude that between markers 3 and 4 the freshwater saltwater interface is likely entirely offshore in the aromas formation the intermediate resistivity zone seen within the aromas formation in the aem profile may represent a transition zone from freshwater to saltwater within this unit offshore within the def f unit tds measurements in well sc a8 275 m from the shore indicate the subsurface is saltwater saturated while other monitoring wells further inland of this indicate the unit is freshwater saturated based on these well data combined with the intermediate resistivity observed in the def f unit in the ert profile and the saltwater saturated sediments observed in the aem profile we conclude that the freshwater saltwater interface exists onshore somewhere between sc a8 and the surrounding monitoring wells to the north and west within the def f unit between markers 4 and 5 the aem profile shows the subsurface to be fully saltwater saturated the ert profile shows freshwater saturated sediments in the near surface with patches of saltwater saturated sediments in the def f unit near marker 5 within the aromas formation we interpret the contrast between these two profiles as their being on opposite sides of the freshwater saltwater interface placing its location somewhere offshore between the two profiles in fig 11 this interpretation is supported by tds measurements in the nearest monitoring well sc a1 located 340 m inland from the shore which indicate freshwater in the aromas formation within the def f unit comparison of the ert and aem profiles suggests significant variation in the location of the freshwater saltwater interface over a short distance near marker 5 we interpret the saltwater saturated patches seen in the def f unit in the ert profile to be the onshore extent of the saltwater saturated sediments in def f unit seen in the aem profile this interpretation would suggest that near marker 5 the freshwater saltwater interface is inland of the ert profile contradicting this interpretation is a measurement of freshwater in monitoring well sc 8 located 100 m from the shore but the long length of the screened interval of the well makes this measurement unreliable near marker 4 in the def f unit the ert profile shows freshwater saturated sediments in the upper 50 m of the subsurface while the aem profile shows saltwater saturated sediments everywhere here we interpret the two profiles as being on opposite sides of the freshwater saltwater interface placing its location somewhere offshore between the two profiles in fig 11 this is supported by measurements of freshwater in the def f unit in sc a8 the nearest well to marker 4 our interpretation placing the freshwater saltwater interface onshore near marker 5 and offshore near marker 4 shows how variable the location of the interface can be within a single unit the sharp boundary between these two zones and the fact that this boundary appears to parallel the boundaries between the hydrostratigraphic units in fig 11b suggests that the variation within this unit could be the result of further lithologic stratification within the unit with the joint interpretation of the aem and ert datasets we have been able to better constrain the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces within box a where the aem data showed the subsurface was predominantly saltwater saturated let us now consider box b shown in fig 9 in the easternmost portion of the aem dataset in this region no aem tie lines extend onshore and there are no coastal ert data there are however a number of monitoring wells near the coast with water quality measurements that can be compared to the offshore aem data as seen in fig 9 all of the regions sampled by the aem data within box b show the subsurface to be saltwater saturated contrary to what is seen in the aem dataset the majority of the water quality measurements in wells inland of box b suggest that onshore sediments are freshwater saturated at all of the depths imaged by the aem data only two of the monitoring wells show elevated tds values these are soquel point and moran lake monitoring wells shown in fig 1b these wells show tds values of 2400 and 510 mg l in 2016 respectively within the a hydrostratigraphic unit hydrometrics 2017 while these tds values are below the limit for our saltwater saturated classification they are higher than measurements made in wells further inland within box b with the aem data showing that just offshore the a unit is fully saltwater saturated we conclude that these elevated tds measurements represent the front of saltwater intrusion within this unit these two same monitoring wells do not show evidence of intrusion in their deepest screened intervals within the aa unit despite the fact that the aem data in fig 9 show that the subsurface is saltwater saturated offshore at all depths a likely explanation for this is that differences in lithology and or pumping rates between the two units is causing intrusion into the a unit before the aa unit while the aem data do not allow us to determine the exact location of the freshwater saltwater interface within box b in fig 9 they do constrain it to being within the 200 m between the wells at the shore and the first aem profile offshore at all depths for most of box b referring again to fig 9 let us now discuss the areas offshore where the subsurface is either of intermediate resistivity light green to mid blue on the resistivity color scale or resistive enough to be classified as freshwater saturated these locations are annotated with fw1 fw5 in fig 9 and where they are present in figs 10 and 11 the largest of these at noted by fw5 in fig 9 can be seen to extend as far as 2 5 km offshore from the seafloor to the bottom of the doi as was discussed in the resistivity to water quality transform section above values within the intermediate resistivity range could represent a wide range of pore water salinities depending on the lithology specifically the clay content for this reason these features must be interpreted using auxiliary information features fw1 fw4 are all located near the mouths of streams or rivers that connect to the ocean some seasonally and some year round our interpretation is that these regions have higher water quality associated with these features due to recharge through the base of the streams or rivers or subsurface stream flow the feature labeled fw3 in fig 9 appears to be connected to the larger region of intermediate resistivity values in the ert dataset shown between markers 3 and 4 in fig 11 and to freshwater observed in monitoring wells onshore the larger feature labeled fw5 is also interpreted to correspond to a region of higher water quality as with the features labeled fw1 fw4 this zone is connected to the mouths of a number of rivers and streams which are likely introducing the fresher water to this area a cross section through this feature can be seen in fig 10c within fig 10c this intermediate resistivity feature is seen to fill all of the hydrostratigraphic bc unit closest to the shoreline in fig 10c the resistivity values in the bc unit are high enough to be classified as freshwater saturated sediments the resistivity values in this unit then gradually decrease with increasing distance from the shore in a transition from the freshwater saturated region to the surrounding regions of fully saltwater saturated sediments 4 2 assessment of anomalously low resistivity features as discussed in the aem data acquisition processing and inversion section this study employed a 1d spatially constrained inversion scheme which may not be appropriate for use where there are abrupt lateral changes is resistivity that violate the 1d assumption there are two areas with zones of anomalously low resistivity values near the coast that we interpret to be artifacts of the inversion scheme due to such abrupt changes in resistivity the locations of these features can be seen in fig 9h within the dashed boxes c and d a cross sectional view through one of these features can be seen at the bottom of fig 10c near the shoreline these features are above the doi and examination of the raw data and inversion results would not suggest that these are the result of any noise source despite this there are a number of reasons to conclude that these features are not real the first is that the standard deviations on the resistivity values with the layers containing the anomalous values are significantly higher than elsewhere in the models the second was that there were challenges in reaching good inversion convergence on the data lastly these are highly unlikely to be hydrogeologic features for a number of reasons these features do not appear to be connected to saltwater intruded sediments further offshore given the hydrogeologic setting and depositional history any large low resistivity feature in a unit onshore would be expected to connect to saltwater saturated sediments in that same unit offshore additionally the inverted resistivity values within these features are very low in some cases lower than that of pure seawater 0 25 ohm m which cannot be explained 4 3 implications for groundwater management the interpretation of the aem data acquired in the offshore coastal environment in combination with the existing understanding of this region from ert data and monitoring wells have a number of implications for groundwater management in this region some of the more important of these are summarized below one management strategy in areas under threat of saltwater intrusion is to ensure that groundwater elevations are maintained at or above the minimum level needed to prevent intrusion as determined through groundwater modeling this minimum level is referred to as the protective groundwater elevation interpretation of the aem dataset within the regions enclosed by box a and box b of fig 9 suggests that it is critical to reach and or maintain protective groundwater elevations in these regions at present the onshore sediments in these regions are predominantly saturated with freshwater with limited evidence of saltwater saturation but the aem data have revealed that the freshwater saltwater interface is very close to the coastline with the subsurface predominantly saltwater saturated just offshore combining the interpretation of the aem dataset with onshore well data suggest specific priority areas within the regions enclosed by box a and box b one such area is the portion of the actively pumped def f unit that falls in box a where a few onshore monitoring wells have encountered intrusion a number of these wells show groundwater elevations below their protective elevations another area is the portion of the a unit within box b as water quality measurements in two wells onshore suggest intrusion may be occurring in this unit proactively increasing groundwater elevations in these areas either by reducing pumping or with managed aquifer recharge could prevent further onshore movement of the freshwater saltwater interface interpretation of the intermediate resistivity zones labeled fw1 fw5 in fig 9 suggests that these are zones with lower salinity water most of these zones are above the depths of the screened intervals of pumping wells and therefore do not likely represent future potential water sources for human use identification of these lower salinity water zones offshore is still useful however as they likely play an important role in maintaining pressure against saltwater intrusion into the deeper portions of the hydrogeologic units in which they reside lastly this new aem dataset and derived interpretations provide a baseline for assessing changes in the hydrologic system using future this could be accomplished using ground based monitoring such as new and existing monitoring wells or future aem acquisitions extensive calibration of the system used to acquire these aem data means that the acquisition can be repeated in the future and be compared to this baseline to map changes in subsurface resistivity over time 5 conclusions the goal of this study was to determine the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces within the soquel creek region our approach was to use a combination of offshore aem data onshore ert data and onshore monitoring well data we found that by using an extremely low acquisition repetition frequency allowing the system to collect at very late time gates 20 ms the aem was able to image to the depths of interest the upper aquifers beneath seawater depth of up to 18 m we found that interpretation of the extent of intrusion onshore from the aem data using a resistivity to water quality transform developed using only well data were consistent with the previously mapped extents of intrusion onshore where a freshwater saltwater interface was present where aem data was acquired the aem data alone accurately located the interface where a freshwater saltwater interface was not below a flight line the location of the interface could be constrained using joint interpretation of the aem data and existing onshore datasets we found the location of the freshwater saltwater interfaces to be extremely variable within the study area both between the different hydrogeologic units and within individual hydrogeologic units at different points along the coast notably we located a region where freshwater extended offshore within the subsurface this study has highlighted the importance of careful interpretation of aem data in the context of their hydrogeologic setting in coastal regions such as studied here with active saltwater intrusion there can be abrupt and extreme lateral changes in resistivity in these cases the 1d assumption in the inversion scheme most commonly used is not valid and can result in inversion artifacts we conclude based on the results of our study that aem data can play an essential role in mapping and monitoring saltwater intrusion a role that cannot be as easily or cost effectively filled by any other existing technology the ability to determine the variation in water quality in the offshore extents of aquifers the acquisition of data in the offshore coastal environment allowed us to better constrain the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces within the various hydrogeologic units and identify the regions most at risk for future intrusion these findings can support the development of proactive strategies for groundwater management by establishing a baseline for water quality in the offshore extents of the aquifers and by highlighting the locations where management actions should be targeted acknowledgments we would like to thank ron duncan from the santa cruz mid county

8441,study region the northern coast of the monterey bay california usa extending from the coastline to 3 5 km offshore study focus three hundred and twenty line kilometers of airborne electromagnetic aem data were acquired offshore these data spanned 20 km of coastline extending up to 3 5 km offshore in water up to 18 m in depth inversion of these data resulted in resistivity models extending to depths between 50 and 200 m below sea level the data were interpreted in conjunction with onshore monitoring well data hydrologic and geologic reports and electrical resistivity tomography ert data to locate the freshwater saltwater interfaces throughout the region a resistivity to water quality transform was established using well based water quality and resistivity logging measurements for resistivity values that could not be converted to water quality with this transform local auxiliary information was used on a case by case basis to interpret the observed features some low resistivity anomalies were identified near the shore at depth which were interpreted to be artifacts of the 1d assumption in the inversion scheme used for these aem data new hydrogeological insights for this region we found that the acquisition of aem data provided valuable information about water quality in the offshore extents of the aquifers a region inaccessible to traditional monitoring methods but one that plays an important role in the modeling prediction and management of saltwater intrusion keywords saltwater intrusion coastal aquifer airborne electromagnetic aem electrical resistivity tomography ert offshore 1 introduction in coastal regions around the world there is a dynamic interface between fresh groundwater and saline ocean water the location and geometry of a freshwater saltwater interface is dictated by density and pressure gradients within the adjacent water bodies as well as all other hydrogeologic conditions that control subsurface flow in many cases both natural and anthropogenic changes in hydrologic systems have resulted in the interface migrating inland in a process called saltwater intrusion saltwater intrusion can have significant economic and ecological impacts johannes 1980 werner et al 2013 michael et al 2017 and therefore is an important issue in coastal groundwater management with 40 of the global population living within 100 km of the coast ciesin 2012 management of coastal groundwater resources is a critical component of achieving global freshwater security a critical step in the management of coastal groundwater resources is mapping and monitoring the distribution of salinity in the subsurface this is typically accomplished using water quality measurements made in wells but there has been increasing recognition of a need to supplement this method in areas with complicated hydrogeologic conditions or where limited well coverage results in large uncertainty in understanding the extent of saltwater intrusion a specific challenge that we address in this study is the need to map the locations of freshwater saltwater interfaces in the offshore region in areas where modeling suggests the imminent threat of saltwater intrusion but no sampling data are available the focus of this study is to assess the use of an airborne geophysical method as a way to locate freshwater saltwater interfaces in the offshore coastal environment in recent years geophysical methods of imaging the subsurface have been shown to be highly effective for large scale exploration and characterization of the extent of saltwater intrusion in coastal environments two methods in particular that have proven successful are ground based electrical resistivity tomography ert and the airborne electromagnetic aem method these methods provide a measure of subsurface electrical resistivity which is highly sensitive to changes in pore fluid salinity and thus are ideally suited to this application de franco et al 2009 martínez et al 2009 zarroca et al 2011 pidlisecky et al 2015 goebel et al 2017 and others have demonstrated the effectiveness of ert for mapping saltwater intrusion onshore both time domain and frequency domain aem methods have been demonstrated to be useful in imaging onshore saltwater intrusion as shown by fitterman and deszcz pan 1998 teatini et al 2011 gunnink et al 2012 jørgensen et al 2012 and others the aem method has the advantage of being able to give extensive spatial coverage relatively rapidly as well as sample areas difficult or impossible to access with other methods one such area is the offshore coastal environment where the use of monitoring wells is impractical given the high cost of installing underwater wells the presence of the seawater has little logistical impact on the ability to collect aem data but there is concern about the impact of the seawater on the data themselves as such a highly conductive feature at the surface could make it difficult to investigate the structures beneath it the capability of aem data to image beneath shallow saltwater bodies in lagoon and offshore environments has been explored in recent studies kirkegaard et al 2011 pedersen et al 2017 these have found that while there is the expected decrease in depth of investigation beneath the conductive seawater and convergence during inversion of the data to obtain the resistivity model can be difficult aem data can still yield useful information for understanding conditions within the offshore extent of aquifers pedersen et al 2017 for example mapped a freshwater lens extending in the subsurface offshore and were able to image to depths of over 80 m in ocean depths of 20 m off the coast of the netherlands these examples have been successful but with a limited number of such studies there is a need for further research in different hydrogeologic settings to better understand the utility of offshore aem data for mapping and monitoring coastal groundwater resources this study was designed to explore the use of aem data to image the subsurface region from the coastline to a distance of up to 3 5 km offshore along the northern coast of monterey bay california this is a region where all of the aquifers are currently experiencing or are threatened by saltwater intrusion three previous geophysical investigations successfully demonstrated the capability of electrical electromagnetic imaging methods to help resolve the distribution of and hydrogeologic controls on saltwater intrusion in this region long offset ert was used in two studies along the coast of monterey bay pidlisecky et al 2015 goebel et al 2017 and aem data were acquired in the salinas valley gottschalk et al 2018 along much of the northern coast of the bay in the soquel creek area ert data in the goebel et al 2017 study were interpreted to show predominantly freshwater in the top 100 mbsl at the shoreline consistent with measurements made in wells inland in those areas where ert and well data indicated that the aquifers were saturated with freshwater onshore the critical question posed by local groundwater managers and the motivation for this study where are the freshwater saltwater interfaces located within the various hydrogeologic units they could be offshore and or could be deeper than the screened intervals of the wells onshore the goal of this study was to locate the freshwater saltwater interfaces in the santa cruz mid county region by complementing onshore well and ert data with offshore aem data where the aem data were used to map out the variation in water quality in the offshore extent of the groundwater aquifers the findings presented here reveal the complex nature of saltwater intrusion in the region and highlight the ability of the aem method to image these complex features offshore a region difficult to access with well based monitoring methods the findings also demonstrate some challenges of this method in coastal environments while specific findings are unique to this study area the insights gained contribute to the assessment of the aem method for offshore coastal hydrogeologic investigations and to the development of this method for investigating similar coastal systems elsewhere in the world 2 study area the location of the study area here referred to as the soquel creek area is in the monterey bay region of california and is shown in fig 1 c and outlined in black in fig 1a and b with limited surface water resources the monterey bay region depends on groundwater to meet 80 of its freshwater needs california water foundation 2014 during times of drought this percentage can increase in the monterey bay region extensive groundwater extraction has lead to significant saltwater intrusion within some of the actively pumped aquifer units with saltwater water observed in monitoring wells more than 16 km inland at some points monterey county water resources agency 2014 while the soquel creek area has not experienced nearly as much saltwater intrusion as found in areas to the south hydraulic head and water quality measurements suggest that saltwater intrusion is still a significant threat in this area hydrometrics 2017 new legislation in the state of california specifically mandates that groundwater resources be managed so as to avoid significant and unreasonable saltwater intrusion into aquifers california department of water resources 2018 characterizing water quality conditions in the offshore extent of aquifers is critical for fully understanding the hydrogeologic system and planning management strategies to meet these new state requirements in the soquel creek area fig 1a shows the study area and surrounding monterey bay region with the location of the offshore aem data acquired in may 2017 lines of data shown in gray were acquired parallel and perpendicular to the coastline with the former so close together that the separate lines are not visible in the figure three hundred and twenty line km of data were acquired along 20 km of the coastline extending up to 3 5 km offshore in water up to 18 m in depth this figure also shows the locations of other geophysical datasets within the region which will be discussed in this paper including ert in green spanning much of the coastline of the bay goebel et al 2017 and onshore aem data in the salinas valley area gottschalk et al 2018 in gray also collected in may 2017 fig 1b shows other key information for the interpretation and contextualization of these data this includes the mapped extent of saltwater intrusion based on well water quality sampling monterey county water resources agency 2017 pajaro valley water management agency 2018 in the salinas valley area this mapped extent is divided into intrusion into the upper and lower aquifers named the 180 ft and 400 ft aquifers respectively with the more inland boundary being that in the 180 ft aquifer it is important to note that these boundaries only show the extent of intrusion as reported by local agencies as interpolated spatial information some intrusion is known to exist near the coast in the north within our study area but is not reported in a way that can be easily presented in this figure fig 1b also shows a selection of the soquel creek monitoring wells closest to the coast within the study area and the location of the monterey bay aquarium research institute s marine monitoring station c1 mbari 2018 a permanent monitoring location offshore where quarterly seawater chemistry measurements are made fig 1c shows a zoomed in view of just the study area showing the spatial relationship between the aem data ert data and monitoring wells discussed in this paper fig 1c includes the names of the monitoring wells as well as markers along the ert line references in the interpretation of these data the geology of the study area consists of two primary water bearing formations the aromas and the purisima underlain by a granitic basement descriptions of properties of these formations are found in column 2 of table 1 department of water resources 2003 within the study area the purisima formation can be further subdivided into a number of hydrostratigraphic units these units are summarized from shallowest to deepest in column 3 of table 1 the subdivision described in table 1 is taken from the groundwater flow model of the region column 4 of table 1 notes the designation aquifer or aquitard of each of these units in the groundwater model extensive discussion on the technical aspects of this model including how the hydrostratigraphic boundaries were selected and what assumptions went into defining these units can be found in hydrometrics 2015 we compare the new finding in this study to the hydrostratigraphic divisions in this model as they are the boundaries that are used in the management of groundwater within the study area to visualize the hydrogeologic structures views of the groundwater model hydrostratigraphy are shown in fig 2 in fig 2 the plan view shows which unit is closest to the surface this model is extrapolated offshore with the offshore region noted in partially transparent gray two cross sections labeled a a and b b on the plan view show the dip of these units the process of saltwater intrusion is sensitive to pumping recharge and hydrogeologic conditions within the soquel creek region there is significant spatial variation in each of these factors as a result this region is likely to have a complicated pattern of intrusion with the freshwater saltwater interfaces located different distances from the coast in the different hydrostratigraphic units or even within a single hydrostratigraphic unit to date onshore mapping of saltwater intrusion using monitoring wells and coastal ert data shows a complicated distribution of fresh and saltwater in the subsurface as shown in fig 1b the coastal monitoring well network has detected intrusion into the upper aquifers in the southern portion of the study area but not the northern portion of the study area furthermore within the portion of the study area where intrusion has been detected well data suggest that the distance from the coast to which saltwater is found inland varies for the different upper aquifers further details on the spatial and temporal patterns of intrusion within this region can be found in hydrometrics 2017 the critical issue motivating this study was the need to extend the mapping of the freshwater saltwater interfaces offshore where there is currently no data to constrain the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces 3 materials and methods 3 1 aem data acquisition processing and inversion on may 23rd 2017 320 line kilometers of aem data were acquired off the coast of the soquel creek area using the dual moment skytem 304m system this system utilizes hardware suspended beneath a helicopter held 30 m above the ground surface a forward modeling study as well as a ground based time domain electromagnetic pilot study were used to determine the utility of an aem survey in this region and to design the best system configuration for an aem acquisition in this setting these studies motivated the use of an extremely low acquisition repetition frequency allowing the system to collect data from 20 μs to very late time gates 20 ms maximizing the depths the system was sensitive to beneath the conductive seawater layer during data acquisition fifteen lines were flown parallel to the shore with 100 m spacing between lines these were connected with 12 tie lines perpendicular to the shore spaced 1 to 2 km apart data acquisition was predominantly limited to the offshore region for two reasons the offshore was the area of greatest interest for understanding the locations of intrusion interfaces in the study area and because much of the onshore portion of the study area consists of urban development over which data acquisition is not permitted according to federal aviation association regulations the data were both automatically and manually processed to remove noisy data minimal processing was required as the conductive seawater and saturated sediments provided a large signal due to the high electromagnetic response from the conductive seawater and the sediments beneath the seafloor even the very late time gates showed signals well above the noise floor additionally the majority of these data were acquired offshore away from common noise sources such as power lines this resulted in high quality data with a high signal to noise ratio throughout this study we have employed the 1d form of aem data inversion an approach that assumes that the subsurface electrical resistivity varies with depth but is laterally uniform this assumption is generally considered appropriate as long as layers do not dip more than 30 auken 2018 the spatial correlation between the data was taken into account using 3d spatial constraints on the 1d inversions this approach is computationally efficient for large datasets such as this one and is well suited to hydrologic applications one limitation of this approach however is an inability to resolve sharp resistivity contrasts across vertical boundaries where the 1d assumption is not valid as shown in heagy et al 2018 1d inversion of data in environments with abrupt lateral changes in resistivity can result in poor resolution of the true resistivity and can introduce artifacts into the final resistivity models along the shoreline where freshwater extends offshore resulting in sharp lateral changes in resistivity between the ocean and the freshwater saturated sediments we observed that the 1d model response had difficulties in fitting the actual measured data which created some model artifacts the data were inverted in aarhus workbench using a 22 layer spatially constrained inversion averaging of the data resulted in a 1d model of the variation in electrical resistivity with depth every 17 m along the flight lines model layer thickness starts at 0 8 m at the surface and increases with depth with a final thickness of 40 m at 200 m depth the maximum depth at which electrical resistivity values were determined the thin layers at the surface were used to ensure that the thickness of the seawater which ranges between 0 and 18 m thick along the offshore flight lines could be modeled as accurately as possible while using a fixed layer thickness inversion this was critical for the inversion of these data as seawater is significantly more conductive than any other material expected to be present in this study area and therefore should produce a large measured signal wherever it was present it was not necessary to constrain the resistivity of the seawater layer within the inversion the final inversion resulted in a data residual a noise normalized rmse between the measured and calculated data of 0 545 this value is below 1 meaning that the data were fit within the noise level the depth of investigation doi is defined as the depth to which models resulting from the inversion of geophysical data can be considered reliable the doi for each of the models was determined using the method outlined in vest christiansen and auken 2012 a universal cumulative sensitivity threshold of 0 1 was applied to determine the doi this is considered the standard threshold in the aarhus workbench software using this threshold the sensitive region of the dataset extends between 50 mbsl and 200 mbsl the shallowest doi occurs furthest offshore where the conductive saline ocean water layer is the thickest and the deepest doi occurs onshore where there are thick packages of resistive material the majority of these models have a doi 100 mbsl with the deepest offshore doi being 165 mbsl this was the spatial variation in doi expected in this study area the highly conductive seawater limits the ability to investigate features beneath the seafloor in the portions of the dataset that are the farthest offshore 3 2 resistivity to water quality transform in order to interpret the data collected to advance the understanding of the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces within the study area a transform between formation resistivity and pore water quality must be established for the purposes of this paper we use the term water quality to qualitatively describe the salinity of the pore water within a saturated sediment ranging from freshwater to seawater as reviewed in knight and endres 2005 the electrical resistivity of a sediment is a function of the resistivity of the solid phase of the sediment and that of the contained pore water typically most of the electrical conduction through a water saturated sediment is through ionic conduction as a result the measured resistivity is highly sensitive to the volume of water filled porosity and salinity with increases in either resulting in a decrease in resistivity the sediment type lithology has an influence on the electrical resistivity through the effect of porosity but can also introduce another conduction mechanism the surface conduction associated with clays results in a decrease in resistivity with an increase in clay content within the aquifers in soquel creek area there is known to be significant variability in both lithology and pore water salinity this makes establishing a transform from resistivity to water quality significantly more difficult than it would be if lithology could be assumed constant because of the unavoidable uncertainty introduced due to variable lithology we adopted an approach whereby we defined two resistivity cutoffs an upper formation resistivity value above which the sediments are interpreted to be freshwater saturated and a lower formation resistivity value below which sediments are interpreted to be saltwater saturated the range of formation resistivity values between these cutoff values could not be easily transformed to water quality as the values within this range could be the result of varying clay content porosity or water salinity for resistivity values within this intermediate range additional information is required for interpretation of water quality the cutoff values for this resistivity to water quality transform were established using data from soquel creek water district coastal monitoring wells where we had measurements of electrical resistivity within the wells in the form of resistivity logs and measurements of water quality given as total dissolved solids tds the resistivity logs were acquired using wireline induction well logging tools either by the soquel creek water district when the wells were installed hydrometrics 2012 pueblo water resources 2007 or in 2014 as part of the goebel et al 2017 study the tds measurements were taken from the tds time series dataset collected and maintained as part of the soquel creek water district and santa cruz mid county groundwater agency s coastal monitoring program hydrometrics 2016 these tds values are collected from the screened intervals within the agencies dedicated coastal monitoring wells at least twice a year and in some cases much more frequently because we needed data spanning the entire range of water quality conditions within the study area freshwater saturated to saltwater saturated we selected a subset of all the available monitoring wells working with the ones that were closest to the coast presuming that they were most likely to have water quality ranging from fresh to saline from this subset we searched for wells with concurrent resistivity logs and tds measurements only four nested well sets met these criteria sc a2 sc a8 sc 8 and sc 9 with a total of 15 separate screened intervals between the four well sets three of these well sets had two different times for which approximately concurrent resistivity and tds data were available schematics for each of these wells showing the depths of screened intervals and the surrounding lithology are shown in fig 3 we sampled the resistivity logs within each of these screened intervals every 1 5 m and paired each of those resistivity values with the tds measurement for the screened interval these measurements thus provide data pairs linking the resistivity of the saturated sediment to the tds of the contained pore water exactly what is needed to develop the relationship between resistivity measured with the aem system and water quality some studies have shown that there can be challenges in comparing the absolute resistivity values measured using surface geophysics and borehole geophysics due to inconsistent well calibration and or difference in the sampled volumes of the two measurements analysis of the well logs in our study area indicates that they are high quality without any calibration issues comparison of collocated aem data and borehole resistivity logs in the salinas valley area where there were significantly more collocated monitoring wells and aem measurements than in the soquel aem area showed good agreement between the resistivity values determined with each method despite the different sampling volumes gottschalk et al 2018 the schematic in fig 3 illustrates one of the issues that complicated establishing the resistivity to water quality transform it can be seen that the screened intervals in these wells range from 6 m to 84 m in length so can extend over more than one lithologic unit it is possible that there is variation in pore water tds between these lithologic units and the tds sampled in the screened interval is an average of that in each of these units in compiling the data pairs the resistivity values in multiple lithologic units were paired with the same single tds value for that screened interval this will increase the observed spread in the resistivity values for any given tds value the impact of this is that the established cutoff values will result in an under estimation of the volumes of the subsurface that are fully freshwater saturated and fully saltwater saturated the compilation of the data from the monitoring wells resulted in 180 resistivity tds data pairs these pairs were then binned into three categories with tds intervals selected based on the potential utility of water for human use tds 10 000 mg l water of limited beneficial use tds 3 000 10 000 mg l water of potential beneficial use tds 0 3 000 mg l potential drinking water these categories were taken from the state water resources control board swrcb 2006 and the united states environmental protection agency us epa 1988 fig 4 shows the histograms of these data on this plot we have noted the annual mean seawater resistivity of 0 256 ohm m measured at 10 m depth at the mbari sampling station c1 the location shown in fig 1b monterey bay aquarium research institute 2017 this value is consistent with global models of surface seawater resistivity tyler et al 2017 as well as measurements made at other mbari stations further offshore this value is considered representative of the seawater resistivity at the time of aem data acquisition as time series of seawater resistivity in the bay show that temporal variability is minimal monthly measurements in 2016 ranged between 0 244 and 0 26 ohm m and the largest anomaly in the monthly data since 1990 was a recorded resistivity of 0 23 ohm m fig 4 shows there were many measurements in the water of beneficial use category tds 3000 mg l very few at higher levels of tds with eight measurements in the water of limited beneficial use category tds 10 000 mg l and no measurements in the water of potential beneficial use category tds 3 000 10 000 mg l this distribution is due to a sampling bias in these data caused by the design of the nested well sets the screened intervals of wells in these well sets were selected such that the deepest well s screened interval is below the depth where saltwater was encountered while drilling the borehole and all subsequent shallower screened intervals were placed where the groundwater was still fresh because of this there are only the eight measurements in the low resistivity range and no measurements in the intermediate range of resistivity values defined as the potential beneficial use category 3000 mg l tds 10 000 mg l given the limited data set the data from this study were combined with a similar dataset compiled from monitoring wells in the salinas valley area gottschalk et al 2018 this region has suffered from significantly more intrusion than the soquel creek area and water quality measurements made in wells here span a wide range of tds values inclusion of these data helped mitigate the sampling bias in the soquel creek well data as they cover a more complete range of the resistivity tds values expected to be imaged by the aem data in the soquel creek area in the salinas valley dataset gottschalk et al discretized the resistivity logs into 15 cm intervals within the screened intervals while the soquel creek resistivity logs were discretized into 1 5 m intervals to account for this difference in discretization when combining these datasets the count in each resistivity bin from the soquel creek dataset was multiplied by a factor of 10 fig 5 shows the combined histograms for the data from monitoring wells in the soquel creek and salinas valley areas this figure shows overlap in the three histograms between 3 and 30 ohm m if the entire area was composed of a single lithological unit and we knew that the water quality measurements were from that unit alone we would expect minimal overlap between the three histograms in the cases of these data however the variable lithology and large screened intervals likely resulting in water quality measurements of each interval which sampling more than one lithologic unit there is significant overlap in these histograms using these combined datasets two cutoff values were determined all resistivity values 3 ohm m are considered to have tds 10 000 mg l and are interpreted to be saltwater saturated sediments or pure seawater and all resistivity values 20 ohm m are considered to have tds 3000 mg l and are interpreted to be freshwater saturated sediments while fig 5 clearly shows that it is possible to have freshwater saturated sediments with resistivity values below 20 ohm m and saltwater saturated sediments with resistivity values above 3 ohm m the intention of these cutoffs is to determine where we can identify with confidence the presence of fresh or saline water there is a small group of resistivity measurements between 20 and 30 ohm m in the 3 000 10 000 mg l tds range but these are considered outliers in this case the isolated cluster of higher resistivity values can be traced back to a single shallow well in the salinas valley dataset looking at the resistivity log over the screened interval of this well there is evidence that the water quality changes within this screened interval despite this interval only having a single water quality measurement as discussed previously this would result in a wider spread in the possible resistivity values assigned to the tds value in that screened interval in this case we can say with confidence that the isolated cluster of higher resistivity values in the 3 000 10 000 mg l tds range have been assigned an inaccurate tds value while the majority of the aem data for this study were collected offshore where sediments would be fully saturated there are two tie lines that extend onshore where unsaturated material above the water table might be encountered in the wells closest to the onshore tie lines the depth to the water table ranges from 1 to 2 mbsl with seasonal variations on the order of 1 m hydrometrics 2017 because these regions will have high resistivity values that could be interpreted as freshwater saturated sediments using the cutoff established above it is also important to also establish a cutoff value above which resistivity values would indicate that the subsurface is unsaturated we adopted the cutoff value established by gottschalk et al 2018 who used a combination of well data and structure in the aem data in the salinas valley area to select a value of 75 ohm m defining all resistivity values above this as indicating unsaturated sediments as an initial assessment of the aem data we produced a histogram of resistivity values from the inversion of the aem data to display the relative volumes of the subsurface sampled by the aem data corresponding to freshwater saturated saltwater saturated and unsaturated sediments we sampled the resistivity models every meter above the doi regardless of model layer thickness the resulting histogram is shown in fig 6 using the defined cutoffs leads us to conclude that 74 25 of the subsurface is saltwater saturated sediments or pure seawater 3 75 is freshwater saturated sediments 0 25 is unsaturated sediments and 21 75 is sediments with water of an undetermined quality the regions with undetermined water quality could be the result of a number of different water quality and lithology combinations and thus will need to be interpreted using additional information such as monitoring wells directly sampling the region or the location of known hydrologic or geologic features in this histogram there is a clear spike around the resistivity of seawater measured as 0 256 ohm m by the mbari c1 marine station resulting from the inverted resistivity models that include a seawater layer we have not attempted to establish a cutoff between seawater and saltwater saturated sediments in the values displayed in the histogram this is because we have very few seawater resistivity measurements and because we expect that the boundaries of the aem resistivity model layers will not perfectly align in all cases with the location of the seafloor as the thicknesses of model layers were fixed in the inversion of these data if the seafloor exists within a model layer the resulting resistivity of that layer will be influenced by both the resistivity of seawater and the resistivity of the underlying sediments 3 3 combined interpretation of ert and aem data the santa cruz mid county groundwater agency aem dataset was predated by another large geophysical survey the collection of ert data on the beach goebel et al 2017 in this study long offset ert data were collected along 40 km of the beach in both a dipole dipole array and gradient array with electrodes spaced every 22 5 m along a 1 8 km active line length these data were processed and inverted to produce resistivity profiles extending down to 280 mbsl with absolute mean percent errors between 7 9 and 12 4 further discussion of the acquisition processing inversion and interpretation of these data can be found in goebel et al 2017 in order to gain the most comprehensive understanding of water quality in the region we wanted to use these onshore ert data in the interpretation of the aem data where the aem data do not extend onshore in our study area we were concerned however that there might be some difference in the data sets simply due to the difference in the physics of the measurements which can result in inconsistencies in the derived resistivity models from the two geophysical methods anschütz et al 2015a b for this reason we elected to first compare data from these two methods in the salinas valley area south of our study area here we had parallel lines of aem and ert data on average less than 50 m apart in an area where we knew based on well data that there was little change in water quality over the distance between these datasets the ert data in the salinas valley area were collected during the same acquisition and using the same methodology that gathered ert data in the soquel creek region the aem data were collected in the salinas valley area within a month of the soquel creek aem data using the same skytem system fig 7 a c show a comparison of the salinas valley aem and ert datasets projected on a north south oriented profile in fig 7a we show the resistivity profile derived from the ert data the ert data have been clipped at their doi a dashed line on top of the ert resistivity profile shows the doi of the aem dataset in fig 7b we take the same 2d plane and show the corresponding resistivity profile derived from the aem data by plotting the closest aem derived resistivity value for each point on the plane we use the same color scale as the ert profile with gray indicating the region falling below the doi in the aem dataset fig 7c shows the difference between the top two plots created by subtracting the ert resistivity values from the aem values we note that difference is plotted on a log scale for both positive and negative differences the region below the doi in the aem dataset is again shown in gray fig 7 shows that overall both the resistivity values and large scale structures mapped with the two methods are very consistent on the right hand side of the two plots we see very good agreement between the aem and ert profiles on the far right of these profiles both show low resistivity in the upper 50 m with a transition to intermediate resistivity below 50 m for the remainder of these two profiles both have low resistivity values in the subsurface below 10 mbsl on the left hand side of the two plots both the aem and ert profiles have low resistivity values along much of the upper 30 m of the subsurface with a transition to intermediate resistivity values below the variable depth at which this transition occurs is consistent between the two profiles there is one difference between the two profiles in the top 10 m of the subsurface that can be attributed to differences in the timing of data acquisition the ert data were acquired in october following the dry season while the aem data were acquired in may following one of the wettest winters on record the red colors in the difference plot in fig 7c indicate that the aem method finds much higher resistivity values than the ert method we conclude that this is due to the presence of significantly more freshwater in the near surface during the aem data acquisition we see one difference between the two datasets that we attribute to the different forms of measurement specifically related to resolution we refer to the area between markers 1 and 2 in the depth range between 25 and 100 m from drillers lithologic logs and water quality data we know that within this zone the thick salinas valley aquitard a clay layer lies above the saltwater intruded 180 ft aquifer in the aem resistivity profile fig 7b these two layers are clearly visible shown as the green clay layer overlying the red saltwater intruded aquifer in the ert profile fig 7a however this whole package appears as a single unit with a resistivity value that falls between those of the two individual layers this difference highlights the established ability of the aem method to resolve small changes in resistivity on the low end of the resistivity spectrum lucius et al 2006 this comparison of the ert and aem datasets in the salinas valley area supports our use of the ert and aem data in the soquel creek area to assist in our interpretation of the variation in water quality in the distance between the two datasets as seen in the comparison above it is important to keep in mind the fact that changes in timing of the data acquisition can lead to changes in resistivity particularly in the very near surface and that there can be differences in the resolution of the two methods 4 results and discussion 4 1 presentation and interpretation of aem inversion results the models produced by inversion of the aem data reveal complex three dimensional resistivity structures in the subsurface we will interpret these structures using the resistivity to water quality transform established above the beach ert survey data from onshore coastal monitoring wells and the mbari marine station the santa cruz mid county groundwater model onshore and offshore and the onshore and offshore digital elevation model dem national ocean and atmospheric association 2012 fig 8 shows a 3d view of the inverted resistivity models from the aem data models have been clipped at their dois resistivity values less than 0 3 ohm m have been omitted removing the seawater layer from this view so as to better highlight the subsurface variability in resistivity the shoreline taken from where the dem was equal to 0 mbls is plotted in black color represents the resistivity values spanning from 0 256 ohm m the annual mean resistivity of the near surface 10 m depth seawater measured at the mbari c1 marine station to 150 ohm m the highest resistivity value found in this study the color bar is also annotated with the cutoff values established in the resistivity to water quality section above in discussing fig 9 and all subsequent figures we describe the presence of saltwater saturated sediments when the resistivity values are below the cut off of 3 ohm m as shown in the color bar and freshwater saturated sediments when the resistivity values are above the cut off of 20 ohm m as shown in the color bar we describe the other regions as being of intermediate resistivity noting that these regions depending on lithology could have water of a quality ranging from saltwater to freshwater this figure shows that there is significant variability in resistivity both laterally and with depth they show that offshore there are portions of the subsurface that can be classified as freshwater saturated as well as portions of the aquifer that can be classified as saltwater saturated fig 9 a h show plan views of the resistivity models derived through inversion of the aem data starting at sea level and extending down 120 mbsl we show shaded dem data in the adjacent onshore region the interval between the depth slices start at 10 m and then increases to 20 m after 40 mbsl for spatial context these data are overlain on a shaded relief image of the onshore dem the resistivity models are only shown above the doi which is the reason why the number of resistivity values the extent of the models decreases with depth there are few locations where the doi exceeded 120 mbsl the figures are annotated with a number of markers that will be referred to in the following discussion an alternate way to view the data in fig 9 is with cross sections which slice the dataset vertically and allow for better visualization of the variation in the resistivity structure with depth the aem 1d models do not lie on a perfectly straight 2d plane in order to make the cross sections we constructed a straight 2d plane coincident with as many of the aem 1d models as possible at locations where the aem models do not lie exactly on this plane the nearest models were plotted on the plane the same procedure was followed in plotting data from nearby wells on the plane the results are 2d cross sections plotting the aem and well data this plotting procedure resulted in a minor apparent mismatch between the dem and the top of the models onshore in some of these figures as the dem was defined exactly of the 2d planes all of the aem models were less than 50 m from the 2d planes and the subsurface geologic structures vary minimally over such a short distance so this plotting approach this has no significant impact on our interpretation fig 10 a c show three such cross sections of the resistivity models perpendicular to the coastline marked as lines x y and z in fig 9 these models are clipped at their dois also layered on fig 10 a c are the dem hydrostratigraphic units from the groundwater model nearby monitoring wells and markers used in the discussion of these data the locations of these cross sections were selected so that they sampled the areas where we see in fig 9 relatively large scale resistivity features let us now refer to the plan sections and cross sections in figs 9 and 10 to interpret features seen within the aem data with the goal of determining water quality in the offshore extent of the groundwater aquifers and the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces in the various hydrostratigraphic units along the coast one easy to interpret feature seen in the aem dataset is the continuous low resistivity layer at the surface offshore which corresponds to the seawater this can be seen in the entire offshore region in fig 9a and in the most distant offshore parts of fig 9b the resistivity values in the seawater layer consistently 0 25 ohm m agree with the near surface 10 m depth annual mean seawater resistivity value of 0 256 ohm m measured at the mbari sampling station c1 the consistency of the resistivity values in this layer across all the aem models is evident in how narrow the peak around 0 25 ohm m is in fig 6 compared to any other peaks in this figure as can be seen in fig 10 a c the lower boundary of the seawater layer as mapped by the aem data aligns very well with the mapped seafloor bathymetry we find that the aem method has accurately captured both the depth and resistivity of the seawater providing evidence of the reliability of the method in this environment we now review the portions of the dataset where the aem data indicate that the subsurface offshore is predominantly saltwater saturated these areas were roughly grouped into the dashed boxes a and b in fig 9 we will begin with a discussion of box a shown in plan view in fig 9 and in cross sections x and y in fig 10a and b interpreting the aem data in these figures using the resistivity to water quality transform shown in the color bar we conclude that most of the sediments offshore in box a are saturated with saltwater the two resistivity cross sections x and y in fig 10a and b display the classic wedge shape associated with saltwater intrusion with the depth at which saltwater saturated sediments are found increasing inland with distance from the shore we see a thick section of freshwater saturated sediments in the upper portion of the onshore aromas formation with evidence that saltwater extends onshore into the sediments within the lower portion of the formation both of the cross sections x and y in fig 10a and b are overlain with the locations of the monitoring wells closest to the cross section with the tds values in their screened intervals annotated alongside the screened interval and the distance between the well and the profile noted above the well the tds values in the aromas formation where the aem data indicate freshwater saturated sediments range from 145 to 364 mg l also indicating freshwater the tds value in the aromas formation where the aem data indicate saltwater saturated sediments is 18 000 mg l also showing saltwater within this formation this agreement between the aem and well data validates our approach to the interpretation of aem data in terms of water quality it also highlights the ability of the aem data to fill in the spatial gaps in the monitoring well network allowing us to track the freshwater saltwater interface in the aromas formation away from the point locations where it is observed in wells in addition to showing saltwater saturated sediments extending onshore in the aromas formation fig 10b shows saltwater extending onshore in the deeper purisima def f unit which is only above the doi for a small number of the models shown in fig 10a the two wells that are screened within this unit both show high tds values again agreeing with our interpretation of the aem data here the aem data can be interpreted as showing saltwater extending at least 1 5 km inland within the def f unit the aem profiles parallel to the coastline within box a in fig 9 show predominantly saltwater in the subsurface offshore while this is useful in determining the water quality of the subsurface offshore they do not allow us to locate the freshwater saltwater interfaces within the hydrogeologic units imaged as in most of box a it appears the interfaces are inland of the closest aem line parallel to the coast 200 m offshore only the two tie lines discussed above which extend onshore are able to directly locate a freshwater saltwater interface and resolve its geometry as it extends from the shoreline onshore within the aromas formation next we will use the combined interpretation of the closest aem profile parallel to the shore and the long offset ert profile along the beach by including the ert dataset in our interpretation of the aem dataset we can bridge the gap between the offshore aem data and the onshore monitoring wells to better constrain the exact location of the freshwater saltwater interface within each of the units imaged by the aem dataset this allows us to maximize the information gained from the new offshore dataset fig 11 a and b show a comparison of the resistivity profiles created from inversion of the onshore ert data and the offshore aem data along the closest flight line parallel to the coast projected on a north south profile the distance between these two profiles is approximately 200 m the ert derived resistivity profile is in fig 11a and the aem derived resistivity profile is in fig 11b both on the same color scale both profiles display results above their respective dois with the doi of the aem dataset shown as a dashed line on the ert profile in both figures the two vertical dashed black lines mark the bounds of box a seen in the plan views in fig 9 the two vertical dashed gray lines show where cross sections x and y seen in fig 10a and b and located in plan view on fig 9 intersect these profiles included on both figures are the hydrostratigraphic units from the groundwater model labeled as named in table 1 and markers 1 to 5 which are referred to in the following discussion for consistency fig 11b is also annotated with the same fw markers used in figs 9 and 10 referencing locations discussed later in the text a comparison of fig 11a and b shows that there are some locations where the two methods show similar resistivity values and structures in the subsurface and some locations where they are quite different in the top few meters of the aem profile is the low resistivity layer corresponding to the seawater layer this is not seen in the ert profile as the data were acquired onshore between markers 1 and 2 the two datasets show similar resistivity structures suggesting that there is little change in the subsurface between these profiles in the top 25 m both profiles predominantly show saltwater saturated sediments yellows through reds though the aem profile consistently shows lower resistivity values than the ert profile possibly suggesting more saline water offshore both then show a zone of intermediate resistivity greens and yellows beginning near the surface below marker 2 and extending to greater depths towards marker 1 this intermediate resistivity zone is much more defined in the aem profile a possible reason for this is that as established in the combined interpretation of ert and aem data section the aem method is better able to resolve small scale changes in resistivity at the low resistivity end of the spectrum than the ert method therefore this intermediate resistivity unit which has a resistivity only a few ohm m higher than the surrounding saltwater saturated sediments in the aem profile is much more clearly defined in the aem profile the fact that neither the ert nor aem profiles contain any resistivity values that fall in the zone classified as freshwater saturated sediments and a significant number of resistivity values that can be classified as saltwater saturated sediments suggest that the intrusion interface is inland of the ert profile this conclusion is consistent with water quality measurements made in monitoring wells as shown in fig 1b saltwater intrusion has been mapped onshore in the aromas formation using well data within this area between markers 2 and 3 in fig 11 the two datasets are quite different the aem profile shows that the subsurface is almost entirely saltwater saturated the ert profile shows saltwater saturated sediments at depth but in the upper 30 m shows freshwater saturated sediments or resistivity values in the intermediate range this difference is interpreted to be the result of these datasets being collected on opposite sides of the freshwater saltwater interface at the surface the location of the ert profile is such that it captures the transition from freshwater saturated to saltwater saturated sediments whereas the aem dataset is seaward of this transition at all depths this interpretation is consistent with the data shown in figs 10a and b where the saltwater saturated sediments extended onshore in the classic wedge shape described by the ghyben herzberg model with a package of freshwater saturated sediments above the intrusion front that increases in thickness moving onshore while it fluctuates somewhat the depth to the saltwater saturated sediments in the ert datasets is relatively constant between markers 2 and 3 using the observed differences between the profiles in fig 11 and the understandings gained from the interpretations of fig 10a and b we conclude that the saltwater saturated sediments seen in the aem data offshore connect to the saltwater saturated sediments seen in the ert data below 30 m in a wedge shape which extends a short distance onshore in the aromas formation between markers 3 and 4 in fig 11b we see saltwater saturated sediments at the top of the aem profile underlain by a region of intermediate resistivity with more saltwater saturated sediments at the base the transition to saltwater saturated sediments at the base of the layer of intermediate resistivity occurs along the boundary of the aromas formation and def f units as mapped in the groundwater model of this region in contrast at the onshore location of the ert profile none of the subsurface is classified as saltwater saturated with the high resistivity values corresponding to freshwater saturated sediments in the top 30 m we can use well data along with these two datasets to develop an understanding of the location of the freshwater saltwater interfaces in the aromas formation and the def f unit within the aromas formation tds measurements in well sc a8 275 m from the shore indicate freshwater based on the well data and ert profile we can conclude that between markers 3 and 4 the freshwater saltwater interface is likely entirely offshore in the aromas formation the intermediate resistivity zone seen within the aromas formation in the aem profile may represent a transition zone from freshwater to saltwater within this unit offshore within the def f unit tds measurements in well sc a8 275 m from the shore indicate the subsurface is saltwater saturated while other monitoring wells further inland of this indicate the unit is freshwater saturated based on these well data combined with the intermediate resistivity observed in the def f unit in the ert profile and the saltwater saturated sediments observed in the aem profile we conclude that the freshwater saltwater interface exists onshore somewhere between sc a8 and the surrounding monitoring wells to the north and west within the def f unit between markers 4 and 5 the aem profile shows the subsurface to be fully saltwater saturated the ert profile shows freshwater saturated sediments in the near surface with patches of saltwater saturated sediments in the def f unit near marker 5 within the aromas formation we interpret the contrast between these two profiles as their being on opposite sides of the freshwater saltwater interface placing its location somewhere offshore between the two profiles in fig 11 this interpretation is supported by tds measurements in the nearest monitoring well sc a1 located 340 m inland from the shore which indicate freshwater in the aromas formation within the def f unit comparison of the ert and aem profiles suggests significant variation in the location of the freshwater saltwater interface over a short distance near marker 5 we interpret the saltwater saturated patches seen in the def f unit in the ert profile to be the onshore extent of the saltwater saturated sediments in def f unit seen in the aem profile this interpretation would suggest that near marker 5 the freshwater saltwater interface is inland of the ert profile contradicting this interpretation is a measurement of freshwater in monitoring well sc 8 located 100 m from the shore but the long length of the screened interval of the well makes this measurement unreliable near marker 4 in the def f unit the ert profile shows freshwater saturated sediments in the upper 50 m of the subsurface while the aem profile shows saltwater saturated sediments everywhere here we interpret the two profiles as being on opposite sides of the freshwater saltwater interface placing its location somewhere offshore between the two profiles in fig 11 this is supported by measurements of freshwater in the def f unit in sc a8 the nearest well to marker 4 our interpretation placing the freshwater saltwater interface onshore near marker 5 and offshore near marker 4 shows how variable the location of the interface can be within a single unit the sharp boundary between these two zones and the fact that this boundary appears to parallel the boundaries between the hydrostratigraphic units in fig 11b suggests that the variation within this unit could be the result of further lithologic stratification within the unit with the joint interpretation of the aem and ert datasets we have been able to better constrain the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces within box a where the aem data showed the subsurface was predominantly saltwater saturated let us now consider box b shown in fig 9 in the easternmost portion of the aem dataset in this region no aem tie lines extend onshore and there are no coastal ert data there are however a number of monitoring wells near the coast with water quality measurements that can be compared to the offshore aem data as seen in fig 9 all of the regions sampled by the aem data within box b show the subsurface to be saltwater saturated contrary to what is seen in the aem dataset the majority of the water quality measurements in wells inland of box b suggest that onshore sediments are freshwater saturated at all of the depths imaged by the aem data only two of the monitoring wells show elevated tds values these are soquel point and moran lake monitoring wells shown in fig 1b these wells show tds values of 2400 and 510 mg l in 2016 respectively within the a hydrostratigraphic unit hydrometrics 2017 while these tds values are below the limit for our saltwater saturated classification they are higher than measurements made in wells further inland within box b with the aem data showing that just offshore the a unit is fully saltwater saturated we conclude that these elevated tds measurements represent the front of saltwater intrusion within this unit these two same monitoring wells do not show evidence of intrusion in their deepest screened intervals within the aa unit despite the fact that the aem data in fig 9 show that the subsurface is saltwater saturated offshore at all depths a likely explanation for this is that differences in lithology and or pumping rates between the two units is causing intrusion into the a unit before the aa unit while the aem data do not allow us to determine the exact location of the freshwater saltwater interface within box b in fig 9 they do constrain it to being within the 200 m between the wells at the shore and the first aem profile offshore at all depths for most of box b referring again to fig 9 let us now discuss the areas offshore where the subsurface is either of intermediate resistivity light green to mid blue on the resistivity color scale or resistive enough to be classified as freshwater saturated these locations are annotated with fw1 fw5 in fig 9 and where they are present in figs 10 and 11 the largest of these at noted by fw5 in fig 9 can be seen to extend as far as 2 5 km offshore from the seafloor to the bottom of the doi as was discussed in the resistivity to water quality transform section above values within the intermediate resistivity range could represent a wide range of pore water salinities depending on the lithology specifically the clay content for this reason these features must be interpreted using auxiliary information features fw1 fw4 are all located near the mouths of streams or rivers that connect to the ocean some seasonally and some year round our interpretation is that these regions have higher water quality associated with these features due to recharge through the base of the streams or rivers or subsurface stream flow the feature labeled fw3 in fig 9 appears to be connected to the larger region of intermediate resistivity values in the ert dataset shown between markers 3 and 4 in fig 11 and to freshwater observed in monitoring wells onshore the larger feature labeled fw5 is also interpreted to correspond to a region of higher water quality as with the features labeled fw1 fw4 this zone is connected to the mouths of a number of rivers and streams which are likely introducing the fresher water to this area a cross section through this feature can be seen in fig 10c within fig 10c this intermediate resistivity feature is seen to fill all of the hydrostratigraphic bc unit closest to the shoreline in fig 10c the resistivity values in the bc unit are high enough to be classified as freshwater saturated sediments the resistivity values in this unit then gradually decrease with increasing distance from the shore in a transition from the freshwater saturated region to the surrounding regions of fully saltwater saturated sediments 4 2 assessment of anomalously low resistivity features as discussed in the aem data acquisition processing and inversion section this study employed a 1d spatially constrained inversion scheme which may not be appropriate for use where there are abrupt lateral changes is resistivity that violate the 1d assumption there are two areas with zones of anomalously low resistivity values near the coast that we interpret to be artifacts of the inversion scheme due to such abrupt changes in resistivity the locations of these features can be seen in fig 9h within the dashed boxes c and d a cross sectional view through one of these features can be seen at the bottom of fig 10c near the shoreline these features are above the doi and examination of the raw data and inversion results would not suggest that these are the result of any noise source despite this there are a number of reasons to conclude that these features are not real the first is that the standard deviations on the resistivity values with the layers containing the anomalous values are significantly higher than elsewhere in the models the second was that there were challenges in reaching good inversion convergence on the data lastly these are highly unlikely to be hydrogeologic features for a number of reasons these features do not appear to be connected to saltwater intruded sediments further offshore given the hydrogeologic setting and depositional history any large low resistivity feature in a unit onshore would be expected to connect to saltwater saturated sediments in that same unit offshore additionally the inverted resistivity values within these features are very low in some cases lower than that of pure seawater 0 25 ohm m which cannot be explained 4 3 implications for groundwater management the interpretation of the aem data acquired in the offshore coastal environment in combination with the existing understanding of this region from ert data and monitoring wells have a number of implications for groundwater management in this region some of the more important of these are summarized below one management strategy in areas under threat of saltwater intrusion is to ensure that groundwater elevations are maintained at or above the minimum level needed to prevent intrusion as determined through groundwater modeling this minimum level is referred to as the protective groundwater elevation interpretation of the aem dataset within the regions enclosed by box a and box b of fig 9 suggests that it is critical to reach and or maintain protective groundwater elevations in these regions at present the onshore sediments in these regions are predominantly saturated with freshwater with limited evidence of saltwater saturation but the aem data have revealed that the freshwater saltwater interface is very close to the coastline with the subsurface predominantly saltwater saturated just offshore combining the interpretation of the aem dataset with onshore well data suggest specific priority areas within the regions enclosed by box a and box b one such area is the portion of the actively pumped def f unit that falls in box a where a few onshore monitoring wells have encountered intrusion a number of these wells show groundwater elevations below their protective elevations another area is the portion of the a unit within box b as water quality measurements in two wells onshore suggest intrusion may be occurring in this unit proactively increasing groundwater elevations in these areas either by reducing pumping or with managed aquifer recharge could prevent further onshore movement of the freshwater saltwater interface interpretation of the intermediate resistivity zones labeled fw1 fw5 in fig 9 suggests that these are zones with lower salinity water most of these zones are above the depths of the screened intervals of pumping wells and therefore do not likely represent future potential water sources for human use identification of these lower salinity water zones offshore is still useful however as they likely play an important role in maintaining pressure against saltwater intrusion into the deeper portions of the hydrogeologic units in which they reside lastly this new aem dataset and derived interpretations provide a baseline for assessing changes in the hydrologic system using future this could be accomplished using ground based monitoring such as new and existing monitoring wells or future aem acquisitions extensive calibration of the system used to acquire these aem data means that the acquisition can be repeated in the future and be compared to this baseline to map changes in subsurface resistivity over time 5 conclusions the goal of this study was to determine the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces within the soquel creek region our approach was to use a combination of offshore aem data onshore ert data and onshore monitoring well data we found that by using an extremely low acquisition repetition frequency allowing the system to collect at very late time gates 20 ms the aem was able to image to the depths of interest the upper aquifers beneath seawater depth of up to 18 m we found that interpretation of the extent of intrusion onshore from the aem data using a resistivity to water quality transform developed using only well data were consistent with the previously mapped extents of intrusion onshore where a freshwater saltwater interface was present where aem data was acquired the aem data alone accurately located the interface where a freshwater saltwater interface was not below a flight line the location of the interface could be constrained using joint interpretation of the aem data and existing onshore datasets we found the location of the freshwater saltwater interfaces to be extremely variable within the study area both between the different hydrogeologic units and within individual hydrogeologic units at different points along the coast notably we located a region where freshwater extended offshore within the subsurface this study has highlighted the importance of careful interpretation of aem data in the context of their hydrogeologic setting in coastal regions such as studied here with active saltwater intrusion there can be abrupt and extreme lateral changes in resistivity in these cases the 1d assumption in the inversion scheme most commonly used is not valid and can result in inversion artifacts we conclude based on the results of our study that aem data can play an essential role in mapping and monitoring saltwater intrusion a role that cannot be as easily or cost effectively filled by any other existing technology the ability to determine the variation in water quality in the offshore extents of aquifers the acquisition of data in the offshore coastal environment allowed us to better constrain the locations of the freshwater saltwater interfaces within the various hydrogeologic units and identify the regions most at risk for future intrusion these findings can support the development of proactive strategies for groundwater management by establishing a baseline for water quality in the offshore extents of the aquifers and by highlighting the locations where management actions should be targeted acknowledgments we would like to thank ron duncan from the santa cruz mid county

8442,study region the lower flint river basin lfrb a karst catchment in southwestern georgia usa study focus using the u s epa reach file 3 data set we generated stream reach azimuths for all tributaries of the lower flint river basin lfrb in southwestern georgia usa then compared these results to regional bedrock jointing orientations and stream chemistry indicating incoming groundwater discharge in one tributary of the lfrb ichawaynochaway creek our objective was to determine if stream bearing might be a useful predictor of increased groundwater discharge in streams of the lfrb where groundwater development has significantly impacted baseflows new hydrological insights for the region we identified a dominant n s trend in 44 of reaches in tributaries of the lfrb with lesser e w nnw nw and ne trends bedrock joints and stream reaches in ichawaynochaway creek a tributary of the flint river shared similar azimuth trends when we compared stream reach orientation with known locations of enhanced groundwater inputs previously detected by rugel and others we found that 55 of the time reaches in ichawaynochaway creek with increased groundwater discharge followed nw or nnw bearings mean n49w further investigation to replicate these results in other tributaries of the lfrb is warranted and may help inform management strategies which could protect both ecological and economic interests in this region keywords grondwater discharge karst water resources groundwater surface water interaction 1 introduction the upper floridan aquifer ufa is a carbonate aquifer which underlies the coastal plain of the southeastern united states miller 1986 karstification within the ocala limestone formation which forms the major water bearing unit of this aquifer has resulted in high secondary permeability and heterogeneous connections with regional streams stringfield 1966 mosner 2002 jones and torak 2006 the ufa currently provides over 15 million cubic meters of groundwater per day for agricultural municipal industrial and domestic use to portions of alabama georgia south carolina and all of florida withdrawal of groundwater from the floridan aquifer system rose 500 between 1950 and 2000 with the greatest increases occurring in the 1970 s after the introduction of center pivot irrigation systems pierce et al 1984 johnston and bush 1988 marcella and berndt 2005 the lower flint river basin lfrb which lies within the dougherty plain physiographic district of southwestern georgia usa underwent extensive agricultural development during this period because of the close hydraulic connection between the ufa and tributaries in the lfrb hicks et al 1987 intensive withdrawal of groundwater and surface water has contributed significantly to reducing baseflows in and beyond the growing season stamey 1996 couch and mcdowell 2006 rugel et al 2012 streams in the lfrb host a diverse aquatic fauna including multiple species of federally listed and endangered mussels which are adapted to the unique physiochemical and structural habitats of this basin golladay et al 2004 previous modeling suggests that current agricultural water usage increases the likelihood of extirpation of several species of mussels in these waters albertson and torak 2002 peterson et al 2011 since farm gate profits account for as much as 34 of regional revenues a greater understanding of aquifer stream interaction is essential to the protection of endemic aquatic fauna as well as the economic security of this heavily allocated region boatright and mckissick 2004 topographic near surface features such as lineaments and sinkhole development have been used to determine the relationships between jointing dissolution trends and well productivity in portions of the lfrb and other karst watersheds brook and sun 1986 hyatt and jacobs 1996 white 1999 dinger et al 2002 however these relationships remain understudied in many sub basins of the lfrb where groundwater use is impacting low flows and threatening endangered and listed aquatic species identifying hydrogeomorphic patterns in regions where withdrawals are currently reducing baseflow may help predict surface and sub surface connectivity and support prudent resource management of this and other heavily developed catchments our objective was to examine large and small scale hydrogeomorphic patterns at the near surface of a karst basin to determine their usefulness as predictors of enhanced groundwater discharge to this end we assessed basin level river and tributary reach orientations azimuths in the lfrb to ascertain patterns in reach bearing within the basin secondly we conducted field measurements of instream bedrock jointing azimuths within one major tributary of the lfrb ichawaynochaway creek which is heavily developed for groundwater use we compared these findings to stream azimuths of sections of ichawaynochaway creek where increased groundwater inputs were detected in a previous study rugel et al 2016 to determine whether reach bearing might be a useful predictor of enhanced groundwater discharge in this and other tributaries 2 site description and methods 2 1 study site the study

of carbonate formations from the paleogene period which overlie deeper cretaceous clastic rocks applin and applin 1944 stringfield 1966 together these layers form a wedge shaped series of hydrogeologic units that underlie much of the coastal plain region of alabama georgia south carolina and all of florida these carbonate formations including the ocala limestone consist mainly of uncemented marine sediments which thin in a northwesterly direction where they interfinger and outcrop along the inside margin of the fall line hills hicks et al 1987 collectively they thicken in a southeasterly direction towards the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean miller 1992 dissolution during the pleistocene enlarged fractures and conduit passageways consistent with jointing within these formations ultimately creating the upper floridan aquifer ufa stringfield 1966 miller 1986 florea et al 2007 within the lfrb this karstified aquifer is overlain by undifferentiated sediments of upper oligocene limestone and miocene clays and sands mantled by an unconsolidated overburden of neogene sediments and confined below by the eocene lisbon formation the ufa ranges from a few meters thick in northwestern portions of the dougherty plain updip extent to over 150 m in the southeasterly direction as it approaches the pelham escarpment and the tifton upland district it may be confined semi confined or unconfined in the study area depending on depth and condition of overburden transmissivity in the ufa within the lfrb ranges from 1 9 102 m2d 1 to 1 0 105 m2d 1 hicks et al 1987 tributaries in the lfrb including kinchafoonee muckalee ichawaynochaway chickasawhatchee and spring creek begin as seeps and springs inside the fall line hills and flow across the dougherty plain into the lower flint river karstification of underlying limestone and erosion of overburden in this region has directed much of the surface drainage below ground and established a close hydraulic connection between surface water and groundwater hicks et al 1987 mosner 2002 torak and painter 2006 rugel et al 2012 3 methods 3 1 stream tributary and river reach orientation analysis the u s epa reach file version 3 rf3 for the conterminous united states 1 100 000 scale digital line graph hydrography was used to determine orientation trends azimuths of all reaches in the lfrb stream river and tributary herein described as stream segments or stream reaches these include all reaches within the rf3 data set excluding portions of the streams or rivers which are impounded see below to segment the original line file a visual basic script was generated in an arcview v 3 extension adapted for arcgis v 9 jenness 2007 the code pathfind avx dissected the continuous reach line data at all stream turns greater than 20 to characterize stream segment azimuth and length for each resulting stream tributary and river reach fig 2 a 20 cutoff was deemed sufficient to account for deviations in gps waypoint and hydrograph data while capturing most directional changes since rivers in the lfrb display an angular drainage pattern changing mostly in 45 turns twidale 2004 polygon data that represented lakes wetlands or reservoirs in the original file were manually excluded from the analysis data on azimuths and lengths of segments dbf were exported into microsoft excel then azimuths were loaded into a boreland c program http www borland com to generate rose diagrams circular histograms fracture rose v 1 0 3 1 jdowd uga edu these diagrams generated 36 bin divisions of 5 arcs with mirrored sets projected for enhanced 360 display mirrored sets were for visual purposes only and did not represent additional data supplementary tools used to create the rose diagram program included steema tee chart www steema com dew research mtxvec www dewresearch com lmd tools www lmdinnovative com and axolot xlsreadwrite www axolot com rose diagrams with 5 arc divisions were generated for the entire lfrb stream segment data set n 37 134 then repeated separately on major tributaries of interest including ichawaynochaway spring big cypress pachitla chickasawhatchee kiokee kinchafoonee and muckalee creeks and the main stem of the lower flint river azimuths between 90 and 180 were then rotated clockwise by 90 and combined with the observed azimuths between 0 and 90 to generate histograms of entire lfrb and ichawaynochaway creek to examine the relationship between stream segment length azimuth and frequency 3 2 instream bedrock jointing measurements to assess regional jointing trends bedrock joints fractures in outcropping ocala limestone were visually surveyed and measured in the field along adjoining segments of lower ichawaynochaway creek figs 1 and 2 this stream is a major tributary of the lfrb and has experienced a 49 decline in low flow metrics compared to pre development years pre and post 1970 rugel et al 2012 downstream portions of this stream are deeply incised into the ocala limestone of the ufa and joints are visible in the stream bedrock a semi contiguous set of fractures beginning approximately 0 5 km upstream from the confluence of ichawaynochaway creek and the flint river and continuing approximately 4 km upstream was measured at low discharge during 2011 drought flows fig 2 all accessible fractures measuring at least 2 m in length were chosen for the analysis n 130 fracture azimuths lengths and widths as well as distinguishing characteristics of joints sinuosity degradation and termination points were recorded along approximately 3 5 km of streambed excluding small sections approximately 5 15 m where fractures were immeasurable due to deep water navigational coordinates were gathered at the terminus of each fracture using a garmin oregon 550 hand held gps and azimuths were taken using a brunton field transit adjusted 4 6 w for regional declination https www ngdc noaa gov geomag web declination accessed april 2011 fracture extents lengths included only that portion of the fracture contained within the streambed regardless of continuation beyond the stream i e into bank following field reconnaissance shapefiles were downloaded into arcgis v 9 using dnrgarmin v 5 4 0 1 a freeware arcview extension program created and made available by the minnesota department of natural resources http www dnr state mn us mis gis tools arcview extensions dnrgarmin dnrgarmin html additional code was written to generate the location direction and extent of each fracture for mapping display purposes instream azimuths were used to produce rose diagrams for comparing bedrock joint trends 36 5 bins as above azimuths of fractures between 90 and 180 were rotated clockwise by 90 and combined with the observed azimuths between 0 and 90 to generate histograms for comparison and analysis 3 3 stream reaches with enhanced groundwater discharge during a previous study rugel et al 2016 stepwise increases in groundwater inflows were detected in some reaches along a 50 km study section of ichawaynochaway creek using specific conductance calcium nitrates alkalinity and stable isotopes δ 18o and δd sampling at 1 km intervals specific conductance highly correlated with calcium in the study site increased an average of 1μs cm km moving downstream along the 50 km section however significantly greater increases per km were repeatedly detected in some stream reaches suggesting incoming groundwater and enhanced surface subsurface connectivity around those locations for the present study we assumed this incoming groundwater was generated from a point slightly upstream from where it was detected therefore we projected waypoints 50 m upstream from each collection point in the 2016 study to represent the presumed origin of incoming groundwater and account for downstream mixing fig 3 we then determined the azimuth of the stream reach segments where each projected point was located n 150 azimuths between 90 and 180 were rotated clockwise by 90 and combined with the observed azimuths between 0 and 90 to generate histograms of all projected points a gaussian normal fit was estimated using the matlab version 9 3 0 713579 r2017b function normfit the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to test the null hypothesis that stream reaches where enhanced groundwater was detected shared the same distribution as all reaches sampled within ichawaynochaway creek finally we generated a rose diagram which represented the orientation trends in all reaches where specific conductance increased 2μs cm km 100 or above the mean change 1μs cm km detected along the stream route 4 results 4 1 stream tributary and river reach azimuth analysis analysis of all stream tributary and river reaches within the lfrb n 37 134 showed a dominant azimuth trend in the ns direction fig 4 other lesser trends were oriented ew and approximately n45 w additionally a nnw trend around n24 w and two weaker nne trends n20e and n40e were present stream reaches with a ns bearing occurred 44 more frequently than reaches with any other azimuth trend but were more often shorter than other trends fig 5 when tributaries of the lfrb were examined individually they also reflected the dominant n s trends with lesser e w and nw trends fig 6 similar to the composite lfrb data set major distinctions between these tributaries included a pronounced nw trend in big cypress creek as dominant as the n s trend strong nw trends are also seen in the ichawaynochaway pachitla spring kinchafoonee and muckalee creeks western and northern side of basin fig 6 this trend became less prominent around the southeastern portion of the basin particularly in reaches of the lower flint river chickasawhatchee and kiokee creek mid basin and the main stem of the lower flint river which displayed stronger but scattered n nne and ne trends compared to streams west and north of these tributaries 4 2 instream bedrock joint trend analysis bedrock joint azimuths measured in limestone outcrops within ichawaynochaway creek n 130 figs 7 and 8 showed some similarities to trends in reach azimuth for this tributary see section 4 1 with n s joints occurring most frequently followed by lesser and more scattered nw and ne sets median joint length was 6 3 m and ranged from 1 6 to over 50 m median aperture of joints was 10 cm from 1 0 to 40 6 cm joint length versus joint azimuth was not formally evaluated since some fractures extended but were not measurable beyond the streambed 4 3 reaches with increased groundwater discharge fig 9 shows a histogram of the frequency of stream reaches of all samples collected by rugel and others 2016 see section 3 3 along a 50 km section of ichawaynochaway creek as a function of stream reach azimuth the stacked bars indicate the degree to which specific conductance increased in stream samples along the collection route with different bearings these increases represent the difference in specific conductance interpreted as incoming groundwater between sampling points 1 km apart along the stream a constant distribution uniform fit of incoming groundwater was found in 65 of all reaches sampled however a peak in specific conductance was found in 35 of the reaches these increases occurred most often in reaches bearing nw and nnw precisely around the mean reach azimuth of 138 09 11 75 n42 w centroid of the gaussian fit the kolmogorov smirnov test on the gaussian fit failed to show that the gaussian fit could be rejected ks stat 0 394 p 0 26 fig 10 is a rose diagram of the azimuths of stream reaches where specific conductance increased 2μs cm km 100 or more above the mean increase of 1μs cm km in the aforementioned stream study rugel et al 2016 the figure shows the largest increases in conductance detected during that study were found in reaches with nnw and nw orientations specifically of all reaches where specific conductance increased 2μs cm km 55 had nnw or nw bearings 34 nw 21 nnw mean azimuth for those reaches was 311 32 10 82 n48 69w 10 82 and mode was 325 62 14 01 n34 40w 14 01 5 discussion 5 1 stream reach bedrock joint and groundwater discharge trends in this study using the u s epa rf3 we were able to identify several prevailing trends in reach orientations within the lfrb the dominant reach azimuth throughout the entire lfrb was n s fig 4 with secondary trends bearing e w nw se and ne sw as expected many of these trends were reflected in individual tributaries of the lfrb with variations within the basin which will be discussed later in this section fig 6 not surprisingly bedrock jointing patterns measured in outcrops within ichawaynochaway creek shared similarities with some reach azimuths for that stream with a dominant n s trend and lesser e w and nw se trends figs 6 and 8 the fact that both large and small scale hydrogeomorphic trends stream orientation and joint orientation shared similarities is not unexpected as fluvial geomorphology often aligns with regional jointing melton 1959 stringfield 1966 freeze and cherry 1979 hancock and engelder 1989 however a pivotal finding of the current study is that where significant changes in groundwater discharge were detected in ichawaynochaway creek by rugel et al 2016 the stream reaches followed nw or nnw bearings mean n48w 10 82 fig 10 55 of the time despite their ubiquity the n s reaches appear to be less hydraulically connective in the ichawaynochaway tributary it is possible that these reaches may not interact with deeper more active dissolution features in this portion of the basin which follow nw se trends to ensure that the n s trend was not an artifact fabricated by the fracture rose program we re ran rf3 data back through matlab with identical results the fact that the n s trend was also present in the ichawaynochaway joints measured in the ocala limestone outcrops suggests that the trend is real and not an artifact of the rf3 data set or other programs used in this study these results are novel to this basin but in agreement with previous observations in adjoining portions of the lfrb where jointing trends influenced regional dissolution and groundwater flow brook and sun 1986 showed that 79 of specific capacity in wells measured in dougherty county could be attributed to proximity to joints and or joint intersections in addition brook and allison 1983 concluded that sinkhole formation in dougherty county was influenced by a conjugate set of fractures around n35 w and n40e and hypothesized these jointing sets were propagated upward from basement rocks into the younger overlying sediments hyatt and jacobs 1996 also showed that after record rainfalls during tropical storm alberto in 1994 312 sinkholes formed in albany ga following joint controlled linear trends including n55 w n45e and n5w orientations in the basin scale analysis we were able to detect where reach bearing trends deviate across the lfrb fig 6 for example while the n s trend dominated in almost all tributaries the nw se trend was equally strong in big cypress creek in fact the southwestern and northern tributaries in the lfrb showed stronger reach azimuth trends in the nw se direction big cypress spring ichawaynochaway pachitla kinchafoonee and muckalee creeks with less pronounced trends in ne sw reaches this pattern began to shift in the central and southeastern tributaries where after the n s trend reaches had either a mixture of ne sw and nw se reaches chickasawhatchee creek or showed a greater occurrence of ne sw reaches kiokee creek and lower stem of the flint river compared to the rest of the basin while the reason for this shift is unclear and outside the scope of this study it may be a relic of transitional atlantic and gulf coast stress fields in this region zoback and zoback 1980 we can conjecture that if stream reaches throughout the lfrb make these directional transitions then jointing patterns may also reflect those changes as these transitions occur across the basin if in fact they are driven by jointing trends groundwater discharge might be found in stream reaches following orientations in those emergent trends some of the transitional patterns found in this study are reflected in the orientational changes in joints measured in upland outcrops around this region mcdowell 2012 5 2 significance and further avenues of research the results of this study are notable and suggest that further ground truthing of jointing patterns and locations of groundwater discharge in other tributaries of the lfrb is warranted if predictable patterns emerge they may be useful to water resource management for creating strategies which protect reaches where increased groundwater is detected these studies may be aided by lidar as well as available remote sensing data sets for wetlands vegetation and lineaments cahalan and milewski 2018 remaining questions to be answered include whether groundwater discharge is enhanced in nw se directions in other tributaries in the southwestern and northern portions of the basin with similar nw se reaches does discharge follow a different pattern in tributaries in the southwestern portion of the lfrb where reaches trend more towards ne sw bearings is groundwater discharge enhanced around creek vertices where these orientations or joints intersect does length of reach influence discharge stream reversals due to natural or anthropogenic causes create losing stream conditions leading to baseflow capture and risk of groundwater contamination some portions of the lfrb including the ichawaynochaway and spring creek sub basins are already restricted from further development due to the deleterious effects of irrigation on low flows in these areas couch and mcdowell 2006 rugel et al 2016 these two sub basins have the highest density of groundwater and surface water permits in the state in a region where streams cut deep into the ocala limestone if reproducible in other sub basins the methods used in this study could potentially identify and predict where groundwater discharge is occurring in other major tributaries of the lfrb guiding management strategies into areas where the greatest protection is needed this might include regulating and incentivizing additional distance between groundwater wells and vulnerable stream reaches or requiring additional buffering requirements in those riparian zones while allowing other areas of less vulnerability to be developed groundwater discharge affects multiple stream parameters including residence time hyporheic exchange temperature bed transport sorting and nutrient loading these physical factors ultimately affect biological complexity productivity and community structure in aquatic systems valett et al 1996 bunn and arthington 2002 freeman et al 2007 identifying regions of groundwater discharge in the lfrb may help determine appropriate sites where populations of sensitive mussels and other groundwater dependent stream species could be protected translocated or removed from reaches where excessive groundwater pumping may have negative and cascading effects on streamflow stamey 1996 albertson and torak 2002 couch and mcdowell 2006 peterson et al 2011 6 conclusion analysis of stream reach orientations in the lfrb using the u s epa reach file 3 indicated a dominant n s azimuth trend occurring up to 44 more often than other stream reach directions with lesser trends oriented e w nw se and ne sw directional trends in

tributaries of the lower flint river basin lfrb in southwestern georgia usa then compared these results to regional bedrock jointing orientations and stream chemistry indicating incoming groundwater

bearings mean n49w further investigation to replicate these results in other tributaries of the lfrb is warranted and may help inform management strategies which could protect both ecological and economic interests in this region keywords grondwater discharge karst water resources groundwater surface water interaction 1 introduction the upper floridan aquifer ufa is a carbonate aquifer which underlies the coastal plain of the southeastern united states miller 1986 karstification within the ocala limestone formation which forms the major water bearing unit of this aquifer has resulted in high secondary permeability and heterogeneous connections with regional streams stringfield 1966 mosner 2002 jones and torak 2006 the ufa currently provides over 15 million cubic meters of groundwater per day for agricultural municipal industrial and domestic use to portions of alabama georgia south carolina and all of florida withdrawal of groundwater from the floridan aquifer system rose 500 between 1950 and 2000 with the greatest increases occurring in the 1970 s after the introduction of center pivot irrigation systems pierce et al 1984 johnston and bush 1988 marcella and berndt 2005 the lower flint river basin lfrb which lies within the dougherty plain physiographic district of southwestern georgia usa underwent extensive agricultural development during this period because of the close hydraulic connection between the ufa and tributaries in the lfrb hicks et al 1987 intensive withdrawal of groundwater and surface water has contributed significantly to reducing baseflows in and beyond the growing season stamey 1996 couch and mcdowell 2006 rugel et al 2012 streams in the lfrb host a diverse aquatic fauna including multiple species of federally listed and endangered mussels which are adapted to the unique physiochemical and structural habitats of this basin golladay et al 2004 previous modeling suggests that current agricultural water usage increases the likelihood of extirpation of several species of mussels in these waters albertson and torak 2002 peterson et al 2011 since farm gate profits account for as much as 34 of regional revenues a greater understanding of aquifer stream interaction is essential to the protection of endemic aquatic fauna as well as the economic security of this heavily allocated region boatright and mckissick 2004 topographic near surface features such as lineaments and sinkhole development have been used to determine the relationships between jointing dissolution trends and well productivity in portions of the lfrb and other karst watersheds brook and sun 1986 hyatt and jacobs 1996 white 1999 dinger et al 2002 however these relationships remain understudied in many sub basins of the lfrb where groundwater use is impacting low flows and threatening endangered and listed aquatic species identifying hydrogeomorphic patterns in regions where withdrawals are currently reducing baseflow may help predict surface and sub surface connectivity and support prudent resource management of this and other heavily developed catchments our objective was to examine large and small scale hydrogeomorphic patterns at the near surface of a karst basin to determine their usefulness as predictors of enhanced groundwater discharge to this end we assessed basin level river and tributary reach orientations azimuths in the lfrb to ascertain patterns in reach bearing within the basin secondly we conducted field measurements of instream bedrock jointing azimuths within one major tributary of the lfrb ichawaynochaway creek which is heavily developed for groundwater use we compared these findings to stream azimuths of sections of ichawaynochaway creek where increased groundwater inputs were detected in a previous study rugel et al 2016 to determine whether reach bearing might be a useful predictor of enhanced groundwater discharge in this and other tributaries 2 site description and methods 2 1 study site the study site lies within the dougherty plain and fall line hills physiographic districts of southwestern georgia usa fig 1 the lfrb consists of approximately 15 100 km2 of gently rolling well drained coastal plain with a slope around 2 m km hicks et al 1987 average annual temperature is 16 c and rainfall averages 1320 mm per year with regional evapotranspiration rates of around 60 lawrimore and peterson 2000 row crop agriculture and pasture lands account for over 50 of land use with remaining acreage in pine plantation deciduous forest and depressional wetlands the region is heavily developed for agriculture with more than 6000 irrigation systems permitted to remove approximately 5 106 m3 of water per day from regional groundwater and surface water sources hook et al 2005 according to usgs gaging data these permitted withdrawals amount to 30 of mean flow 43 of median flow and greater than 200 of the minimum flow of the flint river at bainbridge ga usgs stream gage 02356000 jan 1 2000 to

of carbonate formations from the paleogene period which overlie deeper cretaceous clastic rocks applin and applin 1944 stringfield 1966 together these layers form a wedge shaped series of hydrogeologic units that underlie much of the coastal plain region of alabama georgia south carolina and all of florida these carbonate formations including the ocala limestone consist mainly of uncemented marine sediments which thin in a northwesterly direction where they interfinger and outcrop along the inside margin of the fall line hills hicks et al 1987 collectively they thicken in a southeasterly direction towards the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean miller 1992 dissolution during the pleistocene enlarged fractures and conduit passageways consistent with jointing within these formations ultimately creating the upper floridan aquifer ufa stringfield 1966 miller 1986 florea et al 2007 within the lfrb this karstified aquifer is overlain by undifferentiated sediments of upper oligocene limestone and miocene clays and sands mantled by an unconsolidated overburden of neogene sediments and confined below by the eocene lisbon formation the ufa ranges from a few meters thick in northwestern portions of the dougherty plain updip extent to over 150 m in the southeasterly direction as it approaches the pelham escarpment and the tifton upland district it may be confined semi confined or unconfined in the study area depending on depth and condition of overburden transmissivity in the ufa within the lfrb ranges from 1 9 102 m2d 1 to 1 0 105 m2d 1 hicks et al 1987 tributaries in the lfrb including kinchafoonee muckalee ichawaynochaway chickasawhatchee and spring creek begin as seeps and springs inside the fall line hills and flow across the dougherty plain into the lower flint river karstification of underlying limestone and erosion of overburden in this region has directed much of the surface drainage below ground and established a close hydraulic connection between surface water and groundwater hicks et al 1987 mosner 2002 torak and painter 2006 rugel et al 2012 3 methods 3 1 stream tributary and river reach orientation analysis the u s epa reach file version 3 rf3 for the conterminous united states 1 100 000 scale digital line graph hydrography was used to determine orientation trends azimuths of all reaches in the lfrb stream river and tributary herein described as stream segments or stream reaches these include all reaches within the rf3 data set excluding portions of the streams or rivers which are impounded see below to segment the original line file a visual basic script was generated in an arcview v 3 extension adapted for arcgis v 9 jenness 2007 the code pathfind avx dissected the continuous reach line data at all stream turns greater than 20 to characterize stream segment azimuth and length for each resulting stream tributary and river reach fig 2 a 20 cutoff was deemed sufficient to account for deviations in gps waypoint and hydrograph data while capturing most directional changes since rivers in the lfrb display an angular drainage pattern changing mostly in 45 turns twidale 2004 polygon data that represented lakes wetlands or reservoirs in the original file were manually excluded from the analysis data on azimuths and lengths of segments dbf were exported into microsoft excel then azimuths were loaded into a boreland c program http www borland com to generate rose diagrams circular histograms fracture rose v 1 0 3 1 jdowd uga edu these diagrams generated 36 bin divisions of 5 arcs with mirrored sets projected for enhanced 360 display mirrored sets were for visual purposes only and did not represent additional data supplementary tools used to create the rose diagram program included steema tee chart www steema com dew research mtxvec www dewresearch com lmd tools www lmdinnovative com and axolot xlsreadwrite www axolot com rose diagrams with 5 arc divisions were generated for the entire lfrb stream segment data set n 37 134 then repeated separately on major tributaries of interest including ichawaynochaway spring big cypress pachitla chickasawhatchee kiokee kinchafoonee and muckalee creeks and the main stem of the lower flint river azimuths between 90 and 180 were then rotated clockwise by 90 and combined with the observed azimuths between 0 and 90 to generate histograms of entire lfrb and ichawaynochaway creek to examine the relationship between stream segment length azimuth and frequency 3 2 instream bedrock jointing measurements to assess regional jointing trends bedrock joints fractures in outcropping ocala limestone were visually surveyed and measured in the field along adjoining segments of lower ichawaynochaway creek figs 1 and 2 this stream is a major tributary of the lfrb and has experienced a 49 decline in low flow metrics compared to pre development years pre and post 1970 rugel et al 2012 downstream portions of this stream are deeply incised into the ocala limestone of the ufa and joints are visible in the stream bedrock a semi contiguous set of fractures beginning approximately 0 5 km upstream from the confluence of ichawaynochaway creek and the flint river and continuing approximately 4 km upstream was measured at low discharge during 2011 drought flows fig 2 all accessible fractures measuring at least 2 m in length were chosen for the analysis n 130 fracture azimuths lengths and widths as well as distinguishing characteristics of joints sinuosity degradation and termination points were recorded along approximately 3 5 km of streambed excluding small sections approximately 5 15 m where fractures were immeasurable due to deep water navigational coordinates were gathered at the terminus of each fracture using a garmin oregon 550 hand held gps and azimuths were taken using a brunton field transit adjusted 4 6 w for regional declination https www ngdc noaa gov geomag web declination accessed april 2011 fracture extents lengths included only that portion of the fracture contained within the streambed regardless of continuation beyond the stream i e into bank following field reconnaissance shapefiles were downloaded into arcgis v 9 using dnrgarmin v 5 4 0 1 a freeware arcview extension program created and made available by the minnesota department of natural resources http www dnr state mn us mis gis tools arcview extensions dnrgarmin dnrgarmin html additional code was written to generate the location direction and extent of each fracture for mapping display purposes instream azimuths were used to produce rose diagrams for comparing bedrock joint trends 36 5 bins as above azimuths of fractures between 90 and 180 were rotated clockwise by 90 and combined with the observed azimuths between 0 and 90 to generate histograms for comparison and analysis 3 3 stream reaches with enhanced groundwater discharge during a previous study rugel et al 2016 stepwise increases in groundwater inflows were detected in some reaches along a 50 km study section of ichawaynochaway creek using specific conductance calcium nitrates alkalinity and stable isotopes δ 18o and δd sampling at 1 km intervals specific conductance highly correlated with calcium in the study site increased an average of 1μs cm km moving downstream along the 50 km section however significantly greater increases per km were repeatedly detected in some stream reaches suggesting incoming groundwater and enhanced surface subsurface connectivity around those locations for the present study we assumed this incoming groundwater was generated from a point slightly upstream from where it was detected therefore we projected waypoints 50 m upstream from each collection point in the 2016 study to represent the presumed origin of incoming groundwater and account for downstream mixing fig 3 we then determined the azimuth of the stream reach segments where each projected point was located n 150 azimuths between 90 and 180 were rotated clockwise by 90 and combined with the observed azimuths between 0 and 90 to generate histograms of all projected points a gaussian normal fit was estimated using the matlab version 9 3 0 713579 r2017b function normfit the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to test the null hypothesis that stream reaches where enhanced groundwater was detected shared the same distribution as all reaches sampled within ichawaynochaway creek finally we generated a rose diagram which represented the orientation trends in all reaches where specific conductance increased 2μs cm km 100 or above the mean change 1μs cm km detected along the stream route 4 results 4 1 stream tributary and river reach azimuth analysis analysis of all stream tributary and river reaches within the lfrb n 37 134 showed a dominant azimuth trend in the ns direction fig 4 other lesser trends were oriented ew and approximately n45 w additionally a nnw trend around n24 w and two weaker nne trends n20e and n40e were present stream reaches with a ns bearing occurred 44 more frequently than reaches with any other azimuth trend but were more often shorter than other trends fig 5 when tributaries of the lfrb were examined individually they also reflected the dominant n s trends with lesser e w and nw trends fig 6 similar to the composite lfrb data set major distinctions between these tributaries included a pronounced nw trend in big cypress creek as dominant as the n s trend strong nw trends are also seen in the ichawaynochaway pachitla spring kinchafoonee and muckalee creeks western and northern side of basin fig 6 this trend became less prominent around the southeastern portion of the basin particularly in reaches of the lower flint river chickasawhatchee and kiokee creek mid basin and the main stem of the lower flint river which displayed stronger but scattered n nne and ne trends compared to streams west and north of these tributaries 4 2 instream bedrock joint trend analysis bedrock joint azimuths measured in limestone outcrops within ichawaynochaway creek n 130 figs 7 and 8 showed some similarities to trends in reach azimuth for this tributary see section 4 1 with n s joints occurring most frequently followed by lesser and more scattered nw and ne sets median joint length was 6 3 m and ranged from 1 6 to over 50 m median aperture of joints was 10 cm from 1 0 to 40 6 cm joint length versus joint azimuth was not formally evaluated since some fractures extended but were not measurable beyond the streambed 4 3 reaches with increased groundwater discharge fig 9 shows a histogram of the frequency of stream reaches of all samples collected by rugel and others 2016 see section 3 3 along a 50 km section of ichawaynochaway creek as a function of stream reach azimuth the stacked bars indicate the degree to which specific conductance increased in stream samples along the collection route with different bearings these increases represent the difference in specific conductance interpreted as incoming groundwater between sampling points 1 km apart along the stream a constant distribution uniform fit of incoming groundwater was found in 65 of all reaches sampled however a peak in specific conductance was found in 35 of the reaches these increases occurred most often in reaches bearing nw and nnw precisely around the mean reach azimuth of 138 09 11 75 n42 w centroid of the gaussian fit the kolmogorov smirnov test on the gaussian fit failed to show that the gaussian fit could be rejected ks stat 0 394 p 0 26 fig 10 is a rose diagram of the azimuths of stream reaches where specific conductance increased 2μs cm km 100 or more above the mean increase of 1μs cm km in the aforementioned stream study rugel et al 2016 the figure shows the largest increases in conductance detected during that study were found in reaches with nnw and nw orientations specifically of all reaches where specific conductance increased 2μs cm km 55 had nnw or nw bearings 34 nw 21 nnw mean azimuth for those reaches was 311 32 10 82 n48 69w 10 82 and mode was 325 62 14 01 n34 40w 14 01 5 discussion 5 1 stream reach bedrock joint and groundwater discharge trends in this study using the u s epa rf3 we were able to identify several prevailing trends in reach orientations within the lfrb the dominant reach azimuth throughout the entire lfrb was n s fig 4 with secondary trends bearing e w nw se and ne sw as expected many of these trends were reflected in individual tributaries of the lfrb with variations within the basin which will be discussed later in this section fig 6 not surprisingly bedrock jointing patterns measured in outcrops within ichawaynochaway creek shared similarities with some reach azimuths for that stream with a dominant n s trend and lesser e w and nw se trends figs 6 and 8 the fact that both large and small scale hydrogeomorphic trends stream orientation and joint orientation shared similarities is not unexpected as fluvial geomorphology often aligns with regional jointing melton 1959 stringfield 1966 freeze and cherry 1979 hancock and engelder 1989 however a pivotal finding of the current study is that where significant changes in groundwater discharge were detected in ichawaynochaway creek by rugel et al 2016 the stream reaches followed nw or nnw bearings mean n48w 10 82 fig 10 55 of the time despite their ubiquity the n s reaches appear to be less hydraulically connective in the ichawaynochaway tributary it is possible that these reaches may not interact with deeper more active dissolution features in this portion of the basin which follow nw se trends to ensure that the n s trend was not an artifact fabricated by the fracture rose program we re ran rf3 data back through matlab with identical results the fact that the n s trend was also present in the ichawaynochaway joints measured in the ocala limestone outcrops suggests that the trend is real and not an artifact of the rf3 data set or other programs used in this study these results are novel to this basin but in agreement with previous observations in adjoining portions of the lfrb where jointing trends influenced regional dissolution and groundwater flow brook and sun 1986 showed that 79 of specific capacity in wells measured in dougherty county could be attributed to proximity to joints and or joint intersections in addition brook and allison 1983 concluded that sinkhole formation in dougherty county was influenced by a conjugate set of fractures around n35 w and n40e and hypothesized these jointing sets were propagated upward from basement rocks into the younger overlying sediments hyatt and jacobs 1996 also showed that after record rainfalls during tropical storm alberto in 1994 312 sinkholes formed in albany ga following joint controlled linear trends including n55 w n45e and n5w orientations in the basin scale analysis we were able to detect where reach bearing trends deviate across the lfrb fig 6 for example while the n s trend dominated in almost all tributaries the nw se trend was equally strong in big cypress creek in fact the southwestern and northern tributaries in the lfrb showed stronger reach azimuth trends in the nw se direction big cypress spring ichawaynochaway pachitla kinchafoonee and muckalee creeks with less pronounced trends in ne sw reaches this pattern began to shift in the central and southeastern tributaries where after the n s trend reaches had either a mixture of ne sw and nw se reaches chickasawhatchee creek or showed a greater occurrence of ne sw reaches kiokee creek and lower stem of the flint river compared to the rest of the basin while the reason for this shift is unclear and outside the scope of this study it may be a relic of transitional atlantic and gulf coast stress fields in this region zoback and zoback 1980 we can conjecture that if stream reaches throughout the lfrb make these directional transitions then jointing patterns may also reflect those changes as these transitions occur across the basin if in fact they are driven by jointing trends groundwater discharge might be found in stream reaches following orientations in those emergent trends some of the transitional patterns found in this study are reflected in the orientational changes in joints measured in upland outcrops around this region mcdowell 2012 5 2 significance and further avenues of research the results of this study are notable and suggest that further ground truthing of jointing patterns and locations of groundwater discharge in other tributaries of the lfrb is warranted if predictable patterns emerge they may be useful to water resource management for creating strategies which protect reaches where increased groundwater is detected these studies may be aided by lidar as well as available remote sensing data sets for wetlands vegetation and lineaments cahalan and milewski 2018 remaining questions to be answered include whether groundwater discharge is enhanced in nw se directions in other tributaries in the southwestern and northern portions of the basin with similar nw se reaches does discharge follow a different pattern in tributaries in the southwestern portion of the lfrb where reaches trend more towards ne sw bearings is groundwater discharge enhanced around creek vertices where these orientations or joints intersect does length of reach influence discharge stream reversals due to natural or anthropogenic causes create losing stream conditions leading to baseflow capture and risk of groundwater contamination some portions of the lfrb including the ichawaynochaway and spring creek sub basins are already restricted from further development due to the deleterious effects of irrigation on low flows in these areas couch and mcdowell 2006 rugel et al 2016 these two sub basins have the highest density of groundwater and surface water permits in the state in a region where streams cut deep into the ocala limestone if reproducible in other sub basins the methods used in this study could potentially identify and predict where groundwater discharge is occurring in other major tributaries of the lfrb guiding management strategies into areas where the greatest protection is needed this might include regulating and incentivizing additional distance between groundwater wells and vulnerable stream reaches or requiring additional buffering requirements in those riparian zones while allowing other areas of less vulnerability to be developed groundwater discharge affects multiple stream parameters including residence time hyporheic exchange temperature bed transport sorting and nutrient loading these physical factors ultimately affect biological complexity productivity and community structure in aquatic systems valett et al 1996 bunn and arthington 2002 freeman et al 2007 identifying regions of groundwater discharge in the lfrb may help determine appropriate sites where populations of sensitive mussels and other groundwater dependent stream species could be protected translocated or removed from reaches where excessive groundwater pumping may have negative and cascading effects on streamflow stamey 1996 albertson and torak 2002 couch and mcdowell 2006 peterson et al 2011 6 conclusion analysis of stream reach orientations in the lfrb using the u s epa reach file 3 indicated a dominant n s azimuth trend occurring up to 44 more often than other stream reach directions with lesser trends oriented e w nw se and ne sw directional trends in ichawaynochaway creek a tributary of the lfrb mimicked some jointing trends we measured in limestone bedrock in this stream which followed n s e w and nw se orientations when we compared these data to azimuths of stream reaches where enhanced groundwater discharge was detected in a previous study on ichawaynochaway creek by rugel and others 2016 we found that 55 of the time groundwater discharge was notably higher in reaches which followed nw or nnw bearings average bearing n48 69w 10 82 these results indicate that disproportionate amounts of groundwater are entering the stream through a

patterns will in turn affect the timing and volume of river discharge from these mountainous regions coupled with the high susceptibility to changing environmental dynamics remote mountainous regions also face a severe scarcity of hydrometeorological data thereby limiting an understanding of local hydrological processes and impeding efficient wrm of the region this is partly because government agencies tend to give high elevation sites a lower priority because of costs and logistical issues karpouzoglou et al 2016 in nepal 80 of hydrological stations installed by the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm are situated at low altitude 500 m and only measure the discharge of principal rivers yet due to the strong annual variation in river flow the dangers they pose and the amount of sediment they carry during the monsoon they are rarely used by mountain people for water supply and irrigation who use smaller streams instead smadja et al 2015 as a direct result small settlements

the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in section 2 we briefly describe the hydrological characteristics of the study area in sections 3 and 4 we discuss the water resources assessment using the data generated by participatory monitoring of stream flow and rainfall in local communities of the mustang valley upper kaligandaki basin nepal a simple water balance is then applied to

points and pathways to scale up such local initiatives for national wrm are discussed section 6 offers conclusions and a brief future outlook 2 study region the study is specifically focused on two mountain villages dakarjong and phalyak located in the kagbeni village development committee of the mustang district one of the northernmost districts of western nepal bordered by the tibet autonomous region of china to the north fig 1 the kaligandaki river runs through the district carving the deepest gorge between the two high mountains of annapurna and dhaulagiri basnet 2007 both study villages lie within the upper kaligandaki river basin ukgrb at an altitude of 3200 m contributing to the watersheds of the snow fed lumbuk stream a kaligandaki river tributary comprising 2567 ha dhakarjong consists of 33 households of 191 residents while phalyak comprises 48 households and 249 people within an area of 6562 ha regmi and gurung 2005 these villages lie just 2 5 h from the district headquarters of jomsom but do not lie on the famous annapurna trekking circuit agriculture and subsistence farming therefore remain the dominant livelihood strategy here naked wheat wheat buckwheat sweet and bitter peas and pulses are the major cereal crops farmers also cultivate other vegetables but only in very small areas in recent years this region has seen a decrease in snowfall during winter and accelerated snow melt in summer resulting in increased hydrological extremes across the basin manandhar et al 2012 chapagain and bhusal 2013 pandey 2016 a trend that is expected to intensify in the coming decades e g ragettli et al 2016 thus water availability and access have involved highly contested ecosystem services ess between individuals communities and social groups across most villages of ukgrb basnet 2007 chapagain and bhusal 2013 water allocation between individual households is based on either water share or landholding size basnet 2007 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrometeorological stations there are 10 meteorological stations in mustang that record daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures across the region fig 2 all operated by dhm there is only one monitoring station installed on the kaligandaki river in the village of syang downstream of jomsom only the meteorological station at jomsom offers continuous and reliable climate and precipitation datasets both study villages lack hydrometeorological stations resulting in knowledge gaps of the volume of flowing water and its variability on an annual basis first monitoring instruments consisting of automatic water pressure level sensors and staff gauges were set up at lumbuk khola fig 2 also rain gauges automatic and manual were installed in dakarjong local people were informed of and trained about the operation of the monitoring instruments the method of data collection and its use in local water sharing and allocation the entire installation process of monitoring stations was participatory the locals showed interest in monitoring water flow and rainfall as well as maintaining the station periodic measurement of discharge using a current meter was also undertaken to establish a rating curve and to quantify the volume of water of the lumbuk khola and its variability throughout the year 3 2 data analysis and modelling we exploit one year s worth july 2015 july 2016 of river flow data from the lumbuk gauging station to quantify the volume of water and its variability across the cropping season also by using temperature data from the jomsom station the crop water needs in dakarjong and phalyak are estimated based on a simple water balance approach existing cropping practices are then analysed in this way obtaining a potential solution for an efficient irrigation system 3 2 1 hydrological regime analysis a hydrological analysis was carried out with a view towards developing a supply demand relationship for improved water allocation and equitable sharing between local farmers stream discharge is the most important parameter for understanding catchment hydrology we therefore transformed daily average stage data to daily discharge a rating curve was built to evaluate the water resource potential of the lumbuk stream altogether six measurements were carried out during the study period based on which the rating curve was calibrated any possible backwater effect and unsteadiness in the flow are neglected in this case the general rating curve equation is usually in power form as follows kennedy 1984 herschy 1995 1 q c h a α where q is discharge in m3 s 1 h is river stage in m and c a and α are calibration coefficients a stream flow hydrograph for the entire one year period allowed us to derive the temporal distribution and variation of streamflows baseflow separation is particularly important in this hydrological analysis because the study stream is snow fed thus stream discharge is expected to have a significant component of baseflow monsoon rain contributes very little to irrigation here rather the farming system is much more dependent on meltwater for irrigation thus it is more convenient to consider the available baseflow as a further basis for developing irrigation management strategies 3 2 2 crop water models and irrigation scheduling in most villages of the upper mustang altitudinal constraints and water access issues limit the cropping season to one crop per year however in settlements located at lower elevations i e most villages in the lower mustang two crops are grown in a year su et al 2013 the cropping calendar for the major crops grown in dakarjong and phalyak is provided in table 1 temperature data were corrected for elevation using eq 2 the lete station being in a different climatic zone was excluded from regression analysis therefore the data from the other three stations were employed to calculate monthly lapse rates for maximum and minimum temperatures using eq 2 2 t c l r e where t temperature in ºc is a dependent variable c is the constant for temperature at zero elevation e is elevation in km and the coefficient lr is the temperature lapse rate in ºc km 1 table 2 presents the calculated values of monthly lapse rate for temperature maxima and minima of mustang district using the calibrated values of monthly lapse rate the daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the study area were extrapolated and adjusted from the jomsom station data one major objective of this study is to develop a demand based crop water model and to estimate the water requirement of local crops in the study villages this requires the computation of reference evapotranspiration et0 beforehand since the only available climate data for the region were air temperature a temperature based formula hargreaves and samai 1985 was used to compute reference evapotranspiration considering the paucity of available weather data eq 3 is considered to be the most reliable alternative to estimate the et0 rates allen et al 1998 3 e t 0 0 0023 t m e a n 17 8 t m a x t m i n 0 5 r a where tmax tmin and tmean are the maximum minimum and mean air temperature in ºc respectively ra is the solar insolation in mm day 1 which depends on latitude and the time of the year and can be estimated using the procedures outlined in allen et al 1998 eq 3 is likely to underestimate et0 due to the exclusion of aerodynamic variables that are in fact paramount in determining evapotranspiration in arid regions garcia et al 2004 therefore the use of extremes rather than the mean is usually recommended for these kinds of areas thomas 2008 from the linearly extrapolated maximum and minimum temperature based on the simple lapse rate equation et0 for the study area was estimated on a daily basis and then aggregated to obtain monthly and seasonal estimates the single crop coefficient approach i e etc kcet0 was employed to estimate the potential maximum evapotranspiration etc of the crops the crop growth periods and adopted coefficient values for local crops for this study are listed in table 1 since the study area is an arid zone and high winds prevail throughout the year the kc values for the mid season tend to be higher in such climatic conditions allen et al 1998 for climate data that differ from minimum relative humidity rhmin of 45 and wind speed u2 other than 2 ms 1 the kc values kc mid and kc late provided in table 1 were adjusted per eq 4 given by allen et al 1998 4 k c k c t a b l e 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 the observed minimum relative humidity data at the jomsom station department of hydrology and mines dhm 2015 and simulated monthly wind speed data averaged over four seasons were used for this adjustment a general procedure for developing the crop water model and estimating etc is shown in fig 3 in actual field conditions the soil moisture available in the root zone hardly allows plants to sustain etc rather a fraction of it depending on the soil moisture availability is lost as evapotranspiration this is known as the actual evapotranspiration eta which can be calculated from the combined effect of kc and a soil water stress coefficient ks as follows 5 e t a k s k c e t 0 the estimation of ks and the actual evapotranspiration eta requires the further computation of a daily soil water balance in the root zone for this purpose a soil water balance model wasim hess and counsell 2000 was used wasim is a one dimensional physically based water balance model that estimates daily soil water storage based on water influxes viz rainfall and irrigation and outfluxes i e evapotranspiration and drainage hess and counsell 2000 this model was chosen due to its simplicity computational scale on a daily basis and ability to capture hydrological processes in the root zone the initial soil moisture was assumed to be at field capacity which is normally adopted for initiating soil water balances allen et al 1998 as per the local cropping calendar the crop planting date also happens to coincide with either the rainfall or snowfall period so it is plausible to assume a field capacity state of soil at the start of the cropping season the current cropping system table 1 and existing irrigation application i e fixed amount and fixed interval in response to the seasonal water availability were first evaluated to assess the impact of the existing water management scenario on the water balance of the catchment the same cropping pattern was then analysed for an optimum water management scenario i e irrigation to sustain actual evapotranspiration fully the water requirement in field wrf for the existing mixed cropping pattern in these remote villages was then calculated for each month of the year by incorporating the losses during water delivery application field application potential seepage and evaporation from canals and ponds the total water required for withdrawal wrw was estimated eq 6 gives the relationship between wrf and wrw 6 wrf ec ea wrw where ec is the conveyance efficiency and ea is the application efficiency of the irrigation system the potential area for agriculture can then be calculated by comparing the gross water demand per unit area to the actual volume of water available in the stream finally different irrigation scenarios based on cropping management and irrigation techniques were explored to identify the best possible water management arrangement subject to the given natural limitations of water 4 results and discussion 4 1 water availability the rating curve developed for the lumbuk stream is q 13 53 h 0 001 3 418 this is shown in fig 4 the daily hydrograph estimated from the rating curve is illustrated in fig 5 the average discharge in the stream is 36 ls 1 a minimum discharge of 19 ls 1 and maximum of 196 ls 1 are observed in june and july respectively this kind of river behaviour and average discharge values is common in this region of nepal as the summer monsoon brings more than 80 of annual runoff to the river a corollary that can be seen in fig 5 is that the range of discharge values and interannual variability is high and depends on the monsoon strength for each year however the monsoon in this trans himalayan region is attributed to westerly disturbances that occur in a bimodal fashion peaking in may and december a somewhat similar pattern can also be seen here however the peak observed in march april is not pronounced the behaviour of the hydrograph cannot be directly correlated with rainfall events rather it is governed by snowmelt a simple water balance of the ukgrb by chapagain and bhusal 2013 highlighted the significant contribution of snowmelt and groundwater to annual runoff of the kaligandaki river particularly in the summer monsoon season thus such a large streamflow in summer could be more likely due to the accelerated melting of ice in the lumbuk watershed because of the elevated temperatures soon after summer a distinct recession curve followed by a stable and roughly constant flow is observed fig 5 baseflow estimated from the boughton two parameter algorithm chapman 1999 also reflects the characteristics of this mountainous stream as shown in fig 6 baseflow is dominant for more than 80 of the year for the remaining 20 baseflow is almost half streamflow thus taking baseflow for the water resource assessment does not seem to underestimate the flow in the stream but rather can provide a sustainable solution the monthly availability of water from the lumbuk stream is therefore calculated from baseflow fig 6 the annual runoff in the stream is estimated to be 0 99 mm3 with low flow in winter and the pre monsoon season winter crops which are planted in november december and harvested in june july are most probably affected by this prolonged dry spell throughout their growing season on the other hand for summer crops the existing water allocation strategy based on a rotational basis has the potential to cause conflict among farmers 4 2 water balance modelling the atmospheric demand on water from such crops in this region increases rapidly from the beginning of the year reaching a maximum in april and may fig 7 the reference evapotranspiration et0 plot for jomsom dhakarjong and phalyak shows this increase with the arrival of the summer monsoon in early june evapotranspiration again starts increasing until october thereafter exhibiting a steady decreasing trend in autumn i e the post monsoon period et0 is estimated to increase by 20 45 in the study villages when extremes are considered fig 7 shows this variation in reference evapotranspiration for average and extreme conditions the variability is more pronounced during the winter monsoon period this significant variation in et0 between average and extreme climate conditions will tend to manifest in the crop water demand and will need to be considered for sustainable irrigation water management especially in such arid mountainous regions based on the single crop coefficient method the potential evapotranspiration etc in mm for different crops is presented in table 3 while et0 represents the standard for evaporative demand of the environment and etc best describes the potential water use between the crops it is the actual evapotranspiration eta that determines the timing and volume of irrigation to be applied to the crops for farm level irrigation fao 056 procedures allen et al 1998 combined with a water balance approach are usually employed for irrigation scheduling irrigation is carried out on a rotational basis with total water shares of three days for 23 ha of fields in phalyak and two days for 9 ha of fields of dhakarjong respectively in total 32 ha are currently irrigated using water from the lumbuk stream as reported by the farmers the current irrigation system requires at least 30 35 days to irrigate all these fields considering the result from the hydrological analysis a simple generalisation is performed for the approximate depth of irrigation currently applied to the fields flow that exceeds 95 of time q95 0 0179 m3 s is taken for both winter and summer irrigation a large portion of this diverted flow will be lost due to seepage evaporation and other factors occurring in the earthen water conveyance structures so far field application losses have also been high in basin furrow irrigation as there is no concrete information about the actual quantity of losses occurring in traditional furrow basin irrigation a reasonable irrigation efficiency of 40 has been assumed which will allow an irrigation depth of 65 mm for the irrigation interval of 30 35 days the daily soil moisture simulation for the current scenario is presented in fig 8 the current irrigation application is not in tandem with soil moisture demand there is either too much water resulting in deep percolation or too little water causing water stress in the crops however in both seasons there is only a minor impact on the crop yield as the simulation resulted in a relative transpiration of more than 95 4 3 water management options and participatory monitoring the aforementioned results contrast starkly against local perception as local farmers find it hard to irrigate their fields and cannot grow crops as per potential yield these differences can be explained by two plausible explanations first our initial assumption of 40 irrigation efficiency might not be accurate in this traditional farmer managed irrigation system made up of earthen works there could be substantial losses during the storage and conveyance through long earthen canals in the sandy loam mountainous terrain secondly the very low daily streamflow and small pond sizes for seasonal storage irrigate very little land at once farmers have to wait more than a month for their turn this delay could possibly lower the crops to the irrecoverable water stress point table 4 provides the optimum irrigation schedule for the current mixed cropping pattern since streamflow in summer is sufficiently high the irrigation schedule can be optimised during this cropping period the irrigable area could be substantially increased with the current diversion already inadequate to support crops in the pre monsoon period additional depth during this period cannot be supported unless there are other sources to complement the deficit unlike pumping irrigation systems where the number of operations is more important than the flow in gravity systems like this the water availability in the river becomes the only limiting factor determining the optimisation schedule hence other management options need to be explored particularly for winter irrigation management the overall water balance shows that irrigation particularly at the start of the cropping season can be reduced substantially the potential evapotranspiration for crops during the vegetative growth is lower also climatic conditions are not extreme during these months therefore a late start to irrigation during the crop growth stage is highly recommended however the high variability of flow during summer has to be taken into account for the optimisation of the irrigation schedule during this period one major limitation to our assessment here is the length of our dataset a one year window is probably insufficient to capture long term variability in precipitation time series which is likely in the face of climate change however in spite of data brevity and of the need for longer time series we are able to recommend some water management options both the existing irrigation pattern and the optimum scenario assume the overall efficiency of irrigation to be at least 40 ideally for basin furrow irrigation this assumption is reasonable brouwer et al 1989 yet in this instance a very small fraction of flow is available to crops due to significant losses in transition as a local response towards these potential losses locally modified fields into levelled terraces can be seen in the region but they only serve to regulate the water volume reaching the farm field improvements in terms of making concrete water reservoirs lined canals or conveyance through pipes have already been seen in other villages of the upper mustang region basnet 2007 however such improvements are generally costly time consuming and may not produce immediate or tangible benefits at the local level recently citizen science has emerged as a more useful tool in wrm to energise local stakeholders placing them at the heart of decisions regarding water resources paul et al 2018 paul and buytaert 2018 non scientist collected data can enhance and densify more traditional datasets in space and time while rapid technological advances in the last 10 15 years and the ubiquity of low cost smart sensors in everyday devices like smartphones part of the internet of things gubbi et al 2013 have increased the feasibility of participatory data collection within a devolved monitoring framework buytaert et al 2014 paul et al 2018 this approach has been demonstrably successful in complementing existing government operated hydrometric networks in data scarce regions like western nepal and elsewhere buytaert et al 2014 a useful means of densifying existing sensor networks in space and time thus improving monitoring robustness could be the installation of low cost river level sensors and rain gauges paul et al 2018 describe this process where non scientist local stakeholders can be trained to read and download data which can then ideally be transformed into actionable information like river flow forecasts which are transmitted back to community members via for instance smartphone apps sms alerts or knowledge dissemination interfaces e g buytaert et al 2014 zulkafli et al 2017 paul et al 2018 in addition in the ukgrb additional deployment of low cost non scientist maintained soil moisture sensors e g that use time domain reflectometry and lysimeters to measure evapotranpiration could be carried out where the sensors are connected to a high precision clock that times irrigation patterns in a smart manner e g precluding irrigation following recent rainfall episodes bogena et al 2010 moreover these citizen sourced data also complement and can be combined with remotely sensed data e g precipitation manz et al 2016 extensive ground based observations are increasingly needed for calibration and to resolve small scale spatiotemporal processes which is especially important in complex mountainous regions such as the ukgrb although participatory projects have been common in wrm for some time the uptake of citizen science has been rather limited in hydrological research in southeast asia buytaert et al 2014 one possible reason could be the difficulty in interpreting complex hydrological data intuitively with intensive scientific training normally being a pre requisite for subsequent data analysis however as we have argued above new technology has the possibility to circumvent these limitations participatory projects also have the potential to bring tangible benefits to isolated communities like dakarjong and phalyak such as increased scientific literacy and political empowerment and engagement indeed such projects have been shown to work best when there is active local buy in and the benefits to local stakeholders are highlighted paul et al 2018 participatory engagement however must be handled sensitively new scientific insights could potentially cause apprehension while improper communication of results could risk the creation of permanent misunderstandings e g seymour and regalado 2014 it is therefore important to understand the livelihood needs capacity and specific vulnerabilities of local stakeholders prior to any scientific work communication pathways between scientists citizen scientists and non participating community members should be mapped along with existing social hierarchies and power relationships in this way the most appropriate point of entry for an intervention can be sought while regular mentoring and information feedback training sessions have been shown to build trust between scientists and citizens promoting long term project sustainability e g buytaert et al 2014 rotman et al 2014 5 conclusions and future outlook although the himalayas are a major reservoir of freshwater the remote mountain communities that host highly poor and marginalised groups have difficulty exploiting the full potential to support their subsistence farming and agro pastoral livelihoods the complex physiography changing environmental dynamics and the effects of climate change have all added huge uncertainty to water availability in the region often these effects are more severe in the rain shadow region such as in the upper kaligandaki river basin ukgrb where the monsoon is less important and water is primarily provided by glacial meltwater a lack of hydrometeorological data has further impeded understanding of the mountain hydrology to formulate sustainable wrm strategies in these fragile regions to date there have been hardly any national level policy interventions here in this context an attempt was made to employ a location specific intervention tailored to the citizen science concept to generate hydrological knowledge for improving wrm in the ukgrb mountain streams demonstrate a large variability in summer flow whereas flow is reduced dramatically and almost remains stable for the other seasons which contrasts with the usual bimodal peaks of rivers in the trans himalayan region due to the lack of knowledge about local water availability and crop water demand deficit irrigation has been practised extensively in the study area the existing cropping pattern focuses on crops that have high water demand in prolonged dry spells which would have a severe impact on crop yield apart from the natural limitations of water the lack of efficient irrigation infrastructures further limits access to water some flexibility in cropping dates and patterns could reduce crop water requirements and allow for a more equitable distribution of available seasonal flow however considering the increased variability in streamflow these procedures cannot be recommended as a sustainable solution for the future in the long term either a major shift from non subsistence cereal crops to tree crops is recommended while the construction of a reservoir for seasonal storage could ameliorate the local seasonal deficit of water our research methodology has been applied only to two specific communities yet it has the potential to be scaled up to the entire ukgrb water availability improved irrigation systems and the need for technical assistance for improved wrm have all been reported as common priorities for local farmers in the mustang district we have suggested that a citizen science approach for participatory monitoring and the co generation of hydrological knowledge could lead to potential entry points to make such scaling up a reality as well as greatly densifying existing hydrological monitoring networks in space and time this bottom up approach could complement and improve upon the more traditional top down approach that has met with lower degrees

8443,study region we interrogate the water resources of the upper kaligandaki river basin ukgrb in the remote mustang district of northwestern nepal the nepal himalayas are a major reservoir of freshwater yet the impediments to its exploitation by local inhabitants are manifold including weak governance structures steep and irregular terrain and frequent natural hazards that are linked to climate change the ukgrb is characterised by its extreme fragility paucity of water and water related data and enormous variability of the effects of climate change on glaciers through time and space study focus the purpose of this paper is to elucidate catchment hydrology and local flow variability before demonstrating the ways in which sustainable water resource management wrm can be achieved regionally new hydrological insights for the region we present the local crop water balance and suggest methods to reduce crop water requirements and to ensure a more equitable distribution of available seasonal flow we also propose a series of long term changes that are needed to secure sustainability then we suggest that the principles of citizen science can help to improve the spatial coverage of data generating new hydrological time series e g river discharge which can aid local decision makers in the wrm realm e g irrigation scheduling this approach has the potential to be scaled up across the entire ukgrb and indeed nepal as a whole keywords citizen science data scarcity nepal himalayas water resource management wrm water security 1 introduction 1 1 water security and data scarcity in the himalayas mountains contribute a meaningful proportion of the world s freshwater supply 32 of global discharge meybeck et al 2001 the hindu kush himalayas hkh also known as the water towers of asia mukherji et al 2015 contribute to agriculture and food security across south asia rasul 2014 however the complex physiography and microclimatic variability in the himalayas result in a strong spatial and temporal variation in water flow pandey 2016 more than 80 of the precipitation in nepal falls within four months of the year much of this volume accumulates during few extremely intense rainfall events klatzel and murray 2009 the issue of an excess or paucity of water across the himalayas is therefore a long standing problem that has continuously impeded effective water resource management wrm in the region bandyopadhyay and gyawali 1994 climate change has increased the temporal and spatial uncertainty in mountain water availability e g viviroli et al 2007 ragettli

precipitation adversely affect melt characteristics of glaciers e g harper and humphrey 2003 kääb et al 2012 pritchard 2017 therefore regions dominated by snowmelt hydrology are highly susceptible to climate change since river flow regimes are known to have been significantly altered in terms of seasonality and intensity neupane et al 2014 such fragile regions constitute at a local level remote villages and settlements situated at higher elevations mukherji et al 2015 that are strongly reliant on ecosystem services buytaert et al 2014 likely changes in the local precipitation and snow cover patterns will in turn affect the timing and volume of river discharge from these mountainous regions coupled with the high susceptibility to changing environmental dynamics remote mountainous regions also face a severe scarcity of hydrometeorological data thereby limiting an understanding of local hydrological processes and impeding efficient wrm of the region this is partly because government agencies tend to give high elevation sites a lower priority because of costs and logistical issues karpouzoglou et al 2016 in nepal 80 of hydrological stations installed by the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm are situated at low altitude 500 m and only measure the discharge of principal rivers yet due to the strong annual variation in river flow the dangers they pose and the amount of sediment they carry during the monsoon they are rarely used by mountain people for water supply and irrigation who use smaller streams instead smadja et al 2015 as a direct result small settlements are generally situated at high elevations beyond the reach of any national scale intervention of wrm and planning with very little information about the local hydrology and individual water balances mountain communities rely heavily on their indigenous knowledge to manage the available water resources location specific interventions are required to understand local water issues faced by mountain communities here moreover socio ecological interactions in mountain systems vary both across and within the region such complexities the degree of particular uncertainty and unpredictable interactions require a more bottom up inclusive approach the shared knowledge base of which lends aligns closely with the principles of polycentric governance of ecosystem services buytaert et al 2014 paul et al

mainly due to the underlying complexities in hydrological data collection for prolonged periods the need for continued local interest and objectivity regardless of long term perspectives and complex

using the data generated by participatory monitoring of stream flow and rainfall in local communities of the mustang valley upper kaligandaki basin nepal a simple water balance is then applied to determine the irrigation schedule for effective water allocation among farmers and possible water management options for local decision making are then suggested also in this section potential entry

consists of 33 households of 191 residents while phalyak comprises 48 households and 249 people within an area of 6562 ha regmi and gurung 2005 these villages lie just 2 5 h from the district headquarters of jomsom but do not lie on the famous annapurna trekking circuit agriculture and subsistence farming therefore remain the dominant livelihood strategy here naked wheat wheat buckwheat sweet and bitter peas and pulses are the major cereal crops farmers also cultivate other vegetables but only in very small areas in recent years this region has seen a decrease in snowfall during winter and accelerated snow melt in summer resulting in increased hydrological extremes across the basin manandhar et al 2012 chapagain and bhusal 2013 pandey 2016 a trend that is expected to intensify in the coming decades e g ragettli et al 2016 thus water availability and access have involved highly contested ecosystem services ess between individuals communities and social groups across most villages of ukgrb basnet 2007 chapagain and bhusal 2013 water allocation between individual households is based on either water share or landholding size basnet 2007 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrometeorological stations there are 10 meteorological stations in mustang that record daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures across the region fig 2 all operated by dhm there is only one monitoring station installed on the kaligandaki river in the village of syang downstream of jomsom only the meteorological station at jomsom offers continuous and reliable climate and precipitation datasets both study villages lack hydrometeorological stations resulting in knowledge gaps of the volume of flowing water and its variability on an annual basis first monitoring instruments consisting of automatic water pressure level sensors and staff gauges were set up at lumbuk khola fig 2 also rain gauges automatic and manual were installed in dakarjong local people were informed of and trained about the operation of the monitoring instruments the method of data collection and its use in local water sharing and allocation the entire installation process of monitoring stations was participatory the locals showed interest in monitoring water flow and rainfall as well as maintaining the station periodic measurement of discharge using a current meter was also undertaken to establish a rating curve and to quantify the volume of water of the lumbuk khola and its variability throughout the year 3 2 data analysis and modelling we exploit one year s worth july 2015 july 2016 of river flow data from the lumbuk gauging station to quantify the volume of water and its variability across the cropping season also by using temperature data from the jomsom station the crop water needs in dakarjong and phalyak are estimated based on a simple water balance approach existing cropping practices are then analysed in this way obtaining a potential solution for an efficient irrigation system 3 2 1 hydrological regime analysis a hydrological analysis was carried out with a view towards developing a supply demand relationship for improved water allocation and equitable sharing between local farmers stream discharge is the most important parameter for understanding catchment hydrology we therefore transformed daily average stage data to daily discharge a rating curve was built to evaluate the water resource potential of the lumbuk stream altogether six measurements were carried out during the study period based on which the rating curve was calibrated any possible backwater effect and unsteadiness in the flow are neglected in this case the general rating curve equation is usually in power form as follows kennedy 1984 herschy 1995 1 q c h a α where q is discharge in m3 s 1 h is river stage in m and c a and α are calibration coefficients a stream flow hydrograph for the entire one year period allowed us to derive the temporal distribution and variation of streamflows baseflow separation is particularly important in this hydrological analysis because the study stream is snow fed thus stream discharge is expected to have a significant component of baseflow monsoon rain contributes very little to irrigation here rather the farming system is much more dependent on meltwater for irrigation thus it is more convenient to consider the available baseflow as a further basis for developing irrigation management strategies 3 2 2 crop water models and irrigation scheduling in most villages of the upper mustang altitudinal constraints and water access issues limit the cropping season to one crop per year however in settlements located at lower elevations i e most villages in the lower mustang two crops are grown in a year su et al 2013 the cropping calendar for the major crops grown in dakarjong and phalyak is provided in table 1 temperature data were corrected for elevation using eq 2 the lete station being in a different climatic zone was excluded from regression analysis therefore the data from the other three stations were employed to calculate monthly lapse rates for maximum and minimum temperatures using eq 2 2 t c l r e where t temperature in ºc is a dependent variable c is the constant for temperature at zero elevation e is elevation in km and the coefficient lr is the temperature lapse rate in ºc km 1 table 2 presents the calculated values of monthly lapse rate for temperature maxima and minima of mustang district using the calibrated values of monthly lapse rate the daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the study area were extrapolated and adjusted from the jomsom station data one major objective of this study is to develop a demand based crop water model and to estimate the water requirement of local crops in the study villages this requires the computation of reference evapotranspiration et0 beforehand since the only available climate data for the region were air temperature a temperature based formula hargreaves and samai 1985 was used to compute reference evapotranspiration considering the paucity of available weather data eq 3 is considered to be the most reliable alternative to estimate the et0 rates allen et al 1998 3 e t 0 0 0023 t m e a n 17 8 t m a x t m i n 0 5 r a where tmax tmin and tmean are the maximum minimum and mean air temperature in ºc respectively ra is the solar insolation in mm day 1 which depends on latitude and the time of the year and can be estimated using the procedures outlined in allen et al 1998 eq 3 is likely to underestimate et0 due to the exclusion of aerodynamic variables that are in fact paramount in determining evapotranspiration in arid regions garcia et al 2004 therefore the use of extremes rather than the mean is usually recommended for these kinds of areas thomas 2008 from the linearly extrapolated maximum and minimum temperature based on the simple lapse rate equation et0 for the study area was estimated on a daily basis and then aggregated to obtain monthly and seasonal estimates the single crop coefficient approach i e etc kcet0 was employed to estimate the potential maximum evapotranspiration etc of the crops the crop growth periods and adopted coefficient values for local crops for this study are listed in table 1 since the study area is an arid zone and high winds prevail throughout the year the kc values for the mid season tend to be higher in such climatic conditions allen et al 1998 for climate data that differ from minimum relative humidity rhmin of 45 and wind speed u2 other than 2 ms 1 the kc values kc mid and kc late provided in table 1 were adjusted per eq 4 given by allen et al 1998 4 k c k c t a b l e 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 the observed minimum relative humidity data at the jomsom station department of hydrology and mines dhm 2015 and simulated monthly wind speed data averaged over four seasons were used for this adjustment a general procedure for developing the crop water model and estimating etc is shown in fig 3 in actual field conditions the soil moisture available in the root zone hardly allows plants to sustain etc rather a fraction of it depending on the soil moisture availability is lost as evapotranspiration this is known as the actual evapotranspiration eta which can be calculated from the combined effect of kc and a soil water stress coefficient ks as follows 5 e t a k s k c e t 0 the estimation of ks and the actual evapotranspiration eta requires the further computation of a daily soil water balance in the root zone for this purpose a soil water balance model wasim hess and counsell 2000 was used wasim is a one dimensional physically based water balance model that estimates daily soil water storage based on water influxes viz rainfall and irrigation and outfluxes i e evapotranspiration and drainage hess and counsell 2000 this model was chosen due to its simplicity computational scale on a daily basis and ability to capture hydrological processes in the root zone the initial soil moisture was assumed to be at field capacity which is normally adopted for initiating soil water balances allen et al 1998 as per the local cropping calendar the crop planting date also happens to coincide with either the rainfall or snowfall period so it is plausible to assume a field capacity state of soil at the start of the cropping season the current cropping system table 1 and existing irrigation application i e fixed amount and fixed interval in response to the seasonal water availability were first evaluated to assess the impact of the existing water management scenario on the water balance of the catchment the same cropping pattern was then analysed for an optimum water management scenario i e irrigation to sustain actual evapotranspiration fully the water requirement in field wrf for the existing mixed cropping pattern in these remote villages was then calculated for each month of the year by incorporating the losses during water delivery application field application potential seepage and evaporation from canals and ponds the total water required for withdrawal wrw was estimated eq 6 gives the relationship between wrf and wrw 6 wrf ec ea wrw where ec is the conveyance efficiency and ea is the application efficiency of the irrigation system the potential area for agriculture can then be calculated by comparing the gross water demand per unit area to the actual volume of water available in the stream finally different irrigation scenarios based on cropping management and irrigation techniques were explored to identify the best possible water management arrangement subject to the given natural limitations of water 4 results and discussion 4 1 water availability the rating curve developed for the lumbuk stream is q 13 53 h 0 001 3 418 this is shown in fig 4 the daily hydrograph estimated from the rating curve is illustrated in fig 5 the average discharge in the stream is 36 ls 1 a minimum discharge of 19 ls 1 and maximum of 196 ls 1 are observed in june and july respectively this kind of river behaviour and average discharge values is common in this region of nepal as the summer monsoon brings more than 80 of annual runoff to the river a corollary that can be seen in fig 5 is that the range of discharge values and interannual variability is high and depends on the monsoon strength for each year however the monsoon in this trans himalayan region is attributed to westerly disturbances that occur in a bimodal fashion peaking in may and december a somewhat similar pattern can also be seen here however the peak observed in march april is not pronounced the behaviour of the hydrograph cannot be directly correlated with rainfall events rather it is governed by snowmelt a simple water balance of the ukgrb by chapagain and bhusal 2013 highlighted the significant contribution of snowmelt and groundwater to annual runoff of the kaligandaki river particularly in the summer monsoon season thus such a large streamflow in summer could be more likely due to the accelerated melting of ice in the lumbuk watershed because of the elevated temperatures soon after summer a distinct recession curve followed by a stable and roughly constant flow is observed fig 5 baseflow estimated from the boughton two parameter algorithm chapman 1999 also reflects the characteristics of this mountainous stream as shown in fig 6 baseflow is dominant for more than 80 of the year for the remaining 20 baseflow is almost half streamflow thus taking baseflow for the water resource assessment does not seem to underestimate the flow in the stream but rather can provide a sustainable solution the monthly availability of water from the lumbuk stream is therefore calculated from baseflow fig 6 the annual runoff in the stream is estimated to be 0 99 mm3 with low flow in winter and the pre monsoon season winter crops which are planted in november december and harvested in june july are most probably affected by this prolonged dry spell throughout their growing season on the other hand for summer crops the existing water allocation strategy based on a rotational basis has the potential to cause conflict among farmers 4 2 water balance modelling the atmospheric demand on water from such crops in this region increases rapidly from the beginning of the year reaching a maximum in april and may fig 7 the reference evapotranspiration et0 plot for jomsom dhakarjong and phalyak shows this increase with the arrival of the summer monsoon in early june evapotranspiration again starts increasing until october thereafter exhibiting a steady decreasing trend in autumn i e the post monsoon period et0 is estimated to increase by 20 45 in the study villages when extremes are considered fig 7 shows this variation in reference evapotranspiration for average and extreme conditions the variability is more pronounced during the winter monsoon period this significant variation in et0 between average and extreme climate conditions will tend to manifest in the crop water demand and will need to be considered for sustainable irrigation water management especially in such arid mountainous regions based on the single crop coefficient method the potential evapotranspiration etc in mm for different crops is presented in table 3 while et0 represents the standard for evaporative demand of the environment and etc best describes the potential water use between the crops it is the actual evapotranspiration eta that determines the timing and volume of irrigation to be applied to the crops for farm level irrigation fao 056 procedures allen et al 1998 combined with a water balance approach are usually employed for irrigation scheduling irrigation is carried out on a rotational basis with total water shares of three days for 23 ha of fields in phalyak and two days for 9 ha of fields of dhakarjong respectively in total 32 ha are currently irrigated using water from the lumbuk stream as reported by the farmers the current irrigation system requires at least 30 35 days to irrigate all these fields considering the result from the hydrological analysis a simple generalisation is performed for the approximate depth of irrigation currently applied to the fields flow that exceeds 95 of time q95 0 0179 m3 s is taken for both winter and summer irrigation a large portion of this diverted flow will be lost due to seepage evaporation and other factors occurring in the earthen water conveyance structures so far field application losses have also been high in basin furrow irrigation as there is no concrete information about the actual quantity of losses occurring in traditional furrow basin irrigation a reasonable irrigation efficiency of 40 has been assumed which will allow an irrigation depth of 65 mm for the irrigation interval of 30 35 days the daily soil moisture simulation for the current scenario is presented in fig 8 the current irrigation application is not in tandem with soil moisture demand there is either too much water resulting in deep percolation or too little water causing water stress in the crops however in both seasons there is only a minor impact on the crop yield as the simulation resulted in a relative transpiration of more than 95 4 3 water management options and participatory monitoring the aforementioned results contrast starkly against local perception as local farmers find it hard to irrigate their fields and cannot grow crops as per potential yield these differences can be explained by two plausible explanations first our initial assumption of 40 irrigation efficiency might not be accurate in this traditional farmer managed irrigation system made up of earthen works there could be substantial losses during the storage and conveyance through long earthen canals in the sandy loam mountainous terrain secondly the very low daily streamflow and small pond sizes for seasonal storage irrigate very little land at once farmers have to wait more than a month for their turn this delay could possibly lower the crops to the irrecoverable water stress point table 4 provides the optimum irrigation schedule for the current mixed cropping pattern since streamflow in summer is sufficiently high the irrigation schedule can be optimised during this cropping period the irrigable area could be substantially increased with the current diversion already inadequate to support crops in the pre monsoon period additional depth during this period cannot be supported unless there are other sources to complement the deficit unlike pumping irrigation systems where the number of operations is more important than the flow in gravity systems like this the water availability in the river becomes the only limiting factor determining the optimisation schedule hence other management options need to be explored particularly for winter irrigation management the overall water balance shows that irrigation particularly at the start of the cropping season can be reduced substantially the potential evapotranspiration for crops during the vegetative growth is lower also climatic conditions are not extreme during these months therefore a late start to irrigation during the crop growth stage is highly recommended however the high variability of flow during summer has to be taken into account for the optimisation of the irrigation schedule during this period one major limitation to our assessment here is the length of our dataset a one year window is probably insufficient to capture long term variability in precipitation time series which is likely in the face of climate change however in spite of data brevity and of the need for longer time series we are able to recommend some water management options both the existing irrigation pattern and the optimum scenario assume the overall efficiency of irrigation to be at least 40 ideally for basin furrow irrigation this assumption is reasonable brouwer et al 1989 yet in this instance a very small fraction of flow is available to crops due to significant losses in transition as a local response towards these potential losses locally modified fields into levelled terraces can be seen in the region but they only serve to regulate the water volume reaching the farm field improvements in terms of making concrete water reservoirs lined canals or conveyance through pipes have already been seen in other villages of the upper mustang region basnet 2007 however such improvements are generally costly time consuming and may not produce immediate or tangible benefits at the local level recently citizen science has emerged as a more useful tool in wrm to energise local stakeholders placing them at the heart of decisions regarding water resources paul et al 2018 paul and buytaert 2018 non scientist collected data can enhance and densify more traditional datasets in space and time while rapid technological advances in the last 10 15 years and the ubiquity of low cost smart sensors in everyday devices like smartphones part of the internet of things gubbi et al 2013 have increased the feasibility of participatory data collection within a devolved monitoring framework buytaert et al 2014 paul et al 2018 this approach has been demonstrably successful in complementing existing government operated hydrometric networks in data scarce regions like western nepal and elsewhere buytaert et al 2014 a useful means of densifying existing sensor networks in space and time thus improving monitoring robustness could be the installation of low cost river level sensors and rain gauges paul et al 2018 describe this process where non scientist local stakeholders can be trained to read and download data which can then ideally be transformed into actionable information like river flow forecasts which are transmitted back to community members via for instance smartphone apps sms alerts or knowledge dissemination interfaces e g buytaert et al 2014 zulkafli et al 2017 paul et al 2018 in addition in the ukgrb additional deployment of low cost non scientist maintained soil moisture sensors e g that use time domain reflectometry and lysimeters to measure evapotranpiration could be carried out where the sensors are connected to a high precision clock that times irrigation patterns in a smart manner e g precluding irrigation following recent rainfall episodes bogena et al 2010 moreover these citizen sourced data also complement and can be combined with remotely sensed data e g precipitation manz et al 2016 extensive ground based observations are increasingly needed for calibration and to resolve small scale spatiotemporal processes which is especially important in complex mountainous regions such as the ukgrb although participatory projects have been common in wrm for some time the uptake of citizen science has been rather limited in hydrological research in southeast asia buytaert et al 2014 one possible reason could be the difficulty in interpreting complex hydrological data intuitively with intensive scientific training normally being a pre requisite for subsequent data analysis however as we have argued above new technology has the possibility to circumvent these limitations participatory projects also have the potential to bring tangible benefits to isolated communities like dakarjong and phalyak such as increased scientific literacy and political empowerment and engagement indeed such projects have been shown to work best when there is active local buy in and the benefits to local stakeholders are highlighted paul et al 2018 participatory engagement however must be handled sensitively new scientific insights could potentially cause apprehension while improper communication of results could risk the creation of permanent misunderstandings e g seymour and regalado 2014 it is therefore important to understand the livelihood needs capacity and specific vulnerabilities of local stakeholders prior to any scientific work communication pathways between scientists citizen scientists and non participating community members should be mapped along with existing social hierarchies and power relationships in this way the most appropriate point of entry for an intervention can be sought while regular mentoring and information feedback training sessions have been shown to build trust between scientists and citizens promoting long term project sustainability e g buytaert et al 2014 rotman et al 2014 5 conclusions and future outlook although the himalayas are a major reservoir of freshwater the remote mountain communities that host highly poor and marginalised groups have difficulty exploiting the full potential to support their subsistence farming and agro pastoral livelihoods the complex physiography changing environmental dynamics and the effects of climate change have all added huge uncertainty to water availability in the region often these effects are more severe in the rain shadow region such as in the upper kaligandaki river basin ukgrb where the monsoon is less important and water is primarily provided by glacial meltwater a lack of hydrometeorological data has further impeded understanding of the mountain hydrology to formulate sustainable wrm strategies in these fragile regions to date there have been hardly any national level policy interventions here in this context an attempt was made to employ a location specific intervention tailored to the citizen science concept to generate hydrological knowledge for improving wrm in the ukgrb mountain streams demonstrate a large variability in summer flow whereas flow is reduced dramatically and almost remains stable for the other seasons which contrasts with the usual bimodal peaks of rivers in the trans himalayan region due to the lack of knowledge about local water availability and crop water demand deficit irrigation has been practised extensively in the study area the existing cropping pattern focuses on crops that have high water demand in prolonged dry spells which would have a severe impact on crop yield apart from the natural limitations of water the lack of efficient irrigation infrastructures further limits access to water some flexibility in cropping dates and patterns could reduce crop water requirements and allow for a more equitable distribution of available seasonal flow however considering the increased variability in streamflow these procedures cannot be recommended as a sustainable solution for the future in the long term either a major shift from non subsistence cereal crops to tree crops is recommended while the construction of a reservoir for seasonal storage could ameliorate the local seasonal deficit of water our research methodology has been applied only to two specific communities yet it has the potential to be scaled up to the entire ukgrb water availability improved irrigation systems and the need for technical assistance for improved wrm have all been reported as common priorities for local farmers in the mustang district we have suggested that a citizen science approach for participatory monitoring and the co generation of hydrological knowledge could lead to potential entry points to make such scaling up a reality as well as greatly densifying existing hydrological monitoring networks in space and time this bottom up approach could complement and improve upon the more traditional top down approach that has met with lower degrees

introduction in recent decades observed climate trends show an increase in temperature across europe ipcc 2014 precipitation totals show regionally varying changes and have no clear continental trend compared to temperature since 1960 annual precipitation has increased by up to 70 mm per decade in northern europe and decreased by up to 90 mm per decade in some parts of southern europe eea 2017 river discharge shows similar trends as in precipitation with decreases in southern and eastern europe and increases in northern europe stahl et al 2010 wilson et al 2010 according to the ipcc reports ipcc 2014 kovats et al 2014 there is also a high confidence in changes in temperature extremes heat waves and heavy precipitation events in europe seneviratne et al 2014 donat et al 2013 also an increase in climate related hazards and their intensity is noticed but with a less clear signal and large variation among european regions ipcc 2007 changes in hydrological extremes are now anticipated to be more pronounced and might be related to changing climate conditions ipcc 2014 besides such general considerations for the whole continent it has also been shown that changes in

for alpine catchments kormann et al 2015 have shown that the hydrological regimes including flood regimes of high mountain rivers are changing slowly but steadily there were several ruinous floods in recent decades in 1998 2001 and 2008 in ukraine kovalets et al 2014 one of the biggest and destructive floods occurred in the carpathian region and surrounding areas within ukraine moldova and romania at the end of july 2008 causing 47 fatalities and evacuation of about 40 000 people world health organization 2017 over 40 000 houses and 33 000 ha of farmland were flooded in ukraine international commission for the protection of the danube river icpdr 2009 many studies done recently have been dedicated to future changes of climate in europe the climate projections under different emission scenarios show a temperature increase over europe in the range from 1 to 4 5 c under rcp 4 5 and 2 5 to 5 5 c under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century eea 2017 with higher increases for southern europe in summer and northern and eastern europe in winter kjellström et al 2011 mitchell et al 2004 annual precipitation totals show a less clear signal of change in the 21st century compared to temperature although there is agreement of most projections on an overall annual increase in northern europe of up to 30 and decrease in southern europe of up to 40 by the end of the century jacob et al 2014 kjellström et al 2011 an increasing trend for extreme precipitation by the end of the century was also claimed for northern europe ipcc 2014 although the uncertainty of such projection is very high however recent studies on extreme rainfall intensities over recent decades have shown that an increasing trend of high intensity rain storms can be identified for several regions in central europe if one investigates short time increments i e between a few minutes to one hour see e g mueller and pfister 2011 and bürger et al 2014 changing climate will affect river discharge the future changes in the mean and extreme river discharge can be regionally different in some studies there are indications of a shift in seasonality of river discharge and floods with increases in winter and autumn and decreases in spring e g in finland veijalainen et al 2010 and norway vormoor et al 2015 also increases in high flow and 10 year flood level were found in france quintana seguí et al 2011 in contrast the decreases in 10 year flood and mean annual flood were projected for the alpine lech catchment with a significant increase in winter floods dobler et al 2012 in another study for the alps the mean annual floods and maximum floods are projected to increase in switzerland and to decrease in the southern alps köplin et al 2014 the study of meresa et al 2017 focused on a mountain catchment in poland projected an increase in the annual maximal flow by the end of the century increasing trends in temperature were observed in ukraine balabukh and lukianets 2015 kynal and kholiavchuk 2016 spinoni et al 2015 however no changes in the observed annual maximum river discharge were found in the rainfall and snowmelt driven rivers in mountainous areas within ukraine for the last 60 years gorbachova and barandich 2016 despite the large number of papers focusing on climate change impacts on extremes in europe there are only a few studies on changes in extreme precipitation and river discharge done for eastern europe meresa et al 2017 piniewski et al 2017 and in particular for ukraine didovets et al 2017 krakovska et al 2012 therefore keeping in mind the ruinous floods in the past and expected climate change it is necessary to conduct an assessment of current and expected trends in flood magnitude and frequency in ukraine under warming climate especially in the vulnerable region of the carpathian mountains hence the main purpose of this research is to assess the impacts of climate change on high flows and flood frequency and magnitude in the mountainous carpathian region of ukraine in addition the impacts based on the dynamical and statistical downscaling methods are compared and uncertainties related to climate projections downscaling techniques and hydrological modelling are discussed the carpathian is characterised as a data scarce region with highly variable meteorological and hydrological conditions and therefore it was decided to combine regional observations with globally available data for this investigation the study was performed for two catchments in the region the upper tisza and the upper prut the climate projections were derived from five general circulation models gcms downscaled with a regional climate models rcms and with the statistical downscaling model xds two representative concentration pathways rcp rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were applied the eco hydrological swim model driven by the climate projections was used to simulate hydrological cycle in the basins under study with the focus on high flows and floods the model was calibrated and validated in advance for two outlet gauges and additionally checked for two extra gauges in the upstream parts of the studied basins the results of simulations based on climate projections under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios in the far future period 2071 2100 were compared with simulations in the reference period 1981 2010 driven by the same climate models finally the uncertainty in the projected high flows and floods was analysed 2 study area the tisza and prut rivers are tributaries of the danube river their catchment areas are shared by several countries ukraine romania hungary slovakia serbia and moldova the catchments of the upper tisza and upper prut in the following referred to as tisza and prut in the carpathian region fig 1 were selected as study areas due to data scarcity and missing data on water management only the upper parts of the river catchments were considered the major part of our study areas lies within ukraine and covers approximately a half of the mountain region of ukrainian carpathians this region is also important as water source for the whole danube catchment both rivers are essential for the local population as the tisza catchment covers the whole zakarpattia oblast ukraine and the prut catchment partly covers ivano frankivsk and chernivtsi oblasts with total population of more than 2 million people they are the main sources of water for domestic agricultural and industrial use the drainage areas of the tisza and prut catchments are 9530 km2 and 9300 km2 respectively the climate in both catchments is temperate with average annual precipitation of 1100 mm in the tisza catchment and 758 mm in the prut catchment in the period from 1980 to 2000 the mean monthly temperatures in january july were 3 9 16 9 c in the tisza and 3 9 c 17 5 c in the prut catchment the average discharge at the vilok gauge in the tisza is 206 m3 s 1992 2010 and it is 80 m3 s at the radauti gauge in the prut 1980 2000 the hydrological regimes of both catchments are snowmelt and rainfall driven the minimum runoff is observed in the fall winter period for the prut catchment and in the summer fall period for the tisza catchment the basins have different flood regimes and timing in recent years the majority of floods occurred in november december and spring months in the tisza and in the late spring and summer months in the prut fig 2 this can be explained by differences in the catchments shapes climate conditions topography and land use the average annual precipitation is higher in the tisza compared to the prut catchment this can be explained by prevailing of western air masses coming to the region and the windward and leeward side conditions that take place in the catchments the western air masses bring wet conditions firstly to the tisza catchment and after that partly retained by mountains to the prut catchment also the percentage of area covered by mountains in the tisza catchment is much higher the altitudes of both catchments range between 90 95 m a s l at the outlets and 2100 m a s l in the headwaters however the percentage of area with an elevation above 600 m a s l is over 70 in the tisza catchment and only 34 in the prut catchment the tisza catchment stretches from north west to the south east along the carpathian mountains it allows to accumulate more water from precipitation compared to the prut which stretches from west to east also the prevailing land use types in the catchment forest in the tisza and crops in the prut play important roles in defining their hydrological regimes and flood timing in the mountainous areas forest can delay hydrological responses of river runoff after intense precipitation events and slow down snowmelt process in case of a rapid increase of air temperature in spring but in the case of deforestation there could be opposite effects and an additional risk of erosion most floods that occur in fall winter seasons in the tisza river are generated by a combination of rapid increase in the air temperature causing snow melt and heavy precipitation events in the prut catchment such conditions are also possible but there is no such a pronounced overarching response of snowmelt and rainfall generated floods due to lower elevation and more narrow and long shape of the catchment the main land cover classes in the tisza catchment are forest deciduous evergreen and mixed 56 2 and cropland 8 5 the prut catchment has a different structure the main land cover classes are cropland 47 evergreen forest 22 and grassland 8 8 both rivers are regulated by dams and ponds there are nine reservoirs with a total volume of 60 5 hm3 in the ukrainian part of the tisza catchment and they are mostly used for seasonal water regulation fishing and amelioration purposes there are no big reservoirs in the prut catchment but many ponds in the downstream part it was not possible to include water management in the modelling due to the lack of adequate management data for these catchments 3 data and methods 3 1 swim the eco hydrological model swim is a process based semi distributed model swim is based on two previously developed models matsalu krysanova et al 1989 and swat arnold et al 1993 and implements the hydrological cycle nutrients cycles nitrogen and phosphorus vegetation growth and sediment transport at the river basin scale the model was developed mainly for impact studies in mesoscale and large river basins swim has a three level disaggregation scheme basin sub basins hydrotopes hydrotopes are homogeneous spatial sets of units within sub basins obtained by overlapping land use soil and sub basin map layers the climate data are interpolated to centroids of sub basins and are considered homogeneous at the sub basin level the inverse distance method was implemented for the climate data interpolation the model swim considers the climate data on the sub basin level homogenously but precipitation and temperature were corrected at the hydrotope level during calibration of the model based on simple elevation dependencies and applied for all period of modelling the model was intensively tested and has been applied for impact assessments in more than 50 catchments worldwide particularly in europe hattermann et al 2008 huang et al 2013 asia krysanova et al 2015 america huang et al 2016 koch et al 2015 and africa aich et al 2014 the model continues to be developed further e g glacier and reservoir modules were recently included and tested koch et al 2013 lobanova et al 2017 wortmann et al 2016 to assess the model performance for simulation of river discharge the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 criteria were used in the study also the annual maxima and return levels of floods were compared for the tisza and prut river catchments the swim model was calibrated and validated for the tisza and prut river catchments for the period from 1980 to 2000 in both cases the first half of the period was taken for calibration and second for validation the observed river discharge from the vilok and tiszabecs gauges in the tisza and from the radauti and chernivtsi gauges in the prut was used data for the vilok and tiszabecs gauges were available only for a part of the whole period from 1990 to 2000 and from 1980 to 1992 correspondingly therefore it was decided to combine data and to calibrate the model for the tiszabecs and validate it for the vilok gauge because the gauges are located very close to each other on the hungary ukraine border for the prut catchment the model was calibrated and validated for the radauti gauge and additionally verified for the chernivtsi gauge since both catchments are located in the mountains they are snowmelt and rainfall driven the sensitivity analysis was performed in advance for the curve number parameters of soils groundwater and evapotranspiration related parameters the most sensitive parameters during the calibration were related to snowmelt runoff generation and routing processes 3 2 input data for the swim model setup the following data are needed land use digital elevation model dem soil map with the soil profile parametrisation and climate data daily minimal maximal and average temperature precipitation solar radiation air humidity and solar radiation for this study a dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm of the cgiar consortium for spatial information the spatial resolution of the dem is 90 m with appropriate correction cgiar csi 2017 due to the absence of land use maps in digital form the data was derived from different open sources open street map contributors 2017 patterson and kelso 2016 u s dept of the interior 2005 and also by classification of satellite images u s geological survey 2016 the 30 m resolution map derived for the catchments under study was reclassified to the swim required format 15 classes water settlement industry road bare soil cropland meadow pasture set aside evergreen forest deciduous forest mixed forest wetland heather and glaciers the soil map and a partial parametrization of soil layers were obtained from the harmonized world soil database created by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations with 1 km resolution fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 the data were prepared and converted to the swim format and some missing parameters such as porosity field capacity saturated conductivity and erodibility factor were estimated with pedotransfer functions wosten et al 2001 some of the necessary climate data daily minimal maximal and average temperatures and precipitation were obtained for the period 1980 2000 from 12 climate stations located in the area under study fig 1 the majority of stations are located in lowland and only one station is located at elevation above 900 m a s l the average climate station density is 1 station per 2500 km2 other necessary climate variables air humidity solar radiation wind were not available therefore it was decided to add these variables from the reanalysis data watch forcing data era interim wfdei weedon et al 2014 and to combine them with the observed ones also precipitation data obtained from wfdei and global precipitation climatology centre gpcc were considered as potential inputs to the swim model but gpcc and wfdei data showed underestimation during the whole year in comparison to the observed data due to that and low spatial resolution in case of gpcc 1 1 it was decided to use the observed precipitation data the discharge data were obtained from the global runoff data centre grdc 56068 koblenz for three runoff gauges and from the ukrainian hydrometeorological center for one gauge the prut river dynamics are represented by the daily discharge from the radauti gauge located in romania for the period from 1960 to 2008 river discharge for the tisza catchment was obtained for the tiszabecs gauge in hungary for the period 1937 1995 and the vilok gauge in ukraine for the period 1992 2010 the tiscsabecs and vilok gauges are located close to each other on the ukrainian hungary border and have very similar hydrographs 3 3 climate scenarios 3 3 1 climate scenarios downscaled by rcms from the european impressions project a set of seven climate scenarios provided by the european impressions project impacts and risk from high end scenarios strategies for innovative solutions www impressions project eu was used in this study the scenarios are based on five general circulation models that have been dynamically downscaled using the regional climate models and bias corrected to the reanalysis data wfdei kok et al 2015a fig 3 upper part the climate projections are represented by the gcm rcm climate simulations under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 pathways with resolutions of 0 5 the climate scenarios were selected to cover the magnitude of temperature change for period 2071 2100 compared to 1981 2010 in the range from 1 to 1 4 to above 4 kok et al 2015 and include not all combinations of gcms and rcps the applied climate scenarios for rcp 4 5 are gfdl esm2m rca4 hadgem2 es rca4 and mpi esm lr cclm4 and for rcp8 5 gfdl esm2m rca4 hadgem2 es rca4 canesm2 canrcm4 and ipsl cm5a mr wrf for the bias correction the empirical quantile method was used kok et al 2015b the period from 1981 to 2010 was taken as the basis for the correction each climate variable precipitation mean maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and specific humidity was corrected independently one by one themeßl et al 2012 for this study two emission scenarios were chosen rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 and all seven climate scenarios were applied denoted as gcm r 45 or gcm r 85 see fig 3 in the following referred to as gcm rcm scenarios 3 3 2 four scenarios downscaled by the statistical empirical method the expanded downscaling method xds bürger 1996 is a statistical empirical technique for downscaling which extends the method of multiple linear regression mlr in a way aimed in generating more realistic multivariate local statistics the idea is to reproduce the local meteorology as close as possible to the simulated general atmospheric circulation but at the same time taking into account the local co variability aspects like mlr the method determines a multivariate linear function between the large scale variables and the local data the preservation of local covariance is conditioned on the observed or simulated global covariance so that when driven by global data whose statistics may be altered e g by climate change the local covariability would change accordingly this aspect of preservation and alteration of local covariances makes the technique particularly suited for the simulation of extreme events we used the era interim reanalysis data wfdei and local data from climate stations for the xds calibration after that xds was applied to the gfdl esm2m and hadgem2 projections under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 pathways fig 3 lower part to produce the following atmospheric variables minimum maximum and average daily temperatures specific humidity at the 850 hpa level and surface precipitation the period 1981 1990 was selected for calibration and period 1991 1999 for validation local observations were taken from 12 local climate stations and from the wfdei data for the considered catchments the xds technique produced good results when driven by reanalysis and the gcm simulations in the following referred to as gcm xds for the period 1981 1999 based on the comparison of downscaled daily average maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation for 12 climate stations with actual observations the correlation of the modelled variables with the measurements for the calibration and validation periods is presented in table 1 the correlation was calculated for all 12 climate stations for two periods calibration and validation by using daily data and averaged over 12 stations the high correlation obtained for precipitation in the mountainous area is quite surprising 3 4 extreme value analysis of flood level to analyse climate induced changes in flood level the generalised extreme value distribution gev see more details in coles 2001 was applied in this study the gev distribution was used to fit the annual maximum discharges and estimate changes in the 30 year flood levels the gev distribution incorporates three probability distributions gumbel frechet and weibull and has three parameters location parameter scale parameter and shape parameter we employ a block maximum approach which means that for each year we pick the maximum flow event and neglect all other high flow events the gev distribution function is commonly used for climate impact assessment on floods and was applied in other studies e g dankers et al 2007 huang et al 2013 in addition the means and 98 and 95 percentile values were estimated for the reference 1980 2010 and far future 2070 2100 periods and compared to evaluate future changes in river discharge 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the obtained results of calibration are between good and very good according to thresholds proposed by moriasi et al 2007 the nse for the tisza tiszabecs gauge is 0 69 and pbias 15 2 in the calibration period and 0 78 and 11 3 vilok gauge in the validation period correspondingly the results of model calibration and validation for the prut radauti gauge are nse 0 81 pbias 0 2 for the calibration and nse 0 67 pbias 6 8 for the validation period fig 4 shows the gev plots of the annual maxima for the simulated and observed discharge in the control period from 1980 to 2000 for the tisza and prut river catchments as one can see the agreement is quite good in both cases 4 2 analysis of climate model outputs in the historical and far future periods the uncertainty which is inherent in coupled climate simulations contributes strongly to the uncertainty in simulated river discharge the climate models uncertainty can be clearly shown by the differences between the simulated and observed climate variables in the historical period table 2 presents these differences for the means and 95 and 98 percentiles of annual precipitation average maximum and minimum annual temperatures estimated for the pozhezhevska climate station located in mountains for both downscaling schemes rcms and xds differences vary from small to large and they are naturally smaller for the means than for the extremes for precipitation tmax and tave the bias in 98 and 95 percentiles is smaller for climate simulations downscaled by xds than by rcm the simulations downscaled by xds have generally lower differences except for mean p and tmin the larger differences between climate simulations downscaled by rcms and observations despite bias correction of the projections to the wfdei can be explained by poor data availability in mountainous areas e g low gauge density stations are mostly located in valleys weedon et al 2014 the lower differences produced by model runs downscaled by xds can be explained by different approach used for downscaling this technique calculates climate variables for the points i e for the locations of observation stations and in the case of simulations downscaled by rcms it is done for grid cells also the xds approach uses the observed climate data for historical period and thus better performance in this period is evident the bias of simulated climate variables for the lowland stations is lower but still moderate the analysis for the lowland stations was done but results are not shown in the paper as the next step we analysed climate projections in the far future 2071 2100 and compared them with simulations of the same models in the reference period 1981 2010 for three representative stations chernivtsi and hust in lowland and pozhezhevska in mountains table 3 summarises the results of comparison shown are the differences in simulated temperature and precipitation characteristics the long term means and the 98 and 95 percentiles obtained from the gcm rcm and gcm xds model combinations under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission pathways the mean temperature shows increases in all projections for both emission pathways ranging from 0 8 c to 6 2 c the hadgem2 downscaled with xds model projections show higher increases in mean temperature compared to other projections changes also depend on the emission pathway the temperature increases under rcp 8 5 are higher compared to rcp 4 5 the higher changes in annual temperature under rcp 8 5 were expected these gcm rcm models were chosen in the impressions project to represent the high end scenarios with changes of annual temperature from 1 to 1 5 to more than 4 in the period 2071 2100 compared to 1981 2010 kok et al 2015 the similar changes in annual temperature were found for the gcm rcm scenarios under rcp 8 5 for other catchments in ukraine didovets et al 2017 regarding seasonal changes in temperature the median projections show warming during the whole year under both rcps the increase in fall winter is more significant than in spring summer but the former one has also wider ranges of models spread the majority of projections show an increase in mean 95 and 98 percentiles precipitation for the highland area station pozhezhevska but there is no clear trend for the lowland stations in all three stations changes in mean 95 and 98 percentiles precipitation simulated by had r 45 had r 85 can r 85 and ipsl r 85 are positive and for the last one greater than 20 two projections under rcp 4 5 had x and had r and three projections under rcp 8 5 gfdl x had x ipsl r show significant increases in all three variables in mountains exceeding 10 20 for had x 48 three projections under rcp 4 5 gfdl and mpi show small changes not exceeding 6 5 for three variables in all stations regarding changes in seasonality mean precipitation under both rcps scenarios increases during almost all months except august and september under rcp 8 5 changes in the mean precipitation over sub basins of the prut and tisza catchments are presented on maps in annex 1 figure a1 and a2 the ipsl r 85 shows the greatest increase among all scenarios 25 26 in both catchments also the hadgem2 projections show increases by 10 18 under rcp 4 5 in both catchments and by 12 under rcp 8 5 in the tisza one projection of two this is in agreement with change signals for two stations presented in table 3 except hust and the can r 85 projects 10 increase in precipitation for the prut all other projections indicate small average changes in precipitation over the catchments not exceeding 5 4 3 simulated changes in high flows and floods table 4 presents changes in the means and 95 and 98 percentiles of the simulated discharge for the tisza and prut river catchments driven by gcm rcm and gcm xds climate projections under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios for the far future period compared to the reference period projections largely disagree on the direction and magnitude of changes in all variables for both catchments the largest positive changes for all variables were simulated under had r 45 and ipsl r 85 projections for both basins and this agrees well with precipitation trends in table 3 and on maps in annex 1 figure a1 and a2 the largest negative changes are simulated for all three variables under gfdl x 85 for both catchments and under had x 85 for the prut catchment all gfdl based projections show negative trends under both rcps for both catchments ranging from 1 to 25 both hadgem2 based projections show small to large positive changes under rcp45 and mostly negative changes under rcp85 except under had r 85 for the prut catchment based on the simulated discharge time series in both catchments flood frequency analyses were performed for all eleven scenario combinations the results are shown in table 5 for the 30 year floods and in figs 5 and 6 for flood return periods up to 100 years however due to the pronounced uncertainty resulting from climate scenarios and downscaling techniques as well as limited durations of the observed discharge time series for estimation of flood levels in the reference period it was decided to constrain the comparison of different scenario results to the 30 year flood level only the simulated changes in the 30 year flood for the tisza river show a small to strong increase ranging from 4 5 to 61 7 for four projections under rcp 4 5 except one decrease by 7 8 under mpi r 45 however the signals of change show larger disagreement for projections under rcp 8 5 two projections indicate a decrease up to 22 three an increase up to 99 6 under ipsl r 85 and one negligible change the simulated changes in the 30 year flood for the prut river are similar three projections show a moderate increase ranging from 11 to 22 under rcp 4 5 and one a decrease by 9 under gfdl r 45 the changes in the prut catchment under rcp 8 5 are also similar to those in the tisza two projections show a decrease up to 22 had x 8 5 three indicate an increase up to 93 and one small changes in both catchments the largest change is driven by ipsl r 8 5 and this agrees well with precipitation changes in table 5 and annex 1 figs a1 and a2 comparing projected changes in the 30 year flood based on the xds and rcm approaches it is clearly visible that simulations based on rcm scenarios show larger mean positive changes for the tisza both rcps and prut rcp 8 5 and generally larger ranges of uncertainty than simulations based on xds in both catchments fig 5 6 the model runs based on the xds downscaling produce much smaller signals of change which are positive for rcp 4 5 and negative for rcp 8 5 for both catchments the difference in spreads could be partly explained by the different numbers of scenarios in two groups this is also in agreement with the model spreads presented in tables 4 and 5 by comparing the same gcms had and gfdl for both catchments 5 discussion mountains belong to the most sensitive regions to climate change and it is very important to study climate change impacts there because mountain ecosystems are sources of major rivers biodiversity and providers of vital resources to population kohler et al 2010 the climate impact assessments with the focus on floods in europe in particular for mountain regions were presented by köplin et al 2014 roudier et al 2016 and meresa et al 2017 using different methods and climate projections the results obtained in the study of roudier et al 2016 for europe could be analysed together with our results for the carpathian region though a direct comparison is hardly possible due to differences in settings and methods anyway some projections in both studies show similar tendencies the procedure for assessment of climate change impacts on hydrological extremes is usually the following gcms are run for different greenhouse gas emission scenarios downscaling techniques are used to downscale gcm outputs to a region a hydrological model is run with different downscaled climate scenarios and statistical tools are used for the extreme value analysis meresa et al 2017 all these steps involve certain ranges of uncertainty in their outputs our study includes five different gcms two emission scenarios and different downscaling techniques dynamical models and statistical empirical approach which were applied for two major carpathian mountain river systems one of the issues affecting overall uncertainty can be related to the limited number of ensemble members in our case we used five gcms in total 11 scenarios five under rcp 4 5 and six under rcp 8 5 to cover the range of temperature changes from 1 to 1 5 to more than 4 for the future period in the paper of dalelane et al 2017 authors investigated approaches for decreasing the number of ensemble members their results show a decrease from 15 to 7 ensemble members which still represent 90 of the original climate change signals temperature and precipitation in the future period compared to 1971 2000 we did not use method that has been mentioned above but we can expect that the number of our ensemble members may be sufficient to include potential climate change signals being an essential source area of freshwater for the danube river and due to its significance for tourism and recreation the study region is very important for ukraine romania and moldova nevertheless the region has been rarely investigated in the context of climate change until now the quality of observational data plays a prominent role for the reliability of climate impact assessment in the area under consideration the number of climate stations is quite limited 12 stations in total one station per 2500 km2 on average and the majority of stations are located in the lowland parts only one station is located at an elevation above 900 m a s l the required interpolation of meteorological data to sub basins in highlands can deteriorate the quality of input climate data for hydrological modelling in addition interpolation over relatively large distances may result in disregarding local extreme precipitation events uncertainty in precipitation due to the lack of meteorological observation data in combination with specific climate conditions in the mountainous regions is a big issue one of recommendations for reducing the uncertainty can be using additional climate data sources for improving calibration also pluntke et al 2014 recommended to use alternative precipitation inputs and the ensemble approach to reduce the uncertainty nevertheless the deviations of more than 2 c in tavr and 15 in precipitation for climate scenarios in the historical period after a bias correction are large in case of rcm scenarios one of possible source of uncertainty can appear from inconsistency between climate elements when doing an independent correction for each variable the relatively short duration of hydrological observations could increase uncertainty of estimation the return flood levels therefore we did not explicitly analyse the 50 and 100 year floods but focused on the 30 year floods only uncertainty can also originate from methods of river discharge measurements in the case of extreme events it is more difficult to estimate the specific peak rate correctly for example in our case data from the tiszabecs and vilok gauges which are located close to each other show inaccuracies as during some high flow events the upstream gauge showed higher discharge values than the downstream one the impacts of water management in the catchments could also have significant effects on river runoff particularly on droughts and to a lesser extent on extreme floods in our study area there are no large reservoirs that could be modelled by swim and the existing small ones are used for agriculture and fishing purposes most of them do not affect flood peaks notably there are also dikes constructed as a part of flood protection measures the abstracted water is distributed mainly among domestic uses and agriculture and partly for industrial enterprises in both catchments under study unfortunately missing information about water management during flooding periods did not allow us to take water management into account in this study the uncertainty analysis related to climate projections showed that the scenarios have smaller biases for mean precipitation in the historical period but the bias is much higher in the case of the 98 and 95 percentiles this confirms that average conditions can be reflected much better by the combined climate and downscaling models than the extreme conditions bronstert et al 2007 as floods in the tisza catchment occur in the fall spring months snow melt may play a prominent role in flooding processes the bias in temperature in future climate projections can lead to uncertainties in the projected flood timing and magnitude especially for the gcm rcm driven scenarios where bias in the historical period is up to 5 c nevertheless the type of the applied downscaling method is quite important as the uncertainty due to such methods can be much higher compared to emission scenarios in our study there are inconsistent trends and different signals of change in projections obtained using rcms and xds as well as among five gcms 6 conclusions in this work we attempted to assess the potential climate change impacts on floods in the carpathian region considering the upper tisza and upper prut river catchments as case studies which can be considered representative for western and eastern hydro meteorological conditions in the high carpathians the climate projections indicate on increase in the mean annual temperature under two rcps in both catchments the projected changes in precipitation show increases in the highland area in the majority of scenarios but for lowland the signal is not clear based on the simulated time series for the future climate conditions the analysis of changes in the magnitude of 30 year floods was done the results show an increase of flood level for the majority of projections under rcp 4 5 ranging from 4 5 to 62 in the tisza and from 11 to 22 in the prut the moderate decreasing trends by 8 9 were detected just in one of five projections for each basin however the projections under rcp 8 5 for both catchments are more uncertain two of six projections indicate a decrease up to 22 three an increase up to 93 99 and one shows negligible changes the largest increases in the 30 year flood level exceeding 92 were simulated under ipsl r 85 in both catchments and exceeding 40 under had r for the tisza both rcps and prut rcp 8 5 more significant changes in flood level were found for two projections driven by ipcl r 85 and had r 85 in both catchments and for one projection driven by had r 45 in the tisza catchment this study demonstrated the influence and sensitivity of different elements of the scenario and model chain on the projection of floods for the future we want to emphasize that it is essential to include and analyse those uncertainties in the model based impact assessment in our case study the choice of a particular gcm and downscaling technique has shown the strongest influence on the outputs due to the gcm related uncertainty it was not possible to produce a clear and consistence picture of the future expected impacts on floods in the region a bit surprising was that rcps had a comparatively smaller influence and were not consistent with the simulated changes which were sometimes higher under rcp 4 5 than under rcp 8 5 the annual mean change in precipitation was rather small within 5 in 64 of all projections 7 from 11 in both catchments and it was ranging from 10 to 26 in four scenarios similar increasing trends for eastern europe were projected with different rcms from the euro cordex eea 2017 regarding simulation of the historical climate conditions the gcm xds model combinations showed much lower bias in simulating temperature and a bit lower in simulating precipitation compared to gcms with the dynamical downscaling models this can be explained by the method of downscaling and correction to data of climate stations regarding the future changes driven by gcms downscaled by dynamical models and xds the impacts often show different patterns see figs 5 and 6 furthermore from our results we can conclude that the empirical statistical downscaling method employed here produced smaller signals of change in flood levels and a smaller uncertainty compared to the dynamical downscaling method this finding partly supports the conclusion of bronstert et al 2007 who found that methods like this which were developed specifically to represent the climatological variance and or anomalies are particularly suitable for impact analysis of hydrological extremes however along with it the statistical methods can give an additional uncertainty in future projections in case of statistical relationship changes the emission and climate scenarios do not show a coherent and consistent picture regarding changes in precipitation in the case study region leading to analogous uncertain results of impact assessment on river discharge and floods in presented research the higher emission scenario rcp 8 5 does not show a stronger trend in simulated river discharge than the moderate scenario rcp 4 5 in our opinion the major reason for the generally large uncertainty of projections in this region is uncertainty stemming from the gcm simulations and low density of climate observations reducing uncertainties due to input data is a particular challenge for the carpathian region and it is essential for more reliable projections of floods in the future so it is important to improve the

introduction in recent decades observed climate trends show an increase in temperature across europe ipcc 2014 precipitation totals show regionally varying changes and have no clear continental trend

in summer and northern and eastern europe in winter kjellström et al 2011 mitchell et al 2004 annual precipitation totals show a less clear signal of change in the 21st century compared to temperature although there is agreement of most projections on an overall annual increase in northern europe of up to 30 and decrease in southern europe of up to 40 by the end of the century jacob et al 2014 kjellström et al 2011 an increasing trend for extreme precipitation by the end of the century was also claimed for northern europe ipcc 2014 although the uncertainty of such projection is very high however recent studies on extreme rainfall intensities over recent decades have shown that an increasing trend of high intensity rain storms can be identified for several regions in central europe if one investigates short time increments i e between a few minutes to one hour see e g mueller and pfister 2011 and bürger et al 2014 changing climate will affect river discharge the future changes in the mean and extreme river discharge can be regionally different in some studies there are indications of a shift in seasonality of river discharge and floods with increases in winter and autumn and decreases in spring e g in finland veijalainen et al 2010 and norway vormoor et al 2015 also increases in high flow and 10 year flood level were found in france quintana seguí et al 2011 in contrast the decreases in 10 year flood and mean annual flood were projected for the alpine lech catchment with a significant increase in winter floods dobler et al 2012 in another study for the alps the mean annual floods and maximum floods are projected to increase in switzerland and to decrease in the southern alps köplin et al 2014 the study of meresa et al 2017 focused on a mountain catchment in poland projected an increase in the annual maximal flow by the end of the century increasing trends in temperature were observed in ukraine balabukh and lukianets 2015 kynal and kholiavchuk 2016 spinoni et al 2015 however no changes in the observed annual maximum river discharge were found in the rainfall and snowmelt driven rivers in mountainous areas within ukraine for the last 60 years gorbachova and barandich 2016 despite the large number of papers focusing on climate change impacts on extremes in europe there are only a few studies on changes in extreme precipitation and river discharge done for eastern europe meresa et al 2017 piniewski et al 2017 and in particular for ukraine didovets et al 2017 krakovska et al 2012 therefore keeping in mind the ruinous floods in the past and expected climate change it is necessary to conduct an assessment of current and expected trends in flood magnitude and frequency in ukraine under warming climate especially in the vulnerable region of the carpathian mountains hence the main purpose of this research is to assess the impacts of climate change on high flows and flood frequency and magnitude in the mountainous carpathian region of ukraine in addition the impacts based on the dynamical and statistical downscaling methods are compared and uncertainties related to climate projections downscaling techniques and hydrological modelling are discussed the carpathian is characterised as a data scarce region with highly variable meteorological and hydrological conditions and therefore it was decided to combine regional observations with globally available data for this investigation the study was performed for two catchments in the region the upper tisza and the upper prut the climate projections were derived from five general circulation models gcms downscaled with a regional climate models rcms and with the statistical downscaling model xds two representative concentration pathways rcp rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were applied the eco hydrological swim model driven by the climate projections was used to simulate hydrological cycle in the basins under study with the focus on high flows and floods the model was calibrated and validated in advance for two outlet gauges and additionally checked for two extra gauges in the upstream parts of the studied basins the results of simulations based on climate projections under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios in the far future period 2071 2100 were compared with simulations in the reference period 1981 2010 driven by the same climate models finally the uncertainty in the projected high flows and floods was analysed 2 study area the tisza and prut rivers are tributaries of the danube river their catchment areas are shared by several countries ukraine romania hungary slovakia serbia and moldova the catchments of the upper tisza and upper prut in the following referred to as tisza and prut in the carpathian region fig 1 were selected as study areas due to data scarcity and missing data on water management only the upper parts of the river catchments were considered the major part of our study areas lies within ukraine and covers approximately a half of the mountain region of ukrainian carpathians this region is also important as water source for the whole danube catchment both rivers are essential for the local population as the tisza catchment covers the whole zakarpattia oblast ukraine and the prut catchment partly covers ivano frankivsk and chernivtsi oblasts with total population of more than 2 million people they are the main sources of water for domestic agricultural and industrial use the drainage areas of the tisza and prut catchments are 9530 km2 and 9300 km2 respectively the climate in both catchments is temperate with average annual precipitation of 1100 mm in the tisza catchment and 758 mm in the prut catchment in the period from 1980 to 2000 the mean monthly temperatures in january july were 3 9 16 9 c in the tisza and 3 9 c 17 5 c in the prut catchment the average discharge at the vilok gauge in the tisza is 206 m3 s 1992 2010 and it is 80 m3 s at the radauti gauge in the prut 1980 2000 the hydrological regimes of both catchments are snowmelt and rainfall driven the minimum runoff is observed in the fall winter period for the prut catchment and in the summer fall period for the tisza catchment the basins have different flood regimes and timing in recent years the majority of floods occurred in november december and spring months in the tisza and in the late spring and summer months in the prut fig 2 this can be explained by differences in the catchments shapes climate conditions topography and land use the average annual precipitation is higher in the tisza compared to the prut catchment this can be explained by prevailing of western air masses coming to the region and the windward and leeward side conditions that take place in the catchments the western air masses bring wet conditions firstly to the tisza catchment and after that partly retained by mountains to the prut catchment also the percentage of area covered by mountains in the tisza catchment is much higher the altitudes of both catchments range between 90 95 m a s l at the outlets and 2100 m a s l in the headwaters however the percentage of area with an elevation above 600 m a s l is over 70 in the tisza catchment and only 34 in the prut catchment the tisza catchment stretches from north west to the south east along the carpathian mountains it allows to accumulate more water from precipitation compared to the prut which stretches from west to east also the prevailing land use types in the catchment forest in the tisza and crops in the prut play important roles in defining their hydrological regimes and flood timing in the mountainous areas forest can delay hydrological responses of river runoff after intense precipitation events and slow down snowmelt process in case of a rapid increase of air temperature in spring but in the case of deforestation there could be opposite effects and an additional risk of erosion most floods that occur in fall winter seasons in the tisza river are generated by a combination of rapid increase in the air temperature causing snow melt and heavy precipitation events in the prut catchment such conditions are also possible but there is no such a pronounced overarching response of snowmelt and rainfall generated floods due to lower elevation and more narrow and long shape of the catchment the main land cover classes in the tisza catchment are forest deciduous evergreen and mixed 56 2 and cropland 8 5 the prut catchment has a different structure the main land cover classes are cropland 47 evergreen forest 22 and grassland 8 8 both rivers are regulated by dams and ponds there are nine reservoirs with a total volume of 60 5 hm3 in the ukrainian part of the tisza catchment and they are mostly used for seasonal water regulation fishing and amelioration purposes there are no big reservoirs in the prut catchment but many ponds in the downstream part it was not possible to include water management in the modelling due to the lack of adequate management data for these catchments 3 data and methods 3 1 swim the eco hydrological model swim is a process based semi distributed model swim is based on two previously developed models matsalu krysanova et al 1989 and swat arnold et al 1993 and implements the hydrological cycle nutrients cycles nitrogen and phosphorus vegetation growth and sediment transport at the river basin scale the model was developed mainly for impact studies in mesoscale and large river basins swim has a three level disaggregation scheme basin sub basins hydrotopes hydrotopes are homogeneous spatial sets of units within sub basins obtained by overlapping land use soil and sub basin map layers the climate data are interpolated to centroids of sub basins and are considered homogeneous at the sub basin level the inverse distance method was implemented for the climate data interpolation the model swim considers the climate data on the sub basin level homogenously but precipitation and temperature were corrected at the hydrotope level during calibration of the model based on simple elevation dependencies and applied for all period of modelling the model was intensively tested and has been applied for impact assessments in more than 50 catchments worldwide particularly in europe hattermann et al 2008 huang et al 2013 asia krysanova et al 2015 america huang et al 2016 koch et al 2015 and africa aich et al 2014 the model continues to be developed further e g glacier and reservoir modules were recently included and tested koch et al 2013 lobanova et al 2017 wortmann et al 2016 to assess the model performance for simulation of river discharge the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 criteria were used in the study also the annual maxima and return levels of floods were compared for the tisza and prut river catchments the swim model was calibrated and validated for the tisza and prut river catchments for the period from 1980 to 2000 in both cases the first half of the period was taken for calibration and second for validation the observed river discharge from the vilok and tiszabecs gauges in the tisza and from the radauti and chernivtsi gauges in the prut was used data for the vilok and tiszabecs gauges were available only for a part of the whole period from 1990 to 2000 and from 1980 to 1992 correspondingly therefore it was decided to combine data and to calibrate the model for the tiszabecs and validate it for the vilok gauge because the gauges are located very close to each other on the hungary ukraine border for the prut catchment the model was calibrated and validated for the radauti gauge and additionally verified for the chernivtsi gauge since both catchments are located in the mountains they are snowmelt and rainfall driven the sensitivity analysis was performed in advance for the curve number parameters of soils groundwater and evapotranspiration related parameters the most sensitive parameters during the calibration were related to snowmelt runoff generation and routing processes 3 2 input data for the swim model setup the following data are needed land use digital elevation model dem soil map with the soil profile parametrisation and climate data daily minimal maximal and average temperature precipitation solar radiation air humidity and solar radiation for this study a dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm of the cgiar consortium for spatial information the spatial resolution of the dem is 90 m with appropriate correction cgiar csi 2017 due to the absence of land use maps in digital form the data was derived from different open sources open street map contributors 2017 patterson and kelso 2016 u s dept of the interior 2005 and also by classification of satellite images u s geological survey 2016 the 30 m resolution map derived for the catchments under study was reclassified to the swim required format 15 classes water settlement industry road bare soil cropland meadow pasture set aside evergreen forest deciduous forest mixed forest wetland heather and glaciers the soil map and a partial parametrization of soil layers were obtained from the harmonized world soil database created by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations with 1 km resolution fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 the data were prepared and converted to the swim format and some missing parameters such as porosity field capacity saturated conductivity and erodibility factor were estimated with pedotransfer functions wosten et al 2001 some of the necessary climate data daily minimal maximal and average temperatures and precipitation were obtained for the period 1980 2000 from 12 climate stations located in the area under study fig 1 the majority of stations are located in lowland and only one station is located at elevation above 900 m a s l the average climate station density is 1 station per 2500 km2 other necessary climate variables air humidity solar radiation wind were not available therefore it was decided to add these variables from the reanalysis data watch forcing data era interim wfdei weedon et al 2014 and to combine them with the observed ones also precipitation data obtained from wfdei and global precipitation climatology centre gpcc were considered as potential inputs to the swim model but gpcc and wfdei data showed underestimation during the whole year in comparison to the observed data due to that and low spatial resolution in case of gpcc 1 1 it was decided to use the observed precipitation data the discharge data were obtained from the global runoff data centre grdc 56068 koblenz for three runoff gauges and from the ukrainian hydrometeorological center for one gauge the prut river dynamics are represented by the daily discharge from the radauti gauge located in romania for the period from 1960 to 2008 river discharge for the tisza catchment was obtained for the tiszabecs gauge in hungary for the period 1937 1995 and the vilok gauge in ukraine for the period 1992 2010 the tiscsabecs and vilok gauges are located close to each other on the ukrainian hungary border and have very similar hydrographs 3 3 climate scenarios 3 3 1 climate scenarios downscaled by rcms from the european impressions project a set of seven climate scenarios provided by the european impressions project impacts and risk from high end scenarios strategies for innovative solutions www impressions project eu was used in this study the scenarios are based on five general circulation models that have been dynamically downscaled using the regional climate models and bias corrected to the reanalysis data wfdei kok et al 2015a fig 3 upper part the climate projections are represented by the gcm rcm climate simulations under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 pathways with resolutions of 0 5 the climate scenarios were selected to cover the magnitude of temperature change for period 2071 2100 compared to 1981 2010 in the range from 1 to 1 4 to above 4 kok et al 2015 and include not all combinations of gcms and rcps the applied climate scenarios for rcp 4 5 are gfdl esm2m rca4 hadgem2 es rca4 and mpi esm lr cclm4 and for rcp8 5 gfdl esm2m rca4 hadgem2 es rca4 canesm2 canrcm4 and ipsl cm5a mr wrf for the bias correction the empirical quantile method was used kok et al 2015b the period from 1981 to 2010 was taken as the basis for the correction each climate variable precipitation mean maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and specific humidity was corrected independently one by one themeßl et al 2012 for this study two emission scenarios were chosen rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 and all seven climate scenarios were applied denoted as gcm r 45 or gcm r 85 see fig 3 in the following referred to as gcm rcm scenarios 3 3 2 four scenarios downscaled by the statistical empirical method the expanded downscaling method xds bürger 1996 is a statistical empirical technique for downscaling which extends the method of multiple linear regression mlr in a way aimed in generating more realistic multivariate local statistics the idea is to reproduce the local meteorology as close as possible to the simulated general atmospheric circulation but at the same time taking into account the local co variability aspects like mlr the method determines a multivariate linear function between the large scale variables and the local data the preservation of local covariance is conditioned on the observed or simulated global covariance so that when driven by global data whose statistics may be altered e g by climate change the local covariability would change accordingly this aspect of preservation and alteration of local covariances makes the technique particularly suited for the simulation of extreme events we used the era interim reanalysis data wfdei and local data from climate stations for the xds calibration after that xds was applied to the gfdl esm2m and hadgem2 projections under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 pathways fig 3 lower part to produce the following atmospheric variables minimum maximum and average daily temperatures specific humidity at the 850 hpa level and surface precipitation the period 1981 1990 was selected for calibration and period 1991 1999 for validation local observations were taken from 12 local climate stations and from the wfdei data for the considered catchments the xds technique produced good results when driven by reanalysis and the gcm simulations in the following referred to as gcm xds for the period 1981 1999 based on the comparison of downscaled daily average maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation for 12 climate stations with actual observations the correlation of the modelled variables with the measurements for the calibration and validation periods is presented in table 1 the correlation was calculated for all 12 climate stations for two periods calibration and validation by using daily data and averaged over 12 stations the high correlation obtained for precipitation in the mountainous area is quite surprising 3 4 extreme value analysis of flood level to analyse climate induced changes in flood level the generalised extreme value distribution gev see more details in coles 2001 was applied in this study the gev distribution was used to fit the annual maximum discharges and estimate changes in the 30 year flood levels the gev distribution incorporates three probability distributions gumbel frechet and weibull and has three parameters location parameter scale parameter and shape parameter we employ a block maximum approach which means that for each year we pick the maximum flow event and neglect all other high flow events the gev distribution function is commonly used for climate impact assessment on floods and was applied in other studies e g dankers et al 2007 huang et al 2013 in addition the means and 98 and 95 percentile values were estimated for the reference 1980 2010 and far future 2070 2100 periods and compared to evaluate future changes in river discharge 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the obtained results of calibration are between good and very good according to thresholds proposed by moriasi et al 2007 the nse for the tisza tiszabecs gauge is 0 69 and pbias 15 2 in the calibration period and 0 78 and 11 3 vilok gauge in the validation period correspondingly the results of model calibration and validation for the prut radauti gauge are nse 0 81 pbias 0 2 for the calibration and nse 0 67 pbias 6 8 for the validation period fig 4 shows the gev plots of the annual maxima for the simulated and observed discharge in the control period from 1980 to 2000 for the tisza and prut river catchments as one can see the agreement is quite good in both cases 4 2 analysis of climate model outputs in the historical and far future periods the uncertainty which is inherent in coupled climate simulations contributes strongly to the uncertainty in simulated river discharge the climate models uncertainty can be clearly shown by the differences between the simulated and observed climate variables in the historical period table 2 presents these differences for the means and 95 and 98 percentiles of annual precipitation average maximum and minimum annual temperatures estimated for the pozhezhevska climate station located in mountains for both downscaling schemes rcms and xds differences vary from small to large and they are naturally smaller for the means than for the extremes for precipitation tmax and tave the bias in 98 and 95 percentiles is smaller for climate simulations downscaled by xds than by rcm the simulations downscaled by xds have generally lower differences except for mean p and tmin the larger differences between climate simulations downscaled by rcms and observations despite bias correction of the projections to the wfdei can be explained by poor data availability in mountainous areas e g low gauge density stations are mostly located in valleys weedon et al 2014 the lower differences produced by model runs downscaled by xds can be explained by different approach used for downscaling this technique calculates climate variables for the points i e for the locations of observation stations and in the case of simulations downscaled by rcms it is done for grid cells also the xds approach uses the observed climate data for historical period and thus better performance in this period is evident the bias of simulated climate variables for the lowland stations is lower but still moderate the analysis for the lowland stations was done but results are not shown in the paper as the next step we analysed climate projections in the far future 2071 2100 and compared them with simulations of the same models in the reference period 1981 2010 for three representative stations chernivtsi and hust in lowland and pozhezhevska in mountains table 3 summarises the results of comparison shown are the differences in simulated temperature and precipitation characteristics the long term means and the 98 and 95 percentiles obtained from the gcm rcm and gcm xds model combinations under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission pathways the mean temperature shows increases in all projections for both emission pathways ranging from 0 8 c to 6 2 c the hadgem2 downscaled with xds model projections show higher increases in mean temperature compared to other projections changes also depend on the emission pathway the temperature increases under rcp 8 5 are higher compared to rcp 4 5 the higher changes in annual temperature under rcp 8 5 were expected these gcm rcm models were chosen in the impressions project to represent the high end scenarios with changes of annual temperature from 1 to 1 5 to more than 4 in the period 2071 2100 compared to 1981 2010 kok et al 2015 the similar changes in annual temperature were found for the gcm rcm scenarios under rcp 8 5 for other catchments in ukraine didovets et al 2017 regarding seasonal changes in temperature the median projections show warming during the whole year under both rcps the increase in fall winter is more significant than in spring summer but the former one has also wider ranges of models spread the majority of projections show an increase in mean 95 and 98 percentiles precipitation for the highland area station pozhezhevska but there is no clear trend for the lowland stations in all three stations changes in mean 95 and 98 percentiles precipitation simulated by had r 45 had r 85 can r 85 and ipsl r 85 are positive and for the last one greater than 20 two projections under rcp 4 5 had x and had r and three projections under rcp 8 5 gfdl x had x ipsl r show significant increases in all three variables in mountains exceeding 10 20 for had x 48 three projections under rcp 4 5 gfdl and mpi show small changes not exceeding 6 5 for three variables in all stations regarding changes in seasonality mean precipitation under both rcps scenarios increases during almost all months except august and september under rcp 8 5 changes in the mean precipitation over sub basins of the prut and tisza catchments are presented on maps in annex 1 figure a1 and a2 the ipsl r 85 shows the greatest increase among all scenarios 25 26 in both catchments also the hadgem2 projections show increases by 10 18 under rcp 4 5 in both catchments and by 12 under rcp 8 5 in the tisza one projection of two this is in agreement with change signals for two stations presented in table 3 except hust and the can r 85 projects 10 increase in precipitation for the prut all other projections indicate small average changes in precipitation over the catchments not exceeding 5 4 3 simulated changes in high flows and floods table 4 presents changes in the means and 95 and 98 percentiles of the simulated discharge for the tisza and prut river catchments driven by gcm rcm and gcm xds climate projections under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios for the far future period compared to the reference period projections largely disagree on the direction and magnitude of changes in all variables for both catchments the largest positive changes for all variables were simulated under had r 45 and ipsl r 85 projections for both basins and this agrees well with precipitation trends in table 3 and on maps in annex 1 figure a1 and a2 the largest negative changes are simulated for all three variables under gfdl x 85 for both catchments and under had x 85 for the prut catchment all gfdl based projections show negative trends under both rcps for both catchments ranging from 1 to 25 both hadgem2 based projections show small to large positive changes under rcp45 and mostly negative changes under rcp85 except under had r 85 for the prut catchment based on the simulated discharge time series in both catchments flood frequency analyses were performed for all eleven scenario combinations the results are shown in table 5 for the 30 year floods and in figs 5 and 6 for flood return periods up to 100 years however due to the pronounced uncertainty resulting from climate scenarios and downscaling techniques as well as limited durations of the observed discharge time series for estimation of flood levels in the reference period it was decided to constrain the comparison of different scenario results to the 30 year flood level only the simulated changes in the 30 year flood for the tisza river show a small to strong increase ranging from 4 5 to 61 7 for four projections under rcp 4 5 except one decrease by 7 8 under mpi r 45 however the signals of change show larger disagreement for projections under rcp 8 5 two projections indicate a decrease up to 22 three an increase up to 99 6 under ipsl r 85 and one negligible change the simulated changes in the 30 year flood for the prut river are similar three projections show a moderate increase ranging from 11 to 22 under rcp 4 5 and one a decrease by 9 under gfdl r 45 the changes in the prut catchment under rcp 8 5 are also similar to those in the tisza two projections show a decrease up to 22 had x 8 5 three indicate an increase up to 93 and one small changes in both catchments the largest change is driven by ipsl r 8 5 and this agrees well with precipitation changes in table 5 and annex 1 figs a1 and a2 comparing projected changes in the 30 year flood based on the xds and rcm approaches it is clearly visible that simulations based on rcm scenarios show larger mean positive changes for the tisza both rcps and prut rcp 8 5 and generally larger ranges of uncertainty than simulations based on xds in both catchments fig 5 6 the model runs based on the xds downscaling produce much smaller signals of change which are positive for rcp 4 5 and negative for rcp 8 5 for both catchments the difference in spreads could be partly explained by the different numbers of scenarios in two groups this is also in agreement with the model spreads presented in tables 4 and 5 by comparing the same gcms had and gfdl for both catchments 5 discussion mountains belong to the most sensitive regions to climate change and it is very important to study climate change impacts there because mountain ecosystems are sources of major rivers biodiversity and providers of vital resources to population kohler et al 2010 the climate impact assessments with the focus on floods in europe in particular for mountain regions were presented by köplin et al 2014 roudier et al 2016 and meresa et al 2017 using different methods and climate projections the results obtained in the study of roudier et al 2016 for europe could be analysed together with our results for the carpathian region though a direct comparison is hardly possible due to differences in settings and methods anyway some projections in both studies show similar tendencies the procedure for assessment of climate change impacts on hydrological extremes is usually the following gcms are run for different greenhouse gas emission scenarios downscaling techniques are used to downscale gcm outputs to a region a hydrological model is run with different downscaled climate scenarios and statistical tools are used for the extreme value analysis meresa et al 2017 all these steps involve certain ranges of uncertainty in their outputs our study includes five different gcms two emission scenarios and different downscaling techniques dynamical models and statistical empirical approach which were applied for two major carpathian mountain river systems one of the issues affecting overall uncertainty can be related to the limited number of ensemble members in our case we used five gcms in total 11 scenarios five under rcp 4 5 and six under rcp 8 5 to cover the range of temperature changes from 1 to 1 5 to more than 4 for the future period in the paper of dalelane et al 2017 authors investigated approaches for decreasing the number of ensemble members their results show a decrease from 15 to 7 ensemble members which still represent 90 of the original climate change signals temperature and precipitation in the future period compared to 1971 2000 we did not use method that has been mentioned above but we can expect that the number of our ensemble members may be sufficient to include potential climate change signals being an essential source area of freshwater for the danube river and due to its significance for tourism and recreation the study region is very important for ukraine romania and moldova nevertheless the region has been rarely investigated in the context of climate change until now the quality of observational data plays a prominent role for the reliability of climate impact assessment in the area under consideration the number of climate stations is quite limited 12 stations in total one station per 2500 km2 on average and the majority of stations are located in the lowland parts only one station is located at an elevation above 900 m a s l the required interpolation of meteorological data to sub basins in highlands can deteriorate the quality of input climate data for hydrological modelling in addition interpolation over relatively large distances may result in disregarding local extreme precipitation events uncertainty in precipitation due to the lack of meteorological observation data in combination with specific climate conditions in the mountainous regions is a big issue one of recommendations for reducing the uncertainty can be using additional climate data sources for improving calibration also pluntke et al 2014 recommended to use alternative precipitation inputs and the ensemble approach to reduce the uncertainty nevertheless the deviations of more than 2 c in tavr and 15 in precipitation for climate scenarios in the historical period after a bias correction are large in case of rcm scenarios one of possible source of uncertainty can appear from inconsistency between climate elements when doing an independent correction for each variable the relatively short duration of hydrological observations could increase uncertainty of estimation the return flood levels therefore we did not explicitly analyse the 50 and 100 year floods but focused on the 30 year floods only uncertainty can also originate from methods of river discharge measurements in the case of extreme events it is more difficult to estimate the specific peak rate correctly for example in our case data from the tiszabecs and vilok gauges which are located close to each other show inaccuracies as during some high flow events the upstream gauge showed higher discharge values than the downstream one the impacts of water management in the catchments could also have significant effects on river runoff particularly on droughts and to a lesser extent on extreme floods in our study area there are no large reservoirs that could be modelled by swim and the existing small ones are used for agriculture and fishing purposes most of them do not affect flood peaks notably there are also dikes constructed as a part of flood protection measures the abstracted water is distributed mainly among domestic uses and agriculture and partly for industrial enterprises in both catchments under study unfortunately missing information about water management during flooding periods did not allow us to take water management into account in this study the uncertainty analysis related to climate projections showed that the scenarios have smaller biases for mean precipitation in the historical period but the bias is much higher in the case of the 98 and 95 percentiles this confirms that average conditions can be reflected much better by the combined climate and downscaling models than the extreme conditions bronstert et al 2007 as floods in the tisza catchment occur in the fall spring months snow melt may play a prominent role in flooding processes the bias in temperature in future climate projections can lead to uncertainties in the projected flood timing and magnitude especially for the gcm rcm driven scenarios where bias in the historical period is up to 5 c nevertheless the type of the applied downscaling method is quite important as the uncertainty due to such methods can be much higher compared to emission scenarios in our study there are inconsistent trends and different signals of change in projections obtained using rcms and xds as well as among five gcms 6 conclusions in this work we attempted to assess the potential climate change impacts on floods in the carpathian region considering the upper tisza and upper prut river catchments as case studies which can be considered representative for western and eastern hydro meteorological conditions in the high carpathians the climate projections indicate on increase in the mean annual temperature under two rcps in both catchments the projected changes in precipitation show increases in the highland area in the majority of scenarios but for lowland the signal is not clear based on the simulated time series for the future climate conditions the analysis of changes in the magnitude of 30 year floods was done the results show an increase of flood level for the majority of projections under rcp 4 5 ranging from 4 5 to 62 in the tisza and from 11 to 22 in the prut the moderate decreasing trends by 8 9 were detected just in one of five projections for each basin however the projections under rcp 8 5 for both catchments are more uncertain two of six projections indicate a decrease up to 22 three an increase up to 93 99 and one shows negligible changes the largest increases in the 30 year flood level exceeding 92 were simulated under ipsl r 85 in both catchments and exceeding 40 under had r for the tisza both rcps and prut rcp 8 5 more significant changes in flood level were found for two projections driven by ipcl r 85 and had r 85 in both catchments and for one projection driven by had r 45 in the tisza catchment this study demonstrated the influence and sensitivity of different elements of the scenario and model chain on the projection of floods for the future we want to emphasize that it is essential to include and analyse those uncertainties in the model based impact assessment in our case study the choice of a particular gcm and downscaling technique has shown the strongest influence on the outputs due to the gcm related uncertainty it was not possible to produce a clear and consistence picture of the future expected impacts on floods in the region a bit surprising was that rcps had a comparatively smaller influence and were not consistent with the simulated changes which were sometimes higher under rcp 4 5 than under rcp 8 5 the annual mean change in precipitation was rather small within 5 in 64 of all projections 7 from 11 in both catchments and it was ranging from 10 to 26 in four scenarios similar increasing trends for eastern europe were projected with different rcms from the euro cordex eea 2017 regarding simulation of the historical climate conditions the gcm xds model combinations showed much lower bias in simulating temperature and a bit lower in simulating precipitation compared to gcms with the dynamical downscaling models this can be explained by the method of downscaling and correction to data of climate stations regarding the future changes driven by gcms downscaled by dynamical models and xds the impacts often show different patterns see figs 5 and 6 furthermore from our results we can conclude that the empirical statistical downscaling method employed here produced smaller signals of change in flood levels and a smaller uncertainty compared to the dynamical downscaling method this finding partly supports the conclusion of bronstert et al 2007 who found that methods like this which were developed specifically to represent the climatological variance and or anomalies are particularly suitable for impact analysis of hydrological extremes however along with it the statistical methods can give an additional uncertainty in future projections in case of statistical relationship changes the emission and climate scenarios do not show a coherent and consistent picture regarding changes in precipitation in the case study region leading to analogous uncertain results of impact assessment on river discharge and floods in presented research the higher emission scenario rcp 8 5 does not show a stronger trend in simulated river discharge than the moderate scenario rcp 4 5 in our opinion the major reason for the generally large uncertainty of projections in this region is uncertainty stemming from the gcm simulations and low density of climate observations reducing uncertainties due to input data is a particular challenge for the carpathian region and it is essential for more reliable projections of floods in the future so it is important to improve the modelling process by including additional data more reliable climate scenarios and techniques acknowledgements authors would like to thank the global runoff data centre for access to discharge data
