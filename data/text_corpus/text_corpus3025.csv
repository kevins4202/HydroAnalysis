15125,cellular 2 methylisoborneol mib yield of cyanobacteria varies under different conditions according to culture studies and field investigations the causal mechanism remains unclear and results in ineffective mib prediction through an intensive field survey during an mib episode produced by pseudanabaena cinerea in qcs reservoir we demonstrated that mib synthesis mic gene abundance dna and expression rna might be useful as parameters for early warning of mib production it was found that the abundance of mic dna and rna peaked ahead of mib concentrations by 10 and 7 days respectively in addition the rna abundance r2 0 45 p 0 01 showed a slightly higher correlation with mib compared to dna abundance r2 0 37 p 0 01 suggesting that the conditions for the growth of pseudanabaena cinerea might be slightly different from those for mic gene expression which was verified by a culture experiment the highest cell growth was obtained under 36 μmol photons m 2 s 1 while the highest cellular mib yield and mic gene expression level were obtained under 85 μmol photons m 2 s 1 our results clearly supported that light intensity was the virtual regulator governing the mic gene expression within the controlled culture experiment and the actual mib episode in the reservoir besides these results we developed an early warning model using mic gene abundance as an indicator of mib episodes which was verified in two other reservoirs our findings highlight the effect of light intensity on mic gene expression and mib synthesis and provide an early warning tool targeting mib episode

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction taste and odor issues particularly the musty odor caused by 2 methylisoborneol mib have become a major challenge for water quality izaguirre and taylor 2007 lanciotti et al 2003 sun et al 2013 yang et al 2008 if the mib concentration in source water is over 400 ng l 1 for example dosing with powdered activated carbon alone may not be enough to achieve the goal of 10 ng l 1 odor threshold concentration in purified water cook et al 2001 zamyadi et al 2015 although mib was first identified as the volatile secondary metabolite produced by actinomycetes gerber 1979 filamentous cyanobacteria including pseudanabaena planktothrix phormidium oscillatoria lyngbya planktothricoides etc are the major producers of mib in drinking water sources lu et al 2022 persson 1996 su et al 2015 watson et al 2016 2008 mib concentration in actual water is governed by the growth of mib producer s the expression level of mib synthesis gene and hydrological transportation of mib diffusion water temperature nutrients light availability and hydrodynamics have been revealed as the driving factors affecting the growth of mib producers based on field investigation and culture experiments jia et al 2019 kakimoto et al 2014 wang and li 2015 in comparison with scum forming cyanobacteria the growth of which is mainly driven by nutrient availability the driving forces for the growth of mib producers are quite complicated because of their relatively large cellular sizes these filamentous cyanobacteria have a strong capacity to harness light energy halstvedt et al 2007 su et al 2014 which allows them to live in low light conditions su et al 2019 such a feature however makes them susceptible to competition from other cyanobacteria leaving a narrow niche for themselves in natural reservoirs lakes su et al 2019 accordingly mib producers are usually not the dominant cyanobacteria species in a particular water system and their occurrence and mib episodes only last for normally no longer than 2 months izaguirre and taylor 2007 su et al 2021 2015 wu et al 2021 nevertheless cellular mib yields still show great variation during that period even when the water temperature and nutrient conditions are rather stable chiu et al 2016 huang et al 2018 suggesting that the ambient environmental factors not only govern the growth of mib producers but also affect cellular mib productivity furthermore mib is synthesized through the isoprenoid pathway and shares a common precursor geranyl pyrophosphate gpp with photosynthesis pigments chlorophyll a chl a carotenoids and xanthophylls in cyanobacteria zimba et al 1999 suggesting that mib production is a light dependent process in addition to solar irradiance light availability is also governed by the water extinction coefficient and mixing depth therefore we speculate that underwater light availability could possibly be an important driving factor for the growth of mib producers as well as mib biosynthesis in natural water bodies which makes the mib episodes quite unpredictable based on traditional methods chiu et al 2016 huang et al 2018 this has created a difficult situation for waterworks trying to adjust their treatment processes quantification of functional genes has been regarded as a potential method for cyanobacterial metabolite prediction e g the toxin encoding genes have been used to predict microcystin production by as much as 7 days in advance lu et al 2020 the pathway of mib biosynthesis is nearly the same in cyanobacteria giglio et al 2011 wang et al 2011 and actinomycetes komatsu et al 2008 it consists of two main steps from the precursor geranyl diphosphate gpp including 1 a methylation process from gpp to methyl gpp catalyzed by methyltransferase gppmt and 2 a cyclization process from methyl gpp to mib by mib synthase mibs these two processes do not fully match with cyanobacteria taxonomy so cell morphology based cyanobacteria identification is therefore unable to distinguish the mib producers making it difficult to evaluate the mib production in drinking water reservoirs lakes thus the abundance of genes associated with gppmt mibs and their expression have merit as fundamental indicators for mib episodes as verified in field studies chiu et al 2016 kim et al 2020 lu et al 2019 rong et al 2018 wang and li 2015 in view of the fact that the sequences of the two genes vary somewhat among strains we have developed a pair of universal primers mibqsf r targeting the mibs gene mic gene of all known mib producing strains and validated it to be mib specific based upon samples from 9 reservoirs and 17 cultured strains suruzzaman et al 2022 in addition to the presence of the gene in the genome the expression of the mic gene is also essential to the biosynthesis of mib therefore it may be possible to use mic gene abundance and expression to predict the occurrence and strength of mib episodes on the basis of the description from above literatures and our previous studies we proposed the hypothesis that light intensity is a more important regulator of mib synthesis gene expression compared to water temperature and nutrient concentrations for an actual mib episode a systematic field investigation was performed in qingcaosha qcs reservoir including the spatial and temporal distributions of mib mib producers and mic gene abundance expression at the same time the effect of light intensity on the cell growth mib production cellular mib yield and mic gene expression of the mib producing pseudanabaena strain pseudanabaena cinerea fachb 1277 were determined through culture experiments finally valid early warning indicators targeted for mib prediction were proposed and applied to drinking water reservoirs 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area and sampling sites qcs reservoir 32 27 n 121 38 e figs s1 s2 located in the estuary of the yangtze river is the major source

the specific and non specific amplification fig s4 2 4 identification of mib producers we combined multiple methods including high throughput sequencing and pure culture to identify the mib producers in qcs reservoir firstly considering the cyanobacteria and actinomycetes have the potential to produce mib in natural water bodies but they have different gene order in mib operon devi et al 2021 the genetic information of mic genes can be used to identify the mib producers here nanopore sequencing with long reads that can span the mib operon about 5000 bp was used to investigate the genetic environment of mic genes in qcs reservoir and further identify the mib contribution of cyanobacteria or actinomycetes environmental dna was prepared for library construction large dna fragments were recovered using the bluepippin automatic nucleic acid recovery system sage science and then purified using magnetic beads the two ends of purified dna were repaired and connectors were added these constructed libraries were sequenced on the oxford nanopore technology ont platform raw data were preprocessed by trimmomatic v 0 36 to obtain clean data further the clean data were mixed and assembled to scaftigs using megahit v 1 0 6 then the scaftigs shorter than 500 bp were filtered for subsequent analysis the mic gene in the scaftigs was determined by blastn with mic gene sequences obtained from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi genbank the sequencing data were submitted to the ncbi bioproject database with accession number prjna844292 in addition sequencing of the mic genes of environmental dna can provide clues to explore the communities of potential mib producers qiu et al 2021 the primers mibqsf 5 gacagcttctacacctccatga 3 and mibqsr 5 caatctgtagcaccatgttgac 3 with barcode sequences at two ends were used to amplify the mic genes of environmental samples suruzzaman et al 2022 purified amplicons were paired end sequenced on the illumina miseq pe300 platform illumina inc san diego usa paired end reads were merged by the flash program magoc and salzberg 2011 then the sequences were clustered to operational taxonomic units otus by uparse with 97 similarity cutoff edgar 2013 and the singletons and chimeras were removed representative sequences of otus were blasted with mic gene sequences obtained from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi genbank to identify the contributors to mic genes the sequencing raw data were submitted to ncbi bioproject database with accession number prjna838781 finally the potential mib producers were isolated and their mib production abilities were confirmed a single filament was picked up under the microscope and washed with sterile ddh2o several times until the only target filament was obtained the isolated pseudanabaena were cultured under 25 c and light intensity of 30 μmol photons m 2 s 1 in bg11 medium gc ms was used to identify the mib production abilities of these isolated strains taxonomic classification was confirmed by 16s rrna gene sequencing with the primers 27f 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 and 1492r 5 tacggctaccttgttacgactt 3 three strains of pseudanabaena were isolated from mib episode water samples in qcs reservoir 2 5 culture experiment for pseudanabaena pseudanabaena cinerea fachb 1277 obtained from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology was used to investigate the effects of light intensity on the cell growth mib production and mic gene expression level during the culture period of 35 days cells of pseudanabaena in the logarithmic growth phase were centrifuged 1000 rpm 2 min and washed 3 times with bg11 medium to remove the extracellular odorous substances the subsequent culture experiments were performed at a cell density of approximately 2 106 cells l 1 based on the cell concentrations observed in qcs reservoir during the field investigation pseudanabaena were cultured in triplicate at 25 c under a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle in 30 ml bg11 medium under different light intensities of 5 17 36 85 and 250 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively according to the variations of light intensities in qcs reservoir during the mib episode 15 7 51 1 μmol m 2s 1 2 6 statistical analysis non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds was first proposed by kruskal 1964 and have been extensively used to explore the temporal and spatial transitions of phytoplankton communities with in primer v7 clarke and gorley 2015 and the differences between the communities were tested using the permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova anderson 2017 with 9999 permutations by the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix performed by the vegan package dixon 2003 based on r language r core team 2020 the advance days of the mic gene based early warning method were determined by conducting time shifted pairwise pearson s correlation analysis the correlations between mib concentration and mic gene dna and rna abundance were screened with different lag days δd from 0 to 14 the lag day with the highest correlation was further determined as the advance time for early warning of the mib episode the underwater light intensity in qcs reservoir is determined by solar irradiance and mixing characters of reservoir water and can be calculated by eq 1 as follows 1 i c i u 1 e k z m i x k z m i x where i u is the sub surface solar irradiance k is the light extinction coefficient and z m i x is the mixing depth considering the well mixed characteristics of the water body in qcs reservoir z m i x is equivalent to the water depth z m a x regarding the culture experiment the cell growth rate at the logarithmic phase μ d 1 was calculated based on the cell density increase n t 2 n t 1 over time t 2 t 1 d eq 2 which was determined by the slope of log linear model between n t and t 2 μ ln n t 2 ln n t 1 t 2 t 1 the instantaneous cellular mib yield y t c t n t was determined according to the instant total mib concentration c t including cell bound mib and dissolved mib and cell density n t the mean cellular mib yield y was determined according to the mean of all instantaneous cellular mib yields within the late logarithmic phase and stationary phase for each experiment set linear regression one way analysis of variance anova and pearson s correlations were performed by the vegan package oksanen et al 2014 the figures were visualized using the ggplot2 package wickham 2009 and arcgis v 10 7 3 results 3 1 limnological characteristics seasonal mib episodes lasting for one to two months have been typically observed in the period from apr and jun in qcs reservoir since 2016 according to the historical record data not shown in 2021 the mib episode started in the end of april and ended in late may 25 the solar irradiance varied between 210 6 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and 761 8 μmol photons m 2 s 1 fig s5 meanwhile the underwater light intensity varied between 15 7 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and 51 1 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the air temperature was 21 6 c and showed 4 4 c variance table 1 in comparison the water temperature showed a much smaller variance of 1 8 c with mean value of 20 2 c during the episode in 2021 fig s5 and no significant spatial difference between upstream river water urw and reservoir water was observed p 0 631 the water level was 2 48 0 25 m and hydraulic retention time was 16 7 4 9 d the dissolved oxygen do ph and secchi depth sd in urw were significantly lower than those in reservoir water p 0 01 while the turbidity total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and nitrate no3 n in urw were significantly higher p 0 01 no significant spatial difference was observed for ammonia nh4 n p 0 096 in 2021 a rapid increase in mib occurred at the end of apr and peaked in the middle of may with the highest concentration 99 0 ng l 1 detected at qc10 on may 10 and subsequently it decreased to below the odor threshold 10 0 ng l 1 on may 25 fig 1 no serious mib problem was observed in upstream river water urw and the south branch sb of the reservoir mib concentrations at the middle section ms and the north branch nb were significantly higher than those of urw p 0 01 and sb p 0 01 3 2 dynamics of phytoplankton community structure a total of 21 cyanobacterial genera and 55 genera affiliated with 6 other phyla were recorded during the investigation according to microscopic cell counting results the phytoplankton communities showed significant temporal permanova r2 0 14 f 2 988 p 0 001 and spatial permanova r2 0 13 f 1 846 p 0 015 differences fig s6 cyanophyta and bacillariophyta were the two dominant phyla over the investigation period from apr to jun the abundance of cyanophyta peaked on may 10 4 4 106 cells l 1 but decreased quickly to 1 0 106 cells l 1 on may 17 leaving bacillariophyta 3 0 1 0 106 cells l 1 and chlorophyta 9 4 8 0 105 cells l 1 as the dominant phyla fig 2 b the cell density of pseudanabaena a well known potential mib producer increased from apr 19 4 6 105 cells l 1 to may 12 4 8 106 cells l 1 then decreased to 1 3 105 cells l 1 on may 21 fig 2a exhibiting a similar temporal pattern as the mib concentration r2 0 28 p 0 01 fig s7 the mic gene was detected in 133 water samples collected from qcs reservoir during the mib episode the genes order in the mib operon was determined as illustrated in fig 2c the mic gene was located between the mtf gene and cnb b gene suggesting that mib was produced by the cyanobacteria devi et al 2021 the mic gene sequences were subsequently determined to explore the potential mib producers together with microscopic results pseudanabaena was identified as the dominant mib contributor accounting for 82 7 of the mib producing cyanobacterial community by the annotation of mic gene sequences fig 2c oscillatoria at the same time contributed 5 1 furthermore 3 pseudanabaena strains were isolated from the qcs water samples with pseudanabaena cinerea being determined as the main mib producer in qcs reservoir according to the mib production potential test table s2 3 3 correlation between mib concentration and mic gene abundance the spatial and temporal patterns of mic gene abundances dna and rna are shown in fig 3 a which agreed well with the mib distribution the mic gene abundances dna or rna of nb and ms were significantly higher than urw p 0 01 and sb p 0 01 in general dna reached the peak values earlier than rna daily samples at nb qc10 were further analyzed to reveal the temporal dynamics of the total mib concentrations and mic gene abundances dna and rna the highest mib concentration 99 ng l 1 fig 3c was detected on may 10 while the highest dna 3 67 107 copies l 1 apr 30 and rna 2 03 107 copies l 1 may 3 abundances of the mic gene occurred earlier than the peak mib concentration fig 3b time shifted pairwise pearson s correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the lag time between mic gene abundance and mib concentration the highest correlations with mib concentration were obtained at 10 lag days for dna and 7 lag days for rna respectively fig 4 a furthermore rna abundance of mic gene r2 0 45 p 0 01 fig 4c showed a little higher correlation with mib concentration than the dna abundance r2 0 37 p 0 01 fig 4b the mean mic gene quota mib production per mic gene copy was 33 and 181 fg mic gene copy for dna and rna respectively the earlier peak of mic gene abundance compared to mib concentration was also observed in jz reservoir and lh reservoir in jz reservoir the highest dna abundance 5 02 105 copies l 1 and mib concentration 147 ng l 1 were detected on aug 5 and aug 20 respectively similar result has been found in lh reservoir the highest dna abundance 7 32 106 copies l 1 and mib concentration 72 ng l 1 were detected on may 23 and jun 14 respectively 3 4 driving factors for mic gene expression driving factors responsible for mic gene expression were explored to reveal the differences in the temporal variations between the dna and rna abundances of mic gene during the mib episode water temperature and nutrients were excluded as the major driving factors since no correlation was obtained with mic gene abundances fig s9 only the light intensity was positively correlated with the rna abundance of mic gene r2 0 44 p 0 01 fig 5 b though no correlation was observed with dna abundance r2 0 02 p 0 64 fig 5a further a culture experiment using pseudanabaena cinerea fachb 1277 the major contributor to mib in qcs reservoir was performed to investigate the effects of light intensity on cell growth mib production and mic gene expression level fig 6 the highest cell growth rate 0 26 0 03 d 1 was obtained under moderate light intensity 36 μmol photons m 2 s 1 meanwhile the maximum cell density 1 3 0 3 1010 cells l 1 and mib concentration 897 75 μg l 1 were also observed at 36 μmol photons m 2 s 1 different from the optimum light intensity for cell growth the maximum cellular mib yield 0 15 0 04 pg cell 1 was achieved at 85 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the expression level of mic gene normalized by cell density was roughly stable along the culture period under a certain light intensity but responded to diverse light intensities the mic gene expression level increased by 50 under 85 μmol photons m 2 s 1 compared to 36 μmol photons m 2 s 1 but higher light intensity 250 μmol photons m 2 s 1 could inhibit the mic gene expression fig 6e 4 discussion 4 1 mib episodes in qcs reservoir widespread musty odor events caused by mib have been increasingly reported in recent decades raising considerable public attention devi et al 2021 lee et al 2017 cyanobacteria lee et al 2017 and actinomycetes zaitlin and watson 2006 zuo et al 2010 have been widely accepted as the main mib producers although the dominant source for a specific water body is sometimes controversial previous studies have revealed that the cyclic nucleotide binding protein genes cnb a and cnb b methyl transferase gene mtf and mib cyclase gene mic are associated with mib biosynthesis giglio et al 2011 komatsu et al 2008 the order of these genes within cyanobacteria cnba mtf mic cnbb is different from that in most of the actinomycetes cnb mic mtf because of the occurrence of recombinant events during evolution devi et al 2021 in qcs reservoir the genes order in the mib operon cnba followed by mtf mic and cnbb indicates that cyanobacteria are the major contributor to the mib episode all of the microscopic high throughput sequencing and pure culture results revealed that pseudanabaena cinerea was the dominant mib producer in 2021 though oscillatoria might have also contributed slightly to the mib episode previous studies in general only focused on one mib producer for a specific mib episode huang et al 2018 su et al 2021 this study shows that the ecological niche in qcs reservoir could support two mib producing genera the dominant mib producing species may be different in different years since the environmental conditions may change at the same time it should be noted that there were also two other pseudanabaena species p limnetica and p catenate which could not produce mib which is easy to understand since the same genera usually favor similar niches this study clearly shows that microscopic identification alone fig s8 is therefore not sufficient to identify the mib producers considering the co occurrence of mib producing pseudanabaena and non mib producing pseudanabaena and the cell lysis when mib release 4 2 early warning of mib episode based on mic gene abundance and expression quantification of mib synthesis genes has been regarded as a sensitive and rapid method for the evaluation of the mib production potential in drinking water sources chiu et al 2016 kim et al 2020 lu et al 2019 rong et al 2018 wang and li 2015 which can be completed within one day from samples collection to result analysis and the cost is lower than gc ms analysis this study clearly demonstrates for the first time that the detection of the mic gene could be used as an effective early warning approach for an mib episode since the peaks of the dna and rna abundances arrived 10 and 7 days earlier than that of mib concentration the mic gene has been reported as single copy in the genome of pseudanabaena planktothricoides and the majority of actinomycetes giglio et al 2011 komatsu et al 2008 wang et al 2011 indicating a consistent correlation between mic gene abundance and p cinerea cell density moreover early total pseudanabaena abundance increases were observed before may 10 according to microscopic cell counting suggesting p cinerea probably the dominant pseudanabaena species in the early stage since intracellular mib is mainly released into water during the stationary death phase alghanmi et al 2018 we speculate that the massive breakdown of p cinerea cells before may 10 resulted in the instant mib increases in qcs reservoir in addition the transportation and diffusion processes of mib were also important reasons for the 7 10 days delay of mib episodes in comparison with the dynamics of mic gene abundance previous studies showed that short hydraulic retention time hrt could inhibit cyanobacterial growth via disrupt and dilute processes and hrt was positively correlated with cyanobacterial abundance lee et al 2012 rangel et al 2012 further study is still required to obtain the relationship between hydrodynamics and the time lag this real time pcr based approach is particularly important considering the fact that only one among the three pseudanabaena strains isolated from the episode samples exhibited the potential to produce mib if the waterworks could predict the occurrence of the peak mib concentrations 7 or 10 days earlier they could have sufficient time to take measures to cope with the episode they can change the source water regulating the flow rate preparing pac for mib removal or reduce the problematic source water to ensure sufficient adsorption time since the adsorption of mib mainly occurs in the micropores of pac requiring long adsorption time yu et al 2007 since the mic gene is essential for mib production regardless of taxonomy this method can be applied to all mib episodes though the rna based gene abundance r2 0 44 is slightly more accurate than the dna based one r2 0 37 dna detection may be a more practical approach since the detection of dna is easier and the advance time 10 days is longer this advance time was in accordance with a previous study on microcystin production 7 days lu et al 2020 the mic gene based early warning function was also validated by application in 2 drinking water reservoirs jz reservoir and lh reservoir fig s12 both applications exhibited an earlier peak of mic gene abundance compared to the mib concentration though the advance days cannot be accurately confirmed due to the low sampling frequency this further supports the validation of this technology for early warning purpose although the number of advance days should be adjusted before application due to physiological differences between mib producers and differences in the hydrodynamics of reservoirs lakes 4 3 driving factors for mib production mib production in actual water is governed by the growth of mib producer s the expression level of mib synthesis gene and hydrological transportation of mib diffusion as a result the correlation between observed mib concentration and abundance of mib producer s is not strong e g in this study the correlation coefficient between pseudanabaena cell density and mib concentration is 0 28 and the mib concentration can only be modeled using quantile regression in miyun reservoir su et al 2015 it suggests that the gene expression should be emphasized noted that rna abundance of mic gene is a better indicator of mib dynamics compared to dna abundance with 8 variance differences indicating that the mic gene expression is governed by other factors during the mib episode water temperature nutrients and light availability have been considered to be key factors affecting the growth and mib production of cyanobacteria for pseudanabaena higher temperature could promote cell growth 25 35 c mib production izaguirre and taylor 2007 wang and li 2015 zhang et al 2016 and mic gene expression 30 c kakimoto et al 2014 however no significant correlation between water temperature and mic gene abundances dna or rna was observed in qcs reservoir probably owing to the small temperature variations 17 2 c to 26 0 c during the mib episode the uncorrelated relationship between nutrients concentration and mic gene abundances dna and rna in qcs reservoir further supports that nutrients are probably not the key factor governing mic gene expression nutrients are generally not the limiting factor for mib producers as they prefer to stay in the subsurface bottom layers of the water column where nutrients from sediments can satisfy their demand su et al 2021 2019 which is why prevalent mib episodes usually occur in mesotrophic oligotrophic reservoirs lakes su et al 2019 cyanobacteria capture light photons by using photosynthetic pigments including chlorophyll a and phycobillins through photosynthesis wiltbank and kehoe 2019 mib biosynthesis shares a common precursor with chlorophyll a zimba et al 1999 therefore the ambient light condition probably is an essential regulator that governs the cell growth indicator of chlorophyll a biosynthesis and mib production for cyanobacteria as also observed in other culture experiments jia et al 2019 li et al 2012 su et al 2023 wang and li 2015 our culture result indicates that pseudanabaena cannot grow under light intensity as low as 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 consistent with zhang et al 2016 optimized growth was obtained under 36 μmol photons m 2 s 1 but maximum cellular mib production was obtained under 85 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this result is also consistent with zhang et al 2016 showing that the optimum light intensities for cell growth and mib production were 25 and 40 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively the mic gene expression was promoted along with the increase in light intensity from 17 to 85 μmol photons m 2 s 1 resulting in incremental cellular mib yield nevertheless the level of mic gene expression in response to light is strain specific according to comparison with another independent study wang et al 2011 which revealed that the mic gene expression of pseudanabaena sp dqh15 was inhibited under 60 μmol m 2 s 1 compared to 30 μmol m 2 s 1 meanwhile the mean underwater light intensity varied between 15 7 and 51 1 μmol photons m 2 s 1 during the mib episode in qcs reservoir fig s10 it is interesting that the light intensity was positively correlated with the mic gene abundance of rna r2 0 44 p 0 01 but not with dna r2 0 02 p 0 64 it is possible that the light fluctuation during the mib episode was not big enough to affect the cell growth of pseudanabaena however the result clearly shows that the mic gene expression was more sensitive to underwater light intensity than was cell growth which was in accordance with the pure culture experiment in qcs reservoir the relatively higher light intensity 46 3 5 1 μmol photons m 2 s 1 during the period apr 29 to may 3 may have caused the observed increase in mib concentration 7 days later from may 6 to may 10 fig s10 this light response feature of pseudanabaena means that the production of mib may be greatly reduced even for abundant mib producers if the light availability is not favorable for the expression of the mic gene therefore although the detection of dna is used for early warning of the mib episode the detection of rna is also desirable for a more accurate prediction and the light intensity should be also an important predictor 5 conclusion according to investigation of an mib episode in qcs reservoir and a culture experiment for pseudanabaena cinerea the following conclusions can be drawn 1 p cinerea was identified as the major mib producer in qcs reservoir during the investigation in 2021 2 mic gene expression level is light dependent in particular relatively higher light intensity results in increasing cellular mib yield when underwater light intensity is proper for their growth 3 the mic dna abundance and expression can be used for early warning puropse with 7 10 days forecasts offering a valuable time gap for control measures and emergency operation declaration of competing interest the

15125,cellular 2 methylisoborneol mib yield of cyanobacteria varies under different conditions according to culture studies and field investigations the causal mechanism remains unclear and results in ineffective mib prediction through an intensive field survey during an mib episode produced by pseudanabaena cinerea in qcs reservoir we demonstrated that mib synthesis mic gene abundance dna and expression rna might be useful as parameters for early warning of mib production it was found that the abundance of mic dna and rna peaked ahead of mib concentrations by 10 and 7 days respectively in addition the rna abundance r2 0 45 p 0 01 showed a slightly higher correlation with mib compared to dna abundance r2 0 37 p 0 01 suggesting that the conditions for the growth of pseudanabaena cinerea might be slightly different from those for mic gene expression which was verified by a culture experiment the highest cell growth was obtained under 36 μmol photons m 2 s 1 while the highest cellular mib yield and mic gene expression level were obtained under 85 μmol photons m 2 s 1 our results clearly supported that light intensity was the virtual regulator governing the mic gene expression within the controlled culture experiment and the actual mib episode in the reservoir besides these results we developed an early warning model using mic gene abundance as an indicator of mib episodes which was verified in two other reservoirs our findings highlight the effect of light intensity on mic gene expression and mib synthesis and provide an early warning tool targeting mib episode prediction which therefore should be of importance for source water authorities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 2 methylisoborneol mib mib synthesis gene pseudanabaena prediction

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction taste and odor issues particularly the musty odor caused by 2 methylisoborneol mib have become a major challenge for water quality izaguirre and taylor 2007 lanciotti et al 2003 sun et al 2013 yang et al 2008 if the mib concentration in source water is over 400 ng l 1 for example dosing with powdered activated carbon alone may not be enough to achieve the goal of 10 ng l 1 odor threshold concentration in purified water cook et al 2001 zamyadi et al 2015 although mib was first identified as the volatile secondary metabolite produced by actinomycetes gerber 1979 filamentous cyanobacteria including pseudanabaena planktothrix phormidium oscillatoria lyngbya planktothricoides etc are the major producers of mib in drinking water sources lu et al 2022 persson 1996 su et al 2015 watson et al 2016 2008 mib concentration in actual water is governed by the growth of mib producer s the expression level of mib synthesis gene and hydrological transportation of mib diffusion water temperature nutrients light availability and hydrodynamics have been revealed as the driving factors affecting the growth of mib producers based on field investigation and culture experiments jia et al 2019 kakimoto et al 2014 wang and li 2015 in comparison with scum forming cyanobacteria the growth of which is mainly driven by nutrient availability the driving forces for the growth of mib producers are quite complicated because of their relatively large cellular sizes these filamentous cyanobacteria have a strong capacity to harness light energy halstvedt et al 2007 su et al 2014 which allows them to live in low light conditions su et al 2019 such a feature however makes them susceptible to competition from other cyanobacteria leaving a narrow niche for themselves in natural reservoirs lakes su et al 2019 accordingly mib producers are usually not the dominant cyanobacteria species in a particular water system and their occurrence and mib episodes only last for normally no longer than 2 months izaguirre and taylor 2007 su et al 2021 2015 wu et al 2021 nevertheless cellular mib yields still show great variation during that period even when the water temperature and nutrient conditions are rather stable chiu et al 2016 huang et al 2018 suggesting that the ambient environmental factors not only govern the growth of mib producers but also affect cellular mib productivity furthermore mib is synthesized through the isoprenoid pathway and shares a common precursor geranyl pyrophosphate gpp with photosynthesis pigments chlorophyll a chl a carotenoids and xanthophylls in cyanobacteria zimba et al 1999 suggesting that mib production is a light dependent process in addition to solar irradiance light availability is also governed by the water extinction coefficient and mixing depth therefore we speculate that underwater light availability could possibly be an important driving factor for the growth of mib producers as well as mib biosynthesis in natural water bodies which makes the mib episodes quite unpredictable based on traditional methods chiu et al 2016 huang et al 2018 this has created a difficult situation for waterworks trying to adjust their treatment processes quantification of functional genes has been regarded as a potential method for cyanobacterial metabolite prediction e g the toxin encoding genes have been used to predict microcystin production by as much as 7 days in advance lu et al 2020 the pathway of mib biosynthesis is nearly the same in cyanobacteria giglio et al 2011 wang et al 2011 and actinomycetes komatsu et al 2008 it consists of two main steps from the precursor geranyl diphosphate gpp including 1 a methylation process from gpp to methyl gpp catalyzed by methyltransferase gppmt and 2 a cyclization process from methyl gpp to mib by mib synthase mibs these two processes do not fully match with cyanobacteria taxonomy so cell morphology based cyanobacteria identification is therefore unable to distinguish the mib producers making it difficult to evaluate the mib production in drinking water reservoirs lakes thus the abundance of genes associated with gppmt mibs and their expression have merit as fundamental indicators for mib episodes as verified in field studies chiu et al 2016 kim et al 2020 lu et al 2019 rong et al 2018 wang and li 2015 in view of the fact that the sequences of the two genes vary somewhat among strains we have developed a pair of universal primers mibqsf r targeting the mibs gene mic gene of all known mib producing strains and validated it to be mib specific based upon samples from 9 reservoirs and 17 cultured strains suruzzaman et al 2022 in addition to the presence of the gene in the genome the expression of the mic gene is also essential to the biosynthesis of mib therefore it may be possible to use mic gene abundance and expression to predict the occurrence and strength of mib episodes on the basis of the description from above literatures and our previous studies we proposed the hypothesis that light intensity is a more important regulator of mib synthesis gene expression compared to water temperature and nutrient concentrations for an actual mib episode a systematic field investigation was performed in qingcaosha qcs reservoir including the spatial and temporal distributions of mib mib producers and mic gene abundance expression at the same time the effect of light intensity on the cell growth mib production cellular mib yield and mic gene expression of the mib producing pseudanabaena strain pseudanabaena cinerea fachb 1277 were determined through culture experiments finally valid early warning indicators targeted for mib prediction were proposed and applied to drinking water reservoirs 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area and sampling sites qcs reservoir 32 27 n 121 38 e figs s1 s2 located in the estuary of the yangtze river is the major source

the specific and non specific amplification fig s4 2 4 identification of mib producers we combined multiple methods including high throughput sequencing and pure culture to identify the mib producers in qcs reservoir firstly considering the cyanobacteria and actinomycetes have the potential to produce mib in natural water bodies but they have different gene order in mib operon devi et al 2021 the genetic information of mic genes can be used to identify the mib producers here nanopore sequencing with long reads that can span the mib operon about 5000 bp was used to investigate the genetic environment of mic genes in qcs reservoir and further identify the mib contribution of cyanobacteria or actinomycetes environmental dna was prepared for library construction large dna fragments were recovered using the bluepippin automatic nucleic acid recovery system sage science and then purified using magnetic beads the two ends of purified dna were repaired and connectors were added these constructed libraries were sequenced on the oxford nanopore technology ont platform raw data were preprocessed by trimmomatic v 0 36 to obtain clean data further the clean data were mixed and assembled to scaftigs using megahit v 1 0 6 then the scaftigs shorter than 500 bp were filtered for subsequent analysis the mic gene in the scaftigs was determined by blastn with mic gene sequences obtained from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi genbank the sequencing data were submitted to the ncbi bioproject database with accession number prjna844292 in addition sequencing of the mic genes of environmental dna can provide clues to explore the communities of potential mib producers qiu et al 2021 the primers mibqsf 5 gacagcttctacacctccatga 3 and mibqsr 5 caatctgtagcaccatgttgac 3 with barcode sequences at two ends were used to amplify the mic genes of environmental samples suruzzaman et al 2022 purified amplicons were paired end sequenced on the illumina miseq pe300 platform illumina inc san diego usa paired end reads were merged by the flash program magoc and salzberg 2011 then the sequences were clustered to operational taxonomic units otus by uparse with 97 similarity cutoff edgar 2013 and the singletons and chimeras were removed representative sequences of otus were blasted with mic gene sequences obtained from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi genbank to identify the contributors to mic genes the sequencing raw data were submitted to ncbi bioproject database with accession number prjna838781 finally the potential mib producers were isolated and their mib production abilities were confirmed a single filament was picked up under the microscope and washed with sterile ddh2o several times until the only target filament was obtained the isolated pseudanabaena were cultured under 25 c and light intensity of 30 μmol photons m 2 s 1 in bg11 medium gc ms was used to identify the mib production abilities of these isolated strains taxonomic classification was confirmed by 16s rrna gene sequencing with the primers 27f 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 and 1492r 5 tacggctaccttgttacgactt 3 three strains of pseudanabaena were isolated from mib episode water samples in qcs reservoir 2 5 culture experiment for pseudanabaena pseudanabaena cinerea fachb 1277 obtained from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology was used to investigate the effects of light intensity on the cell growth mib production and mic gene expression level during the culture period of 35 days cells of pseudanabaena in the logarithmic growth phase were centrifuged 1000 rpm 2 min and washed 3 times with bg11 medium to remove the extracellular odorous substances the subsequent culture experiments were performed at a cell density of approximately 2 106 cells l 1 based on the cell concentrations observed in qcs reservoir during the field investigation pseudanabaena were cultured in triplicate at 25 c under a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle in 30 ml bg11 medium under different light intensities of 5 17 36 85 and 250 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively according to the variations of light intensities in qcs reservoir during the mib episode 15 7 51 1 μmol m 2s 1 2 6 statistical analysis non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds was first proposed by kruskal 1964 and have been extensively used to explore the temporal and spatial transitions of phytoplankton communities with in primer v7 clarke and gorley 2015 and the differences between the communities were tested using the permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova anderson 2017 with 9999 permutations by the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix performed by the vegan package dixon 2003 based on r language r core team 2020 the advance days of the mic gene based early warning method were determined by conducting time shifted pairwise pearson s correlation analysis the correlations between mib concentration and mic gene dna and rna abundance were screened with different lag days δd from 0 to 14 the lag day with the highest correlation was further determined as the advance time for early warning of the mib episode the underwater light intensity in qcs reservoir is determined by solar irradiance and mixing characters of reservoir water and can be calculated by eq 1 as follows 1 i c i u 1 e k z m i x k z m i x where i u is the sub surface solar irradiance k is the light extinction coefficient and z m i x is the mixing depth considering the well mixed characteristics of the water body in qcs reservoir z m i x is equivalent to the water depth z m a x regarding the culture experiment the cell growth rate at the logarithmic phase μ d 1 was calculated based on the cell density increase n t 2 n t 1 over time t 2 t 1 d eq 2 which was determined by the slope of log linear model between n t and t 2 μ ln n t 2 ln n t 1 t 2 t 1 the instantaneous cellular mib yield y t c t n t was determined according to the instant total mib concentration c t including cell bound mib and dissolved mib and cell density n t the mean cellular mib yield y was determined according to the mean of all instantaneous cellular mib yields within the late logarithmic phase and stationary phase for each experiment set linear regression one way analysis of variance anova and pearson s correlations were performed by the vegan package oksanen et al 2014 the figures were visualized using the ggplot2 package wickham 2009 and arcgis v 10 7 3 results 3 1 limnological characteristics seasonal mib episodes lasting for one to two months have been typically observed in the period from apr and jun in qcs reservoir since 2016 according to the historical record data not shown in 2021 the mib episode started in the end of april and ended in late may 25 the solar irradiance varied between 210 6 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and 761 8 μmol photons m 2 s 1 fig s5 meanwhile the underwater light intensity varied between 15 7 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and 51 1 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the air temperature was 21 6 c and showed 4 4 c variance table 1 in comparison the water temperature showed a much smaller variance of 1 8 c with mean value of 20 2 c during the episode in 2021 fig s5 and no significant spatial difference between upstream river water urw and reservoir water was observed p 0 631 the water level was 2 48 0 25 m and hydraulic retention time was 16 7 4 9 d the dissolved oxygen do ph and secchi depth sd in urw were significantly lower than those in reservoir water p 0 01 while the turbidity total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and nitrate no3 n in urw were significantly higher p 0 01 no significant spatial difference was observed for ammonia nh4 n p 0 096 in 2021 a rapid increase in mib occurred at the end of apr and peaked in the middle of may with the highest concentration 99 0 ng l 1 detected at qc10 on may 10 and subsequently it decreased to below the odor threshold 10 0 ng l 1 on may 25 fig 1 no serious mib problem was observed in upstream river water urw and the south branch sb of the reservoir mib concentrations at the middle section ms and the north branch nb were significantly higher than those of urw p 0 01 and sb p 0 01 3 2 dynamics of phytoplankton community structure a total of 21 cyanobacterial genera and 55 genera affiliated with 6 other phyla were recorded during the investigation according to microscopic cell counting results the phytoplankton communities showed significant temporal permanova r2 0 14 f 2 988 p 0 001 and spatial permanova r2 0 13 f 1 846 p 0 015 differences fig s6 cyanophyta and bacillariophyta were the two dominant phyla over the investigation period from apr to jun the abundance of cyanophyta peaked on may 10 4 4 106 cells l 1 but decreased quickly to 1 0 106 cells l 1 on may 17 leaving bacillariophyta 3 0 1 0 106 cells l 1 and chlorophyta 9 4 8 0 105 cells l 1 as the dominant phyla fig 2 b the cell density of pseudanabaena a well known potential mib producer increased from apr 19 4 6 105 cells l 1 to may 12 4 8 106 cells l 1 then decreased to 1 3 105 cells l 1 on may 21 fig 2a exhibiting a similar temporal pattern as the mib concentration r2 0 28 p 0 01 fig s7 the mic gene was detected in 133 water samples collected from qcs reservoir during the mib episode the genes order in the mib operon was determined as illustrated in fig 2c the mic gene was located between the mtf gene and cnb b gene suggesting that mib was produced by the cyanobacteria devi et al 2021 the mic gene sequences were subsequently determined to explore the potential mib producers together with microscopic results pseudanabaena was identified as the dominant mib contributor accounting for 82 7 of the mib producing cyanobacterial community by the annotation of mic gene sequences fig 2c oscillatoria at the same time contributed 5 1 furthermore 3 pseudanabaena strains were isolated from the qcs water samples with pseudanabaena cinerea being determined as the main mib producer in qcs reservoir according to the mib production potential test table s2 3 3 correlation between mib concentration and mic gene abundance the spatial and temporal patterns of mic gene abundances dna and rna are shown in fig 3 a which agreed well with the mib distribution the mic gene abundances dna or rna of nb and ms were significantly higher than urw p 0 01 and sb p 0 01 in general dna reached the peak values earlier than rna daily samples at nb qc10 were further analyzed to reveal the temporal dynamics of the total mib concentrations and mic gene abundances dna and rna the highest mib concentration 99 ng l 1 fig 3c was detected on may 10 while the highest dna 3 67 107 copies l 1 apr 30 and rna 2 03 107 copies l 1 may 3 abundances of the mic gene occurred earlier than the peak mib concentration fig 3b time shifted pairwise pearson s correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the lag time between mic gene abundance and mib concentration the highest correlations with mib concentration were obtained at 10 lag days for dna and 7 lag days for rna respectively fig 4 a furthermore rna abundance of mic gene r2 0 45 p 0 01 fig 4c showed a little higher correlation with mib concentration than the dna abundance r2 0 37 p 0 01 fig 4b the mean mic gene quota mib production per mic gene copy was 33 and 181 fg mic gene copy for dna and rna respectively the earlier peak of mic gene abundance compared to mib concentration was also observed in jz reservoir and lh reservoir in jz reservoir the highest dna abundance 5 02 105 copies l 1 and mib concentration 147 ng l 1 were detected on aug 5 and aug 20 respectively similar result has been found in lh reservoir the highest dna abundance 7 32 106 copies l 1 and mib concentration 72 ng l 1 were detected on may 23 and jun 14 respectively 3 4 driving factors for mic gene expression driving factors responsible for mic gene expression were explored to reveal the differences in the temporal variations between the dna and rna abundances of mic gene during the mib episode water temperature and nutrients were excluded as the major driving factors since no correlation was obtained with mic gene abundances fig s9 only the light intensity was positively correlated with the rna abundance of mic gene r2 0 44 p 0 01 fig 5 b though no correlation was observed with dna abundance r2 0 02 p 0 64 fig 5a further a culture experiment using pseudanabaena cinerea fachb 1277 the major contributor to mib in qcs reservoir was performed to investigate the effects of light intensity on cell growth mib production and mic gene expression level fig 6 the highest cell growth rate 0 26 0 03 d 1 was obtained under moderate light intensity 36 μmol photons m 2 s 1 meanwhile the maximum cell density 1 3 0 3 1010 cells l 1 and mib concentration 897 75 μg l 1 were also observed at 36 μmol photons m 2 s 1 different from the optimum light intensity for cell growth the maximum cellular mib yield 0 15 0 04 pg cell 1 was achieved at 85 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the expression level of mic gene normalized by cell density was roughly stable along the culture period under a certain light intensity but responded to diverse light intensities the mic gene expression level increased by 50 under 85 μmol photons m 2 s 1 compared to 36 μmol photons m 2 s 1 but higher light intensity 250 μmol photons m 2 s 1 could inhibit the mic gene expression fig 6e 4 discussion 4 1 mib episodes in qcs reservoir widespread musty odor events caused by mib have been increasingly reported in recent decades raising considerable public attention devi et al 2021 lee et al 2017 cyanobacteria lee et al 2017 and actinomycetes zaitlin and watson 2006 zuo et al 2010 have been widely accepted as the main mib producers although the dominant source for a specific water body is sometimes controversial previous studies have revealed that the cyclic nucleotide binding protein genes cnb a and cnb b methyl transferase gene mtf and mib cyclase gene mic are associated with mib biosynthesis giglio et al 2011 komatsu et al 2008 the order of these genes within cyanobacteria cnba mtf mic cnbb is different from that in most of the actinomycetes cnb mic mtf because of the occurrence of recombinant events during evolution devi et al 2021 in qcs reservoir the genes order in the mib operon cnba followed by mtf mic and cnbb indicates that cyanobacteria are the major contributor to the mib episode all of the microscopic high throughput sequencing and pure culture results revealed that pseudanabaena cinerea was the dominant mib producer in 2021 though oscillatoria might have also contributed slightly to the mib episode previous studies in general only focused on one mib producer for a specific mib episode huang et al 2018 su et al 2021 this study shows that the ecological niche in qcs reservoir could support two mib producing genera the dominant mib producing species may be different in different years since the environmental conditions may change at the same time it should be noted that there were also two other pseudanabaena species p limnetica and p catenate which could not produce mib which is easy to understand since the same genera usually favor similar niches this study clearly shows that microscopic identification alone fig s8 is therefore not sufficient to identify the mib producers considering the co occurrence of mib producing pseudanabaena and non mib producing pseudanabaena and the cell lysis when mib release 4 2 early warning of mib episode based on mic gene abundance and expression quantification of mib synthesis genes has been regarded as a sensitive and rapid method for the evaluation of the mib production potential in drinking water sources chiu et al 2016 kim et al 2020 lu et al 2019 rong et al 2018 wang and li 2015 which can be completed within one day from samples collection to result analysis and the cost is lower than gc ms analysis this study clearly demonstrates for the first time that the detection of the mic gene could be used as an effective early warning approach for an mib episode since the peaks of the dna and rna abundances arrived 10 and 7 days earlier than that of mib concentration the mic gene has been reported as single copy in the genome of pseudanabaena planktothricoides and the majority of actinomycetes giglio et al 2011 komatsu et al 2008 wang et al 2011 indicating a consistent correlation between mic gene abundance and p cinerea cell density moreover early total pseudanabaena abundance increases were observed before may 10 according to microscopic cell counting suggesting p cinerea probably the dominant pseudanabaena species in the early stage since intracellular mib is mainly released into water during the stationary death phase alghanmi et al 2018 we speculate that the massive breakdown of p cinerea cells before may 10 resulted in the instant mib increases in qcs reservoir in addition the transportation and diffusion processes of mib were also important reasons for the 7 10 days delay of mib episodes in comparison with the dynamics of mic gene abundance previous studies showed that short hydraulic retention time hrt could inhibit cyanobacterial growth via disrupt and dilute processes and hrt was positively correlated with cyanobacterial abundance lee et al 2012 rangel et al 2012 further study is still required to obtain the relationship between hydrodynamics and the time lag this real time pcr based approach is particularly important considering the fact that only one among the three pseudanabaena strains isolated from the episode samples exhibited the potential to produce mib if the waterworks could predict the occurrence of the peak mib concentrations 7 or 10 days earlier they could have sufficient time to take measures to cope with the episode they can change the source water regulating the flow rate preparing pac for mib removal or reduce the problematic source water to ensure sufficient adsorption time since the adsorption of mib mainly occurs in the micropores of pac requiring long adsorption time yu et al 2007 since the mic gene is essential for mib production regardless of taxonomy this method can be applied to all mib episodes though the rna based gene abundance r2 0 44 is slightly more accurate than the dna based one r2 0 37 dna detection may be a more practical approach since the detection of dna is easier and the advance time 10 days is longer this advance time was in accordance with a previous study on microcystin production 7 days lu et al 2020 the mic gene based early warning function was also validated by application in 2 drinking water reservoirs jz reservoir and lh reservoir fig s12 both applications exhibited an earlier peak of mic gene abundance compared to the mib concentration though the advance days cannot be accurately confirmed due to the low sampling frequency this further supports the validation of this technology for early warning purpose although the number of advance days should be adjusted before application due to physiological differences between mib producers and differences in the hydrodynamics of reservoirs lakes 4 3 driving factors for mib production mib production in actual water is governed by the growth of mib producer s the expression level of mib synthesis gene and hydrological transportation of mib diffusion as a result the correlation between observed mib concentration and abundance of mib producer s is not strong e g in this study the correlation coefficient between pseudanabaena cell density and mib concentration is 0 28 and the mib concentration can only be modeled using quantile regression in miyun reservoir su et al 2015 it suggests that the gene expression should be emphasized noted that rna abundance of mic gene is a better indicator of mib dynamics compared to dna abundance with 8 variance differences indicating that the mic gene expression is governed by other factors during the mib episode water temperature nutrients and light availability have been considered to be key factors affecting the growth and mib production of cyanobacteria for pseudanabaena higher temperature could promote cell growth 25 35 c mib production izaguirre and taylor 2007 wang and li 2015 zhang et al 2016 and mic gene expression 30 c kakimoto et al 2014 however no significant correlation between water temperature and mic gene abundances dna or rna was observed in qcs reservoir probably owing to the small temperature variations 17 2 c to 26 0 c during the mib episode the uncorrelated relationship between nutrients concentration and mic gene abundances dna and rna in qcs reservoir further supports that nutrients are probably not the key factor governing mic gene expression nutrients are generally not the limiting factor for mib producers as they prefer to stay in the subsurface bottom layers of the water column where nutrients from sediments can satisfy their demand su et al 2021 2019 which is why prevalent mib episodes usually occur in mesotrophic oligotrophic reservoirs lakes su et al 2019 cyanobacteria capture light photons by using photosynthetic pigments including chlorophyll a and phycobillins through photosynthesis wiltbank and kehoe 2019 mib biosynthesis shares a common precursor with chlorophyll a zimba et al 1999 therefore the ambient light condition probably is an essential regulator that governs the cell growth indicator of chlorophyll a biosynthesis and mib production for cyanobacteria as also observed in other culture experiments jia et al 2019 li et al 2012 su et al 2023 wang and li 2015 our culture result indicates that pseudanabaena cannot grow under light intensity as low as 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 consistent with zhang et al 2016 optimized growth was obtained under 36 μmol photons m 2 s 1 but maximum cellular mib production was obtained under 85 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this result is also consistent with zhang et al 2016 showing that the optimum light intensities for cell growth and mib production were 25 and 40 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively the mic gene expression was promoted along with the increase in light intensity from 17 to 85 μmol photons m 2 s 1 resulting in incremental cellular mib yield nevertheless the level of mic gene expression in response to light is strain specific according to comparison with another independent study wang et al 2011 which revealed that the mic gene expression of pseudanabaena sp dqh15 was inhibited under 60 μmol m 2 s 1 compared to 30 μmol m 2 s 1 meanwhile the mean underwater light intensity varied between 15 7 and 51 1 μmol photons m 2 s 1 during the mib episode in qcs reservoir fig s10 it is interesting that the light intensity was positively correlated with the mic gene abundance of rna r2 0 44 p 0 01 but not with dna r2 0 02 p 0 64 it is possible that the light fluctuation during the mib episode was not big enough to affect the cell growth of pseudanabaena however the result clearly shows that the mic gene expression was more sensitive to underwater light intensity than was cell growth which was in accordance with the pure culture experiment in qcs reservoir the relatively higher light intensity 46 3 5 1 μmol photons m 2 s 1 during the period apr 29 to may 3 may have caused the observed increase in mib concentration 7 days later from may 6 to may 10 fig s10 this light response feature of pseudanabaena means that the production of mib may be greatly reduced even for abundant mib producers if the light availability is not favorable for the expression of the mic gene therefore although the detection of dna is used for early warning of the mib episode the detection of rna is also desirable for a more accurate prediction and the light intensity should be also an important predictor 5 conclusion according to investigation of an mib episode in qcs reservoir and a culture experiment for pseudanabaena cinerea the following conclusions can be drawn 1 p cinerea was identified as the major mib producer in qcs reservoir during the investigation in 2021 2 mic gene expression level is light dependent in particular relatively higher light intensity results in increasing cellular mib yield when underwater light intensity is proper for their growth 3 the mic dna abundance and expression can be used for early warning puropse with 7 10 days forecasts offering a valuable time gap for control measures and emergency operation declaration of competing interest the

15126,the provision of self cleaning velocities has been shown to reduce the risk of discolouration in water distribution networks wdns despite these findings control implementations continue to be focused primarily on pressure and leakage management this paper considers the control of diurnal flow velocities to maximize the self cleaning capacity scc of wdns we formulate a new optimal design for control problem where locations and operational settings of pressure control and automatic flushing valves are jointly optimized the problem formulation includes a nonconvex objective function

control capabilities and benefits of dynamically adaptive networks to improve water quality in wdns graphical abstract keywords water quality discolouration self cleaning capacity design for control mixed integer nonlinear programming convex optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the management of water quality in water distribution networks wdns presents a complex operational challenge as a direct consequence of ageing and deteriorating infrastructure the mitigation of discolouration incidents is becoming one of the key operational challenges within water quality management programmes in addition to discolouration being the largest source of customer complaints vreeburg and boxall 2007 husband and boxall 2011 armand et al 2017 there is a growing body of evidence suggesting its occurrence harbours increased microbial activity liu et al 2013 2014 van der wielen and lut 2016 these conditions can accelerate biofilm growth and drastically reduce the efficacy of disinfectant residuals in protecting against waterborne illness and contaminants intrusion moreover wdns in the uk are highly sectorized and operated with fixed topology for purposes of leakage management this type of network configuration referred to as district metered areas dmas has been demonstrated to exacerbate water quality deterioration and increase the risk of discolouration incidents machell and boxall 2014 armand et al 2018 with progressively stringent water quality regulations water companies are seeking effective and cost efficient operational control strategies to reduce the risk of discolouration discolouration is primarily a consequence of resuspended material accumulated within wdns vreeburg and boxall 2007 it can materialize from the cumulative impact of the following processes boxall and dewis 2005 i the ingress and or development of particulate matter ii the accumulation of particulates at the pipe invert and or formation of cohesive layers at the pipe wall and iii a hydraulic disturbance i e trigger event which mobilizes loose particulates and generates sufficient shear stress to overcome cohesive forces at the pipe wall such hydraulic disturbances can be generated from different phenomena including pressure transients during unsteady hydraulic conditions aisopou et al 2012 apart from their origin the physical pathways of discolouration are intrinsically connected to network hydraulics in a recent study focusing on the impact of network sectorization on water quality armand et al 2018 proposed a set of surrogate hydraulic variables for discolouration risk assessment central to their findings was the role of diurnal flow velocities on particle transport and fate this connection between discolouration and hydrodynamic conditions has been supported by numerous experimental and theoretical studies see van summeren and blokker 2017 and armand et al 2018 for reviews on the topic these studies have mainly focused on the development of predictive tools for modelling particle transport and accumulation processes most notably boxall et al 2001 developed the prediction of discolouration in distribution systems podds model an empirically based numerical tool which aims to characterize cohesive layer strength at the pipe wall the podds model was later updated to account for material regeneration in furnass et al 2014 where both erosion and regeneration processes require calibration using continuous flow and turbidity data because such tools require extensive field testing and are generally limited to pipe level assessments their use in practice has not yet been widespread recognizing this limitation van summeren and blokker 2017 presented a theoretical particle transport model combining the effects of gravitational settling hydraulic shear stresses and bed load transport to complement this several laboratory based experimental studies have emerged to better understand the complex interactions between particle properties and pipe hydraulics e g sharpe et al 2019 braga et al 2020 in addition to predictive modelling research has also focused on reducing the severity and frequency of discolouration incidents through network design maintenance and control water companies in the netherlands have been conducting experimental research on the design and implementation of controls for self cleaning networks the self cleaning capacity scc of a wdn is defined as the ability for pipes to experience peak daily flow velocities above a threshold required to routinely re suspend particles and thus prevent accumulation vreeburg et al 2009 previous experimental programmes have suggested resuspension velocities on the order of 0 2 m s to 0 25 m s in distribution pipes ryan et al 2008 blokker et al 2010 this has been corroborated with a recent field study monitoring turbidity under various flow rates where an increase in turbidity levels were observed at flow velocities greater than 0 2 m s prest et al 2021 water companies in the netherlands have demonstrated successful self cleaning implementations by redesigning looped oversized networks to branched layouts with smaller diameter pipes vreeburg et al 2009 a recent study has also investigated the trade off between self cleaning velocities and fire flow capacity in north american wdns gibson et al 2019 however since the redesign of wdn infrastructure becomes cost prohibitive at scale there have been recent forays in the reconfiguration of existing network topology to promote self cleaning networks blokker et al 2012 abraham et al 2016 2018 combining uk and dutch experience abraham et al 2016 2018 formulated an optimization problem for increasing scc by redistributing flow through changes in network topology more specifically the optimization problem aimed to maximize the number of pipes with flow velocities above a self cleaning threshold through two separate strategies i optimal closure of isolation valves and ii optimal operational settings of existing pressure control valves abraham et al 2016 2018 abraham et al 2018 solved the problem of optimizing valve closures using a linear graph analysis tool following schaub et al 2014 a line outage distribution factor lodf matrix was computed to estimate the flow redistribution resulting from an outage closure of an or multiple edge to edge relation s for the optimal control problem abraham et al 2016 computed a local solution by approximating the nonsmooth objective function as a continuous nonlinear function followed by application of a tailored sequential convex programming algorithm while the benefits of the lodf solution method for optimal valve closures were demonstrated numerically using an operational network in the netherlands results from the control problem were limited to a small scale theoretical network moreover decision variables were restricted to the control of existing unidirectional pressure reducing valves prvs building on the scc optimization problem posed in abraham et al 2016 2018 this manuscript considers both control and design for control problem formulations the latter involves the simultaneous optimization of valve placement and operational settings for both existing and new control valves in addition to unidirectional prvs this work also considers bidirectional dynamic boundary valves dbvs and automatic flushing valves afvs as dynamic hydraulic controls these hydraulic controls were developed to facilitate the novel operational framework of dynamically adaptive networks wright et al 2014 ulusoy et al 2022 the resulting optimization problem is formulated as a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear program minlp both mathematical optimization and heuristic methods have been used to solve design and control problems in wdns see literature review in mala jetmarova et al 2017 for mathematical optimization methods scalability is recognized as a current limitation in solving minlp problems to global optimality koch et al 2012 sahinidis 2019 that is the implementation of global solvers become impractical for large problem cases consequently heuristic approaches are often employed to compute satisfactory feasible solutions a common heuristic method used for wdn optimization problems is the genetic algorithm ga while gas have been successfully applied to design problems the computational effort required to find solutions sufficiently close to the global optimum grows rapidly with problem size maier et al 2014 in this manuscript we develop a heuristic algorithm based on convex optimization and a multi start scheme to compute feasible solutions to the considered minlp problem to handle integer variables we first formulate a convex subproblem through polyhedral relaxations of nonconvex terms and the continuous relaxation of binary variables we subsequently employ a randomization heuristic to sample n candidate valve configurations from the set of fractional values generated from the convex subproblem we then fix binary variables for each sampled valve configuration and compute locally optimal operational settings from a nonlinear programming nlp control problem this follows the heuristic algorithm presented in pecci et al 2022 extending its application to the scc design for control problem and to the nonsmooth hazen williams friction model since the degree of nonlinearity of the scc problem is higher than the problem investigated in pecci et al 2022 we include a multi start strategy and a feasibility restoration problem for selecting starting points this step aims to minimize the risk of poor local optima as well as ensure hydraulic feasibility of the nlp control problem finally the best feasible solution is selected from the set of sampled valve configurations the proposed heuristic algorithm further increases the benefits from the implementation of dynamically adaptive networks as it expands their control capabilities to enhance water quality in wdns this manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 we formulate the design for control problem of maximizing the network scc through dynamic hydraulic controls we then present the proposed heuristic algorithm in section 3 finally in section 4 we demonstrate the performance of the developed heuristic algorithm using three case study networks with varying size and degrees of complexity to facilitate a broader discussion on heuristic approaches for the design and control of wdns we compare the results with an off the shelf ga implementation which is a common approach used in the literature 2 problem formulation we investigate a design for control problem to maximize the length of network pipes experiencing flow velocities above a given self cleaning capacity scc threshold this is achieved by installing new valves and or controlling their operational settings for this purpose our problem formulation considers three valve types as pressure and connectivity control actuators first pressure reducing valves prvs which are modelled having unidirectional flow second bidirectional dynamic boundary valves dbvs for which flow is permitted in both directions across discrete model time steps here dbvs represent the operation of remote controlled isolation valves which modulate flow and pressure between adjacent zones third automatic flushing valves afvs whose flushing rate is bounded by a set maximum value throughout this manuscript we refer to either prvs or dbvs as control valves as both have the capability of controlling pressure and are modelled at network links on the other hand afvs are simply referred to as flushing valves and are modelled at network nodes we consider operational scenarios for which prv locations have been fixed to minimize average zone pressure azp and thus decision variables include only their operational settings in comparison both locations and operational settings of dbvs and afvs are considered as decision variables the operational settings of valves are modelled as continuous variables whereas their placement location are modelled through binary variables all network links and nodes are considered as potential locations of dbvs and afvs respectively as the current stage of this work focuses on the self cleaning capacity of pipes at the dma or distribution level we do not consider storage tanks or pumping activity as forms of hydraulic control therefore we assume discrete and hydraulically independent model time steps finally it is noted that this work relies on the availability of a calibrated hydraulic model 2 1 hydraulic variables and constraints the problem considers a water distribution network wdn with n p links n n demand nodes and n 0 known head nodes e g water sources reservoirs the network is modelled as a directed graph with n p edges links and n n n 0 vertices nodes a demand driven hydraulic analysis is used to simulate steady state network hydraulics over n t discrete time steps for each time step t 1 n t known hydraulic conditions are given by vectors of nodal demands d t r n n and source hydraulic heads h t 0 r n 0 moreover vectors η t r n p and α t r n n are included to model local losses introduced by the action of control valves and operational demands at flushing valves respectively unique vectors of hydraulic states q t r n p and h t r n n are computed by solving the following steady state energy 1a and mass 1b conservation equations governing pipe flow 1a a 12 h t a 10 h t 0 ϕ q t η t 0 1b a 12 t q t d t α t 0 where a 12 r n p n n and a 10 r n p n 0 are the link node incidence matrices for demand and known head nodes respectively and the vector ϕ q t ϕ 1 q 1 t ϕ n p q n p t t models frictional head losses associated with flows q t omitting time index t ϕ j q j is defined in general form for flow conveyed across link j as 2 ϕ j q j r j q j n j 1 q j j 1 n p where the resistance coefficient r j and exponent n j both independent of time t take different values depending on the link type e g pipe or valve and on the frictional head loss model for valve links n j 2 and r j 8 k j g π 2 d j 4 with k j and d j representing the valve loss coefficient and diameter respectively larock et al 1999 in this work we apply the hazen williams hw model to characterize frictional head losses across pipe links the hw model is an explicit and empirical relationship between pipe flow and frictional head loss with n j 1 852 and r j is defined as follows for all j 1 n p 3 r j 10 67 l j c j 1 852 d j 4 871 where c is the hw coefficient a dimensionless number representing frictional characteristics l is pipe length in meters and d is pipe diameter in meters larock et al 1999 similarly explicit approximations of the darcy weisbach formula e g valiantzas 2008 could be used to model frictional head losses finally it is convenient to isolate the nonlinear term ϕ q t in 1a here we introduce a vector of auxiliary variables θ t r n p which separates the energy conservation constraint into its linear and nonlinear components as follows 4a a 12 h t a 10 h t 0 θ t η t 0 4b θ t ϕ q t 0 valve placement and operation are modelled as follows for each time step t 1 n t the continuous variable η t r n p presented in 1a models the local losses introduced by the action of control valves and the continuous variable α t r n n presented in 1b models the flow emitted at flushing valves moreover binary variables z 0 1 n p are included to model prv and dbv placement and v t 0 1 n p and v t 0 1 n p to assign their control capabilities in the positive or negative flow direction respectively across each time step t thus for all links j 1 n p and time steps t 1 n t binary variables z j v j t and v j t are set as z j 1 control valve on link j 0 no valve 5 v j t 1 control valve on link j in positive direction 0 no valve v j t 1 control valve on link j in negative direction 0 no valve analogously the placement of afvs at network nodes is modelled using binary variables y 0 1 n n defined as 6 y i 1 flushing valve placed at node i 0 no valve these binary variables are subject to the following physical and economical constraints which limit pressure control capabilities in a single direction at each time step t 7a and enforce a maximum number of control valves n v and flushing valves n f considered for installation 7b 7c 7a v j t v j t z j j 1 n p t 1 n t 7b j 1 n p z j n v 7c i 1 n n y i n f since we assume that existing prvs have fixed location and unidirectional flow z j v j t and v j t are set a priori for all time steps t 1 n t at the known set of prv links n prv 1 n p we introduce constant vectors to bound the continuous hydraulic variables and formulate big m constraints for modelling the operation of control and flushing valves for a given vector of maximum allowed velocities u max r n p and vector of link cross sectional areas a r n p let q t l a u max and q t u a u max be the vectors of lower and upper bound flows across network links at time step t respectively bounds on the auxiliary head loss vector θ t are set as θ t l ϕ q t l and θ t u ϕ q t u moreover let h t min and h t max r n n specify minimum and maximum heads at network nodes respectively the minimum head is set to a minimum regulatory pressure plus the node elevation and the maximum head is set to the largest available known source head bounds on η t for j 1 n p are then defined as follows 8a η t l j h t min i h t max k i j k 8b η t u j h t max i h t min k i j k we formulate big m constraints to model valve placement and enforce energy conservation at control valve links ensuring η t and q t act in the same direction these constraints are written as follows 9a η t diag η t u v t 0 t 1 n t 9b η t diag η t l v t 0 t 1 n t 9c q t diag q t l v t q t l t 1 n t 9d q t diag q t u v t q t u t 1 n t 9e θ t diag θ t l v t θ t l t 1 n t 9f θ t diag θ t u v t θ t u t 1 n t additionally let α t u be a known upper bound on the flushing rate at afvs the following big m constraint is then included to model flushing valve placement and enforce bounds on the continuous variable α t 10 α t diag α t u y 0 t 1 n t finally lower and upper bounds on hydraulic variables h t q t η t and θ t are set to define the feasible solution space 11a q t l q t q t u t 1 n t 11b h t min h t h t max t 1 n t 11c η t l η t η t u t 1 n t 11d 0 α t α t u t 1 n t 11e θ t l θ t θ t u t 1 n t 2 2 self cleaning capacity objective function the objective of this study is to maximize the length of network pipes satisfying the self cleaning capacity scc threshold the scc objective function is defined as the following length weighted sum over all pipes n p and hydraulic time steps n t abraham et al 2018 12 f scc 1 n t t 1 n t j 1 n p w j κ j q j t a j where a is the link cross sectional area and κ j is an indicator function which models the state of pipe velocities with reference to a minimum threshold the indicator function is described for link j as follows 13 κ j u 1 if u u j min 0 otherwise with u j min representing the threshold flow velocity at link j defined a priori see presented literature in section 1 moreover a weighting is included to normalize the length of link j to the entire network w j l j k 1 n p l k where l r n p is the vector of pipe lengths the scc objective function f scc is nonsmooth at u min resulting in unbounded gradients therefore in order to employ gradient based optimization methods the threshold function κ is approximated with a continuous sum of sigmoids or logistic function as proposed in abraham et al 2016 the sigmoidal function has positive and negative components defined by ψ j u 1 e ρ u u j min 1 and ψ j u 1 e ρ u u j min 1 respectively where ρ is a parameter which sets the sigmoid function curvature the following expression combines these sigmoid functions to approximate f scc posed in 12 14 f scc 1 n t t 1 n t j 1 n p w j ψ j q j t a j ψ j q j t a j where velocity is defined as u j t q j t a j in accordance with that reported in abraham et al 2016 we found ρ 100 provided a step like objective function whilst still being sufficiently smooth at the threshold boundaries for gradients to exist an example of the scc indicator function κ and its continuous sum of sigmoids approximation f scc are shown in fig 1 2 3 mixed integer nonlinear program the scc design for control problem aims to maximize 14 subject to hydraulic conservation laws and physical and economical valve constraints the problem formulation includes continuous variables denoted by x q h η θ α t and binary variables denoted by v v v t y and z here the objective function is replaced with its additive inverse to result in a minimization optimization problem the resulting mixed integer nonlinear program minlp is summarized by the following problem formulation minlp minimize x v y z f scc 14 subject to linear hydraulic conservation constraints 1b and 4a nonconvex hw head loss model constraints 4b big m constraints for control valve operation 9a 9f big m constraints for flushing valve operation 10 physical and economical valve constraints 7a 7c x q 11a 11e v 0 1 2 n p n t y 0 1 n n z 0 1 n p where q is a rectangle representing upper and lower bounds for the continuous decision variables the continuous decision variables are defined as q q t t 1 n t h h t t 1 n t η η t t 1 n t θ θ t t 1 n t and α α t t 1 n t the binary decision variables varying with time step t are defined as v v t t 1 n t and v v t t 1 n t problem minlp has n t 3 n p 2 n n continuous variables 2 n t n p n p n n binary variables and 2 n t n p nonconvex terms observe that the problem grows rapidly with the size of the considered wdn see table 1 making it a difficult nonconvex minlp problem to solve to overcome these challenges we develop a convex heuristic to compute feasible solutions to problem minlp the following section describes the solution algorithm and its implementation details 3 solution method the proposed solution algorithm combines convex relaxations with a randomization heuristic and multi start solver to compute feasible solutions to problem minlp first we formulate convex relaxations of problem minlp which yield a linear programming lp subproblem here the nonconvex scc objective function 12 and nonconvex energy conservation constraints 4b are relaxed using polyhedral envelopes and a continuous relaxation is applied to binary decision variables we also include a domain reduction step where the resulting convex subproblem is tightened using both model decomposition and optimization based bound tightening obbt techniques then a randomization heuristic uses the fractional valve placement values from the convex subproblem solution to form nonlinear programming nlp control problems local solutions to these nlp problems are computed using a strictly feasible sequential convex programming sfscp solver we also implement a multi start strategy which includes an optimization based feasibility restoration problem to ensure hydraulic feasibility of the starting points fig 2 offers a detailed overview of the solution method referred to as the convex multi start cms algorithm the algorithm steps and overall implementation details are provided in the following subsections 3 1 convex relaxation there are two sources of nonlinear nonconvexity that make problem minlp difficult to solve these are the scc objective function f scc 14 and the hw head loss model ϕ in equality constraint 4b one approach to overcome nonconvexity is through polyhedral relaxations which can be formulated as linear constraints and thus efficiently handled by state of the art linear solvers since the resulting mixed integer linear program milp may still have a large number of binary variables it is convenient to apply a continuous relaxation to binary variables in addition to the computational advantages a continuous relaxation increases the search space for the set of optimal binary variables here we implement the aforementioned relaxation techniques to formulate a convex subproblem of problem minlp with its solution forming the basis of the heuristic algorithm we first relax the nonconvex objective function in 14 with a linear outer approximation let σ t r n p and σ t r n p be vectors of auxiliary variables introduced to model the positive ψ and negative ψ sigmoid functions respectively the objective function f scc is then reformulated as the following set of inequality constraints 15a σ t ψ q t a t 1 n t 15b σ t ψ q t a t 1 n t to ensure equivalence with 14 the scc objective function becomes 16 f scc 1 n t t 1 n t j 1 n p w j σ j t σ j t we construct concave envelopes for the positive ψ and negative ψ components of f scc this follows the methodology presented in udell and boyd 2014 2016 for sigmoidal functions resulting in piecewise linear relaxations these relaxations are written as the following constraint 17 s t q t t t σ t s t t 1 n t where matrices s t s t s t t and t t t t t t t and vector s t s t s t t depend on flow velocity bounds u t l q t l a and u t u q t u a as well as the sigmoid function parameters a detailed derivation of these relaxations is provided in appendix a 1 moreover an example of the implemented relaxation is illustrated in fig 3 a with ψ ˆ denoting the set of linear relaxations we then implement polyhedral relaxations for the hw head loss model ϕ in equality constraint 4b this builds on the relaxation methods for monomials of odd degree introduced by liberti and pantelides 2003 by formulating polyhedral relaxations for the hw head loss model similar to 17 the formulated relaxations are written as the following linear constraint 18 r t q t e t θ t r t t 1 n t where matrices r t and e t and vector r t are derived from flow bounds q t l and q t u and the hw model parameters further details are presented in appendix a 2 and an example of the implemented relaxation is illustrated in fig 3 b with the polyhedral relaxation denoted by ϕ ˆ lastly we implement the continuous relaxation of binary variables v y and z these are combined with continuous decision variables x defined in problem minlp and the continuous auxiliary variables associated with the f scc inequality constraints 15a and 15b denoted by σ σ σ the resulting convex relaxation of problem minlp is represented by the following lp subproblem lp minimize x v y z σ f scc reformulated in 16 subject to linear relaxations of hw head loss model constraints 18 linear relaxations of ψ and ψ sigmoid functions 17 linear hydraulic conservation constraints 1b and 4a big m constraints for control valve operation 9a 9f big m constraints for flushing valve operation 10 physical and economical valve constraints 7a 7c x q 11a 11e σ 0 1 2 n p n t v 0 1 2 n p n t y 0 1 n n z 0 1 n p the optimal value to subproblem lp yields a lower bound to the original nonconvex problem minlp in particular vectors y r n n and z r n p of continuous variables for valve placement can be interpreted as the probability distribution from which random samples are drawn to solve the nlp control problem moreover the vector η r n p from subproblem lp is used as one of m starting points in the multi start strategy these steps are discussed in the subsequent sections furthermore we implement a domain reduction procedure to reduce the bound intervals and thus strengthen the convex relaxations formulated for subproblem lp the main procedure implemented is an optimization based bound tightening obbt algorithm belotti et al 2009 the obbt algorithm solves a series of lp optimization problems with objective functions set to both maximize and minimize link flow this is augmented with a forest core decomposition scheme to reduce the number of flow variables whose bounds are tightened simpson et al 2014 the forest of a wdn comprises the disjoint union of all outer branch or tree components deuerlein 2008 the core represents the set of looped or block graphs which contain the roots of all forest trees following pecci et al 2019 we only perform bound tightening on the set of core links we include pseudocode for the obbt algorithm in appendix b 3 2 randomization heuristic in searching for a good quality local solution to problem minlp we employ a randomization heuristic to sample candidate valve configurations here the fractional values of y r n n and z r n p yielded from the solution to subproblem lp define a discrete probability distribution for the index sets 1 n n and 1 n p respectively we propose to randomly sample candidate pressure control n v and flushing n f valve configurations from the respective probability distributions over n sampling trials this creates sampled vectors of binary variables y i 1 n 0 1 n n and z i 1 n 0 1 n p from which a local solution to the nlp control problem is obtained for each trial i 1 n see section 3 3 to avoid redundant valve configurations we store binary values from each trial in the set p r n n v n f checking its intersection with y i z i before fixing valve placement values and proceeding to the nlp control problem pseudocode for the implemented randomization heuristic is detailed in algorithm 1 3 3 multi start solver the final component of the cms solution algorithm concerns the optimization of valve settings this control problem is formulated to compute locally optimal operational settings for each candidate valve configuration generated from the randomization heuristic because the objective function in problem minlp is highly nonlinear we implement a strategy to use multiple starting points in order to avoid getting trapped in poor local optima this includes a feasibility restoration subproblem to ensure hydraulically feasible starting points are passed to the nlp solver we refer to the overall solution process as the multi start solver which has steps highlighted by the process diagram shown in fig 4 3 3 1 strictly feasible sequential convex programming solver with the placement of dbvs and afvs from the set of sampled configurations 1 n we then fix binary flow direction variables v t and v t at dbv locations for each time step t 1 n t this yields a nonconvex nlp problem with continuous decision variables denoted by x q h η α t moreover big m constraints for pressure control and flushing valve operations found in problem minlp are reformulated as variable bounds these bounds are derived on the basis of the fixed binary variables the corresponding nlp control problem is formulated as follows nlp minimize x f scc 14 subject to hydraulic conservation constraints 1a and 1b x q where q represents the upper and lower variable bounds modified to account for directional constraints enforced by the fixed binary variables since the focus of this study is at the dma or distribution level which in practice limits the number of installed dbvs for consideration we use an enumeration approach to test all dbv flow direction combinations for v t and v t this approach was deemed appropriate on the basis of the relatively small computational cpu times recorded in section 4 for example the numerical experiment corresponding to the maximum number of installed dbvs on the largest network tested in this study see section 4 1 for details resulted in a cpu time of less than five minutes this cpu time is well within an assumed one hour limit for application in control strategies we acknowledge however that this assumption warrants re evaluation for system wide studies which inevitably consider a larger set of control valves here a total of t 2 n dbv control problems are solved to find the best dbv direction combination at each time step t 1 n t see fig 4 in this work we use the strictly feasible sequential convex programming sfscp method outlined in wright et al 2015 for solving a local optima to problem nlp the sfscp solver also used to optimize scc control valve settings in abraham et al 2016 is implemented because of its reliable convergence properties namely its strict feasibility requirement for each iterate of the optimization process the sfscp solver linearizes the objective function and nonlinear hydraulic conservation constraints in problem nlp from which a sequence of linear programs can be efficiently solved linear approximations are formulated using first order taylor expansions around the point x k q k h k η k α k t let f f scc and the hydraulic conservation equality constraints 1a and 1b be denoted by g it follows that 19 f x f x k f q x k q q k and 20 g x g x k g q x k q q k g η x k η η k g α x k α α k are the linearized expressions used to formulate a convex subproblem for each iterate k this subproblem computes step directions d η k and d α k at point x k for pressure control and flushing valve operational variables respectively following wright et al 2015 a strictly feasible line search method is implemented to guarantee an improvement in objective function whilst ensuring hydraulic feasibility of the computed local optima we define the hydraulically feasible region by the set 21 f x r n p n n n v n f x satisfies constraints 1a 1b and variable bounds q the null space solver proposed in abraham and stoianov 2015 is used to solve hydraulic states q k 1 and h k 1 for the optimal controls obtained at iterate k if x k f then the optimization process moves to the next iterate k k 1 otherwise a backtracking procedure is implemented to reduce d η k and d α k until hydraulic feasibility is achieved termination of the sfscp solver is triggered when relative improvements in the objective function are below a set tolerance ϵ tol the sfscp solver steps are detailed in pseudocode presented in appendix c wright et al 2015 moreover the subsequent section describes a multi start strategy for selecting feasible starting points x 0 to be passed to the sfscp solver for completeness we provide a brief discussion on the performance comparison with state of the art nonlinear solver ipopt this is included as many large scale wdn optimization studies have used ipopt to compute locally optimal solutions for network controls e g pecci et al 2019 ulusoy et al 2020 nerantzis and stoianov 2022 most of these studies however have applied a quadratic approximation qa to model the head loss function ψ as the nonsmooth hw formula presents challenges for ipopt namely that its hessian is unbounded at the origin preliminary efforts to introduce a qa model for the current scc problem resulted in large inaccuracies compared to the hw model this was expected as the current study aims to maximize pipe flow velocities which increases the qa model error since a larger maximum flow value is required pecci et al 2017 equation 21 therefore we tested ipopt using the hw model and relied on its feasibility restoration scheme to mitigate potential errors infeasibility errors were observed for the larger case study network when using the ipopt solver ultimately leading to the sfscp solver as the more reliable and robust option for the current scc control problem the sfscp and ipopt solver comparison is detailed in appendix d 3 3 2 multi start strategy as highlighted in fig 4 a multi start strategy is implemented to find good quality local optima to problem nlp here we initialize starting points x 0 for multiple initial conditions j 1 m which are sequentially passed to the sfscp solver starting points are formed by simulating hydraulic states for different initial control valve settings η 0 for initial condition j 1 we set η j 1 0 equal to the control valve settings resulting from subproblem lp otherwise η j 2 m 0 is randomly generated between the previously set lower and upper η bounds note that initial flushing operations are set as α 0 0 for all initial conditions j 1 m since the initial control conditions do not guarantee a solution in the hydraulically feasible region we also include a feasibility restoration step that is if starting point x j 0 f for all j 1 m feasibility is restored through the solution to the following nlp optimization problem fr minimize x η η 0 2 2 subject to hydraulic conservation constraints 1a and 1b x q where the objective function is set to minimize the squared ℓ 2 norm between the vector of initial settings η 0 and settings η which produce a hydraulically feasible starting point problem fr is solved using the nonlinear ipopt solver apart from cases where the fixed dbv directions strictly cannot facilitate a hydraulically feasible solution we did not encounter infeasibility errors when using ipopt as the nlp solver for problem fr the discussion in appendix d suggests that the nonconvexity of the scc objective function in problem nlp is a key factor for the observed infeasibility issues 4 numerical experiments and discussion we evaluate the scc design for control problem using the proposed cms solution algorithm since cms is a heuristic we also compare its performance with an off the shelf ga implementation which is a common heuristic method for solving wdn design problems this section is organized as follows first in section 4 1 we describe the problem parameters case study networks and computational resources used to carry out the numerical experiments next section 4 2 discusses the results obtained when solving the control only subproblem to problem minlp where valves locations are fixed in this case operational settings of existing prv and dbv if applicable valve configurations are optimized to maximize self cleaning conditions we then investigate the solution to the design for control problem in section 4 3 where the placement and operation of both pressure control and flushing valves are considered to improve scc performance 4 1 computational setup all numerical experiments were performed in matlab r2021b 64 bit for microsoft windows 11 installed on a 2 50 ghz intel r core tm i9 11900h cpu with 8 cores and 32 0 gb of memory ram the lp problems involved in the convex relaxation obbt algorithm and sfscp solver were solved using gurobi v9 5 0 gurobi optimization 2022 accessed via its matlab interface with the exception of large problem cases which had solver parameters e g numericfocus crossover and presolve modified to deal with numerical issues gurobi s default parameters were applied local solutions to the nlp feasibility restoration problems were solved using the state of the art interior point solver ipopt v3 12 19 wächter and biegler 2006 ipopt was accessed in matlab via the opti toolbox interface currie et al 2012 and was implemented passing the exact jacobian and hessian matrices as inputs to the solver the single objective ga was implemented using matlab s off the shelf global optimization toolbox with its default solver parameters e g population size 100 crossover fraction 0 8 function tolerance 1 e 6 for each ga fitness evaluation epanet2 2 rossman et al 2020 hydraulic solver was accessed via the epanet matlab toolkit interface eliades et al 2016 we set maximum time limits for the ga implementation associated with control and design for control problems of 6 and 12 h respectively furthermore matlab s parallel computing toolbox was employed with eight local workers to speed up code in the obbt algorithm and multi start solver finally network hydraulics were computed within cms using the null space method proposed in abraham and stoianov 2015 we evaluated the performance of the solution methods using three case study networks pescara modena and bwflnet problem data for each network including the size of the resulting minlp optimization problems are summarized in table 1 moreover network layouts are shown in fig 5 pescara and modena are skeletonized versions of wdns in medium sized italian cities published by bragalli et al 2012 for benchmarking purposes since these are theoretical networks unidirectional prvs were placed at the outlet of each reservoir to represent existing valve configurations bwflnet is a large scale operational network representing an area of the city of bristol s wdn located in southwest england it currently operates with dynamically controlled prv and bidirectional dbv valves which modulate flow and pressure between adjacent zones to minimize azp bwflnet s current control valve configuration was applied to model existing conditions for more details on bwflnet see wright et al 2014 and waldron et al 2020 moreover existing kept shut boundary valves were opened in order to test the full capabilities of the proposed solution algorithm observe that the evaluated case study networks vary by size network connectivity and demand scenarios enabling the proposed cms algorithm to be tested on a range of network conditions pescara and modena are relatively small scale looped networks with theoretical and quite large demands bwflnet on the other hand represents a larger scale operational network having a branched structure and demands representing water consumption in a typical urban area in the uk for reference we note that the size of the resulting minlp optimization problems for bwflnet are at the upper end of the range reported in the minlplib database vigerske 2022 minlplib is a widely used library of benchmarking minlp problem instances the known input parameters for problem minlp were selected as follows for the scc objective function f scc 14 we set the sigmoid function curvature parameter ρ to 50 unless stated otherwise on the basis of the reviewed literature in section 1 the self cleaning velocity threshold u j min was set to 0 2 m s for all j 1 n p since we are concerned with the redistribution of peak flows we define four discrete hydraulic time steps n t to represent peak demand scenarios within a typical diurnal demand profile these were split between the morning and evening high demand periods and were unique to each case study in relation to hydraulic feasibility constraints 11b we applied a minimum regulatory pressure head of 15 m uk regulations at all nonzero demand nodes for all case study networks moreover the upper bound for flushing valve demands α u shown in constraint 11d was set to 25 l s this value was selected with reference to the recommended fire flow capacity at fire hydrants in the uk local government association and water uk 2007 for the design for control problem we evaluated the placement and operation of n v 1 3 bidirectional dbvs and n f 0 3 afvs hence for each network a total of 12 valve configurations were considered the number of randomization trials n in algorithm 1 was set to the minimum of valve configuration combinations generated from the continuous relaxation in subproblem lp or a maximum trial count maximum trial counts were set to n 50 for pescara and modena and n 100 for bwflnet finally the number of initial conditions tested in the multi start scheme fig 4 was set to m 5 4 2 existing valve configuration results we first investigated improvements to scc performance achieved by optimizing the operational settings of existing pressure control valve configurations this was considered a logical initial step as the implementation scc specific controls requires no additional capital investment and can thus be readily applied as discussed previously the theoretical case study networks pescara and modena were assumed to have prvs assigned at each link leaving a source node e g reservoir on the other hand bwflnet had its existing operational valve configuration assigned a subproblem of problem minlp was then formulated where binary variables z were fixed for the known control valve locations and directional variables v and v were set free for networks with existing dbv locations e g bwflnet valve control settings and dbv directions were then optimized over the four peak demand periods using the multi start strategy described in section 3 3 the results are reported in fig 6 through cumulative distribution plots of maximum flow velocities weighted by pipe length these plots offer a comparison between network scc conditions with and without optimized controls considering f scc is an approximation of the actual self cleaning problem we also include a sensitivity analysis on the sigmoid curvature parameter ρ to test changes in relative performance moreover table 2 summarizes the control problem results obtained with both the multi start solver and the ga implementation described in section 4 1 we set a maximum time limit of one hour for the off the shelf ga solver which was assumed to reflect an upper bound for the practical application of control problems first fig 6 suggests that pressure modulation at existing control valves can significantly improve scc conditions in the tested looped networks this is highlighted by the numerical results for modena where the length of pipe experiencing self cleaning velocities increased from approximately 60 to 95 for peak demand conditions in contrast results for bwflnet which has limited connectivity due to its branched structure showed only modest improvements these results were expected as the reduced inter connectivity in bwflnet leads to pipe flows being primarily a function of downstream demands for this reason section 4 3 presents the results for a design for control problem where we consider the installation of additional dbvs and flushing valves which aim to improve self cleaning conditions in branched networks furthermore we report modest changes in the flow velocity profiles for the ρ sensitivity analysis see fig 6 since no pattern can be discerned between ρ values we conclude ρ 50 to be suitable for the design for control numerical experiments discussed in the subsequent section as shown in table 2 the multi start solver computes solutions that are similar to those obtained by the ga but at a fraction of the computational effort while the ga consistently reaches the set time limit of one hour the longest computational time experienced by the multi start solver is equal to 200 s this is important as we are considering an optimal control problem which may need to be solved in near real time the much longer cpu time required by the ga is likely due to the fact that it facilitates a search for the globally optimal solution thus for highly nonlinear optimization problems like that formulated for the current scc problem the ga retains a large solution space so as to avoid exclusion of the global optimum this characteristic has been recognized as a challenge when using gas for wdn control problems especially when dealing with problems having a large number and range of free continuous variables maier et al 2014 ulusoy et al 2022 furthermore we note that the ga implementation used in this work applies default parameters see section 4 1 and loads an external hydraulic solver epanet2 2 at each fitness evaluation this off the shelf implementation is also likely to contribute to the relatively large cpu times extending the time limit to nearly 48 h the ga converges to a solution with an scc value of approximately 24 8 for bwflnet this minimal performance gain suggests that the one hour time limit is sufficient for the scc control problem comparison in addition table 2 provides a comparison of average zone pressure azp performance between control settings optimized for azp and scc respectively note that the azp objective function is formulated as a weighted sum of nodal pressures averaged over n t time steps wright et al 2015 equation 4 in accordance with findings in abraham et al 2016 we found a clear trade off between the optimization of control settings for the scc and azp objectives for example a 16 2 m difference in azp was recorded for bwflnet while this trade off is not discussed further in the current study we acknowledge the importance of having scc and azp objectives among others coexist in an overall operational network control strategy furthermore the transition between such operational objectives may provoke large variations in hydraulic conditions e g pressure transients and should thus be managed accordingly future work is needed to investigate these considerations for the implementation of dynamically adaptive control strategies in operational wdns 4 3 design for control results this section considers the scc design for control problem for optimal placement and control of new bidirectional dbvs and afvs we test a total of 12 valve configurations for each case study network where experiment 1 corresponds to n v 1 and n f 0 and experiment 12 corresponds to n v 3 and n f 3 as stated in section 4 1 each experiment uses hydraulic conditions from four peak demand conditions across a typical diurnal demand profile moreover with the exception of existing dbvs in bwflnet the design for control numerical experiments include the existing prv configurations shown in fig 5 which were used for the optimal control subproblem in section 4 2 we investigate the solution of problem minlp using three methods i the proposed convex multi start heuristic cms ii cms with domain reduction as described in section 3 1 referred to as cms dr and iii an off the shelf ga implementation coupled with the epanet2 2 hydraulic solver note that we set the following time limits for the ga on the basis of that recorded using cms 6 h for pescara and modena and 12 h for bwflnet the scc objective function results and corresponding cpu times from each solution method are shown in fig 7 for the considered set of numerical experiments figs 7 a 7 c and 7 e show that cms finds feasible solutions for all numerical experiments to highlight the improvements in scc we include a solid black line to represent initial hydraulic conditions and a dashed black line to report the scc values obtained by optimally controlling existing valves as done in section 4 2 while scc improvements are experienced for all case studies we observe significant relative improvements compared with the control only solution for bwflnet as previously discussed in section 4 2 the scc improvements for bwflnet can be attributed to the deployment of afvs which facilitate controlled flushing demands at the optimally selected locations moreover the additional dbvs act to further branch the network thereby enhancing self cleaning velocities the increase in scc is investigated further through network velocity plots shown in fig 8 here we compare maximum pipe velocities resulting from initial hydraulics i e no control and as an example the design for control solution corresponding to n v 2 and n f 3 figs 8 b 8 d and 8 f clearly indicate a net increase in the overall extent of the network experiencing self cleaning velocities from optimal valve controls we observe optimal afv placement to be near the network periphery in pescara and bwflnet these results are intuitive as flushing demands facilitate self cleaning velocities in areas that otherwise convey relatively low flow in contrast afvs are concentrated near a source node in modena this is a result of existing prvs modulating inlet pressure to shift the hydraulic balance point or interface between source nodes in particular the flow rates illustrated in fig 8 d suggest that source nodes near the top of the network supply a greater proportion of the demand additionally we note that the optimal dbv locations which increase self cleaning velocities by redistributing flow paths may result in sub optimal conditions for controlling network pressure since we do not explicitly consider pressure management in the scc problem formulation the integration of self cleaning and pressure management objectives should be a focus of future work lastly fig 8 f highlights the limited influence of control features for the more branched bwflnet network although the placement and operation of afvs indeed improve self cleaning hydraulic conditions these are generally limited to direct upstream flow paths in the case where self cleaning velocities are sought for specific areas of the network e g historical complaints the scc objective function can be modified to focus on a user defined subset of pipes in comparing the two implementations of cms with and without domain reduction we observe the former to yield better quality feasible solutions this can be attributed to the tighter relaxations resulting from domain reduction in fact tighter relaxations may generate fractional valve placement values closer to the feasible domain and therefore more likely to result in better quality design for control solutions in addition the solution of subproblem lp with tighter relaxations computes control valve settings η that are closer to the feasible set and the global optimum as described in section 3 3 these η values are used as a starting point for the multi start solver hence we expect these settings to be advantageous in finding a better solution nonetheless the obbt algorithm comes at an increase in computational effort figs 7 b 7 d and 7 f compare cpu times across numerical experiments for each solution method although the increase in cpu times are modest for the smaller networks obbt does not scale well for the larger operational network for example the increase in cpu time reported for bwflnet was at minimum approximately 50 when obbt was applied even though problem minlp is considered a design problem and is thus solved offline obbt can become impractical for large scale and highly interconnected networks pecci et al 2022 future work should investigate speed improvements to obbt or the implementation of tighter relaxations for problem minlp finally we compare design for control solutions computed by cms with an off the shelf ga implementation as described in section 4 1 the epanet2 2 hydraulic solver was employed within the ga s fitness function to test hydraulic feasibility of the generated solutions the solution was deemed feasible when the epanet2 2 solver successfully converged and when the entire set of pressure heads across all time steps met the minimum pressure constraint otherwise hydraulically infeasible solutions were discarded moreover pressure set points at control valves were bounded by the maximum head difference across the network i e reservoir level less minimum node elevation in fig 7 a the ga solution is shown to produce comparable if not better scc results for pescara than cms dr this is not surprising as the stochastic search procedure employed by the ga is well suited for highly nonlinear optimization problems such as the current scc objective function although the ga did not satisfy its termination criterion within the prescribed time limit six hours the relatively small number of free continuous variables in pescara e g pressure set points and flushing rates see table 1 enabled the computation of good quality feasible solutions on the other hand the ga was unable to find feasible solutions for numerous problem instances using modena this was particularly evident for experiments including the design and control of afvs which result in higher frictional losses materializing from flushing demands note that infeasibility is indicated by an scc value of zero in fig 7 c additional ga experiments revealed such infeasibility issues to be linked to the relatively small range in hydraulically feasible pressures found in modena with the minimum regulatory pressure head relaxed from 15 m to 0 m i e h min set to node elevations the ga found feasible solutions comparable to cms dr these results highlight the efficacy of the proposed convex heuristic for a wider range of network conditions for bwflnet cms dr finds similar quality design for control solutions to the ga however as observed in modena cms dr is shown to consistently outperform the ga for experiments considering the implementation of afvs in light of the comparison between solution methods we investigated the computational overhead of the ga fitness function as configured in this study using the epanet matlab toolkit this is a cumbersome process and one which directly impacts the number of fitness evaluations performed by the ga by comparison cms requires much less overhead from loading external software and computes hydraulic states via an efficient null space solver table 3 compares the number of epanet2 2 solver calls for the 12 hour time limit with the null space solver calls in cms the comparison uses select design for control experiments for the bwflnet case study network with the exception of experiment 1 table 3 reports the number of epanet2 2 solver calls to be significantly less than the hydraulic simulations recorded in cms this identifies the hydraulic analysis as a bottleneck in the overall ga search procedure particularly since its cpu times are over twice that reported using cms the comparison demonstrates the advantages of the proposed cms algorithm in its ability to efficiently perform hydraulic simulations which in turn yields more opportunities for cms to compute solutions to the scc problem than the ga over a given period 5 conclusions novel operational strategies are needed to minimize the severity and frequency of discolouration incidents in wdns in this paper we propose control and design for control strategies for maximizing the self cleaning capacity scc of a network this is facilitated through the operational framework of dynamically adaptive networks by extending its control capabilities to enhance water quality building on previous work we formulate an optimization problem to improve scc through the optimal placement and operation of pressure control and automatic flushing valves this results in a nonconvex minlp problem since global solvers become intractable for large problem instances we propose a tailored convex multi start heuristic referred to as cms to compute feasible solutions to the scc design for control problem cms comprises a convex relaxation and randomized valve sampling procedure which is demonstrated to effectively handle integer variables modelling valve placement given the high nonlinearity of the scc objective function cms also implements a multi start solver to compute feasible solutions to the scc control problem whilst mitigating the occurrence of poor local optima compared to an off the shelf ga implementation which employs the epanet2 2 hydraulic solver cms is shown to consistently yield good quality feasible solutions to the scc design for control problem we demonstrate the robustness of cms using networks with varying size and hydraulic complexity including a large scale operational network in the uk although the ga computed comparable solutions to cms for most numerical experiments it yielded worse quality and in some instances infeasible solutions for larger and more complex conditions furthermore we show the proposed multi start solver to compute fast and scalable solutions to the scc control problem highlighting its suitability for application in near real time control strategies altogether the proposed convex multi start algorithm represents progress towards the optimal design and control of smart water networks moving forward the proposed solution for maximizing scc needs to be integrated within a wider framework for the design and operation of wdns with dynamically adaptive control for example the objective to minimize average zone pressure and pressure variations should include the periodic transition to a self cleaning mode as formulated in this manuscript through the operation of pressure control and automatic flushing valves from an operational perspective it is also important that this control framework considers the management of unsteady hydraulics arising from such dynamic controls in relation to the scc objective function additional features should also be investigated to improve self cleaning performance these may include the impacts of flow reversals as well as a tailored approach to focus on specific areas of the network e g historical complaints these considerations combined with advances in technologies for the operation of dynamically adaptive networks

15126,the provision of self cleaning velocities has been shown to reduce the risk of discolouration in water distribution networks wdns despite these findings control implementations continue to be focused primarily on pressure and leakage management this paper considers the control of diurnal flow velocities to maximize the self cleaning capacity scc of wdns we formulate a new optimal design for control problem where locations and operational settings of pressure control and automatic flushing valves are jointly optimized the problem formulation includes a nonconvex objective function nonconvex hydraulic conservation law constraints and binary variables for modelling valve placement resulting in a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp optimization problem considering the challenges with solving nonconvex minlp problems we propose a heuristic algorithm which combines convex relaxations with domain reduction a randomization technique and a multi start strategy to compute feasible solutions we evaluate the proposed algorithm on case study networks with varying size and degrees of complexity including a large scale operational network in the uk the convex multi

moreover we demonstrate the implemented multi start strategy to be a fast and scalable method for computing feasible solutions to the nonlinear scc control problem the proposed method extends the control capabilities and benefits of dynamically adaptive networks to improve water quality in wdns graphical abstract keywords water quality discolouration self cleaning capacity design for control mixed integer nonlinear programming convex optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the management of water quality in water distribution networks wdns presents a complex operational challenge as a direct consequence of ageing and deteriorating infrastructure the mitigation of discolouration incidents is becoming one of the key operational challenges within water quality management programmes in addition to discolouration being the largest source of customer complaints vreeburg and boxall 2007 husband and boxall 2011 armand et al 2017 there is a growing body of evidence suggesting its occurrence harbours increased microbial activity liu et al 2013 2014 van der wielen and lut 2016 these conditions can accelerate biofilm growth and drastically reduce the efficacy of disinfectant residuals in protecting against waterborne illness and contaminants intrusion moreover wdns in the uk are highly sectorized and operated with fixed topology for purposes of leakage management this type of network configuration referred to as district metered areas dmas has been demonstrated to exacerbate water quality deterioration and increase the risk of discolouration incidents machell and boxall 2014 armand et al 2018 with progressively stringent water quality regulations water companies are seeking effective and cost efficient operational control strategies to reduce the risk of discolouration discolouration is primarily a consequence of resuspended material accumulated within wdns vreeburg and boxall 2007 it can materialize from the cumulative impact of the following processes boxall and dewis 2005 i the ingress and or development of particulate matter ii the accumulation of particulates at the pipe invert and or formation of cohesive layers at the pipe wall and iii a hydraulic disturbance i e trigger event which mobilizes loose particulates and generates sufficient shear stress to overcome cohesive forces at the pipe wall such hydraulic disturbances can be generated from different phenomena including pressure transients during unsteady hydraulic conditions aisopou et al 2012 apart from their origin the physical pathways of discolouration are intrinsically connected to network hydraulics in a recent study focusing on the impact of network sectorization on water quality armand et al 2018 proposed a set of surrogate hydraulic variables for discolouration risk assessment central to their findings was the role of diurnal flow velocities on particle transport and fate this connection between discolouration and hydrodynamic conditions has been supported by numerous experimental and theoretical studies see van summeren and blokker 2017 and armand et al 2018 for reviews on the topic these studies have mainly focused on the development of predictive tools for modelling particle transport and accumulation processes most notably boxall et al 2001 developed the prediction of discolouration in distribution systems podds model an empirically based numerical tool which aims to characterize cohesive layer strength at the pipe wall the podds model was later updated to account for material regeneration in furnass et al 2014 where both erosion and regeneration processes require calibration using continuous flow and turbidity data because such tools require extensive field testing and are generally limited to pipe level assessments their use in practice has not yet been widespread recognizing this limitation van summeren and blokker 2017 presented a theoretical particle transport model combining the effects of gravitational settling hydraulic shear stresses and bed load transport to complement this several laboratory based experimental studies have emerged to better understand the complex interactions between particle properties and pipe hydraulics e g sharpe et al 2019 braga et al 2020 in addition to predictive modelling research has also focused on reducing the severity and frequency of discolouration incidents through network design maintenance and control water companies in the netherlands have been conducting experimental research on the design and implementation of controls for self cleaning networks the self cleaning capacity scc of a wdn is defined as the ability for pipes to experience peak daily flow velocities above a threshold required to routinely re suspend particles and thus prevent accumulation vreeburg et al 2009 previous experimental programmes have suggested resuspension velocities on the order of 0 2 m s to 0 25 m s in distribution pipes ryan et al 2008 blokker et al 2010 this has been corroborated with a recent field study monitoring turbidity under various flow rates where an increase in turbidity levels were observed at flow velocities greater than 0 2 m s prest et al 2021 water companies in the netherlands have demonstrated successful self cleaning implementations by redesigning looped oversized networks to branched layouts with smaller diameter pipes vreeburg et al 2009 a recent study has also investigated the trade off between self cleaning velocities and fire flow capacity in north american wdns gibson et al 2019 however since the redesign of wdn infrastructure becomes cost prohibitive at scale there have been recent forays in the reconfiguration of existing network topology to promote self cleaning networks blokker et al 2012 abraham et al 2016 2018 combining uk and dutch experience abraham et al 2016 2018 formulated an optimization problem for increasing scc by redistributing flow through changes in network topology more specifically the optimization problem aimed to maximize the number of pipes with flow velocities above a self cleaning threshold through two separate strategies i optimal closure of isolation valves and ii optimal operational settings of existing pressure control valves abraham et al 2016 2018 abraham et al 2018 solved the problem of optimizing valve closures using a linear graph analysis tool following schaub et al 2014 a line outage distribution factor lodf matrix was computed to estimate the flow redistribution resulting from an outage closure of an or multiple edge to edge relation s for the optimal control problem abraham et al 2016 computed a local solution by approximating the nonsmooth objective function as a continuous nonlinear function followed by application of a tailored sequential convex programming algorithm while the benefits of the lodf solution method for optimal valve closures were demonstrated numerically using an operational network in the netherlands results from the control problem were limited to a small scale theoretical network moreover decision variables were restricted to the control of existing unidirectional pressure reducing valves prvs building on the scc optimization problem posed in abraham et al 2016 2018 this manuscript considers both control and design for control problem formulations the latter involves the simultaneous optimization of valve placement and operational settings for both existing and new control valves in addition to unidirectional prvs this work also considers bidirectional dynamic boundary valves dbvs and automatic flushing valves afvs as dynamic hydraulic controls these hydraulic controls were developed to facilitate the novel operational framework of dynamically adaptive networks wright et al 2014 ulusoy et al 2022 the resulting optimization problem is formulated as a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear program minlp both mathematical optimization and heuristic methods have been used to solve design and control problems in wdns see literature review in mala jetmarova et al 2017 for mathematical optimization methods scalability is recognized as a current limitation in solving minlp problems to global optimality koch et al 2012 sahinidis 2019 that is the implementation of global solvers become impractical for large problem cases consequently heuristic approaches are often employed to compute satisfactory feasible solutions a common heuristic method used for wdn optimization problems is the genetic algorithm ga while gas have been successfully applied to design problems the computational effort required to find solutions sufficiently close to the global optimum grows rapidly with problem size maier et al 2014 in this manuscript we develop a heuristic algorithm based on convex optimization and a multi start scheme to compute feasible solutions to the considered minlp problem to handle integer variables we first formulate a convex subproblem through polyhedral relaxations of nonconvex terms and the continuous relaxation of binary variables we subsequently employ a randomization heuristic to sample n candidate valve configurations from the set of fractional values generated from the convex subproblem we then fix binary variables for each sampled valve configuration and compute locally optimal operational settings from a nonlinear programming nlp control problem this follows the heuristic algorithm presented in pecci et al 2022 extending its application to the scc design for control problem and to the nonsmooth hazen williams friction model since the degree of nonlinearity of the scc problem is higher than the problem investigated in pecci et al 2022 we include a multi start strategy and a feasibility restoration problem for selecting starting points this step aims to minimize the risk of poor local optima as well as ensure hydraulic feasibility of the nlp control problem finally the best feasible solution is selected from the set of sampled valve configurations the proposed heuristic algorithm further increases the benefits from the implementation of dynamically adaptive networks as it expands their control capabilities to enhance water quality in wdns this manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 we formulate the design for control problem of maximizing the network scc through dynamic hydraulic controls we then present the proposed heuristic algorithm in section 3 finally in section 4 we demonstrate the performance of the developed heuristic algorithm using three case study networks with varying size and degrees of complexity to facilitate a broader discussion on heuristic approaches for the design and control of wdns we compare the results with an off the shelf ga implementation which is a common approach used in the literature 2 problem formulation we investigate a design for control problem to maximize the length of network pipes experiencing flow velocities above a given self cleaning capacity scc threshold this is achieved by installing new valves and or controlling their operational settings for this purpose our problem formulation considers three valve types as pressure and connectivity control actuators first pressure reducing valves prvs which are modelled having unidirectional flow second bidirectional dynamic boundary valves dbvs for which flow is permitted in both directions across discrete model time steps here dbvs represent the operation of remote controlled isolation valves which modulate flow and pressure between adjacent zones third automatic flushing valves afvs whose flushing rate is bounded by a set maximum value throughout this manuscript we refer to either prvs or dbvs as control valves as both have the capability of controlling pressure and are modelled at network links on the other hand afvs are simply referred to as flushing valves and are modelled at network nodes we consider operational scenarios for which prv locations have been fixed to minimize average zone pressure azp and thus decision variables include only their operational settings in comparison both locations and operational settings of dbvs and afvs are considered as decision variables the operational settings of valves are modelled as continuous variables whereas their placement location are modelled through binary variables all network links and nodes are considered as potential locations of dbvs and afvs respectively as the current stage of this work focuses on the self cleaning capacity of pipes at the dma or distribution level we do not consider storage tanks or pumping activity as forms of hydraulic control therefore we assume discrete and hydraulically independent model time steps finally it is noted that this work relies on the availability of a calibrated hydraulic model 2 1 hydraulic variables and constraints the problem considers a water distribution network wdn with n p links n n demand nodes and n 0 known head nodes e g water sources reservoirs the network is modelled as a directed graph with n p edges links and n n n 0 vertices nodes a demand driven hydraulic analysis is used to simulate steady state network hydraulics over n t discrete time steps for each time step t 1 n t known hydraulic conditions are given by vectors of nodal demands d t r n n and source hydraulic heads h t 0 r n 0 moreover vectors η t r n p and α t r n n are included to model local losses introduced by the action of control valves and operational demands at flushing valves respectively unique vectors of hydraulic states q t r n p and h t r n n are computed by solving the following steady state energy 1a and mass 1b conservation equations governing pipe flow 1a a 12 h t a 10 h t 0 ϕ q t η t 0 1b a 12 t q t d t α t 0 where a 12 r n p n n and a 10 r n p n 0 are the link node incidence matrices for demand and known head nodes respectively and the vector ϕ q t ϕ 1 q 1 t ϕ n p q n p t t models frictional head losses associated with flows q t omitting time index t ϕ j q j is defined in general form for flow conveyed across link j as 2 ϕ j q j r j q j n j 1 q j j 1 n p where the resistance coefficient r j and exponent n j both independent of time t take different values depending on the link type e g pipe or valve and on the frictional head loss model for valve links n j 2 and r j 8 k j g π 2 d j 4 with k j and d j representing the valve loss coefficient and diameter respectively larock et al 1999 in this work we apply the hazen williams hw model to characterize frictional head losses across pipe links the hw model is an explicit and empirical relationship between pipe flow and frictional head loss with n j 1 852 and r j is defined as follows for all j 1 n p 3 r j 10 67 l j c j 1 852 d j 4 871 where c is the hw coefficient a dimensionless number representing frictional characteristics l is pipe length in meters and d is pipe diameter in meters larock et al 1999 similarly explicit approximations of the darcy weisbach formula e g valiantzas 2008 could be used to model frictional head losses finally it is convenient to isolate the nonlinear term ϕ q t in 1a here we introduce a vector of auxiliary variables θ t r n p which separates the energy conservation constraint into its linear and nonlinear components as follows 4a a 12 h t a 10 h t 0 θ t η t 0 4b θ t ϕ q t 0 valve placement and operation are modelled as follows for each time step t 1 n t the continuous variable η t r n p presented in 1a models the local losses introduced by the action of control valves and the continuous variable α t r n n presented in 1b models the flow emitted at flushing valves moreover binary variables z 0 1 n p are included to model prv and dbv placement and v t 0 1 n p and v t 0 1 n p to assign their control capabilities in the positive or negative flow direction respectively across each time step t thus for all links j 1 n p and time steps t 1 n t binary variables z j v j t and v j t are set as z j 1 control valve on link j 0 no valve 5 v j t 1 control valve on link j in positive direction 0 no valve v j t 1 control valve on link j in negative direction 0 no valve analogously the placement of afvs at network nodes is modelled using binary variables y 0 1 n n defined as 6 y i 1 flushing valve placed at node i 0 no valve these binary variables are subject to the following physical and economical constraints which limit pressure control capabilities in a single direction at each time step t 7a and enforce a maximum number of control valves n v and flushing valves n f considered for installation 7b 7c 7a v j t v j t z j j 1 n p t 1 n t 7b j 1 n p z j n v 7c i 1 n n y i n f since we assume that existing prvs have fixed location and unidirectional flow z j v j t and v j t are set a priori for all time steps t 1 n t at the known set of prv links n prv 1 n p we introduce constant vectors to bound the continuous hydraulic variables and formulate big m constraints for modelling the operation of control and flushing valves for a given vector of maximum allowed velocities u max r n p and vector of link cross sectional areas a r n p let q t l a u max and q t u a u max be the vectors of lower and upper bound flows across network links at time step t respectively bounds on the auxiliary head loss vector θ t are set as θ t l ϕ q t l and θ t u ϕ q t u moreover let h t min and h t max r n n specify minimum and maximum heads at network nodes respectively the minimum head is set to a minimum regulatory pressure plus the node elevation and the maximum head is set to the largest available known source head bounds on η t for j 1 n p are then defined as follows 8a η t l j h t min i h t max k i j k 8b η t u j h t max i h t min k i j k we formulate big m constraints to model valve placement and enforce energy conservation at control valve links ensuring η t and q t act in the same direction these constraints are written as follows 9a η t diag η t u v t 0 t 1 n t 9b η t diag η t l v t 0 t 1 n t 9c q t diag q t l v t q t l t 1 n t 9d q t diag q t u v t q t u t 1 n t 9e θ t diag θ t l v t θ t l t 1 n t 9f θ t diag θ t u v t θ t u t 1 n t additionally let α t u be a known upper bound on the flushing rate at afvs the following big m constraint is then included to model flushing valve placement and enforce bounds on the continuous variable α t 10 α t diag α t u y 0 t 1 n t finally lower and upper bounds on hydraulic variables h t q t η t and θ t are set to define the feasible solution space 11a q t l q t q t u t 1 n t 11b h t min h t h t max t 1 n t 11c η t l η t η t u t 1 n t 11d 0 α t α t u t 1 n t 11e θ t l θ t θ t u t 1 n t 2 2 self cleaning capacity objective function the objective of this study is to maximize the length of network pipes satisfying the self cleaning capacity scc threshold the scc objective function is defined as the following length weighted sum over all pipes n p and hydraulic time steps n t abraham et al 2018 12 f scc 1 n t t 1 n t j 1 n p w j κ j q j t a j where a is the link cross sectional area and κ j is an indicator function which models the state of pipe velocities with reference to a minimum threshold the indicator function is described for link j as follows 13 κ j u 1 if u u j min 0 otherwise with u j min representing the threshold flow velocity at link j defined a priori see presented literature in section 1 moreover a weighting is included to normalize the length of link j to the entire network w j l j k 1 n p l k where l r n p is the vector of pipe lengths the scc objective function f scc is nonsmooth at u min resulting in unbounded gradients therefore in order to employ gradient based optimization methods the threshold function κ is approximated with a continuous sum of sigmoids or logistic function as proposed in abraham et al 2016 the sigmoidal function has positive and negative components defined by ψ j u 1 e ρ u u j min 1 and ψ j u 1 e ρ u u j min 1 respectively where ρ is a parameter which sets the sigmoid function curvature the following expression combines these sigmoid functions to approximate f scc posed in 12 14 f scc 1 n t t 1 n t j 1 n p w j ψ j q j t a j ψ j q j t a j where velocity is defined as u j t q j t a j in accordance with that reported in abraham et al 2016 we found ρ 100 provided a step like objective function whilst still being sufficiently smooth at the threshold boundaries for gradients to exist an example of the scc indicator function κ and its continuous sum of sigmoids approximation f scc are shown in fig 1 2 3 mixed integer nonlinear program the scc design for control problem aims to maximize 14 subject to hydraulic conservation laws and physical and economical valve constraints the problem formulation includes continuous variables denoted by x q h η θ α t and binary variables denoted by v v v t y and z here the objective function is replaced with its additive inverse to result in a minimization optimization problem the resulting mixed integer nonlinear program minlp is summarized by the following problem formulation minlp minimize x v y z f scc 14 subject to linear hydraulic conservation constraints 1b and 4a nonconvex hw head loss model constraints 4b big m constraints for control valve operation 9a 9f big m constraints for flushing valve operation 10 physical and economical valve constraints 7a 7c x q 11a 11e v 0 1 2 n p n t y 0 1 n n z 0 1 n p where q is a rectangle representing upper and lower bounds for the continuous decision variables the continuous decision variables are defined as q q t t 1 n t h h t t 1 n t η η t t 1 n t θ θ t t 1 n t and α α t t 1 n t the binary decision variables varying with time step t are defined as v v t t 1 n t and v v t t 1 n t problem minlp has n t 3 n p 2 n n continuous variables 2 n t n p n p n n binary variables and 2 n t n p nonconvex terms observe that the problem grows rapidly with the size of the considered wdn see table 1 making it a difficult nonconvex minlp problem to solve to overcome these challenges we develop a convex heuristic to compute feasible solutions to problem minlp the following section describes the solution algorithm and its implementation details 3 solution method the proposed solution algorithm combines convex relaxations with a randomization heuristic and multi start solver to compute feasible solutions to problem minlp first we formulate convex relaxations of problem minlp which yield a linear programming lp subproblem here the nonconvex scc objective function 12 and nonconvex energy conservation constraints 4b are relaxed using polyhedral envelopes and a continuous relaxation is applied to binary decision variables we also include a domain reduction step where the resulting convex subproblem is tightened using both model decomposition and optimization based bound tightening obbt techniques then a randomization heuristic uses the fractional valve placement values from the convex subproblem solution to form nonlinear programming nlp control problems local solutions to these nlp problems are computed using a strictly feasible sequential convex programming sfscp solver we also implement a multi start strategy which includes an optimization based feasibility restoration problem to ensure hydraulic feasibility of the starting points fig 2 offers a detailed overview of the solution method referred to as the convex multi start cms algorithm the algorithm steps and overall implementation details are provided in the following subsections 3 1 convex relaxation there are two sources of nonlinear nonconvexity that make problem minlp difficult to solve these are the scc objective function f scc 14 and the hw head loss model ϕ in equality constraint 4b one approach to overcome nonconvexity is through polyhedral relaxations which can be formulated as linear constraints and thus efficiently handled by state of the art linear solvers since the resulting mixed integer linear program milp may still have a large number of binary variables it is convenient to apply a continuous relaxation to binary variables in addition to the computational advantages a continuous relaxation increases the search space for the set of optimal binary variables here we implement the aforementioned relaxation techniques to formulate a convex subproblem of problem minlp with its solution forming the basis of the heuristic algorithm we first relax the nonconvex objective function in 14 with a linear outer approximation let σ t r n p and σ t r n p be vectors of auxiliary variables introduced to model the positive ψ and negative ψ sigmoid functions respectively the objective function f scc is then reformulated as the following set of inequality constraints 15a σ t ψ q t a t 1 n t 15b σ t ψ q t a t 1 n t to ensure equivalence with 14 the scc objective function becomes 16 f scc 1 n t t 1 n t j 1 n p w j σ j t σ j t we construct concave envelopes for the positive ψ and negative ψ components of f scc this follows the methodology presented in udell and boyd 2014 2016 for sigmoidal functions resulting in piecewise linear relaxations these relaxations are written as the following constraint 17 s t q t t t σ t s t t 1 n t where matrices s t s t s t t and t t t t t t t and vector s t s t s t t depend on flow velocity bounds u t l q t l a and u t u q t u a as well as the sigmoid function parameters a detailed derivation of these relaxations is provided in appendix a 1 moreover an example of the implemented relaxation is illustrated in fig 3 a with ψ ˆ denoting the set of linear relaxations we then implement polyhedral relaxations for the hw head loss model ϕ in equality constraint 4b this builds on the relaxation methods for monomials of odd degree introduced by liberti and pantelides 2003 by formulating polyhedral relaxations for the hw head loss model similar to 17 the formulated relaxations are written as the following linear constraint 18 r t q t e t θ t r t t 1 n t where matrices r t and e t and vector r t are derived from flow bounds q t l and q t u and the hw model parameters further details are presented in appendix a 2 and an example of the implemented relaxation is illustrated in fig 3 b with the polyhedral relaxation denoted by ϕ ˆ lastly we implement the continuous relaxation of binary variables v y and z these are combined with continuous decision variables x defined in problem minlp and the continuous auxiliary variables associated with the f scc inequality constraints 15a and 15b denoted by σ σ σ the resulting convex relaxation of problem minlp is represented by the following lp subproblem lp minimize x v y z σ f scc reformulated in 16 subject to linear relaxations of hw head loss model constraints 18 linear relaxations of ψ and ψ sigmoid functions 17 linear hydraulic conservation constraints 1b and 4a big m constraints for control valve operation 9a 9f big m constraints for flushing valve operation 10 physical and economical valve constraints 7a 7c x q 11a 11e σ 0 1 2 n p n t v 0 1 2 n p n t y 0 1 n n z 0 1 n p the optimal value to subproblem lp yields a lower bound to the original nonconvex problem minlp in particular vectors y r n n and z r n p of continuous variables for valve placement can be interpreted as the probability distribution from which random samples are drawn to solve the nlp control problem moreover the vector η r n p from subproblem lp is used as one of m starting points in the multi start strategy these steps are discussed in the subsequent sections furthermore we implement a domain reduction procedure to reduce the bound intervals and thus strengthen the convex relaxations formulated for subproblem lp the main procedure implemented is an optimization based bound tightening obbt algorithm belotti et al 2009 the obbt algorithm solves a series of lp optimization problems with objective functions set to both maximize and minimize link flow this is augmented with a forest core decomposition scheme to reduce the number of flow variables whose bounds are tightened simpson et al 2014 the forest of a wdn comprises the disjoint union of all outer branch or tree components deuerlein 2008 the core represents the set of looped or block graphs which contain the roots of all forest trees following pecci et al 2019 we only perform bound tightening on the set of core links we include pseudocode for the obbt algorithm in appendix b 3 2 randomization heuristic in searching for a good quality local solution to problem minlp we employ a randomization heuristic to sample candidate valve configurations here the fractional values of y r n n and z r n p yielded from the solution to subproblem lp define a discrete probability distribution for the index sets 1 n n and 1 n p respectively we propose to randomly sample candidate pressure control n v and flushing n f valve configurations from the respective probability distributions over n sampling trials this creates sampled vectors of binary variables y i 1 n 0 1 n n and z i 1 n 0 1 n p from which a local solution to the nlp control problem is obtained for each trial i 1 n see section 3 3 to avoid redundant valve configurations we store binary values from each trial in the set p r n n v n f checking its intersection with y i z i before fixing valve placement values and proceeding to the nlp control problem pseudocode for the implemented randomization heuristic is detailed in algorithm 1 3 3 multi start solver the final component of the cms solution algorithm concerns the optimization of valve settings this control problem is formulated to compute locally optimal operational settings for each candidate valve configuration generated from the randomization heuristic because the objective function in problem minlp is highly nonlinear we implement a strategy to use multiple starting points in order to avoid getting trapped in poor local optima this includes a feasibility restoration subproblem to ensure hydraulically feasible starting points are passed to the nlp solver we refer to the overall solution process as the multi start solver which has steps highlighted by the process diagram shown in fig 4 3 3 1 strictly feasible sequential convex programming solver with the placement of dbvs and afvs from the set of sampled configurations 1 n we then fix binary flow direction variables v t and v t at dbv locations for each time step t 1 n t this yields a nonconvex nlp problem with continuous decision variables denoted by x q h η α t moreover big m constraints for pressure control and flushing valve operations found in problem minlp are reformulated as variable bounds these bounds are derived on the basis of the fixed binary variables the corresponding nlp control problem is formulated as follows nlp minimize x f scc 14 subject to hydraulic conservation constraints 1a and 1b x q where q represents the upper and lower variable bounds modified to account for directional constraints enforced by the fixed binary variables since the focus of this study is at the dma or distribution level which in practice limits the number of installed dbvs for consideration we use an enumeration approach to test all dbv flow direction combinations for v t and v t this approach was deemed appropriate on the basis of the relatively small computational cpu times recorded in section 4 for example the numerical experiment corresponding to the maximum number of installed dbvs on the largest network tested in this study see section 4 1 for details resulted in a cpu time of less than five minutes this cpu time is well within an assumed one hour limit for application in control strategies we acknowledge however that this assumption warrants re evaluation for system wide studies which inevitably consider a larger set of control valves here a total of t 2 n dbv control problems are solved to find the best dbv direction combination at each time step t 1 n t see fig 4 in this work we use the strictly feasible sequential convex programming sfscp method outlined in wright et al 2015 for solving a local optima to problem nlp the sfscp solver also used to optimize scc control valve settings in abraham et al 2016 is implemented because of its reliable convergence properties namely its strict feasibility requirement for each iterate of the optimization process the sfscp solver linearizes the objective function and nonlinear hydraulic conservation constraints in problem nlp from which a sequence of linear programs can be efficiently solved linear approximations are formulated using first order taylor expansions around the point x k q k h k η k α k t let f f scc and the hydraulic conservation equality constraints 1a and 1b be denoted by g it follows that 19 f x f x k f q x k q q k and 20 g x g x k g q x k q q k g η x k η η k g α x k α α k are the linearized expressions used to formulate a convex subproblem for each iterate k this subproblem computes step directions d η k and d α k at point x k for pressure control and flushing valve operational variables respectively following wright et al 2015 a strictly feasible line search method is implemented to guarantee an improvement in objective function whilst ensuring hydraulic feasibility of the computed local optima we define the hydraulically feasible region by the set 21 f x r n p n n n v n f x satisfies constraints 1a 1b and variable bounds q the null space solver proposed in abraham and stoianov 2015 is used to solve hydraulic states q k 1 and h k 1 for the optimal controls obtained at iterate k if x k f then the optimization process moves to the next iterate k k 1 otherwise a backtracking procedure is implemented to reduce d η k and d α k until hydraulic feasibility is achieved termination of the sfscp solver is triggered when relative improvements in the objective function are below a set tolerance ϵ tol the sfscp solver steps are detailed in pseudocode presented in appendix c wright et al 2015 moreover the subsequent section describes a multi start strategy for selecting feasible starting points x 0 to be passed to the sfscp solver for completeness we provide a brief discussion on the performance comparison with state of the art nonlinear solver ipopt this is included as many large scale wdn optimization studies have used ipopt to compute locally optimal solutions for network controls e g pecci et al 2019 ulusoy et al 2020 nerantzis and stoianov 2022 most of these studies however have applied a quadratic approximation qa to model the head loss function ψ as the nonsmooth hw formula presents challenges for ipopt namely that its hessian is unbounded at the origin preliminary efforts to introduce a qa model for the current scc problem resulted in large inaccuracies compared to the hw model this was expected as the current study aims to maximize pipe flow velocities which increases the qa model error since a larger maximum flow value is required pecci et al 2017 equation 21 therefore we tested ipopt using the hw model and relied on its feasibility restoration scheme to mitigate potential errors infeasibility errors were observed for the larger case study network when using the ipopt solver ultimately leading to the sfscp solver as the more reliable and robust option for the current scc control problem the sfscp and ipopt solver comparison is detailed in appendix d 3 3 2 multi start strategy as highlighted in fig 4 a multi start strategy is implemented to find good quality local optima to problem nlp here we initialize starting points x 0 for multiple initial conditions j 1 m which are sequentially passed to the sfscp solver starting points are formed by simulating hydraulic states for different initial control valve settings η 0 for initial condition j 1 we set η j 1 0 equal to the control valve settings resulting from subproblem lp otherwise η j 2 m 0 is randomly generated between the previously set lower and upper η bounds note that initial flushing operations are set as α 0 0 for all initial conditions j 1 m since the initial control conditions do not guarantee a solution in the hydraulically feasible region we also include a feasibility restoration step that is if starting point x j 0 f for all j 1 m feasibility is restored through the solution to the following nlp optimization problem fr minimize x η η 0 2 2 subject to hydraulic conservation constraints 1a and 1b x q where the objective function is set to minimize the squared ℓ 2 norm between the vector of initial settings η 0 and settings η which produce a hydraulically feasible starting point problem fr is solved using the nonlinear ipopt solver apart from cases where the fixed dbv directions strictly cannot facilitate a hydraulically feasible solution we did not encounter infeasibility errors when using ipopt as the nlp solver for problem fr the discussion in appendix d suggests that the nonconvexity of the scc objective function in problem nlp is a key factor for the observed infeasibility issues 4 numerical experiments and discussion we evaluate the scc design for control problem using the proposed cms solution algorithm since cms is a heuristic we also compare its performance with an off the shelf ga implementation which is a common heuristic method for solving wdn design problems this section is organized as follows first in section 4 1 we describe the problem parameters case study networks and computational resources used to carry out the numerical experiments next section 4 2 discusses the results obtained when solving the control only subproblem to problem minlp where valves locations are fixed in this case operational settings of existing prv and dbv if applicable valve configurations are optimized to maximize self cleaning conditions we then investigate the solution to the design for control problem in section 4 3 where the placement and operation of both pressure control and flushing valves are considered to improve scc performance 4 1 computational setup all numerical experiments were performed in matlab r2021b 64 bit for microsoft windows 11 installed on a 2 50 ghz intel r core tm i9 11900h cpu with 8 cores and 32 0 gb of memory ram the lp problems involved in the convex relaxation obbt algorithm and sfscp solver were solved using gurobi v9 5 0 gurobi optimization 2022 accessed via its matlab interface with the exception of large problem cases which had solver parameters e g numericfocus crossover and presolve modified to deal with numerical issues gurobi s default parameters were applied local solutions to the nlp feasibility restoration problems were solved using the state of the art interior point solver ipopt v3 12 19 wächter and biegler 2006 ipopt was accessed in matlab via the opti toolbox interface currie et al 2012 and was implemented passing the exact jacobian and hessian matrices as inputs to the solver the single objective ga was implemented using matlab s off the shelf global optimization toolbox with its default solver parameters e g population size 100 crossover fraction 0 8 function tolerance 1 e 6 for each ga fitness evaluation epanet2 2 rossman et al 2020 hydraulic solver was accessed via the epanet matlab toolkit interface eliades et al 2016 we set maximum time limits for the ga implementation associated with control and design for control problems of 6 and 12 h respectively furthermore matlab s parallel computing toolbox was employed with eight local workers to speed up code in the obbt algorithm and multi start solver finally network hydraulics were computed within cms using the null space method proposed in abraham and stoianov 2015 we evaluated the performance of the solution methods using three case study networks pescara modena and bwflnet problem data for each network including the size of the resulting minlp optimization problems are summarized in table 1 moreover network layouts are shown in fig 5 pescara and modena are skeletonized versions of wdns in medium sized italian cities published by bragalli et al 2012 for benchmarking purposes since these are theoretical networks unidirectional prvs were placed at the outlet of each reservoir to represent existing valve configurations bwflnet is a large scale operational network representing an area of the city of bristol s wdn located in southwest england it currently operates with dynamically controlled prv and bidirectional dbv valves which modulate flow and pressure between adjacent zones to minimize azp bwflnet s current control valve configuration was applied to model existing conditions for more details on bwflnet see wright et al 2014 and waldron et al 2020 moreover existing kept shut boundary valves were opened in order to test the full capabilities of the proposed solution algorithm observe that the evaluated case study networks vary by size network connectivity and demand scenarios enabling the proposed cms algorithm to be tested on a range of network conditions pescara and modena are relatively small scale looped networks with theoretical and quite large demands bwflnet on the other hand represents a larger scale operational network having a branched structure and demands representing water consumption in a typical urban area in the uk for reference we note that the size of the resulting minlp optimization problems for bwflnet are at the upper end of the range reported in the minlplib database vigerske 2022 minlplib is a widely used library of benchmarking minlp problem instances the known input parameters for problem minlp were selected as follows for the scc objective function f scc 14 we set the sigmoid function curvature parameter ρ to 50 unless stated otherwise on the basis of the reviewed literature in section 1 the self cleaning velocity threshold u j min was set to 0 2 m s for all j 1 n p since we are concerned with the redistribution of peak flows we define four discrete hydraulic time steps n t to represent peak demand scenarios within a typical diurnal demand profile these were split between the morning and evening high demand periods and were unique to each case study in relation to hydraulic feasibility constraints 11b we applied a minimum regulatory pressure head of 15 m uk regulations at all nonzero demand nodes for all case study networks moreover the upper bound for flushing valve demands α u shown in constraint 11d was set to 25 l s this value was selected with reference to the recommended fire flow capacity at fire hydrants in the uk local government association and water uk 2007 for the design for control problem we evaluated the placement and operation of n v 1 3 bidirectional dbvs and n f 0 3 afvs hence for each network a total of 12 valve configurations were considered the number of randomization trials n in algorithm 1 was set to the minimum of valve configuration combinations generated from the continuous relaxation in subproblem lp or a maximum trial count maximum trial counts were set to n 50 for pescara and modena and n 100 for bwflnet finally the number of initial conditions tested in the multi start scheme fig 4 was set to m 5 4 2 existing valve configuration results we first investigated improvements to scc performance achieved by optimizing the operational settings of existing pressure control valve configurations this was considered a logical initial step as the implementation scc specific controls requires no additional capital investment and can thus be readily applied as discussed previously the theoretical case study networks pescara and modena were assumed to have prvs assigned at each link leaving a source node e g reservoir on the other hand bwflnet had its existing operational valve configuration assigned a subproblem of problem minlp was then formulated where binary variables z were fixed for the known control valve locations and directional variables v and v were set free for networks with existing dbv locations e g bwflnet valve control settings and dbv directions were then optimized over the four peak demand periods using the multi start strategy described in section 3 3 the results are reported in fig 6 through cumulative distribution plots of maximum flow velocities weighted by pipe length these plots offer a comparison between network scc conditions with and without optimized controls considering f scc is an approximation of the actual self cleaning problem we also include a sensitivity analysis on the sigmoid curvature parameter ρ to test changes in relative performance moreover table 2 summarizes the control problem results obtained with both the multi start solver and the ga implementation described in section 4 1 we set a maximum time limit of one hour for the off the shelf ga solver which was assumed to reflect an upper bound for the practical application of control problems first fig 6 suggests that pressure modulation at existing control valves can significantly improve scc conditions in the tested looped networks this is highlighted by the numerical results for modena where the length of pipe experiencing self cleaning velocities increased from approximately 60 to 95 for peak demand conditions in contrast results for bwflnet which has limited connectivity due to its branched structure showed only modest improvements these results were expected as the reduced inter connectivity in bwflnet leads to pipe flows being primarily a function of downstream demands for this reason section 4 3 presents the results for a design for control problem where we consider the installation of additional dbvs and flushing valves which aim to improve self cleaning conditions in branched networks furthermore we report modest changes in the flow velocity profiles for the ρ sensitivity analysis see fig 6 since no pattern can be discerned between ρ values we conclude ρ 50 to be suitable for the design for control numerical experiments discussed in the subsequent section as shown in table 2 the multi start solver computes solutions that are similar to those obtained by the ga but at a fraction of the computational effort while the ga consistently reaches the set time limit of one hour the longest computational time experienced by the multi start solver is equal to 200 s this is important as we are considering an optimal control problem which may need to be solved in near real time the much longer cpu time required by the ga is likely due to the fact that it facilitates a search for the globally optimal solution thus for highly nonlinear optimization problems like that formulated for the current scc problem the ga retains a large solution space so as to avoid exclusion of the global optimum this characteristic has been recognized as a challenge when using gas for wdn control problems especially when dealing with problems having a large number and range of free continuous variables maier et al 2014 ulusoy et al 2022 furthermore we note that the ga implementation used in this work applies default parameters see section 4 1 and loads an external hydraulic solver epanet2 2 at each fitness evaluation this off the shelf implementation is also likely to contribute to the relatively large cpu times extending the time limit to nearly 48 h the ga converges to a solution with an scc value of approximately 24 8 for bwflnet this minimal performance gain suggests that the one hour time limit is sufficient for the scc control problem comparison in addition table 2 provides a comparison of average zone pressure azp performance between control settings optimized for azp and scc respectively note that the azp objective function is formulated as a weighted sum of nodal pressures averaged over n t time steps wright et al 2015 equation 4 in accordance with findings in abraham et al 2016 we found a clear trade off between the optimization of control settings for the scc and azp objectives for example a 16 2 m difference in azp was recorded for bwflnet while this trade off is not discussed further in the current study we acknowledge the importance of having scc and azp objectives among others coexist in an overall operational network control strategy furthermore the transition between such operational objectives may provoke large variations in hydraulic conditions e g pressure transients and should thus be managed accordingly future work is needed to investigate these considerations for the implementation of dynamically adaptive control strategies in operational wdns 4 3 design for control results this section considers the scc design for control problem for optimal placement and control of new bidirectional dbvs and afvs we test a total of 12 valve configurations for each case study network where experiment 1 corresponds to n v 1 and n f 0 and experiment 12 corresponds to n v 3 and n f 3 as stated in section 4 1 each experiment uses hydraulic conditions from four peak demand conditions across a typical diurnal demand profile moreover with the exception of existing dbvs in bwflnet the design for control numerical experiments include the existing prv configurations shown in fig 5 which were used for the optimal control subproblem in section 4 2 we investigate the solution of problem minlp using three methods i the proposed convex multi start heuristic cms ii cms with domain reduction as described in section 3 1 referred to as cms dr and iii an off the shelf ga implementation coupled with the epanet2 2 hydraulic solver note that we set the following time limits for the ga on the basis of that recorded using cms 6 h for pescara and modena and 12 h for bwflnet the scc objective function results and corresponding cpu times from each solution method are shown in fig 7 for the considered set of numerical experiments figs 7 a 7 c and 7 e show that cms finds feasible solutions for all numerical experiments to highlight the improvements in scc we include a solid black line to represent initial hydraulic conditions and a dashed black line to report the scc values obtained by optimally controlling existing valves as done in section 4 2 while scc improvements are experienced for all case studies we observe significant relative improvements compared with the control only solution for bwflnet as previously discussed in section 4 2 the scc improvements for bwflnet can be attributed to the deployment of afvs which facilitate controlled flushing demands at the optimally selected locations moreover the additional dbvs act to further branch the network thereby enhancing self cleaning velocities the increase in scc is investigated further through network velocity plots shown in fig 8 here we compare maximum pipe velocities resulting from initial hydraulics i e no control and as an example the design for control solution corresponding to n v 2 and n f 3 figs 8 b 8 d and 8 f clearly indicate a net increase in the overall extent of the network experiencing self cleaning velocities from optimal valve controls we observe optimal afv placement to be near the network periphery in pescara and bwflnet these results are intuitive as flushing demands facilitate self cleaning velocities in areas that otherwise convey relatively low flow in contrast afvs are concentrated near a source node in modena this is a result of existing prvs modulating inlet pressure to shift the hydraulic balance point or interface between source nodes in particular the flow rates illustrated in fig 8 d suggest that source nodes near the top of the network supply a greater proportion of the demand additionally we note that the optimal dbv locations which increase self cleaning velocities by redistributing flow paths may result in sub optimal conditions for controlling network pressure since we do not explicitly consider pressure management in the scc problem formulation the integration of self cleaning and pressure management objectives should be a focus of future work lastly fig 8 f highlights the limited influence of control features for the more branched bwflnet network although the placement and operation of afvs indeed improve self cleaning hydraulic conditions these are generally limited to direct upstream flow paths in the case where self cleaning velocities are sought for specific areas of the network e g historical complaints the scc objective function can be modified to focus on a user defined subset of pipes in comparing the two implementations of cms with and without domain reduction we observe the former to yield better quality feasible solutions this can be attributed to the tighter relaxations resulting from domain reduction in fact tighter relaxations may generate fractional valve placement values closer to the feasible domain and therefore more likely to result in better quality design for control solutions in addition the solution of subproblem lp with tighter relaxations computes control valve settings η that are closer to the feasible set and the global optimum as described in section 3 3 these η values are used as a starting point for the multi start solver hence we expect these settings to be advantageous in finding a better solution nonetheless the obbt algorithm comes at an increase in computational effort figs 7 b 7 d and 7 f compare cpu times across numerical experiments for each solution method although the increase in cpu times are modest for the smaller networks obbt does not scale well for the larger operational network for example the increase in cpu time reported for bwflnet was at minimum approximately 50 when obbt was applied even though problem minlp is considered a design problem and is thus solved offline obbt can become impractical for large scale and highly interconnected networks pecci et al 2022 future work should investigate speed improvements to obbt or the implementation of tighter relaxations for problem minlp finally we compare design for control solutions computed by cms with an off the shelf ga implementation as described in section 4 1 the epanet2 2 hydraulic solver was employed within the ga s fitness function to test hydraulic feasibility of the generated solutions the solution was deemed feasible when the epanet2 2 solver successfully converged and when the entire set of pressure heads across all time steps met the minimum pressure constraint otherwise hydraulically infeasible solutions were discarded moreover pressure set points at control valves were bounded by the maximum head difference across the network i e reservoir level less minimum node elevation in fig 7 a the ga solution is shown to produce comparable if not better scc results for pescara than cms dr this is not surprising as the stochastic search procedure employed by the ga is well suited for highly nonlinear optimization problems such as the current scc objective function although the ga did not satisfy its termination criterion within the prescribed time limit six hours the relatively small number of free continuous variables in pescara e g pressure set points and flushing rates see table 1 enabled the computation of good quality feasible solutions on the other hand the ga was unable to find feasible solutions for numerous problem instances using modena this was particularly evident for experiments including the design and control of afvs which result in higher frictional losses materializing from flushing demands note that infeasibility is indicated by an scc value of zero in fig 7 c additional ga experiments revealed such infeasibility issues to be linked to the relatively small range in hydraulically feasible pressures found in modena with the minimum regulatory pressure head relaxed from 15 m to 0 m i e h min set to node elevations the ga found feasible solutions comparable to cms dr these results highlight the efficacy of the proposed convex heuristic for a wider range of network conditions for bwflnet cms dr finds similar quality design for control solutions to the ga however as observed in modena cms dr is shown to consistently outperform the ga for experiments considering the implementation of afvs in light of the comparison between solution methods we investigated the computational overhead of the ga fitness function as configured in this study using the epanet matlab toolkit this is a cumbersome process and one which directly impacts the number of fitness evaluations performed by the ga by comparison cms requires much less overhead from loading external software and computes hydraulic states via an efficient null space solver table 3 compares the number of epanet2 2 solver calls for the 12 hour time limit with the null space solver calls in cms the comparison uses select design for control experiments for the bwflnet case study network with the exception of experiment 1 table 3 reports the number of epanet2 2 solver calls to be significantly less than the hydraulic simulations recorded in cms this identifies the hydraulic analysis as a bottleneck in the overall ga search procedure particularly since its cpu times are over twice that reported using cms the comparison demonstrates the advantages of the proposed cms algorithm in its ability to efficiently perform hydraulic simulations which in turn yields more opportunities for cms to compute solutions to the scc problem than the ga over a given period 5 conclusions novel operational strategies are needed to minimize the severity and frequency of discolouration incidents in wdns in this paper we propose control and design for control strategies for maximizing the self cleaning capacity scc of a network this is facilitated through the operational framework of dynamically adaptive networks by extending its control capabilities to enhance water quality building on previous work we formulate an optimization problem to improve scc through the optimal placement and operation of pressure control and automatic flushing valves this results in a nonconvex minlp problem since global solvers become intractable for large problem instances we propose a tailored convex multi start heuristic referred to as cms to compute feasible solutions to the scc design for control problem cms comprises a convex relaxation and randomized valve sampling procedure which is demonstrated to effectively handle integer variables modelling valve placement given the high nonlinearity of the scc objective function cms also implements a multi start solver to compute feasible solutions to the scc control problem whilst mitigating the occurrence of poor local optima compared to an off the shelf ga implementation which employs the epanet2 2 hydraulic solver cms is shown to consistently yield good quality feasible solutions to the scc design for control problem we demonstrate the robustness of cms using networks with varying size and hydraulic complexity including a large scale operational network in the uk although the ga computed comparable solutions to cms for most numerical experiments it yielded worse quality and in some instances infeasible solutions for larger and more complex conditions furthermore we show the proposed multi start solver to compute fast and scalable solutions to the scc control problem highlighting its suitability for application in near real time control strategies altogether the proposed convex multi start algorithm represents progress towards the optimal design and control of smart water networks moving forward the proposed solution for maximizing scc needs to be integrated within a wider framework for the design and operation of wdns with dynamically adaptive control for example the objective to minimize average zone pressure and pressure variations should include the periodic transition to a self cleaning mode as formulated in this manuscript through the operation of pressure control and automatic flushing valves from an operational perspective it is also important that this control framework considers the management of unsteady hydraulics arising from such dynamic controls in relation to the scc objective function additional features should also be investigated to improve self cleaning performance these may include the impacts of flow reversals as well as a tailored approach to focus on specific areas of the network e g historical complaints these considerations combined with advances in technologies for the operation of dynamically adaptive networks

15127,harmful algal blooms habs have been increasing in frequency areal extent and duration due to the large increase in nutrient inputs from land based sources to coastal seas and cause significant economic losses in this study we used the watershed coast continuum concept to explore the effects of land based nutrient pollution on hab development in the eastern chinese coastal seas eccs results from the coupling of a watershed nutrient model and a coast hydrodynamic biogeochemical model show that between the 1980s and 2000s the risk of diatom blooms and dinoflagellate blooms increased by 158

produce toxins that bioaccumulate in seafood and can cause massive fish kills and or cause ecological damage through the development of hypoxia or anoxia and other habitat alterations with a series of important negative consequences for human health economy society and recreation after more than 20 years of research efforts since the first workshop of the global ecology and oceanography of harmful algal blooms geohab group in 1998 cullen 1998 there is a growing consensus that coastal eutrophication combined with the climate change drives the worldwide increasing abundance frequency and geographic extent of habs glibert 2017 glibert and burford 2017 gobler 2020 nutrient fluxes of nitrogen n and phosphorus p to the global coastal ocean via river runoff groundwater discharge and

financial losses in aquaculture and tourism during the past 40 years yan et al 2022 however the subsequent decrease of hab frequency in the chinese coastal seas is difficult to explain in view of the continued high level of nutrient pollution parallel to the increasing frequency of hab occurrences the dominant hab species changed and became more diversified a shift of dominant hab species from diatoms to dinoflagellate in the east china sea ecs occurred since 2000 zhou et al 2022 freshwater from the changjiang river the taiwan warm current and a branch of the kuroshio current complicate the dynamics of hydrology in the ecs and the situation is even more complex due to conspiring environmental changes such as climate warming and nutrient loading xiao et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 in addition

group n p and e representing communities more sensitive to n p and light limitation respectively the biomass of non diatoms is the sum of flagellates dinoflagellates and phaeocystis bloom does not include the biomass of a anophagefferens to assess the risk of a anophagefferens blooms we developed a post processing tool to map the instant distribution of potential habitat for a anophagefferens

anophagefferens blooms two different ways have been applied to the assessment of hab risk caused by micro plankton diatoms flagellates dinoflagellates pheaocystis and pico plankton a anophagefferens using the model results the risk of micro plankton blooms can be assessed directly based on its biomass a chlorophyll a chl value equal to 10 µg was used as the threshold for a potential risk of micro plankton blooms smith and bernard 2020 stumpf et al 2003 for each grid cell the monthly averaged chl sum of all species exceeding this threshold represents a risk of micro plankton blooms in that month the hab risk area for each month is calculated from the number of grid cells with potential risk and the grid size fig 4a b for each grid cell the cumulative frequency of risk is defined as the number of months per year decade that a risk is calculated the distribution of hab risk in each decade is based on the cumulative frequency figs 5 and 6 instead of using the simulated biomass the potential risk of a anophagefferens is mapped by the distributions of environmental parameters extracted from the model output and their corresponding range suitable for a anophagefferens blooms these environmental parameters include light intensity temperature salinity and nutrient concentrations the criteria for the suitability of a anophagefferens blooms were obtained from wang et al 2022a table s3 at a certain point of time the potential risk of a anophagefferens blooms is determined if grid cells where all environmental parameters are within these criteria table s3 fig s5 unlike micro plankton a anophagefferens prefers to utilize organic nutrients when the availability of dissolved inorganic nutrients is sufficient for micro plankton growth a anophagefferens are outcompeted boneillo and mulholland 2014 gobler et al 2005 situations where inorganic nutrients in the water column are nearly depleted and more organic nutrients become available from micro phytoplankton decomposition are beneficial to a anophagefferens gobler et al 2005 lomas et al 1996 ou et al 2018 yao et al 2019 therefore the maximum din and dip and minimum dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop concentrations define the chemical criteria for this picoplankton species table s3 2 4 data for model validation annual average nutrients concentrations in the

concentrations during winter resulted in rmse values of 36 for din and 21 for dip fig 3 3 2 temporal variation of the hab risk the model predicted a total cumulative area of 117 103 km2 with hab risk from 1980 to 2010 the hab risk area increased from 2 103 km2 yr 1 in the 1980s to 6 103 km2 yr 1 in the 2000s fig 4 a the seasonal distribution of hab risk area shifted from june in the 1980s to march july in the 2000s fig 4b compared to the 1990s most of the increase in the hab risk area occurred in spring march april and may during the period 1980 2010 tn and tp in the eccs water increased by 62 and 27 respectively while si decreased by 10 from the highest value in 1985 to 2010 the tn tp molar ratio increased from around 12 in 1980 to 16 in 2010 fig 4d while the si tn molar ratio decreased from 6 to 3 5 in the beginning of the 1980s diatoms were the dominant species in primary production fig 4c the composition of the primary producers showed a decreasing proportion of diatoms and increasing proportion of non diatoms and in the 2000s the contributions of diatoms and non diatoms to primary production were equal 3 3 spatial distribution of harmful algal bloom risk the outcomes of the modelled distribution of hab risk over the three decades 1980s 1990s and 2000s are compared with the distribution of reported hab events in the corresponding time period fig 5 in general the hab risk distributions match well with the reported bloom events for same time period although hab risk areas are underestimated in the south of the changjiang estuary in the 1980s hab risk mainly occurred in the southern and northern parts of the bohai sea as well as small areas in the changjiang estuary fig 5a in the 2000s there was hab risk in almost all areas near the coastline of the eccs a shift from the southern to the middle part in the bohai sea expansion in the changjiang estuary and further expansion offshore in the south yellow sea after the 1990s fig 5b c by evaluating the hab risk dominated by diatoms and dinoflagellates separately fig 6 the results show that compared to the 1990s the risk of diatom blooms in the bohai sea spread from south to the middle and decreased in the 2000s fig 6a c the risk of diatom blooms in the yellow sea and east china sea expanded from scattered areas in the nearshore region close to the changjiang estuary in the 1980s and 1990s to the nearshore area of the whole south yellow sea and changjiang estuary in the 2000s compared to the 1980s the risk of diatom blooms for the whole domain increased by 74 in 1990s and by 158 in the 2000s the risk of dinoflagellate blooms increased by 51 and 127 from the 1980s to 1990s and 2000s respectively fig 6d f in the 1980s the distribution of dinoflagellate hab risk in the 1980s is similar to that of diatoms after the 1980s the risk of dinoflagellate blooms not only overlapped the area with diatom bloom risk but also formed two new zones with dinoflagellate bloom risk in the offshore area in the south yellow sea and the changjiang estuary regarding a anophagefferens the model results indicate no risk of a anophagefferens blooms in 2000 and 2005 fig 7 a as not all abiotic conditions meet the requirements for blooms fig 7a b the model results for 2010 indicate that all parameters matched the suitability envelopes for a anophagefferens bloom in two zones in the bohai sea fig 7c in order to analyze which parameter is the primary limitation for the risk of a anophagefferens blooms the spatial distribution of compliance with a anophagefferens blooms requirements are shown in fig s5 physical conditions and din concentration show no restriction while dip don and dop concentrations are the primary limitations for a anophagefferens blooms fig s5 between july 2000 and july 2005 the increases of don and dop concentrations in the bohai sea and the northwest of north yellow sea provided the suitable organic nutrient condition for a anophagefferens blooms while the dip concentration was not within the criteria range table s3 in july 2010 the dip concentration in the bohai sea was within this range which leads to suitable conditions for the development of a anophagefferens with respect to all 7 considered parameters fig s5 fig 7c 3 4 nearshore offshore gradients nutrient concentrations molar tn tp ratios and molar din dip ratios increase from deep towards shallow waters fig 8 in the zone with water depths less than 20 m din increased by more than 80 between 1980 and 2010 and dip by 16 39 fig 8 consequently the din dip and tn tp ratios also increased in the 1980s only areas with water depths 10 m showed din dip ratios 16 but in the 1990s and 2000s this expanded to areas with water depths up to 40 m fig 8 the relative dip increase between 1980 and 2010 was less significant and its variation 81 97 with water depth from 160 m to 5 m was smaller than that of din 332 414 however the dop concentration was much higher in areas with shallow waters than in areas with deeper waters in areas with deep waters 80 m dop made up 28 of tp and 40 in shallow waters 20 m in the areas with waters shallower than 10 m dinoflagellates were the dominant species table 1 while in the areas with waters deeper than 80 m diatoms were dominant dinoflagellate biomass in areas with water 5 m deep was more than 13 times larger than that in areas with waters deeper than 160 m which was a much larger difference than that for diatom biomass 4 times table 1 4 discussion 4 1 responses of harmful algal bloom risk to nutrient pollution the model simulations show three types of response of hab risk to nutrient loading the immediate response to high anthropogenic din and dip inputs is enhanced primary production nutrient pollution is the main reason for the expansion of the areal coverage of hab risk from 1980 to 2010 fig 4a in the 1980s hab risk only occurred in the changjiang estuary fig 5a concentrated in july following high river discharge fig 4b indicating a direct response to the nutrient loading from rivers liu et al 2009 in contrast in the 2000s hab risk covered almost all areas close to the coastline and the risk occurred during an extended period from march to july fig 4b hence after more than 20 years of nutrient loading from land based sources nutrients have continuously accumulated in the water column fig 8 wang et al 2018 and the spatial and temporal distributions of hab risk seem to gradually become independent from the seasonal riverine nutrient export fig 4b once the water temperature is close to the optimum for their growth algae proliferation begins and the period with conditions prone to hab development extends xiao et al 2019 temperature thus becomes the major driver of the seasonal variation of hab risk hence global warming may become an important factor for hab proliferation in the future the second type of response is related to nutrient stoichiometry the imbalance of nutrient inputs due to increasing din dip ratio in areas with shallow water depth provides an advantage for dinoflagellates compared to diatoms liang et al 2019 sakamoto et al 2021 which is reflected by the high ratio of dinoflagellates diatoms in primary production in the areas with shallow waters table 1 dinoflagellate blooms commonly have more severe ecological consequences than diatom blooms anderson et al 2021 officer and ryther 1980 the area with risk of dinoflagellate blooms covered a larger area than that of diatom blooms since the 1990s fig 6 which is driven by the expansion of the area with an imbalanced din dip ratio fig 8 meanwhile the contribution of diatoms to total primary production decreases along with declining dsi tn ratios fig 4 both of these results imply an aquatic environment more prone to dinoflagellate blooms due to increasing imbalance of nutrients the third type of hab response to changing nutrients is the elevated risk of a anophagefferens blooms in the bohai sea since 2010 ou et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 unlike the east china sea and yellow sea the relatively weak current force in the bohai sea amplifies the anthropogenic impact bohai sea is a semi enclosed sea wang et al 2019b with a mean depth of 18 m fig 1 the water residence time in the bohai sea is 11 6 years about twice of that in the yellow sea and 30 times of that in the east china sea lin et al 2020 slow water exchange with the open ocean enhances the accumulation of water with high din dip liu et al 2011 on a seasonal time scale once the water temperature is favourable for algae growth inorganic nutrients are utilized however there will be no supplement for the depleted dip during the rest of the growing season as the time for replenishment of dip from autogenic mineralization and water exchange with the open ocean exceeds the seasonal time scale therefore the bohai sea shows a severe seasonal shortage of dip and excessive din availability under these circumstances a anophagefferens has strong competitiveness to become the dominant hab species owing to its ability and preference for dop uptake gobler et al 2005 2011 thus the recent occurrence of a anophagefferens habs is the result of nutrient imbalance caused by the high din dip ratio in the nutrient sources and the slow mixing of oceanic water 4 2 implications for nutrient management the 14th five year plan for ecological environmental protection announced by the chinese government has ambitious water quality goals between now and 2025 around 79 of the area of chinese coastal seas need to have excellent water quality status based on the chinese seawater quality standard gb 3097 1997 published in 1997 with this high ambition it is necessary to assess the progress towards this goal during the period of 1980 2010 the cumulative increments of din and dip inputs from land based sources to the eccs are 1215 and 13 gmol respectively fig s6 and accumulation in the water column amounted to 97 gmol of din and 3 gmol of dip overall the accumulation of din and dip in the water column are respectively 8 and 24 of their total accumulation this indicates a lower accumulation efficiency of din compared to dip primarily due to denitrification if we assume no change of primary production from the current level in the eccs large reductions of the annual loading of din 16 and dip 33 are needed to halt nutrient accumulation and deplete the current accumulated stocks within 5 years text s3 this implies that the hab risk in the eccs will not decline within 5 years unless more ambitious reductions will be implemented the above ball park estimates ignore the impact of changing nutrient loading on ecological processes and thus the nutrient accumulation rates a more accurate model based analysis is necessary to establish the required future nutrient reductions achieving reduction of the nutrient loads is complex as it involves management of many different sources on the land agriculture industry and sewage in the sea aquaculture and indirect sources atmospheric deposition all of which require specific strategies and measures bai et al 2022 liu 2022 wang et al 2022b the fact that changing n p ratios are an important factor in hab proliferation which needs to be taken into consideration when developing mitigation strategies on the land in this study the accumulation rate of din is 3 2 gmol yr 1 about 32 times higher than that of dip more importantly the excess din of 15 gmol in 2010 estimated based on din dip ratio exceeding the redfield ratio redfield 1963 occurred primarily in areas with water shallower than 40 m fig 8f our model results indicate a higher abatement of dip than din for diminishing their accumulation in the water column but more actions to curb din loading are needed to reduce the nutrient imbalance in addition the relatively small water volume and long water residence time of the bohai sea not only enhance the accumulation of anthropogenic nutrient pollution and consequent habs but also increase the difficulty of governance wang et al 2022a zhou et al 2021 4 3 model limitations and improvements the simulation of the seasonal variation of nutrient conditions and primary production in coastal waters can be refined by using monthly riverine nutrient concentration data instead of annual data a further limitation is the data availability for the open boundary especially the nutrient transportation through a branch of kuroshio current xu et al 2020 as time series of nutrient transportation through the open boundary from the global ocean physics reanalysis database were not available prior to 1993 in addition previous studies indicated that the p flux from the taiwan warm current is 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than that from the changjiang river guo et al 2006 isobe 2008 which supplies sufficient p for phytoplankton growth along the coastline in the south of the changjiang estuary zhou et al 2019 therefore the relatively poor simulation of nutrient fluxes carried by the ocean current may lead to the underestimation of hab risk in the south of the changjiang estuary xu et al 2020 indicated that nutrients supplied through ocean currents mainly affect the coastal area south of the changjiang estuary the nutrient inputs from taiwan warm current and kuroshio current can contribute no more than 6 and 26 of chl a concentration in the changjiang estuary respectively since this study focuses on the impacts of land based nutrient pollution and most of the study area is in the north of the changjiang estuary underestimation of oceanic nutrient inflow will not change our conclusions drastically 5 conclusions the analysis of the changing hab risk in the eccs under the influence of anthropogenic nutrient pollution showed that between the 1980s and 2000s the risk of diatom blooms and dinoflagellate blooms increased by 158 and 127 respectively but the risk area for dinoflagellate blooms expanded faster than that of diatom blooms and the composition of primary producer communities in the eccs has shifted from diatom dominated to equal shares of diatoms and non diatoms the potential occurrence of a anophagefferens blooms after 2005 resulted from the shortage of dip and enhanced dop and don concentrations during the summer significant reductions are needed 33 for dip and 16 for din inputs to halt din and dip accumulation in the water column in the eccs also strategies for nutrient reduction need to consider the current excess din availability causing the gap between current din dip and redfield ratio in areas with shallow waters 40 m in developing policy strategies the bohai sea should be a priority because of its ecosystem vulnerability high nutrient accumulation and long residence time of water and nutrients our model approach to assess hab risk advances our understanding of the impact of anthropogenic nutrient pollution on hab development and can also be used for predicting the future evolution of hab risk this will support the development of effective strategies for nutrient mitigation and management for chinese coastal waters and other hab hotspots around the world

15127,harmful algal blooms habs have been increasing in frequency areal extent and duration due to the large increase in nutrient inputs from land based sources to coastal seas and cause significant economic losses in this study we used the watershed coast continuum concept to explore the effects of land based nutrient pollution on hab development in the eastern chinese coastal seas eccs results from the coupling of a watershed nutrient model and a coast hydrodynamic biogeochemical model show that between the 1980s and 2000s the risk of diatom blooms and dinoflagellate blooms increased by 158 and 127 respectively the spatial expansion of hab risk caused by dinoflagellates is larger than that of diatoms the simulated suitability of the habitat for bloom of aureococcus anophagefferens a pico plankton of non diatom or dinoflagellate in the bohai sea is consistent with observations spatially and temporally to halt further nutrient accumulation in the eccs reductions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din 16 and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip 33 loading are required to improve the situation of distorted din dip ratios even larger reductions of din are required especially in the bohai sea our approach is a feasible way to predict the risk of habs under the pressure of increasing anthropogenic nutrient pollution in coastal waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

produce toxins that bioaccumulate in seafood and can cause massive fish kills and or cause ecological damage through the development of hypoxia or anoxia and other habitat alterations with a series of important negative consequences for human health economy society and recreation after more than 20 years of research efforts since the first workshop of the global ecology and oceanography of harmful algal blooms geohab group in 1998 cullen 1998 there is a growing consensus that coastal eutrophication combined with the climate change drives the worldwide increasing abundance frequency and geographic extent of habs glibert 2017 glibert and burford 2017 gobler 2020 nutrient fluxes of nitrogen n and phosphorus p to the global coastal ocean via river runoff groundwater discharge and atmospheric deposition have been increasing due to intensive agricultural and industrial activities since the 1950s bouwman et al 2005 van puijenbroek et al 2019 agriculture through the rapid increase of the global use of fertilizers and expansion of livestock production is the main land based source of nutrient pollution beusen et al 2022 2016 not only nutrient loading is increasing there is also an increase in the global n p ratio in agricultural nutrients bouwman et al 2017 further enhanced by soil and aquatic biogeochemistry beusen et al 2022 leading to an increased n p ratio in coastal waters across the globe penuelas et al 2013 meanwhile dam and reservoir construction increases silica si and p retention resulting in declining export to the coastal ocean conley 1997 humborg et al 2000 in order to meet the rising demand for food and energy nutrient loading with imbalanced n p si ratios in rivers are likely to continue to increase in the coming half century beusen et al 2022 under such conditions changing of phytoplankton biomass and composition in response to the nutrient supply impacts the hab succession and diversity sharoni and halevy 2020 considering the complex interaction between the abiotic environment and hab occurrence competition and succession new approaches of hydrodynamic biogeochemical models have been used for hindcasting hab proliferation under climate change and excessive and disproportionate nutrient supply glibert 2017 glibert et al 2014 wells et al 2020 china has experienced unprecedented economic development in the past four decades but this has caused significant ecological damage liu and diamond 2005 nutrient loading from land based sources increased rapidly during that period wang et al 2019a yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 intensive dam construction further altered the composition of nutrient loads exported to china s coastal waters dai and lu 2014 yang et al 2018 meanwhile population and megacities have been concentrating in the chinese coastal zone accelerating degradation in the nearshore area world urbanization prospects revised wup 2014 and causing the continued increase of hab frequency and large financial losses in aquaculture and tourism during the past 40 years yan et al 2022 however the subsequent decrease of hab frequency in the chinese coastal seas is difficult to explain in view of the continued high level of nutrient pollution parallel to the increasing frequency of hab occurrences the dominant hab species changed and became more diversified a shift of dominant hab species from diatoms to dinoflagellate in the east china sea ecs occurred since 2000 zhou et al 2022 freshwater from the changjiang river the taiwan warm current and a branch of the kuroshio current complicate the dynamics of hydrology in the ecs and the situation is even more complex due to conspiring environmental changes such as climate warming and nutrient loading xiao et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 in addition to the diatoms and dinoflagellates that have become common bloom forming algae the pelagophyte aureococcus anophagefferens a anophagefferens became a typical hab species in the bohai sea since 2009 zhang et al 2012 china is now among the three countries threatened by blooms of this species together with the usa and south africa although a anophagefferens is not the major component of primary production its emergence is a strong indicator of ecological degradation in the bohai sea wang et al 2022a this study combines hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models in a 3d framework with high spatial and temporal resolution and elaborate mechanisms including long term consecutive land based nutrient exports physiological based processes and complex abiotic descriptions we focus on the

conditions thus accounting for resource competition los et al 2008 in this study we considered four phytoplankton groups diatoms flagellates dinoflagellates and phaeocystis and three types within each group n p and e representing communities more sensitive to n p and light limitation respectively the biomass of non diatoms is the sum of flagellates dinoflagellates and phaeocystis bloom does not include the biomass of a anophagefferens to assess the risk of a anophagefferens blooms we developed a post processing tool to map the instant distribution of potential habitat for a anophagefferens blooms see 2 3 the model distinguishes different nutrient forms dissolved inorganic dissolved organic and particulate organic fig 2 dissolved inorganic nitrogen consists of nitrates no3 and ammonia nh4 mineralization of organic matter can occur in the water column or in the sediment nitrification denitrification and oxygen reaeration and consumption processes are simulated as well finally

anophagefferens blooms two different ways have been applied to the assessment of hab risk caused by micro plankton diatoms flagellates dinoflagellates pheaocystis and pico plankton a anophagefferens using the model results the risk of micro plankton blooms can be assessed directly based on its biomass a chlorophyll a chl value equal to 10 µg was used as the threshold for a potential risk of micro plankton blooms smith and bernard 2020 stumpf et al 2003 for each grid cell the monthly averaged chl sum of all species exceeding this threshold represents a risk of micro plankton blooms in that month the hab risk area for each month is calculated from the number of grid cells with potential risk and the grid size fig 4a b for each grid cell the cumulative frequency of risk is defined as the number of months per year decade that a risk is calculated the distribution of hab risk in each decade is based on the cumulative frequency figs 5 and 6 instead of using the simulated biomass the potential risk of a anophagefferens is mapped by the distributions of environmental parameters extracted from the model output and their corresponding range suitable for a anophagefferens blooms these environmental parameters include light intensity temperature salinity and nutrient concentrations the criteria for the suitability of a anophagefferens blooms were obtained from wang et al 2022a table s3 at a certain point of time the potential risk of a anophagefferens blooms is determined if grid cells where all environmental parameters are within these criteria table s3 fig s5 unlike micro plankton a anophagefferens prefers to utilize organic nutrients when the availability of dissolved inorganic nutrients is sufficient for micro plankton growth a anophagefferens are outcompeted boneillo and mulholland 2014 gobler et al 2005 situations where inorganic nutrients in the water column are nearly depleted and more organic nutrients become available from micro phytoplankton decomposition are beneficial to a anophagefferens gobler et al 2005 lomas et al 1996 ou et al 2018 yao et al 2019 therefore the maximum din and dip and minimum dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop concentrations define the chemical criteria for this picoplankton species table s3 2 4 data for model validation annual average nutrients concentrations in the changjiang estuary stations located in 122 124 e 20 32 n were obtained from li et al 2015 mu et al 2020 wang et al 2016 zhang 2020 annual average nutrients concentrations collected from the transect in the central bohai sea were obtained from zhang 2020 fig 1 nutrient concentrations during winter time from the transect in the north yellow sea were obtained from wei et al 2015 fig 1 the nutrient concentrations used for model validation are the average values in the corresponding transect region shown as red triangles in fig 1 observed daily sea surface salinity sss and sea surface temperature

squared error rmse details in text s2 of daily to annual average sst sss din and dip the rmse values of daily sst and sss in three different stations range from 6 to 12 and from 49 to 51 respectively fig s3 modelled spatial distribution of suspended sediment was in good agreement with satellite derived data fig s4 the annual average concentrations in the central bohai sea resulted in rmse values of 52 for din and 53 for dip rmse values of din and dip in the changjiang estuary are 24 and 13 respectively fig 3 the validation of modelled nutrients in the central north yellow sea based on concentrations during winter resulted in rmse values of 36 for din and 21 for dip fig 3 3 2 temporal variation of the hab risk the model predicted a total cumulative area of 117 103 km2 with hab risk from 1980 to 2010 the hab risk area increased from 2 103 km2 yr 1 in the 1980s to 6 103 km2 yr 1 in the 2000s fig 4 a the seasonal distribution of hab risk area shifted from june in the 1980s to march july in the 2000s fig 4b compared to the 1990s most of the increase in the hab risk area occurred in spring march april and may during the period 1980 2010 tn and tp in the eccs water increased by 62 and 27 respectively while si decreased by 10 from the highest value in 1985 to 2010 the tn tp molar ratio increased from around 12 in 1980 to 16 in 2010 fig 4d while the si tn molar ratio decreased from 6 to 3 5 in the beginning of the 1980s diatoms were the dominant species in primary production fig 4c the composition of the primary producers showed a decreasing proportion of diatoms and increasing proportion of non diatoms and in the 2000s the contributions of diatoms and non diatoms to primary production were equal 3 3 spatial distribution of harmful algal bloom risk the outcomes of the modelled distribution of hab risk over the three decades 1980s 1990s and 2000s are compared with the distribution of reported hab events in the corresponding time period fig 5 in general the hab risk distributions match well with the reported bloom events for same time period although hab risk areas are underestimated in the south of the changjiang estuary in the 1980s hab risk mainly occurred in the southern and northern parts of the bohai sea as well as small areas in the changjiang estuary fig 5a in the 2000s there was hab risk in almost all areas near the coastline of the eccs a shift from the southern to the middle part in the bohai sea expansion in the changjiang estuary and further expansion offshore in the south yellow sea after the 1990s fig 5b c by evaluating the hab risk dominated by diatoms and dinoflagellates separately fig 6 the results show that compared to the 1990s the risk of diatom blooms in the bohai sea spread from south to the middle and decreased in the 2000s fig 6a c the risk of diatom blooms in the yellow sea and east china sea expanded from scattered areas in the nearshore region close to the changjiang estuary in the 1980s and 1990s to the nearshore area of the whole south yellow sea and changjiang estuary in the 2000s compared to the 1980s the risk of diatom blooms for the whole domain increased by 74 in 1990s and by 158 in the 2000s the risk of dinoflagellate blooms increased by 51 and 127 from the 1980s to 1990s and 2000s respectively fig 6d f in the 1980s the distribution of dinoflagellate hab risk in the 1980s is similar to that of diatoms after the 1980s the risk of dinoflagellate blooms not only overlapped the area with diatom bloom risk but also formed two new zones with dinoflagellate bloom risk in the offshore area in the south yellow sea and the changjiang estuary regarding a anophagefferens the model results indicate no risk of a anophagefferens blooms in 2000 and 2005 fig 7 a as not all abiotic conditions meet the requirements for blooms fig 7a b the model results for 2010 indicate that all parameters matched the suitability envelopes for a anophagefferens bloom in two zones in the bohai sea fig 7c in order to analyze which parameter is the primary limitation for the risk of a anophagefferens blooms the spatial distribution of compliance with a anophagefferens blooms requirements are shown in fig s5 physical conditions and din concentration show no restriction while dip don and dop concentrations are the primary limitations for a anophagefferens blooms fig s5 between july 2000 and july 2005 the increases of don and dop concentrations in the bohai sea and the northwest of north yellow sea provided the suitable organic nutrient condition for a anophagefferens blooms while the dip concentration was not within the criteria range table s3 in july 2010 the dip concentration in the bohai sea was within this range which leads to suitable conditions for the development of a anophagefferens with respect to all 7 considered parameters fig s5 fig 7c 3 4 nearshore offshore gradients nutrient concentrations molar tn tp ratios and molar din dip ratios increase from deep towards shallow waters fig 8 in the zone with water depths less than 20 m din increased by more than 80 between 1980 and 2010 and dip by 16 39 fig 8 consequently the din dip and tn tp ratios also increased in the 1980s only areas with water depths 10 m showed din dip ratios 16 but in the 1990s and 2000s this expanded to areas with water depths up to 40 m fig 8 the relative dip increase between 1980 and 2010 was less significant and its variation 81 97 with water depth from 160 m to 5 m was smaller than that of din 332 414 however the dop concentration was much higher in areas with shallow waters than in areas with deeper waters in areas with deep waters 80 m dop made up 28 of tp and 40 in shallow waters 20 m in the areas with waters shallower than 10 m dinoflagellates were the dominant species table 1 while in the areas with waters deeper than 80 m diatoms were dominant dinoflagellate biomass in areas with water 5 m deep was more than 13 times larger than that in areas with waters deeper than 160 m which was a much larger difference than that for diatom biomass 4 times table 1 4 discussion 4 1 responses of harmful algal bloom risk to nutrient pollution the model simulations show three types of response of hab risk to nutrient loading the immediate response to high anthropogenic din and dip inputs is enhanced primary production nutrient pollution is the main reason for the expansion of the areal coverage of hab risk from 1980 to 2010 fig 4a in the 1980s hab risk only occurred in the changjiang estuary fig 5a concentrated in july following high river discharge fig 4b indicating a direct response to the nutrient loading from rivers liu et al 2009 in contrast in the 2000s hab risk covered almost all areas close to the coastline and the risk occurred during an extended period from march to july fig 4b hence after more than 20 years of nutrient loading from land based sources nutrients have continuously accumulated in the water column fig 8 wang et al 2018 and the spatial and temporal distributions of hab risk seem to gradually become independent from the seasonal riverine nutrient export fig 4b once the water temperature is close to the optimum for their growth algae proliferation begins and the period with conditions prone to hab development extends xiao et al 2019 temperature thus becomes the major driver of the seasonal variation of hab risk hence global warming may become an important factor for hab proliferation in the future the second type of response is related to nutrient stoichiometry the imbalance of nutrient inputs due to increasing din dip ratio in areas with shallow water depth provides an advantage for dinoflagellates compared to diatoms liang et al 2019 sakamoto et al 2021 which is reflected by the high ratio of dinoflagellates diatoms in primary production in the areas with shallow waters table 1 dinoflagellate blooms commonly have more severe ecological consequences than diatom blooms anderson et al 2021 officer and ryther 1980 the area with risk of dinoflagellate blooms covered a larger area than that of diatom blooms since the 1990s fig 6 which is driven by the expansion of the area with an imbalanced din dip ratio fig 8 meanwhile the contribution of diatoms to total primary production decreases along with declining dsi tn ratios fig 4 both of these results imply an aquatic environment more prone to dinoflagellate blooms due to increasing imbalance of nutrients the third type of hab response to changing nutrients is the elevated risk of a anophagefferens blooms in the bohai sea since 2010 ou et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 unlike the east china sea and yellow sea the relatively weak current force in the bohai sea amplifies the anthropogenic impact bohai sea is a semi enclosed sea wang et al 2019b with a mean depth of 18 m fig 1 the water residence time in the bohai sea is 11 6 years about twice of that in the yellow sea and 30 times of that in the east china sea lin et al 2020 slow water exchange with the open ocean enhances the accumulation of water with high din dip liu et al 2011 on a seasonal time scale once the water temperature is favourable for algae growth inorganic nutrients are utilized however there will be no supplement for the depleted dip during the rest of the growing season as the time for replenishment of dip from autogenic mineralization and water exchange with the open ocean exceeds the seasonal time scale therefore the bohai sea shows a severe seasonal shortage of dip and excessive din availability under these circumstances a anophagefferens has strong competitiveness to become the dominant hab species owing to its ability and preference for dop uptake gobler et al 2005 2011 thus the recent occurrence of a anophagefferens habs is the result of nutrient imbalance caused by the high din dip ratio in the nutrient sources and the slow mixing of oceanic water 4 2 implications for nutrient management the 14th five year plan for ecological environmental protection announced by the chinese government has ambitious water quality goals between now and 2025 around 79 of the area of chinese coastal seas need to have excellent water quality status based on the chinese seawater quality standard gb 3097 1997 published in 1997 with this high ambition it is necessary to assess the progress towards this goal during the period of 1980 2010 the cumulative increments of din and dip inputs from land based sources to the eccs are 1215 and 13 gmol respectively fig s6 and accumulation in the water column amounted to 97 gmol of din and 3 gmol of dip overall the accumulation of din and dip in the water column are respectively 8 and 24 of their total accumulation this indicates a lower accumulation efficiency of din compared to dip primarily due to denitrification if we assume no change of primary production from the current level in the eccs large reductions of the annual loading of din 16 and dip 33 are needed to halt nutrient accumulation and deplete the current accumulated stocks within 5 years text s3 this implies that the hab risk in the eccs will not decline within 5 years unless more ambitious reductions will be implemented the above ball park estimates ignore the impact of changing nutrient loading on ecological processes and thus the nutrient accumulation rates a more accurate model based analysis is necessary to establish the required future nutrient reductions achieving reduction of the nutrient loads is complex as it involves management of many different sources on the land agriculture industry and sewage in the sea aquaculture and indirect sources atmospheric deposition all of which require specific strategies and measures bai et al 2022 liu 2022 wang et al 2022b the fact that changing n p ratios are an important factor in hab proliferation which needs to be taken into consideration when developing mitigation strategies on the land in this study the accumulation rate of din is 3 2 gmol yr 1 about 32 times higher than that of dip more importantly the excess din of 15 gmol in 2010 estimated based on din dip ratio exceeding the redfield ratio redfield 1963 occurred primarily in areas with water shallower than 40 m fig 8f our model results indicate a higher abatement of dip than din for diminishing their accumulation in the water column but more actions to curb din loading are needed to reduce the nutrient imbalance in addition the relatively small water volume and long water residence time of the bohai sea not only enhance the accumulation of anthropogenic nutrient pollution and consequent habs but also increase the difficulty of governance wang et al 2022a zhou et al 2021 4 3 model limitations and improvements the simulation of the seasonal variation of nutrient conditions and primary production in coastal waters can be refined by using monthly riverine nutrient concentration data instead of annual data a further limitation is the data availability for the open boundary especially the nutrient transportation through a branch of kuroshio current xu et al 2020 as time series of nutrient transportation through the open boundary from the global ocean physics reanalysis database were not available prior to 1993 in addition previous studies indicated that the p flux from the taiwan warm current is 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than that from the changjiang river guo et al 2006 isobe 2008 which supplies sufficient p for phytoplankton growth along the coastline in the south of the changjiang estuary zhou et al 2019 therefore the relatively poor simulation of nutrient fluxes carried by the ocean current may lead to the underestimation of hab risk in the south of the changjiang estuary xu et al 2020 indicated that nutrients supplied through ocean currents mainly affect the coastal area south of the changjiang estuary the nutrient inputs from taiwan warm current and kuroshio current can contribute no more than 6 and 26 of chl a concentration in the changjiang estuary respectively since this study focuses on the impacts of land based nutrient pollution and most of the study area is in the north of the changjiang estuary underestimation of oceanic nutrient inflow will not change our conclusions drastically 5 conclusions the analysis of the changing hab risk in the eccs under the influence of anthropogenic nutrient pollution showed that between the 1980s and 2000s the risk of diatom blooms and dinoflagellate blooms increased by 158 and 127 respectively but the risk area for dinoflagellate blooms expanded faster than that of diatom blooms and the composition of primary producer communities in the eccs has shifted from diatom dominated to equal shares of diatoms and non diatoms the potential occurrence of a anophagefferens blooms after 2005 resulted from the shortage of dip and enhanced dop and don concentrations during the summer significant reductions are needed 33 for dip and 16 for din inputs to halt din and dip accumulation in the water column in the eccs also strategies for nutrient reduction need to consider the current excess din availability causing the gap between current din dip and redfield ratio in areas with shallow waters 40 m in developing policy strategies the bohai sea should be a priority because of its ecosystem vulnerability high nutrient accumulation and long residence time of water and nutrients our model approach to assess hab risk advances our understanding of the impact of anthropogenic nutrient pollution on hab development and can also be used for predicting the future evolution of hab risk this will support the development of effective strategies for nutrient mitigation and management for chinese coastal waters and other hab hotspots around the world

15128,microplastics and nanoplastics are being assumed as emerging toxic pollutants owing to their unique persistent physicochemical attributes chemical stability and nonbiodegradable nature owing to their possible toxicological impacts not only on aquatic biota but also on humans scientific communities are developing innovative technologies to remove microplastics and nanoplastics from polluted waters various technologies including adsorption coagulation photocatalysis bioremediation and filtration have been developed and employed to eliminate microplastics and nanoplastics recently adsorption technology has been getting great interest in capturing microplastics and nanoplastics and achieving excellent removal performance therefore this review is designed to discuss recent

malleability versatility low cost durability excellent oxygen resistance lightweight and biological dullness zhao et al 2021 the global plastics yield in 2020 was 367 million tons tiseo 2021 and an increase of 29 has been predicted for the year 2028 aslani et al 2021 when surplus in the environment plastics steadily break up into tiny particles under the influence of weathering mechanical wear solar radiation and microorganisms thereby yielding microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps ali et al 2022 luo et al 2022 recently mps 5 mm to 0 1 µm and nanoplastics nps 100 nm or 0 1 µm have been assumed as emerging toxic pollutants due to their unique physicochemical characteristics chemical stability and nonbiodegradable nature ali et al 2021a ali et al 2021b both mps and nps are widely distributed including fresh water lake water river sewage drains wwtps sediments oceans groundwater estuaries ya et al 2021 drinking water alimi et al 2018 atmosphere ragusa et al 2021 soil nizzetto et al 2016 food chain 2016 human body wright and kelly 2017 and even discovered in human blood ragusa et al 2021 aquatic animals and organisms mammals birds fish zooplankton and molluscs could mistakenly ingest mps and nps baudrimont et al 2020 both mp and np could easily discharge harmful substances they could perform as a trajectory to absorb toxic contaminants antibiotics pharmaceuticals heavy metals pesticides and plasticizers pathogen organisms owing to their high surface area smaller size and strong hydrophobicity ragusa et al 2021 this interaction could eventually influence the bioavailability fate and bio magnification of these contaminants zaki and aris 2022 further due to their small sizes aquatic species could mistakenly devour mps and nps as food and these tiny particles can potentially move to animals and humans through the food chain triggering a toxicological threat towards the thorough ecosystem zaki and aris 2022 thus the removal of mps and nps is urgent to protect water environment various kinds of treatment technologies including adsorption goh et al 2022 coagulation xu et al 2021 advanced oxidation processes ricardo et al 2021 photocatalysis ebrahimbabaie et al 2022 bioremediation masiá et al 2020 and filtration malankowska et al 2021 have been developed to eradicate mps and nps from contaminated waters among these techniques adsorption is assumed to be cost effective simple reliable and effective in capturing mps and nps from water and sewage ali et al 2021b recently different adsorbents including sponge rong et al 2022 aerogel zhuang et al 2022 biochar zhu et al 2022 metal metal oxides rius ayra et al 2021 magnetic nanoparticles shi et al 2022 magnetic carbon nanotubes tang et al 2021 metal layer hydr oxides ldh tiwari et

cigarette butts el hadri et al 2021 and magnetic effervescent tablets qu et al 2022 have been fabricated for the elimination of mps and nps from different water environments the presence of distinctive functional groups cooh oh n ch3 nh2 si o fe oh on adsorbents performed an imperative role in capturing mps and nps from polluted waters batool and valiyaveettil 2021 chazovachii et al 2021 rong et al 2022 both plain and surface functionalized mps and nps have been removed mainly due to hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding van der waals interaction electrostatic attraction π π interaction pore filling and intra particle diffusion depending on the characteristics of mps nps and adsorbents peng et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 further the pertinent factors including adsorbents characteristics mps nps characteristics solution ph reaction temperature natural organic matter nom and co existing interfering ions also control adsorption performance huang et al 2022 shi et al 2022 in addition some adsorbents are also utilized for practical applications to examine their capabilities to eradicate mps and nps from real waters arenas et al 2021 ganie et al 2021 rius ayra et al 2021 you et al 2021 to date few reports have highlighted using different adsorbents to eradicate mps and nps from the water recently some mini reviews narrated the removal of mps by surface functionalized materials gupta et al 2022 biochar ahmed et al 2022 and nanomaterials goh et al 2022 zaki and aris 2022 likewise few researchers reviewed the removal of nps by different adsorbents chen et al 2022b gupta et al 2022 however to our knowledge none of the reviews reported an in depth critical summary of the developed promising adsorbents for the systematically remediation of mps and nps in addition none of the published reports can critically elucidate the stimulus of pertinent components on the adsorptive elimination of mps and nps likewise no one has reported the practical application of the developed adsorbents in eradicating mps and nps from natural water samples thus the current understanding of the innovations in developing promising adsorbents for the remediation of mps and nps is still not comprehensive hence to fill this gap information available to date december 2022 was critically evaluated and its demonstration is focused on i the innovations in the development of promising adsorbents for the remediation of mps and nps from water under laboratory conditions ii critical examination of the influence of various pertinent factors including characteristic of adsorbents characteristics of mps nps solution ph reaction temperature natural organic matter and co existing interfering ions on the removal performance of developed adsorbents iii elucidation of the particle application of the developed adsorbents for mps and nps elimination from real water samples iv highlighting the barriers to market penetration of the developed adsorbents to help experts transfer adsorption based technology from laboratory to commercial applications and lastly v summation of the current knowledge gaps and future recommendations to assist scientific communal for improving adsorption based technologies to encounter mps and nps contamination 2 innovations in the development of promising adsorbents for the remediation of microplastic and nanoplastics numerous adsorbents have been fabricated via different routes to capture mps and nps from the water ecosystem table 1 in addition various techniques including dynamic light scattering dls fluorescence spectroscopy fs fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometry and turbidimeter have been used to quantify mps and nps magid et al 2021 singh et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2022 various kinds of mps including polystyrene ps polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polyvinyl chloride pvc polyamide pa high density polyethylene hdpe polymethyl methacrylate pmma melamine resin mr carboxylate modified polystyrene ps cooh amine modified polystyrene ps nh2 acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs nylon and micronized rubber with varying sizes ranging from 0 105 to 1240 µm have been removed via using different kinds of adsorbents various types of nps including ps pvc pet abs pmma polyvinyl acetate pva and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with varying sizes ranging from 30 to 100 nm have been eliminated using different adsorbents table 1 the adsorbents prepared by different routes depicted diverse morphology and characteristics to capture mps and nps herein the utilized adsorbents have been categorized into four main classes sponge aerogel based adsorbent metal based adsorbent biochar based adsorbent and other developed adsorbents to better reveal the ejection of mps and nps from the water environment 2 1 sponge aerogel based adsorbents sponge aerogel as an adsorption material with three dimensional porous morphology has gained much attention recently owing to its high specific surface area low density high compressive strength high aspect ratio porous structure good mechanical strength low cost and presence of abundant active groups on the surface for the adsorption of various pollutants sun et al 2020 in addition the sponges aerogels prepared by biomass based materials are environment friendly and biodegradable in soil sun et al 2021 numerous kinds of sponge aerogel based adsorbents have been fabricated via different routes including chemical crosslinking freezing thawing spin coating desilylation and self polymerization and they have been utilized for the removal of mps and np rong et al 2022 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2021b zhuang et al 2022 owing to having unique morphology and abundant hydrophilic functional groups mps and nps have been captured through diverse interactions including hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding van der waals interaction electrostatic attraction π π interaction ion exchange and intra particle diffusion table 1 2 1 1 microplastics regarding mps chitin and graphene oxide based chgo sponges could remove up to 89 8 72 4 and 88 9 of plain ps ps cooh and ps nh2 mps respectively via the combination of electrostatic interactions between opposite charges of adsorbent and mps intra particle diffusion due to interconnected porous morphology hydrogen bond interactions between the oxygen containing functional groups of adsorbent and mps and π π interactions between adsorbent and mps owing to the manifestation of the aromatic ring in mps structure notably the interconnected macroporous sponge system allowed mps to diffuse throughout the sponge and attach to the inner core of the sponge in addition the exhausted sponge could be biodegraded in soil sun et al 2020 similarly plant protein based sponges could adsorb up to 81 2 ps mps at the ph range of 6 9 due to having a highly interconnected porous structure 83 which helped sponges to adsorb 38 of mps within 10 s via the transport of mps throughout the sponge notably the hydrophobic groups on the protein side chain could shape hydrophobic interaction with the benzene rings on ps mps wang et al 2021b the prepared sponge depicted good biodegradability the captured water could be quickly discharged from sponges just by modestly compression with a hand and it could be regenerated for cyclic use wang et al 2021b recently it was reported that polydimethylsiloxane pdms grafted fe3o4 particle based sponge could remove about 100 mps pp pvc and pe in 5 min via the combination of intra particle diffusion under capillary attraction electrostatic interaction hydrogen bond interaction and σ p or p p conjugation mechanism rong et al 2022 notably sem findings witnessed that large numbers of mps particles were disseminated into the skeleton and pores of the coated sponges consistently and almost wholly covered the sponge fig 1 i in addition the adsorption of pp mps on the sponge could be endorsed to the joint grasping forces between methyl group of pp mps and the oxygen atom of pdms and the wan der waals force among hydrophobic molecules while chlorine atoms with lone pair electrons of pvc polymer molecule could adsorb on the pdms molecule owing to the electrostatic interactions and σ p and p p conjugations in addition the less branched chain of pvc structure could decline the steric hindrance contributing to the smooth adsorption of pvc mps onto the sponge meanwhile the developed sponge depicted excellent salt resistance and antibacterial activity to e coli and s aureus demonstrating that the sponge could remove mps from a highly saline and microbial rich environment rong et al 2022 further oxygen doped carbon nitride o c3n4 was loaded into chitin based sponges and 90 elimination efficiency of ps ps cooh and ps nh2 mps 1 µm was achieved sun et al 2021 notably the loading of o c3n4 significantly improved sponges water absorption capacity thus increased the elimination of mps via electrostatic interactions intra particle diffusion hydrogen bond interactions and π π interaction mechanisms further the leading driving force during ps nh2 mps adsorption was π π interactions instead of electrostatic interaction because ps nh2 mps and chitin based sponges both were positively charged and the conjugation effect was present between the lone electron pairs in n atoms and the benzene ring for π π interactions furthermore the expanded sponge could be biodegraded like fungal mycelia in soil as cracks and crumbles were noticed on the superficial of the sponge after 28 d sun et al 2021 adhesive coated beads could remove up to 99 of nonpolar pe micronized rubber and polar pet nylon mps in addition to ps mps within 5 min via the combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic attraction chazovachii et al 2021 the modified cellulose aerogel depicted an excellent adsorption capacity 146 38 mg g against ps mps due to having unique porous morphology and active sites which helped in capturing mps via electrostatic interaction and ion exchange as observed by a fluorescence study which depicted that different aerogels showed different adsorption effects against ps mps fig 1 ii zhuang et al 2022 similarly polydopamine enhanced magnetic chitosan pda mcs aerogels could remove up to 91 6 pet mps the manifestation of hydrophilic functional groups cooh nh2 played an essential role in capturing pet mps from solution via the permutation of electrostatic interactions physical adhesion hydrogen bonding and π π interaction as porous size and high porosity of the aerogels offered several adsorption sites for pet mps fig 1 iii notably xps findings indicated that the amino group of the chain of the chitosan molecule could combine with the cooh group on pet to develop n c o group via electrostatic interactions which performed an imperative role in the adsorption in addition the adsorption capability of pda mcs aerogels against pet mps was superior under dark daylight and uv light conditions within 24 h zheng et al 2022 it was recently reported that native nanocellulose film cnf hydrogels could capture cationic and anionic ps mps 1 µm cnf hydrogels depicted higher removal for positively charged ps mps as compared to charge ps mps negatively notably the hygroscopic nanocellulose network and negative surface charge of cnf hydrogels promoted the accretion and removal of the positively charged ps mps through diffusion cohesion capillary forces and electrostatic interaction leppänen et al 2022 likewise tempo cnf ps ultrathin and regenerated cellulose rc films have captured higher cationic ps mps than the anionic ps mps leppänen et al 2022 in addition mps can be charged on site at the place of their production 2 1 2 nanoplastics regarding nps zif 8 aerogel could remove both pvdf nps 60 110 nm and ps nps 90 140 nm from the water via the combination of electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces because the zeta potential values of zif 8 pvdf and ps were 13 5 16 1 and 18 7 mv respectively and pvdf ps and zif 8 were all hydrophobic substance notably the removal efficiency of pvdf 91 4 was better than that of ps 42 5 on zif 8 aerogel because the c f on pvdf could establish hydrogen bonds with oh in cellulose further sem micrographs illustrated that pvdf and ps nps were strongly devoted to the surface of zif 8 and the walls of the aerogel pores you et al 2021 pei ce adsorbent could remove 98 nps pvc pmma and pvac within 30 min owing to electrostatic interactions between positively charged pei ce and negatively charged nps because the zeta potential value of adsorbent turned to negative after sorption of negatively charged nps notably sem micrographs depicted uniformly disseminated spherical nps on the surface of pei ce fig 2 i further ftir findings represented characteristics peak of the c o stretching of the ester in both pmma and pvac backbone at 1734 cm 1 demonstrating the presence of electrostatic interaction between positively charged pei ce and negatively charged nps batool and valiyaveettil 2021 recently a team of researchers have reported that 3d oldh could remove 80 ps nps 80 nm at ph 3 to 11 and even nearly 60 at ph 1 and 13 the prepared material 3d oldh demonstrated outstanding acid and base resistance against ps nps removal notably the characterization and dft findings depicted that hydrogen bonding and complexation linked with layer double hydroxide ldh retrieved from ldo and π π conjunction from graphene like carbon g and p π interaction between g and benzene ring of ps nps due to the presence of sulfur s in g from sds performed an imperative role in the elimination of ps nps by 3d oldh peng et al 2022 further it was observed that native nanocellulose film cnf hydrogels could capture cationic and anionic ps nps 100 nm cnf hydrogels depicted higher removal for positively charged ps nps rivalled to negatively charged ps nps notably the hygroscopic nanocellulose network and negative surface charge of cnf hydrogels promoted the accumulation and reduction of the positively charged plastic particles through diffusion cohesion capillary forces and electrostatic interaction leppänen et al 2022 likewise ps ultrathin films and regenerated cellulose rc films captured higher cationic ps nps than anionic ps nps tempo cnf film could capture roughly 20 billion ps nps per mg of tempo cnf a remarkable achievement in addition mps and nps can be charged on site where they are produced leppänen et al 2022 overall unique morphology and the presence of reactive functional groups played an essential role in removing mps and nps from polluted waters in addition sponge aerogel could remove higher amount nps than mp and the consumed sponge aerogel could be biodegraded by microorganisms in soil however what is the fate of collected mps nps after regenerating sponge aerogel this question is demanding experts attention in future investigations 2 2 metal based adsorbents different kinds of metal based adsorbents have been utilized to remove mps and nps iron fe modified adsorbents have been prepared via various routes including chemical co precipitation hydrothermal chemical vapour deposition calcination and sonication in addition different metals cu co mn pt minerals kaolin and acids phosphonic acid molecules lauric acid have been incorporated to confer super hydrophilic or superhydrophobic properties and enhance reactive sites and functional groups on the surfaces of adsorbents for the efficient adsorption of mps and nps huang et al 2022 rius ayra et al 2021 sarcletti et al 2021 urso et al 2022 in addition these fe modified adsorbents can be magnetically collected and removed from the solution by employing an external magnetic field shi et al 2022 2 2 1 microplastics regarding mps superhydrophobic cufeco powder alloy could remove 83 of hdpe mps from the water via hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction the capturing mechanism can be explained in this way first mps moved from water to the organic phase under constant stirring meanwhile the cufeco particles were also instantaneously shifted from the aqueous phase to the organic one due to their superhydrophobic superoleophobic properties which was oil where the cufeco particles surrounded the mps by the centripetal force of the stirring process to capture them through electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction fig 2 ii rius ayra et al 2021 sarcletti and coworkers 2021 have developed different functionalized core shell superparamagnetic iron oxide spion nanoparticles to remove different sizes of mps ps pmma mr from water the findings depicted that spions adsorbed on the mps surface and agglomerated them by acting like a glue between mps particles fig 2 iii notably the fabricated spion could remove mps because of the presence of van der waals electrostatic and hydrophobic attractions between mps and functionalized spion in addition spion systems also depicted high removal capabilities under co mixture of mr and ps as sem micrographs witnessed that polymer co mixture already tended to small clustering of the mps according to their different zeta potential still much larger agglomerates were noticed in the presence of the spion fig 3 i magnetic carbon nanotube m cnt could completely remove mps pe pet and pa within 300 min at neutral ph 7 the hydrophobic interactions could endorse the adsorption of pe by m cnt in contrast the adsorption of pet could be attributed to the combination of hydrophobic and π π electron conjugate interactions between pet mps and m cnt due to the presence of highly polarized π electron cloud on carbon nanotubes surfaces while the adsorption of pa was principally due to the combination of π π electron interaction complexation electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bond interaction because pa polar polymer had good hydrophilicity owing to the manifestation of a large number of amide groups on the molecular chain and pa could dissociate more cooh than amine groups at neutral conditions revealing negative surface charge whereas m cnts were positively charged because of containing fe3o4 on the surface also fe3o4 could make complex with the cooh on the m cnts and the hydrogen bonds between the pa amide groups and the m cnts tang et al 2021 notably the higher adsorption capacities of pe 1650 mg g and pet 1400 mg g than that of pa 1100 mg g depicted that hydrophobic interaction between pe pet and m cnts was much stronger than the electrostatic and complexation adsorption between pa and m cnts additionally the superior crystallinity of pe compared with pet began with higher hydrophobic interaction and resulted from higher adsorption capacity than pet tang et al 2021 further m cnts maintained their performance even in the presence of cod ammonium and phosphate materials tang et al 2021 magnetic nano fe3o4 could remove mps pe pp ps and pet via surface absorption as a large number of nano fe3o4 particles could be noticed on the superficial of mps fig 3 ii shi et al 2022 a study reported that co mn kaolin and fe kaolin could remove different types of nps including pcv ps pet and abs through electrostatic interaction and co mn kaolin depicted better sorption performance 22 mg g when compared to fe kaolin 13 68 mg g it was mainly because co mn kaolin had additional and bigger pores and a slightly higher surface area than fe kaolin fig 3 iii huang et al 2022 2 2 2 nanoplastics regarding nps the enquiry of tiwari et al 2020 reported that zn al ldh could completely remove 100 ps nps 80 nm notably the ftir findings witnessed the formation of the complex m o ps between zn al ldh and ps nps by replacing the m oh surface hydroxyl groups of ldh through electrostatic interactions because new peaks emerged at 1332 and 697 cm 1 after the sorption of ps nps on zn al ldh likewise sun et al 2022 integrated cellulose with mg al ldh and positively charged cellulose mg al ldh composite beads could efficiently remove 97 negatively charged ps nps 100 nm under optimal conditions via the combination of pore diffusion hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions mechanisms notably the ftir findings depicted that the band transferred from 3329 to 3313 cm 1 after the sorption demonstrated that the oh functional groups in the beads could adsorb ps nps via hydrogen bonds in addition a new peak was noticed near 925 cm 1 after the sorption and could be endorsed to electrostatic attraction further sem micrographs witnessed the attachment of ps nps on the surfaces and the pores of the beads subsequent in the development of polymers containing ps nps upon penetrating these pores due to the presence of electrostatic attraction further cuni carbon material cuni c could completely remove ps nps 100 nm within 24 h the isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics findings have described that the adsorption of ps nps on cuni c was due to the combination of physical adsorption monolayer coverage and electrostatic attraction zhou et al 2022 fe modified fly ash fa could adsorb 89 9 mg g ps nps 80 nm within 15 h via electrostatic attraction complexation and π π interaction in addition the stuck and entangled pores regulated the elimination of ps nps notably the fe oh delivered the oh that bonded with the cooh of ps nps via complexation as ensured via ftir analysis because the peak at 3148 cm 1 has shifted and amplified further the fe oxides adsorbed on ps nps by electrostatic attraction and formed fe oxides ps nps complex which declined the peak intensity at 553 580 cm 1 zhao et al 2022 recently urso et al 2022 narrated that γ fe2o3 pt tio2 microrobots could capture 97 ps cooh nps 50 nm within one min under uv light irradiation through electrostatic interactions due to the distinctive permutation of self propulsion and programmable zeta potential fig 3 iv notably sem micrographs endorsed the attachment of nps on the microrobot s surface including the slits between the formerly mxene s multi layer stacks thus depicting the multi layered design s efficacy and electrostatic capturing fig 4 i in contrast mxene microparticles could only trap 50 nps within 5 min urso et al 2022 metal based adsorbents have shown good removal performance and mps nps can be removed quickly in addition nps could enter the pores of the metal based adsorbents via pore diffusion importantly the interaction between adsorbents and mps nps mainly depended on the size of plastic particles and morphology of the adsorbents further none of the study investigated the influence of leached metals on the removal performance of adsorbents thus this point is demanding much attention 2 3 biochar based adsorbents researchers have used biochar based adsorbents to remove mps and nps from different environmental matrixes table 1 the porous morphology and active vacant sites of biochar are tunable and easy to assemble making biochar more suitable and less expensive than sponge based and metal based adsorbents for the adsorption of environmental pollutants magid et al 2021 various kinds of biochar have been prepared via different methods such as pyrolysis carbonization and impregnation using different types of biomasses sugarcane bagasse corncobs for the adsorption of mps and nps ganie et al 2021 singh et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2022 further some researchers have modified biochar by incorporating different metals mg zn and fe metal oxides fe3o4 and strong oxidizing agents hno3 h2so4 to enhance its sorption ability reactive functional groups mobility colloidal stability and recyclability magid et al 2021 singh et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 2 3 1 microplastics regarding mps iron modified biochar pyrolyzed at two different temperatures i e 550 c fb 550 and 850 c fb 850 could completely remove 99 negatively charged ps cooh and positively charged ps nh2 mps 1 µm in 10 min notably fb 850 have described higher sorption of ps cooh compared to ps nh2 owing to having a positive charge on the surface of adsorbent fb 850 in the presence of iron hydroxide functionalities with cooh mainly via acid base reaction in contrast fb 550 have shown higher sorption of ps nh2 as compared to ps cooh owing to having a negative charge on the surface of adsorbent fb 550 which created strong electrostatic attraction and complexation with fb 550 surface compared to fb 850 with phpzc at 5 8 further the ftir findings have revealed the complexation of mps with hydrophilic functional groups oh cooh of adsorbents via electrostatic interaction in addition π π conjugation and hydrophobicity of the mps and adsorbents also played an imperative role in the sorption of mps by fb composites singh et al 2021 likewise metal modified magnetic biochar could eradicate higher ps mps as compared to simple magnetic biochar mbc which indicated that the loading of metals mg and zn could enhance the capturing capability of ps mps by creating more positively charged active sites for the interaction of negatively charged ps mps on the surface of adsorbent via electrostatic and metal o ps bonds interactions verified by sem observations fig 4 ii wang et al 2021a 2 3 2 nanoplastics regarding nps the biochar bc prepared at 750 c demonstrated significantly higher ps nps 500 nm removal 99 when compared to biochar prepared at 350 and 550 c because bc 750 had higher zeta potential 10 to 20 mv and surface area 540 36 m2 g when compared to bc 350 20 mv 1 44 m2 g and this elevated electrostatic attraction between nps and biochar composites the self aggregation capability of bc 750 after nps interaction and mechanical interlocking between nps and biochar ganie et al 2021 notably sem images have revealed the entrapment of nps between the two bc 750 grains besides being electrostatically attracted towards biochar fig 4 iii likewise the iron modified biochar pyrolyzed at 850 c fb 850 have depicted higher removal of ps cooh nps 30 nm when compared to iron modified biochar pyrolyzed at 550 c fb 550 due to the manifestation of iron hydroxide functionalities on the composites surface as ensured via ftir analysis because a peak visible at 880 cm 1 which helped in creating stronger electrostatic interactions between fb 850 and ps cooh nps because fb 850 had higher phpzc value 5 8 than fb 550 3 3 singh et al 2021 likewise the enquiry of magid et al 2021 reported that the adsorption capacity of corncob biochar cb for ps nps significantly improved with boosted pyrolysis temperature and after ageing through oxidation by 5 of hno3 h2so4 because the hydrophobicity specific surface area and aromaticity of biochar improved with temperature while the quantities of oxygen containing groups and specific surface area improved after oxidation table 1 notably the ftir findings have represented that oh functional groups played an important role in the sorption of ps nps on the surface of biochar due to the formation of hydrogen bonding because the band at 3429 cm 1 oh and 1102 cm 1 c o c declined significantly after ps nps adsorption in addition the decline of the ether group c o c after ps nps adsorption is implicit the presence of hydrophobic interaction between biochar and ps nps because c o c groups are nonpolar magid et al 2021 recently zhu et al 2022 narrated that ps nps could adsorb on in the functional mesoporous biochar mbc and then the adsorbed ps nps on mbc could be hydrothermally degraded notably the bet findings have revealed that ps nps 100 nm could not penetrate the pores and cracks of mbc because the average pore diameter of mbc was 4 58 nm in comparison the zeta potential values indicated that negatively charged ps nps 34 5 mv could be adsorbed on positively charged mbc 6 mv via electrostatic attraction zhu et al 2022 further it was perceived from sem images that ps nps adsorbed on mbc could be degraded through catalytic hydrolysis and radicals due to various oxygen containing functional groups in mbc fig 4 iv notably the quenching experiments depicted that o2 and h performed a governing role in the degradation of ps nps overall biochar based adsorbent could remove 75 mps and nps and this removal efficiency could be improved up to 99 by modifying the fabrication protocol of biochar biochar based adsorbents are inexpensive environment friendly and can be fabricated in single step pyrolysis process with exploiting any expensive and toxic chemical 2 4 other developed adsorbents few researchers have used activated carbon waste materials and biopolymers as adsorbents to remove mps and nps for instance bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers prepared by cultivating komagataeibacter saccharivorans in stationary situations could retain 84 to 98 68 spherical ps mps 10 µm from contaminated water by creating an electrostatic barrier against the negatively charged ps mps particles faria et al 2022 notably wet bc biopolymers have revealed highest removal efficiency 98 63 0 39 being able to retain 9 47 0 03 mg l of ps mps 10 µm because they were highly hydrated due to availability of abundant oh groups for interaction with water molecules further freeze dried fd bc showed comparatively higher removal performance 96 45 2 22 than oven dried od bc biopolymers 93 04 2 07 because fd bc biopolymers kept a better porous structure compared to od bc biopolymers drying the biopolymers would significantly enhance logistics and implementation of practicality with removal efficiencies declining by only 2 6 in addition the as prepared bc biopolymers did not show any signs of degradation throughout the 20 filtration cycles maintaining outstanding high removal efficiencies despite flux diminution and pore clogging faria et al 2022 further sem micrographs have illustrated the adsorption of ps mps across the bc biopolymer s surface in addition fluorescence microscopy has disclosed that besides adsorbing on the bc biopolymers surface ps mps were also systematically integrated faria et al 2022 however it is important to comprehend how to augment culture conditions at an industrial level to fabricate cost effective bc biopolymers in addition experiments on wastewater samples would be required to recommend bc biopolymers based technology for commercial applications moreover coffee grounds biowaste could remove positively charged nps ps nh2 via electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding owing to the manifestation of abundant oxygen containing hydrophilic functional groups oh cooh on the superficial of coffee grounds yen et al 2022 granular activated carbon gac could adsorb ps nps 97 nm due to the presence of electrostatic interactions between the positively charged nps and negatively charged gac and larger size internal pores 10 to 15 μm for the penetration and settlement of nps within the inner surface of gac through pore diffusion arenas et al 2021 recently qu et al 2022 developed novel magnetic effervescent tablets using hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent des fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles sodium carbonate and tartaric acid and these developed tablets could remove 94 0 0 8 ps nps 100 nm within 3 5 min under optimal conditions via the combination of hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding mechanisms in addition the developed tablets have shown little impact on the environment as ensured by analytical ecological scale and the green analysis process index values further cigarette butts cgb could remove ps nps 50 nm more efficiently as compared to ps mps 500 nm because 50 nm ps nps depicted the lowest energy barrier and strong partition coefficients as compared to 500 nm ps mps for overcoming electrostatic repulsion and entering into the porous organic matrices el hadri et al 2021 however cigarette butts are nonbiodegradable toxic compounds are present in cigarettes including chromium lead nicotine cadmium formaldehyde arsenic copper and contain a variety of polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs which may eventually generate secondary pollutants in the environment 2 5 techniques used for understanding adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism of mps nps with adsorbents is dependent on the characteristics of adsorbents i e specific surface area morphology surface charge porosity surface functional groups the contaminants size shape chemical structure coordination sites nature of functional fractions and characteristics of the environmental medium salinity ph temperature concentrations etc sajid et al 2022 it was observed that modern machinery including ftir transmission electron microscopy tem scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray eds x ray diffraction xrd brunauer emmett teller bet x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps atomic force microscopy afm selected area electron diffraction saed etc have been employed to comprehend the function of adsorbent morphology and functional groups in the removal of mps and nps arenas et al 2021 el hadri et al 2021 ganie et al 2021 urso et al 2022 yen et al 2022 for instance the manifestation of new peaks the elimination of peaks alterations in peak strengths and the red blue swing of peaks in the ftir spectrum could give some idea about the attachment of mps nps with the reactive functional groups of the adsorbents singh et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 likewise sem images could modify the adsorbents morphology urso et al 2022 notably combining different techniques could give a thorough delineation of the adsorption mechanism huang et al 2022 sun et al 2022 furthermore to better explore the adsorption mechanism various kinds of adsorption isotherms models langmuir freundlich tempkin and dubinin radushkevich d r sip s and kinetics models pseudo first order pseudo second order kinetics intraparticle diffusion models have been utilized to estimate adsorption capacity removal efficiency and possible sorption mechanisms langmuir and freundlich isotherms were the two most frequently applied isotherm models the langmuir isotherm is based on the supposition of homogenous monolayer adsorbate dissemination over all the adsorbent surfaces comprising limited similar spots with comparable sorption activated energy while freundlich isotherm is based on the hypothesis of heterogenous sorption surface energy which is exploited to explain both monolayer and multilayer adsorptions on the other hand pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetics were the most often employed adsorption kinetic models the pseudo first order kinetic model believes that the adsorption rate depends on the divergence between the prompt adsorption capacity and the pivotal step that influences the adsorbate elimination process is mass transfer while the pseudo second order kinetic model presumes that chemical sorption is the pivotal step influencing the adsorbate ejection process it was noticed that the value of linear correlation coefficients r2 was the main indicator to express the suitability of the respective model in addition the value of adsorption intensity 1 n was also estimated by many researchers to explore the feasibility of the adsorption process table 1 depicted that the langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm are frequently correlated with the adsorption of mps nps on adsorbents few studies indicated that sip s isotherm which is a permutation of both langmuir and freundlich and dubinin radushkevich which is allied with a pore filling mechanism and describe physisorption on a heterogenous surface models are concomitant with the adsorption of mps nps on adsorbents tiwari et al 2020 yen et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 on the other hand most of the reports are explained by pseudo second order kinetics whereas a few are by general order pseudo first order and intraparticle diffusion kinetics models for instance the adsorption of ps ps cooh and ps nh2 mps on chgo sponge mainly followed the intraparticle diffusion kinetic model and the adsorption kinetic investigation recommended that the hydrogen bond electrostatic and π π interactions were the main driving force for mps adsorption due to the presence of carboxyl and amino groups on the surface of adsorbent and mps sun et al 2021 during the adsorption process mps first transmitted from water to the surface of the sponges and then mps steadily permeated the core of sponges and finally the adsorption process gradually approached equilibrium when the diffusion rate declined with the diminution of the concentration of mps in the water arenas et al 2021 sun et al 2021 sun et al 2022 further the adsorption of pvc ps pet and abs mps on co mn kaolin mainly obeyed the pseudo first order kinetic model which hinted that the diffusion step controlled the adsorption in addition the freundlich isotherms model had a higher r2 value than the langmuir isotherms model implicit the heterogeneity nature of the adsorbent and or presence of multilayer adsorption huang et al 2022 similarly the adsorption of mps on aerogels was suitable for freundlich isotherm model thus demonstrated the uneven and multilayered forces on the surface of aerogels this also indicated the presence of other forces such as the physical adhesion of polydopamine as well as hydrogen bonding and π π interaction between chitosan and mps in addition to electrostatic interactions zheng et al 2022 likewise the adsorption behavior of ps nps on zn al ldh was well matched with general order kinetic and freundlich isotherm models suggested the multilayer stacking with the non ideal nature of sorption tiwari et al 2020 notably the rate constants kd1 acquired for ps nps in lake geneva water were superior than those for ultrapure water owing to aggregation and sedimentation whereas kd2 indicated that internal diffusion was less efficient in lake geneva water arenas et al 2021 overall different adsorbents depicted distinct adsorption mechanisms mainly depended on the morphology chemical composition effective binding sites of the adsorbents and characteristics of the environmental media and mps nps 3 influence of pertinent factors on the adsorptive removal of microplastics and nanoplastics various factors such as characteristics of adsorbents properties of mps and nps reaction temperature solution ph natural organic matter nom and co existing ions can influence the removal performance efficiencies of adsorbents against mps and nps 3 1 characteristics of adsorbents the attributes of the adsorbents such as surface area porosity morphology and surface charge can stimulus the elimination efficiency against mps and nps various researchers investigated the stimulus of adsorbents characteristics on the ejection of mps and nps by modifying the surface charge and morphology of the adsorbents for instance chgo sponge could remove higher mps 88 9 as compared to the plant protein based sponge 81 2 due to the presence of stronger electrostatic and π π interactions on go sun et al 2021 despite this truth the plant protein based sponge had a much better interconnected porous structure than the chgo sponge which rapidly helped the sponge remove 38 mps within 10 seconds wang et al 2021b further the loading of different kinds of nanoparticles could significantly enhance the active sites on the surfaces of adsorbents for instance pdms grafted fe3o4 particle based sponge could remove approximately 100 mps in 5 min because of having higher porosity surface area and reactive functional groups on the sponge rong et al 2022 likewise the loading of o c3n4 could enhance the removal capability 90 and water absorption capacity of the sponge sun et al 2021 as compared to chgo sponge 88 9 sun et al 2020 notably a positively charged o c3n4 based sponge could remove positively charged ps nh2 mps due to the conjugation effect between the lone electron pairs in n atoms and the benzene ring for π π interactions sun et al 2021 further a hygroscopic nanocellulose network could enhance the removal of nps because nps could enter into the inner core of the hydrogel via cohesion pores diffusion and capillary forces leppänen et al 2022 likewise functionalized spion nanoparticles could capture higher mps than nano fe3o4 particles due to stronger electrostatic interaction and additional hydrophobic and van der waals interactions between mps and functionalized spion sarcletti et al 2021 shi et al 2022 further co mn kaolin achieved higher adsorptive capacity 22 mg g than fe kaolin 13 68 mg g due to having a higher surface area and pores huang et al 2022 notably γ fe2o3 pt tio2 microrobots could capture higher nps 97 as compared to mxene mps 50 due to having stronger electrostatic interaction and multi layer stacks morphology urso et al 2022 moreover higher pyrolysis temperature could significantly improve the surface area porosity and active sites on the surfaces of biochar which eventually enhanced the removal capability of biochar as compared to biochar prepared at lower pyrolysis temperatures ganie et al 2021 singh et al 2021 in addition the anchoring of metals and aging of biochar significantly improved the mps and nps adsorption due to having higher specific surface area and oxygen containing groups wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2022 overall different kinds of modifications would create various interaction forces for the efficient adsorption of mps and nps 3 2 characteristics of microplastics nanoplastics the attributes of mps nps such as size shape chemical structure and chemical composition can influence the removal performance of adsorbents some researchers investigated these aspects for instance smaller size pp mps 6 5 μm could attach to both the internal pores and the skeleton of the sponge as compared to larger size pp mps 150 μm because the abundant porosity in the inner sponge could produce capillary forces that helped the entry of small particles into internal pores of sponge during the adsorption process likewise pvc mps 150 μm could penetrate the sponge pores more easily than spherical pe mps 250 μm due to the size effect and coincident with minor hydrogen bond interaction between the oxygen atom of pdms molecule and the hydrogen atom of pe molecule rong et al 2022 similarly ps nps 100 nm could diffuse deeper into the hydrogel when rivaled to the ps mps 1 µm and cnf hydrogels had a considerably higher capability to capture ps nps than ps mps leppänen et al 2022 further the elimination efficiency of large 900 μm and small 200 μm mps was greater than medium 500 μm mps in artificial seawater by nano fe3o4 in addition the mean removal rate of mps pe pp ps and pet was comparatively high than that of ultrapure water it might be because electrostatic interaction between mps and nano fe3o4 was dominant in seawater which would be different from hydrophobic interaction in ultrapure water shi et al 2022 surprisingly anionic tempo cnf film depicted higher removal efficacy for anionic ps nps than cationic ps nps because anionic ps nps could enter the nanocellulose network more efficiently to have low attractive energy between negatively charged surfaces in contrast cationic ps nps could attach on the surface of anionic tempo cnf film due to having high attractive power between oppositely charged surfaces but this could impede the particles to diffuse or penetrate inside the network leppänen et al 2022 further pvdf has shown higher removal 91 4 as compared to ps 42 5 on zif 8 aerogel because the c f on pvdf established hydrogen bonds with oh in cellulose you et al 2021 likewise the adsorption of pe on m cnt could be endorsed by the hydrophobic interactions in contrast the adsorption of pet could be attributed to the hydrophobic interaction and π π electron conjugate system between pet mps and m cnt due to the presence of highly polarized π electron cloud on carbon nanotube surfaces while the adsorption of pa was mainly due to the π π electron interaction complexation electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bond interaction because pa polar polymer had good hydrophilicity owing to the manifestation of a large number of amide groups on the molecular chain and pa could dissociate more cooh than amine groups at neutral conditions revealing negative surface charge whereas m cnts were positively charged because of the presence of fe3o4 on the surface also fe3o4 could make complex with the cooh on the m cnts and the hydrogen bonds between the pa amide groups and the m cnts tang et al 2021 notably the higher adsorption capacities of pe and pet than pa by m cnts depicted that hydrophobic interaction between pe pet and m cnts was much stronger than the electrostatic and complexation adsorption between pa and m cnts further the superior crystallinity of pe compared with pet began with higher hydrophobic interaction and resulted from higher adsorption capacity than pet tang et al 2021 the elimination rate of pet mps 200 μm was significantly lower than that of the other three types of mps including pe pp and ps because pet mps had higher density lower crystallinity and weakest hydrophobicity compared to other mps shi et al 2022 further the shape of mps can also influence the removal performance for instance the elimination rates of pe mps 200 μm particles fibers films and foams were 86 87 6 92 93 09 6 63 99 56 0 68 and 99 35 1 13 respectively by nano fe3o4 this might be due to the variations in agglomeration behavior of mps in water and interaction of mps surfaces and fe3o4 particles among size different mps shi et al 2022 overall characteristics of mps nps size shape surface charge chemical composition and structure could affect the removal performance by altering removal mechanisms 3 3 solution ph the ph of the solution dramatically influences the adsorbent s performance because it can change the charge of reactive functional groups on the surfaces of the adsorbent and the chemical status of pollutants in the solution various researchers investigated the impact of solution ph on the execution of different adsorbents against mps and nps the zeta potential and phpzc values of the adsorbents and plastic particles were essential to optimize the removal performance of adsorbents against specific mps nps because these values would decide the manifestation of electrostatic attraction between adsorbent and mps nps and the presence of competitive ions h oh in the system for instance the aerogel achieved maximum adsorption capacity at ph 7 at the same time it decreased when the ph improved or declined because the content of h in the solution increased under acidic ph and the cationic groups of the amended aerogel had the same charge as the mps which dwindled the adsorbable active sites of aerogel in contrast the presence of anion oh resulted from interference to negatively charged mps under alkaline ph and reduced the adsorption capacity zhuang et al 2022 likewise the chgo sponge achieved maximum removal 92 9 at ph 6 while the lowest 43 7 was observed at ph 10 because oh could compete with negative charge ps mps for the active sites at higher ph in the case of ps cooh mps the removal efficacy significantly declined at ph 8 because of a competitive effect between ps cooh and oh similarly h created a competitive effect for ps nh2 mps at ph 4 which inhibited removal efficiency sun et al 2020 similarly the lowest elimination performance of ps ps cooh and ps nh2 mps 1 µm was noticed at ph 10 mainly due to the competitive adsorption between oh and mps in addition the presence of h inhibited the elimination efficiency of ps nh2 mps by chitin based sponges at ph 4 sun et al 2021 further pda mcs aerogels retained removal performance at the ph range of 6 to 9 in contrast removal efficiency declined 20 at ph 10 because of the presence of competition between oh and negatively charged pet mps for active sites on aerogels under alkaline conditions indicating that electrostatic interaction was an imperative mechanism zheng et al 2022 likewise a sponge prepared by plant based protein depicted a decline in removal efficacy when ph decreased to 4 and increased to 10 because a higher negative charge on the surface of the sponge could attract more water molecules instead of ps mps and this phenomenon eventually diminished the hydrophobic interaction between sponge and ps mps wang et al 2021b further 3d oldh could maintain approximately 80 removal of ps nps 80 nm at ph 3 5 while the elimination reached up to 95 in the range of ph 7 11 notably 3d oldh could remove 60 ps nps even at ph 1 and 13 because the presence of graphitic carbon in g ldo700 could protect ldo at acid and alkaline ph surprisingly the higher removal of ps nps at ph 9 hinted at the sight of other dominant interactions i e hydrogen bonding π π conjunction and π π interaction because the surface charge of both ps nps and 3d oldh was negative due to having negative zeta potential values 5 to 32 mv peng et al 2022 moreover m cnts depicted the highest removal efficiency at ph 7 however the adsorption capacity of pe and pet declined under alkaline conditions due to the configuration of acidic oxygen containing groups on the surface of m cnts which declined the hydrophobicity and destabilized the hydrophobic interaction between m cnts and pe pet mps in contrast the adsorption of pa on m cnts diminished significantly only in a strongly acidic environment due to greater electrostatic repulsion between dissociable amine groups of pa and positively charged m cnts despite this truth pa had dissociable carboxylic groups in alkaline conditions which rivaled with hydroxide ions for the vacant sites and led to a minor decline in adsorption performance tang et al 2021 further the adsorption ability of co mn kaolin against nps pcv ps pet and abs declined significantly with the rise of ph from 3 to 12 because oh competed with nps for active sites on co mn kaolin in contrast fe kaolin adsorbed more nps with the rise of ph from 3 to 10 because the production of positively charged iron hydroxide colloid could enhance the sorption of negatively charged nps even with the increase of the concentration of oh however the sorption ability was significantly inhibited at ph 10 because of the formation of iron hydroxide precipitation rather than colloid huang et al 2022 similarly cuni c showed the lowest removal efficiency of ps nps 100 nm at ph 9 owing to electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged cuni c and ps nps in addition oh the content was greater at ph 9 and they could compete with ps nps for active adsorption sites zhou et al 2022 further the alkaline condition ph 9 significantly declined the sorption of ps nps on the exterior of zn al ldh due to improved competitive binding and destabilization of ldh because the phpzc of zn al ldh was above ph 10 while the ps nps were highly negatively charged in the experimented ph range hence the zeta potential of zn al ldh declined due to the deprotonation of surface hydroxyl groups and was near zero at ph 9 where electrostatic interaction was minimum tiwari et al 2020 likewise cellulose mg al ldh composite beads performed well under acidic and neutral conditions ph 2 7 because positively charged beads could strongly attract negatively charged ps nps however the removal gradually declined under alkaline conditions ph 8 11 because the negative charge on the surface of the beads lessened the electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged ps nps and directed to a state of mutual revulsion as ensured by zeta potential values sun et al 2022 further the sorption performance of ps nps 80 nm significantly boosted from 58 3 to 89 9 mg g at the ph range of 3 7 owing to positive charge on the surface of iron modified fly ash under an acidic condition which robustly attracted the negatively charged ps nps by forming acidic o containing groups and reducing hydrophobic interaction in contrast iron modified fly ash depicted the lowest adsorption performance for ps nps in an alkaline condition owing to electrostatic repulsion and surface complexation zhao et al 2022 moreover zn mbc depicted higher removal performance 97 5 in acidic and neutral ph and marginally lower 95 81 in an alkalescent ph because zno particles were negatively charged in alkaline ph ensuing the poor electrostatic attraction of mps wang et al 2021a notably solution ph did not influence the elimination efficacy of ps cooh mps ps nh2 mps by fb 550 and fb 850 in ph 3 5 9 5 it could be endorsed to the mutual effect of electrostatic attraction owing to heterogeneous charge dissemination on composite surfaces and surface complexation however higher removal of ps cooh nps 30 nm was detected in the acidic ph because of the aggregation these aggregates of nps could rapidly adsorb on the active sites of the adsorbent singh et al 2021 further the biochar prepared at 750 bc 750 demonstrated significantly lower ps nps removal efficiency at highly alkaline conditions ph 8 owing to having strong electrostatic repulsion between nps and bc 750 because phpzc of bc 750 was 4 7 ganie et al 2021 the adsorption of ps nps on corncob biochar declined with the rise of ph 5 because of the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged biochar and ps nps further the cation bridging effect was also noticed during the adsorption of ps nps on corncob biochar cb in the range of ph 3 to 5 owing to the interface of multivalent cations al3 ca2 and mg2 and biochar as well as with ps nps notably this cation bridging effect disappeared at ph 5 due to the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged biochar and ps nps on the other hand this cation bridging effect was also absent in the aged biochars because washing eliminated the acid magid et al 2021 in contrast coffee grounds biowaste depicted good adsorption capacity for ps nh2 nps 100 nm under alkaline conditions it might be because of the utilization of a high concentration 25 g l of coffee ground biowaste under alkaline conditions yen et al 2022 different adsorbents exhibited different removal capabilities at different solution ph due to their different phpzc and zeta potential values 3 4 reaction temperature the reaction temperature can influence the diffusion rate of mps nps and sorption capacity for instance it was noticed that the adsorption capacity of modified cellulose aerogel first increased with the rise of temperature up to 35 c and then declined by further increasing temperature from 35 to 65 c thus demonstrated the defect of physical adsorption zhuang et al 2022 fe kaolin could adsorb more nps pcv ps pet and abs with the rise in reaction temperature because the values of δg of nps adsorbed by fe kaolin declined from 7 02 to 3 49 kj mol with the increase in temperature from 293 15 to 313 15 k moreover the sorption behavior of nps on fe kaolin was endothermic because both δh and δs were more significant than zero co mn kaolin removed more nps with the decline of the reaction temperature because the values of δg of nps adsorbed by co mn kaolin boosted from 2 84 to 7 03 kj mol with the rise of the temperature from 293 15 to 313 15 k besides the sorption behavior of nps on co mn kaolin was exothermic because both δh and δs were less than zero huang et al 2022 while different reaction temperatures 15 25 and 40 c did not stimulus the removal efficacy of ps cooh mps ps nh2 mps by fb 550 and fb 850 as the decline in gibbs energy value was noticed leading to faster interaction and improved elimination singh et al 2021 different adsorbents showed different behaviors at different reaction temperatures due to their different natural chemical compositions 3 5 natural organic matter the manifestation of natural organic matter nom can influence the removal performance of adsorbents because it can attach to the surfaces of either plastic particles or adsorbents via electrostatic hydrophobic and π π interactions they can obstruct the adsorption process owing to steric hindrances and exertion of stability impact on plastic particles few researchers investigated the sway of nom on the removal performance of distinctive adsorbents against mps nps for instance a chitin based sponge has shown resistance against dom and the removal efficiency of ps ps cooh and ps nh2 mps 1 µm was slightly reduced in the manifestation of dom sun et al 2021 likewise humic acid ha did not intrude with ps mps adsorption which indicated that the adhesive surface was not fouled by water soluble hydrophobic materials chazovachii et al 2021 in contrast nom could decline the removal efficiency of zn mbc by creating direct competition between mps and nom during adsorption wang et al 2021a likewise ha also impacted the removal of negatively and positively charged mps by fb 550 and fb 850 and least affected the elimination of ps cooh mps compared to ps nh2 mps because amine functionalized mps with lone pairs could conjugate with ha rapidly through π π conjugation notably ha significantly inhibited the sorption of ps cooh nps 30 nm even at ha concentrations 5 mg l due to the rapid adsorption of ha on nps which led nps to steric stabilization and declined the electrostatic interaction between nps and adsorbent singh et al 2021 similarly the manifestation of ha significantly dropped the removal efficiency of ps nps by bc 750 even at a modest concentration 1 mg l this reduction could be ascribed to the steric hindrances caused by ha directing to declined heteroaggregation of nps and coating of ha on the surfaces of nps and bc 750 created very strong electrostatic repulsion which exerted a stabilizing effect on negative charged nps and declined removal percentage ganie et al 2021 recently sun et al 2022 narrated that ha significantly inhibited ps nps sorption on the cellulose mg al ldh composite beads because negatively charged ha developed electrostatic interactions with the positively charged beads impeding the sorption sites on the beads and thus hindering the adsorption of ps nps on the beads sun et al 2022 overall different adsorbents have presented different removal behavior in the presence of nom due to their morphology and tolerance capability against nom 3 6 co existing interfering ions the presence of cations and anions can influence the adsorption process by creating competition to obtain vacant sites on surfaces of adsorbents table 2 described various cations and anions used to examine the effect of co existing ions on the performance of different adsorbents against mps nps removal for instance the presence of cl significantly declined the adsorption performance of aerogel against ps mps because the greater content of cl protected the cationic group zhuang et al 2022 in contrast common competitive anions i e cl co3 2 and no3 did not influence the removal performance of 3d oldh against ps nps peng et al 2022 further the presence of cl declined the sorption of mps pcv ps pet and abs by co mn kaolin owing to the presence of competition between nps and cl for obtaining vacant sites notably cl first declined the sorption of mps by fe kaolin but when the concentration of cl amplified to a certain extent then cl stimulated the adsorption of the mps owing to the configuration of ferric chloride on the surface of fe kaolin because ferric chloride could generate positively charged ferric hydroxide colloid after hydrolysis which promoted sorption of negatively charged mps on fe kaolin huang et al 2022 thus it would be better to dechlorinate adsorbents before using them for the adsorption of mps nps further the manifestation of hco3 significantly declined the elimination efficiency of ps nps by cuni c because the hydrolysis of hco3 generated oh which altered zeta potential of ps nps 16 6 mv and cuni c 5 24 mv and this eventually enhanced the electrostatic repulsion in the system zhou et al 2022 further the presence of so4 2 and po4 2 drastically declined the sorption performance of ps nps by zn al ldh where 2 of removal was noticed this indicated that so4 2 and po4 3 had a higher specific affinity towards ldh than ps nps tiwari et al 2020 likewise the incidence of po4 3 considerably inhibited the removal efficiency ps mps by zn mbc because of having higher charge density than ps mps wang et al 2021a the manifestation of 5 mm concentration of hco3 noticeably dropped the ejection percentage 50 of ps nps by bc 750 this could be explained in this way that hco3 acted as a buffer and altered solution ph towards basic nature at which biochar acquired more net negative charge resulting in the repulsion of nps because the solution demonstrated an abrupt transformation of ph from 5 5 to 8 6 ganie et al 2021 further the adsorption capacity of ps cooh mps declined marginally with fb 550 and fb 850 in the occurrence of po4 3 further interfering ions did not impact the removal of ps nh2 mps by fb 550 and fb 850 due to the strong inner sphere complexation of mps with an adsorbent surface notably the presence of interfering ions significantly improved the sorption of ps cooh nps 30 nm onto fb 550 and fb 850 because of having charge screening effect and self aggregation which strongly bonded nps with the available sites on the adsorbent singh et al 2021 thus size along with the surface charge of the plastic particles would also influence the sorption behavior in the presence of interfering ions the presence of ca2 significantly dropped the adsorption performance of ps nps 80 nm by iron modified fly ash owing to ion exchange interaction between fe ions and ca2 on the surface of adsorbents while other cations mg2 na and k did not inhibit removal performance in contrast the existence of no3 2 and po4 2 substantially declined the removal of ps nps by iron modified fly ash adsorbent due to having a relatively high charge density than ps nps zhao et al 2022 likewise sun et al 2022 reported that the removal effect of ps nps by cellulose mg al ldh composite beads significantly inhibited the increase of ionic strength and the influence trend of ions was cacl2 nacl kcl notably the effect of divalent cations ca2 was more significant than that of monovalent anions na and k due to higher double layer compression and the combination of ca2 with the negatively charged functional groups of ps nps further the adsorption capacity of the beads significantly declined with the increased concentration of so4 2 which obstructed the positively charged vacant active sites of the beads sun et al 2022 overall different adsorbents indicated different removal performances in the presence of co existing ions due to their unique morphology charge screening effect and self aggregation attributes 4 regeneration and reusability of the developed adsorbents regeneration and reusability for adsorbents are often considered important to transfer adsorption based technology from lab scale to commercial applications regarding this various researchers have examined the regeneration and reusability potential of the developed adsorbents against mps nps removal it can be noticed that ethanol solution has been used to regenerate sponge aerogel based adsorbents table 3 most of the sponge based adsorbents could be reused for up to 3 to 5 consecutive treatment cycles and they could maintain their removal performance in the range of 60 80 depending on the initial concentration of plastic particles size adsorbent dosage and the number of the consecutive treatment cycle table 3 notably fe3o4 pdms halloysite pdms pdms coated sponge could be reused for up to 50 consecutive treatment cycles and maintain more than 99 removal efficiency rong et al 2022 further metal based adsorbents could be regenerated using various solutions i e ethanol naoh and water and thermal treatment noticeably metal based adsorbents showed good reusability performance about 8 12 decrease in removal efficiency was noticed up to five 05 consecutive treatment cycles further biochar based adsorbents could be regenerated using water acetone and thermal pyrolysis biochar based adsorbents showed remarkably high reusability performance up to 4 to 5 consecutive treatment cycles approximately 4 5 decline in removal efficiency was observed after regenerating by the thermal pyrolysis method because thermal treatment could completely degrade the adsorbed plastic particles from the surface and pores of biochar owing to having catalytic properties of biochar in the meantime thermal treatment could replenish the porosity and surface area of the biochar based adsorbents wang et al 2021a in summary different adsorbents depicted different reusability potentials due to their diverse chemical composition and the employment of different regeneration solutions techniques 5 practical application of the developed adsorbents practical application of the developed adsorbents is essential to transfer proposed adsorption based technology from laboratory scale to industrial implementations because natural water is more variable and authentic than ultrapure water used in the laboratory natural water samples usually enclose a variety of contaminants salts heavy metals toxic dyes natural organic matter and micropollutants which may alter the elimination performance of the proposed adsorbents regarding this researchers compared the removal performances of the proposed adsorbents by applying them to natural waters including river water lake water seawater domestic wastewater groundwater industrial wastewater hard water and drainage water table 4 for instance the removal efficiency of pet pe and ps mps by pda mcs reached 97 3 94 6 and 92 3 respectively in river water and drainage water however in ultrapure water the elimination efficiency of pet pe and ps mps was 91 6 35 and 46 respectively this difference in removal efficiencies could be endorsed to electrostatic interactions because non negatively charged mps pe and ps could act as a medium to adsorb ions and organic pollutants from natural waters they could transform their surface charge into negative then these negatively charged mps could attach to the surface of positively charged pda mcs aerogel via electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding and π π interactions zheng et al 2022 likewise spion systems improved their removal performance against mps ps pmma and mr in river water samples and it was projected that the presence of small molecule organic soaps herbicides or has could contribute to balancing unfavorable surface charges after adsorption on the surface of adsorbent sarcletti et al 2021 similarly 3d oldh could remove 90 ps nps 80 nm from lake water and tap water which was equivalent to adsorption performance in deionized water 96 in addition the removal efficiency of ps nps could reach up to 75 in industrial wastewater peng et al 2022 further pei ce sponge could remove approximately 98 nps pmma pvc and pvac within 30 min from commercial body scrub samples batool and valiyaveettil 2021 similarly zif 8 aerogel could remove 92 5 and 88 7 of pvdf and ps nps respectively from seawater samples you et al 2021 further fe2o3 mno2 core shell micromotors could remove over 10 pe mps within 2 h from wastewater through the synergy of catalytic degradation surface adsorption and adsorptive bubbles separations mechanisms ye et al 2021 m cnts could eradicate 100 mps pe pet and pa from kitchen wastewater within 300 min tang et al 2021 more than 80 removal of mps pe and pes was achieved when nano fe3o4 adsorbent was employed to river water domestic sewage and seawater samples shi et al 2022 in contrast a sharp decline in removal efficiency 53 of ps mps was noticed by zn mbc in the case of river water due to the incidence of abundant nom because nom could create direct competition during the adsorption process in addition the low removal performance 52 of zn mbc in the case of wastewater was mainly due to the presence of anionic dyes which could compete for positively charged vacant sites and chunk the small micropores owing to their smaller molecular sizes wang et al 2021a likewise the sorption of ps cooh and ps nh2 mps 1 µm by fb 550 and fb 850 depicted the removal trend as freshwater tap water groundwater due to having higher ionic strength of groundwater 18 97 103 m compared to tap water 14 78 103 m and freshwater 1 28 103 m however the quantity of nom content was higher in groundwater greater ionic strength had a leading effect singh et al 2021 further zn al ldh depicted the highest elimination of ps cooh nps 55 nm in the case of synthetic freshwater because of the self aggregation of nps owing to the presence of diverse ionic species in comparison zn al ldh depicted the lowest removal of nps in the case of synthetic hard water owing to competitive site binding by the high concentrations of anionic species which could decline the stability of ldh under alkaline conditions ph 8 in addition the coating of nom on the superficial of ldh could provide an additional stabilization effect via electrostatic repulsion in the system tiwari et al 2020 further the eradication of ps nps by bc 750 followed the order of groundwater 98 river water 75 wastewater 25 the low removal percentage in river water was mainly due to bicarbonate ions which altered the solution ph towards alkaline conditions ph 8 3 in contrast steric hindrances caused by a high concentration of dissolved organic carbon content sucrose extremely impacted the removal of ps nps in wastewater noticeably the high ionic strength of groundwater 1 7 10 2 m compared to river water 0 3 10 2 m caused higher homoaggregation of nps in groundwater this phenomenon played a key role in the adsorption process via the bridging effect owing to the incidence of high ca2 concentration in groundwater 80 16 mg l compared to river water 18 49 mg l although the ionic strength of wastewater was very high 7 9 10 1 m as rivaled to river water and groundwater however owing to the various high steric hindrances caused by high dissolved organic carbon concentration resulted from low interaction between ps nps and bc 750 ganie et al 2021 a team of investigators reported similar findings that the incidence of nom and divalent ions could decline the removal of ps nps on gac in lake water because of the development of large aggregates via bridging effects and these larger size aggregates could not penetrate the gac pores arenas et al 2021 in summary the co presence pollutants significantly inhibited the expected removal performance of the developed adsorbents thus pre optimization of environmental conditions or integration of adsorption based technology with other techniques coagulation filtration membrane bioreactor would be required to gain maximum removal efficiency at minimum operating expenses 6 barriers to market penetrations studies have indicated that various novel adsorbents have been established and utilized to remove mps and nps from contaminated waters table 1 however none of the developed adsorbents has been transferred from laboratory scale to commercial level to date because the selection of adsorbent is dependent on many factors including fabrication expenses accessibility the seriousness of targeted pollutant stability recovery functional design environmental risks removal performance regeneration and reusability etc table 5 represents the pros and cons of the developed adsorbents used for the remediation of mps and nps from polluted waters it can be noticed that most of the adsorbents were fabricated using expensive and toxic chemicals which would eventually increase the treatment cost in addition most of the developed adsorbents were a mixture of different metals excluding some sponge aerogel based adsorbents thus they can generate secondary pollutants in the environment after breakdown because of the leaching of metals and nanoparticles notably some adsorbents e g sponge aerogel could be biodegraded in the soil but the adsorbed plastic particles may negatively impact the soil environment no one has highlighted this point thus it should be considered in future investigations to better implement adsorbent based technology for the remediation of mps and nps likewise the adsorbents can develop new pollutants after interacting with other co presence pollutants in real sewage and this phenomenon would eventually alter the adsorbents performance and their fate in natural water environments on the other hand various technologies including coagulation granular media filtration or membrane processes photocatalysis and bioremediation have also been employed to eliminate mps and nps from contaminated waters chen et al 2022c however certain limitations owing to their mechanisms and the nature of treatment methods have hindered their practical implementations despite promising removal performance efficiencies energy utilization and incompetence in removing small sized plastic particles nps are the typical limitations of all the proposed treatment technologies golgoli et al 2021 for instance granular media filtration or membrane processes mbr and uf have shown excellent performance in removing plastic particles and these processes have been executed in many wastewater treatment plants enfrin et al 2020 however membrane fouling is an unavoidable problem for all membrane based processes eventually leading to the deterioration of separation performance and increased operational costs in terms of frequent membrane cleaning and replacement li et al 2021 li et al 2020 further the co presence of other pollutants including metal ions biological matter and natural organic matter can intensify the fouling tendency for instance some mps could tend to motivate microbial activity and result in the generation of extracellular polymeric substances thus promoting the development of biofilms and exaggerating biofouling xiong et al 2021 notably the fitting of pretreatment technologies including ozonation coagulation and uv chlorin could efficiently reduce membrane fouling susceptibility however these techniques have their own demerits as well du et al 2019 wan et al 2021 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 for example the deposit of al based coagulants in the remedied water is neurotoxic and can cause harmful human health consequences kimura et al 2013 in addition a substantial quantity of coagulants and polymeric essences has also been identified in the effluents owing to their heavy usage in the coagulation process further bioremediation by bacteria fungi enzymes and microalgae is assumed to be an environment friendly and cost effective treatment technology for mps and nps in addition it can be done in both in situ and ex situ conditions however the implementation of this technique is largely limited because of having comparatively low elimination efficiency even after a lengthy treatment time however the employment of genetically modified organisms could efficiently enhance the biodegradation rate jaiswal et al 2020 however the unquantifiable negative impacts introduced by genetically modified organisms on the environment are still unknown further the photocatalysis technique has shown the potential to completely mineralize mps without producing byproducts however the cost and energy depletion of photocatalysis is comparatively high when compared to traditional treatment technologies patil et al 2022 although the optimization of operational parameters and development of low cost photocatalysts can increase the mps nps degradation performance however some situations such as sustaining the solution temperature at 0ºc are considered impractical for the actual application ariza tarazona et al 2020 therefore under these circumstances adsorption can be one of the capable technologies for eliminating mps and nps from the water environment because a variety of novel adsorbents can be fabricated via different methods to improve adsorption techniques for targeted removal of mps nps in addition surface modification of adsorbents not only enhances their firmness and dispersibility but also supports to expedite the integration of adsorption technology with other technologies i e coagulation membrane bioreactor filtration to gain maximum removal at a minimum operational cost for instance nano adsorbents were integrated within the bulk polymeric membrane matrix to develop nanocomposite membrane to remove organic pollutants gupta et al 2021 such adsorbents based integrated membrane processes should also be examined for the elimination of mps nps because of the presence of abundant hydrophilic functional groups oh cooh which may enhance the performance capability of membrane process to capture even smaller size plastic polymers nps which could easily pass through membrane pores sun et al 2020 likewise integrating nano adsorbent carbon nanotube within polymeric membrane could improve ultrahigh water penetration flux under a low driving pressure goh et al 2013 as it can minimize the energy footprint of the membrane process without conceding the output of the method further it was observed that none of the available studies could highlight the end use of retrieved mps nps acquired from the regeneration process of adsorption thus the treatment of collected mps nps is important to minimize their adverse impacts on the environment and to propose adsorbent based technology commercially for this purpose adsorption technology can be integrated with post degradation technologies i e electrocatalysis biodegradation photocatalysis thermal degradation and advanced oxidation processes to minimize environmental footprint of mps nps pollution in addition the collected mps nps can be transferred into valuable products h2o carbon nanoparticles co2 green hydrogen gas and trim chain monomers chen et al 2022a wang et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 7 conclusions knowledge gaps and future recommendations published articles have indicated that novel adsorbents have been prepared via different fabrication routes and they can efficiently remove both microplastics and nanoplastics from synthetic and real sewage however considerable knowledge gaps still subsist recommending enduring debates to confirm water safety therefore the major conclusions knowledge gaps and looming perspectives of this critical review are as follows 1 innovations in the development of promising adsorbents the sponge aerogel based adsorbents have great potential in removing microplastics and nanoplastics from polluted waters due to their unique porous morphology and diverse reactive functional groups notably sponge aerogel can remove higher nanoplastics than microplastics because nanoplastics could enter the sponge s internal network due to attractive energy differences and capillary diffusion forces in addition the reactive sites can be increased by loading different nanoparticles into sponge aerogel notably biomass based fabricated sponge aerogel can be biodegraded thus can minimize the generation of secondary pollutants in the environment both microplastics and nanoplastics can attach to the surfaces of metal based adsorbents through diverse interactions forces surface complexation hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction ion exchange etc depending on the type of plastic particles and adsorbents morphology subsequently they can also develop agglomerates in the water environment notably small size plastic particles nanoplastics can also enter the pores of the metal based adsorbents via pore diffusion notably metal based adsorbents can also adsorb on the surfaces of microplastics indicating that both possibilities are existed depending on the size of plastic particles and the morphology of the adsorbents thus these adsorbents can completely remove micro nanoplastics from the water environment it is observed that biochar based adsorbents can remove 75 microplastics and nanoplastics from polluted waters notably the increase in pyrolysis temperature incorporation of metals and metal oxides and biochar ageing can boost this removal efficiency up to 99 both positively charged and negatively charged microplastics and nanoplastics can be removed using biochar based adsorbents due to their unique porous morphology and diverse reactive functional groups further the adsorbed plastic particles on biochar can be further completely degraded via catalytic hydrolysis it was observed that different kinds of adsorbents were employed for removal of microplastics 0 105 1240 μm and nanoplastics 30 100 nm therefore microplastics 1240 μm and nanoplastics 30 nm should also be used in future inspections to better realize the remediation of microplastics and nanoplastics by adsorption technology so far laboratory made virgin and surface functionalized plastic polymers are subjected to examine their removal using different kinds of advanced adsorbents thus other plastic polymers should also be utilized to better understand the remediation potential by adsorption technology till now isotherm kinetics model equations and modern machinery have been devoted to understand the adsorption mechanisms it was noticed that different adsorbents have shown distinct adsorption mechanisms which mainly depended on the characteristics of adsorbents medium and plastics particles thus computational studies like density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations should also be considered to better understand the role of functional groups in removing microplastics and nanoplastics because artificial factors can control surface chemistry none of the researcher has yet reported cost analysis calculations thus cost analysis studies should be performed in future experiments to better explicate the practical feasibility of advanced adsorbents at commercial levels although biochar based adsorbents are inexpensive environment friendly and can be fabricated in a single step pyrolysis without using expensive and toxic chemicals however more research efforts are required for increasing the cost effectiveness of adsorbents by investigating the performance of other waste materials e g fly ash clay biowaste etc such as coffee grounds and cigarette butts in addition artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques should also be employed to evaluate the fabrication of adsorbents with desired attributes for gaining maximum removal performance by investing minimum expenditures 2 influence of pertinent factors both microplastics and nanoplastics removal can be improved by altering fabrication protocols and after incorporation of different kinds of nanoparticles metals metal oxides and acids notably various modifications can create different interaction forces for the adsorption of microplastics and nanoplastics it is noticed that smaller size micro nanoplastics can adsorb on the inner network of the adsorbents as compared to larger size micro nanoplastics notably the difference in attractive energies between plastic particles and sponge based adsorbents can influence the adsorption of micro nanoplastics which can eventually alter the removal capability of adsorbents thus this direction would require more investigations into other adsorbents and plastic polymers further different surface properties of micro nanoplastics can show different removal mechanisms against the same adsorbent due to their different chemical structure and composition some specific plastic polymers including polyethylene terephthalate polyamide polyvinylidene fluoride and polyethylene have been engaged to explore removal mechanisms thus other plastic polymers should be involved against different adsorbents to better understand the changing in removal mechanisms further the shape of micro nanoplastics can also influence the removal performance thus more investigations are required for other plastic polymers to better comprehend the function of plastic polymer shapes on the removal performance of different adsorbents published reports have indicated that sponge aerogel based adsorbents can reduce removal efficiency under strong acidic and alkaline conditions these adsorbents can remove maximum micro nanoplastics at ph 6 8 further metal based adsorbents can decline removal efficiency under strongly alkaline conditions ph 9 and they depicted the highest removal performance at the ph range of 3 7 while biochar based adsorbents have shown different results because the biochar prepared by different pyrolysis temperatures depicted different removal trends due to having different phpzc values in addition the existence of multivalent cations in the composition of biochar can also alter the removal capability of the prepared biochar at different solution ph overall biochar based adsorbents showed maximum adsorption in the range of ph 5 8 notably contradictory findings were observed about the effect of reaction temperature on the performance of adsorbents despite this truth sponge aerogel based adsorbents have revealed higher removal at higher temperatures in contrast meta based adsorbents can improve or decline removal with the rise of reaction temperature moreover reaction temperature did not influence the performance of biochar against microplastics therefore more investigations are urgently needed to better understand the stimulus of reaction temperature on the performance of different adsorbents against microplastics and nanoplastics reports have shown that sponge aerogel based adsorbents can tolerate the manifestation of natural organic matter and maintain their removal performance however biochar based adsorbents dropped their removal performance in the incidence of natural organic matter owing to steric hindrances and electrostatic repulsion notably none of the available reports can highlight the impact of natural organic matter on the performance of metal based adsorbents against micro nanoplastics therefore more studies are urgently required to better elucidate the influence of natural organic matter on the performance of different developed adsorbents against micro nanoplastics removal findings have shown that the presence of co existing ions can alter the removal performance of different adsorbents against micro nanoplastics by creating competition generating other competitive ions showing higher affinity towards adsorbents showing higher charge density than plastic particles and altering solution ph notably some adsorbents have shown excellent resistance against these co existing ions and can maintain their removal performance their adsorption performance can be improved because they have a unique morphology charge screening effect and self aggregation characteristics thus more investigations would be required to fabricate novel adsorbents to maintain adsorption performance against micro nanoplastics in the presence of co existing ions or pollutants 3 regeneration and reusability to date limited studies have explored the regeneration and reusability potential of the developed adsorbents different adsorbents have revealed different reusability potentials such as sponge aerogel based adsorbents depicted the highest reusability potential and could be reused using a simple ethanol solution exhausted sponge aerogel based adsorbents can be biodegraded without generating secondary pollution notably the thermal pyrolysis method can improve the reusability potential of the biochar based adsorbents because it can replenish the porosity surface area surface activity and structure of the adsorbent however it is an expensive and harmful technique because thermal treatment may need high temperatures and produce gas pollutants that eventually affect air quality further water is a cost effective regeneration solution but it cannot confer acceptable reusability performance therefore more investigations are needed to develop novel adsorbents which can be regenerated using cheap and environment friendly eluents and they can also deliver maximum removal performance and reusability potential 4 practical implementations of the developed adsorbents it is observed that different adsorbents depicted different removal trends in real water samples some adsorbents can tolerate co presence pollutants and maintain their removal performance however most of the adsorbents cannot endure their presence further the incidence of natural organic matter toxic dyes salts and metal ions can inhibit the removal performance of adsorbents by creating steric hindrance electrostatic repulsion and aggregation in the system thus pre optimizing the environmental conditions is important before using these adsorbents for practical purposes in addition more investigations are urgently needed to understand how developed adsorbents can tolerate the presence of other co existing pollutants and maintain their adsorption performance in real environmental situations 5 barriers to market penetrations it is observed that sole adsorption based technology is insufficient to remove completely the plastic particles from contaminated waters therefore it is suggested that different adsorbents can be integrated with other existing treatment units to improve the overall treatment capability of microplastics and nanoplastics importantly such integration schemes can reduce the shortcomings of current treatment technologies and adsorption based technology therefore future studies should investigate these aspects to better implement adsorption based technology for the remediation of microplastics and nanoplastics credit authorship contribution statement imran ali conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft xiao tan supervision conceptualization writing review editing funding

15128,microplastics and nanoplastics are being assumed as emerging toxic pollutants owing to their unique persistent physicochemical attributes chemical stability and nonbiodegradable nature owing to their possible toxicological impacts not only on aquatic biota but also on humans scientific communities are developing innovative technologies to remove microplastics and nanoplastics from polluted waters various technologies including adsorption coagulation photocatalysis bioremediation and filtration have been developed and employed to eliminate microplastics and nanoplastics recently adsorption technology has been getting great interest in capturing microplastics and nanoplastics and achieving excellent removal performance therefore this review is designed to discuss recent innovations in developing promising adsorbents for the remediation of microplastics and nanoplastics from wastewater and natural water the developed adsorbents have been classified into four main classes sponge aerogel based metal based biochar based and other developed adsorbents and their performance efficiencies have been critically examined further the influence of various pertinent factors including adsorbents characteristics microplastics nanoplastics characteristics solution ph reaction temperature natural organic matter and co existing interfering ions on the removal performance of advanced adsorbents have been critically assessed importantly the particle application of the developed adsorbents in removing microplastics and nanoplastics from natural water has been elucidated in addition barriers to market penetration of the developed adsorbents are briefly discussed to help experts transfer adsorption based technology from laboratory scale to commercial applications finally the current knowledge gaps and future recommendations are highlighted to assist scientific communal for improving adsorption based technologies to battle against microplastics and

malleability versatility low cost durability excellent oxygen resistance lightweight and biological dullness zhao et al 2021 the global plastics yield in 2020 was 367 million tons tiseo 2021 and an increase of 29 has been predicted for the year 2028 aslani et al 2021 when surplus in the environment plastics steadily break up into tiny particles under the influence of weathering mechanical wear solar radiation and microorganisms thereby yielding microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps ali et al 2022 luo et al 2022 recently mps 5 mm to 0 1 µm and nanoplastics nps 100 nm or 0 1 µm have been assumed as emerging toxic pollutants due to their unique physicochemical characteristics chemical stability and nonbiodegradable nature ali et al 2021a ali et al 2021b both mps and nps are widely distributed including fresh water lake water river sewage drains wwtps sediments oceans groundwater estuaries ya et al 2021 drinking water alimi et al 2018 atmosphere ragusa et al 2021 soil nizzetto et al 2016 food chain 2016 human body wright and kelly 2017 and even discovered in human blood ragusa et al 2021 aquatic animals and organisms mammals birds fish zooplankton and molluscs could mistakenly ingest mps and nps baudrimont et al 2020 both mp and np could easily discharge harmful substances they could perform as a trajectory to absorb toxic contaminants antibiotics pharmaceuticals heavy metals pesticides and plasticizers pathogen organisms owing to their high surface area smaller size and strong hydrophobicity ragusa et al 2021 this interaction could eventually influence the bioavailability fate and bio magnification of these contaminants zaki and aris 2022 further due to their small sizes aquatic species could mistakenly devour mps and nps as food and these tiny particles can potentially move to animals and humans through the food chain triggering a toxicological threat towards the thorough ecosystem zaki and aris 2022 thus the removal of mps and nps is urgent to protect water environment various kinds of treatment technologies including adsorption goh et al 2022 coagulation xu et al 2021 advanced oxidation processes ricardo et al 2021 photocatalysis ebrahimbabaie et al 2022 bioremediation masiá et al 2020 and filtration malankowska et al 2021 have been developed to eradicate mps and nps from contaminated waters among these techniques adsorption is assumed to be cost effective simple reliable and effective in capturing mps and nps from water and sewage ali et al 2021b recently different adsorbents including sponge rong et al 2022 aerogel

distinctive functional groups cooh oh n ch3 nh2 si o fe oh on adsorbents performed an imperative role in capturing mps and nps from polluted waters batool and valiyaveettil 2021 chazovachii et al 2021 rong et al 2022 both plain and surface functionalized mps and nps have been removed mainly due to hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding van der waals interaction electrostatic attraction π π interaction pore filling and intra particle diffusion depending on the characteristics of mps nps and adsorbents peng et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 further the pertinent factors including adsorbents characteristics mps nps characteristics solution ph reaction temperature natural organic matter nom and co existing interfering ions also control adsorption performance huang et al 2022 shi et al 2022 in addition some adsorbents are also utilized for practical applications to examine their capabilities to eradicate mps and nps from real waters arenas et al 2021 ganie et al 2021 rius ayra et al 2021 you et al 2021 to date few reports have highlighted using different adsorbents to eradicate mps and nps from the water recently some mini reviews narrated the removal of mps by surface functionalized materials gupta et al 2022 biochar ahmed et al 2022 and nanomaterials goh et al 2022 zaki and aris 2022 likewise few researchers reviewed the removal of nps by different adsorbents chen et al 2022b gupta et al 2022 however to our knowledge none of the reviews reported an in depth critical summary of the developed promising adsorbents for the systematically remediation of mps and nps in addition none of the published reports can critically elucidate the stimulus of pertinent components on the adsorptive elimination of mps and nps likewise no one has reported the practical application of the developed adsorbents in eradicating mps and nps from natural water samples thus the current understanding of the innovations in developing promising adsorbents for the remediation of mps and nps is still not comprehensive hence to fill this gap information available to date december 2022 was critically evaluated and its demonstration is focused on i the innovations in the development of promising adsorbents for the remediation of mps and nps from water under laboratory conditions ii critical examination of the influence of various pertinent factors including characteristic of adsorbents characteristics of mps nps solution ph reaction temperature natural organic matter and co existing interfering ions on the removal performance of developed adsorbents iii elucidation of the particle application of the developed adsorbents for mps and nps elimination from real water samples iv highlighting the barriers to market penetration of the developed adsorbents to help experts transfer adsorption based technology from laboratory to commercial applications and lastly v summation of the current knowledge gaps and future recommendations to assist scientific communal for improving adsorption based technologies to encounter mps and nps contamination 2 innovations in the development of promising adsorbents for the remediation of microplastic and nanoplastics numerous adsorbents have been fabricated via different routes to capture mps and nps from the water ecosystem table 1 in addition various techniques including dynamic light scattering dls fluorescence spectroscopy fs fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometry and turbidimeter have been used to quantify mps and nps magid et al 2021 singh et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2022 various kinds of mps including polystyrene ps polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polyvinyl chloride pvc polyamide pa high density polyethylene hdpe polymethyl methacrylate pmma melamine resin mr carboxylate modified polystyrene ps cooh amine modified polystyrene ps nh2 acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs nylon and micronized rubber with varying sizes ranging from 0 105 to 1240 µm have been removed via using different kinds of adsorbents various types of nps including ps pvc pet abs pmma polyvinyl acetate pva and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with varying sizes ranging from 30 to 100 nm have been eliminated using different adsorbents table 1 the adsorbents prepared by different routes depicted diverse morphology and characteristics to capture mps and nps herein the utilized adsorbents have been categorized into four main classes sponge aerogel based adsorbent metal based adsorbent biochar based adsorbent and other developed adsorbents to better reveal the ejection of mps and nps from the water environment 2 1 sponge aerogel based adsorbents sponge aerogel as an adsorption material with three dimensional porous morphology has gained much attention recently owing to its high specific surface area low density high compressive strength high aspect ratio porous structure good mechanical strength low cost and presence of abundant active groups on the surface for the adsorption of various pollutants sun et al 2020 in addition the sponges aerogels prepared by biomass based materials are environment friendly and biodegradable in soil sun et al 2021 numerous kinds of sponge aerogel based adsorbents have been fabricated via different routes including chemical crosslinking freezing thawing spin coating desilylation and self polymerization and they have been utilized for the removal of mps and np rong et al 2022 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2021b zhuang et al 2022 owing to having unique morphology and abundant hydrophilic functional groups mps and nps have been captured through diverse interactions including hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding van der waals interaction electrostatic attraction π π interaction ion exchange and intra particle diffusion table 1 2 1 1 microplastics regarding mps chitin and graphene oxide based chgo sponges could remove up to 89 8 72 4 and 88 9 of plain ps ps cooh and ps nh2 mps respectively via the combination of electrostatic interactions between opposite charges of adsorbent and mps intra particle diffusion due to interconnected porous morphology hydrogen bond interactions between the oxygen containing functional groups of adsorbent and mps and π π interactions between adsorbent and mps owing to the manifestation of the aromatic ring in mps structure notably the interconnected macroporous sponge system allowed mps to diffuse throughout the sponge and attach to the inner core of the sponge in addition the exhausted sponge could be biodegraded in soil sun et al 2020 similarly plant protein based sponges could adsorb up to 81 2 ps mps at the ph range of 6 9 due to having a highly interconnected porous structure 83 which helped sponges to adsorb 38 of mps within 10 s via the transport of mps throughout the sponge notably the hydrophobic groups on the protein side chain could shape hydrophobic interaction with the benzene rings on ps mps wang et al 2021b the prepared sponge depicted good biodegradability the captured water could be quickly discharged from sponges just by modestly compression with a hand and it could be regenerated for cyclic use wang et al 2021b recently it was reported that polydimethylsiloxane pdms grafted fe3o4 particle based sponge could remove about 100 mps pp pvc and pe in 5 min via the combination of intra particle diffusion under capillary attraction electrostatic interaction hydrogen bond interaction and σ p or p p conjugation mechanism rong et al 2022 notably sem findings witnessed that large numbers of mps particles were disseminated into the skeleton and pores of the coated sponges consistently and almost wholly covered the sponge fig 1 i in addition the adsorption of pp mps on the sponge could be endorsed to the joint grasping forces between methyl group of pp mps and the oxygen atom of pdms and the wan der waals force among hydrophobic molecules while chlorine atoms with lone pair electrons of pvc polymer molecule could adsorb on the pdms molecule owing to the electrostatic interactions and σ p and p p conjugations in addition the less branched chain of pvc structure could decline the steric hindrance contributing to the smooth adsorption of pvc mps onto the sponge meanwhile the developed sponge depicted excellent salt resistance and antibacterial activity to e coli and s aureus demonstrating that the sponge could remove mps from a highly saline and microbial rich environment rong et al 2022 further oxygen doped carbon nitride o c3n4 was loaded into chitin based sponges and 90 elimination efficiency of ps ps cooh and ps nh2 mps 1 µm was achieved sun et al 2021 notably the loading of o c3n4 significantly improved sponges water absorption capacity thus increased the elimination of mps via electrostatic interactions intra particle diffusion hydrogen bond interactions and π π interaction mechanisms further the leading driving force during ps nh2 mps adsorption was π π interactions instead of electrostatic interaction because ps nh2 mps and chitin based sponges both were positively charged and the conjugation effect was present between the lone electron pairs in n atoms and the benzene ring for π π interactions furthermore the expanded sponge could be biodegraded like fungal mycelia in soil as cracks and crumbles were noticed on the superficial of the sponge after 28 d sun et al 2021 adhesive coated beads could remove up to 99 of nonpolar pe micronized rubber and polar pet nylon mps in addition to ps mps within 5 min via the combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic attraction chazovachii et al 2021 the modified cellulose aerogel depicted an excellent adsorption capacity 146 38 mg g against ps mps due to having unique porous morphology and active sites which helped in capturing mps via electrostatic interaction and ion exchange as observed by a fluorescence study which depicted that different aerogels showed different adsorption effects against ps mps fig 1 ii zhuang et al 2022 similarly polydopamine enhanced magnetic chitosan pda mcs aerogels could remove up to 91 6 pet mps the manifestation of hydrophilic functional groups cooh nh2 played an essential role in capturing pet mps from solution via the permutation of electrostatic interactions physical adhesion hydrogen bonding and π π interaction as porous size and high porosity of the aerogels offered several adsorption sites for pet mps fig 1 iii notably xps findings indicated that the amino group of the chain of the chitosan molecule could combine with the cooh group on pet to develop n c o group via electrostatic interactions which performed an imperative role in the adsorption in addition the adsorption capability of pda mcs aerogels against pet mps was superior under dark daylight and uv light conditions within 24 h zheng et al 2022 it was recently reported that native nanocellulose film cnf hydrogels could capture cationic and anionic ps mps 1 µm cnf hydrogels depicted higher removal for positively charged ps mps as compared to charge ps mps negatively notably the hygroscopic nanocellulose network and negative surface charge of cnf hydrogels promoted the accretion and removal of the positively charged ps mps through diffusion cohesion capillary forces and electrostatic interaction leppänen et al 2022 likewise tempo cnf ps ultrathin and regenerated cellulose rc films have captured higher cationic ps mps than the anionic ps mps leppänen et al 2022 in addition mps can be charged on site at the place of their production 2 1 2 nanoplastics regarding nps zif 8 aerogel could remove both pvdf nps 60 110 nm and ps nps 90 140 nm from the water via the combination of electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces because the zeta potential values of zif 8 pvdf and ps were 13 5 16 1 and 18 7 mv respectively and pvdf ps and zif 8 were all hydrophobic substance notably the removal efficiency of pvdf 91 4 was better than that of ps 42 5 on zif 8 aerogel because the c f on pvdf could establish hydrogen bonds with oh in cellulose further sem micrographs illustrated that pvdf and ps nps were strongly devoted to the surface of zif 8 and the walls of the aerogel pores you et al 2021 pei ce adsorbent could remove 98 nps pvc pmma and pvac within 30 min owing to electrostatic interactions between positively charged pei ce and negatively charged nps because the zeta potential value of adsorbent turned to negative after sorption of negatively charged nps notably sem micrographs depicted uniformly disseminated spherical nps on the surface of pei ce fig 2 i further ftir findings represented characteristics peak of the c o stretching of the ester in both pmma and pvac backbone at 1734 cm 1 demonstrating the presence of electrostatic interaction between positively charged pei ce and negatively charged nps batool and valiyaveettil 2021 recently a team of researchers have reported that 3d oldh could remove 80 ps nps 80 nm at ph 3 to 11 and even nearly 60 at ph 1 and 13 the prepared material 3d oldh demonstrated outstanding acid and base resistance against ps nps removal notably the characterization and dft findings depicted that hydrogen bonding and complexation linked with layer double hydroxide ldh retrieved from ldo and π π conjunction from graphene like carbon g and p π interaction between g and benzene ring of ps nps due to the presence of sulfur s in g from sds performed an imperative role in the elimination of ps nps by 3d oldh peng et al 2022 further it was observed that native nanocellulose film cnf hydrogels could capture cationic and anionic ps nps 100 nm cnf hydrogels depicted higher removal for positively charged ps nps rivalled to negatively charged ps nps notably the hygroscopic nanocellulose network and negative surface charge of cnf hydrogels promoted the accumulation and reduction of the positively charged plastic particles through diffusion cohesion capillary forces and electrostatic interaction leppänen et al 2022 likewise ps ultrathin films and regenerated cellulose rc films captured higher cationic ps nps than anionic ps nps tempo cnf film could capture roughly 20 billion ps nps per mg of tempo cnf a remarkable achievement in addition mps and nps can be charged on site where they are produced leppänen et al 2022 overall unique morphology and the presence of reactive functional groups played an essential role in removing mps and nps from polluted waters in addition sponge aerogel could remove higher amount nps than mp and the consumed sponge aerogel could be biodegraded by microorganisms in soil however what is the fate of collected mps nps after regenerating sponge aerogel this question is demanding experts attention in future investigations 2 2 metal based adsorbents different kinds of metal based adsorbents have been utilized to remove mps and nps iron fe modified adsorbents have been prepared via various routes including chemical co precipitation hydrothermal chemical vapour deposition calcination and sonication in addition different metals cu co mn pt minerals kaolin and acids phosphonic acid molecules lauric acid have been incorporated to confer super hydrophilic or superhydrophobic properties and enhance reactive sites and functional groups on the surfaces of adsorbents for the efficient adsorption of mps and nps huang et al 2022 rius ayra et al 2021 sarcletti et al 2021 urso et al 2022 in addition these fe modified adsorbents can be magnetically collected and removed from the solution by employing an external magnetic field shi et al 2022 2 2 1 microplastics regarding mps superhydrophobic cufeco powder alloy could remove 83 of hdpe mps from the water via hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction the capturing mechanism can be explained in this way first mps moved from water to the organic phase under constant stirring meanwhile the cufeco particles were also instantaneously shifted from the aqueous phase to the organic one due to their superhydrophobic superoleophobic properties which was oil where the cufeco particles surrounded the mps by the centripetal force of the stirring process to capture them through electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction fig 2 ii rius ayra et al 2021 sarcletti and coworkers 2021 have developed different functionalized core shell superparamagnetic iron oxide spion nanoparticles to remove different sizes of mps ps pmma mr from water the findings depicted that spions adsorbed on the mps surface and agglomerated them by acting like a glue between mps particles fig 2 iii notably the fabricated spion could remove mps because of the presence of van der waals electrostatic and hydrophobic attractions between mps and functionalized spion in addition spion systems also depicted high removal capabilities under co mixture of mr and ps as sem micrographs witnessed that polymer co mixture already tended to small clustering of the mps according to their different zeta potential still much larger agglomerates were noticed in the presence of the spion fig 3 i magnetic carbon nanotube m cnt could completely remove mps pe pet and pa within 300 min at neutral ph 7 the hydrophobic interactions could endorse the adsorption of pe by m cnt in contrast the adsorption of pet could be attributed to the combination of hydrophobic and π π electron conjugate interactions between pet mps and m cnt due to the presence of highly polarized π electron cloud on carbon nanotubes surfaces while the adsorption of pa was principally due to the combination of π π electron interaction complexation electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bond interaction because pa polar polymer had good hydrophilicity owing to the manifestation of a large number of amide groups on the molecular chain and pa could dissociate more cooh than amine groups at neutral conditions revealing negative surface charge whereas m cnts were positively charged because of containing fe3o4 on the surface also fe3o4 could make complex with the cooh on the m cnts and the hydrogen bonds between the pa amide groups and the m cnts tang et al 2021 notably the higher adsorption capacities of pe 1650 mg g and pet 1400 mg g than that of pa 1100 mg g depicted that hydrophobic interaction between pe pet and m cnts was much stronger than the electrostatic and complexation adsorption between pa and m cnts additionally the superior crystallinity of pe compared with pet began with higher hydrophobic interaction and resulted from higher adsorption capacity than pet tang et al 2021 further m cnts maintained their performance even in the presence of cod ammonium and phosphate materials tang et al 2021 magnetic nano fe3o4 could remove mps pe pp ps and pet via surface absorption as a large number of nano fe3o4 particles could be noticed on the superficial of mps fig 3 ii shi et al 2022 a study reported that co mn kaolin and fe kaolin could remove different types of nps including pcv ps pet and abs through electrostatic interaction and co mn kaolin depicted better sorption performance 22 mg g when compared to fe kaolin 13 68 mg g it was mainly because co mn kaolin had additional and bigger pores and a slightly higher surface area than fe kaolin fig 3 iii huang et al 2022 2 2 2 nanoplastics regarding nps the enquiry of tiwari et al 2020 reported that zn al ldh could completely remove 100 ps nps 80 nm notably the ftir findings witnessed the formation of the complex m o ps between zn al ldh and ps nps by replacing the m oh surface hydroxyl groups of ldh through electrostatic interactions because new peaks emerged at 1332 and 697 cm 1 after the sorption of ps nps on zn al ldh likewise sun et al 2022 integrated cellulose with mg al ldh and positively charged cellulose mg al ldh composite beads could efficiently remove 97 negatively charged ps nps 100 nm under optimal conditions via the combination of pore diffusion hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions mechanisms notably the ftir findings depicted that the band transferred from 3329 to 3313 cm 1 after the sorption demonstrated that the oh functional groups in the beads could adsorb ps nps via hydrogen bonds in addition a new peak was noticed near 925 cm 1 after the sorption and could be endorsed to electrostatic attraction further sem micrographs witnessed the attachment of ps nps on the surfaces and the pores of the beads subsequent in the development of polymers containing ps nps upon penetrating these pores due to the presence of electrostatic attraction further cuni carbon material cuni c could completely remove ps nps 100 nm within 24 h the isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics findings have described that the adsorption of ps nps on cuni c was due to the combination of physical adsorption monolayer coverage and electrostatic attraction zhou et al 2022 fe modified fly ash fa could adsorb 89 9 mg g ps nps 80 nm within 15 h via electrostatic attraction complexation and π π interaction in addition the stuck and entangled pores regulated the elimination of ps nps notably the fe oh delivered the oh that bonded with the cooh of ps nps via complexation as ensured via ftir analysis because the peak at 3148 cm 1 has shifted and amplified further the fe oxides adsorbed on ps nps by electrostatic attraction and formed fe oxides ps nps complex which declined the peak intensity at 553 580 cm 1 zhao et al 2022 recently urso et al 2022 narrated that γ fe2o3 pt tio2 microrobots could capture 97 ps cooh nps 50 nm within one min under uv light irradiation through electrostatic interactions due to the distinctive permutation of self propulsion and programmable zeta potential fig 3 iv notably sem micrographs endorsed the attachment of nps on the microrobot s surface including the slits between the formerly mxene s multi layer stacks thus depicting the multi layered design s efficacy and electrostatic capturing fig 4 i in contrast mxene microparticles could only trap 50 nps within 5 min urso et al 2022 metal based adsorbents have shown good removal performance and mps nps can be removed quickly in addition nps could enter the pores of the metal based adsorbents via pore diffusion importantly the interaction between adsorbents and mps nps mainly depended on the size of plastic particles and morphology of the adsorbents further none of the study investigated the influence of leached metals on the removal performance of adsorbents thus this point is demanding much attention 2 3 biochar based adsorbents researchers have used biochar based adsorbents to remove mps and nps from different environmental matrixes table 1 the porous morphology and active vacant sites of biochar are tunable and easy to assemble making biochar more suitable and less expensive than sponge based and metal based adsorbents for the adsorption of environmental pollutants magid et al 2021 various kinds of biochar have been prepared via different methods such as pyrolysis carbonization and impregnation using different types of biomasses sugarcane bagasse corncobs for the adsorption of mps and nps ganie et al 2021 singh et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2022 further some researchers have modified biochar by incorporating different metals mg zn and fe metal oxides fe3o4 and strong oxidizing agents hno3 h2so4 to enhance its sorption ability reactive functional groups mobility colloidal stability and recyclability magid et al 2021 singh et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 2 3 1 microplastics regarding mps iron modified biochar pyrolyzed at two different temperatures i e 550 c fb 550 and 850 c fb 850 could completely remove 99 negatively charged ps cooh and positively charged ps nh2 mps 1 µm in 10 min notably fb 850 have described higher sorption of ps cooh compared to ps nh2 owing to having a positive charge on the surface of adsorbent fb 850 in the presence of iron hydroxide functionalities with cooh mainly via acid base reaction in contrast fb 550 have shown higher sorption of ps nh2 as compared to ps cooh owing to having a negative charge on the surface of adsorbent fb 550 which created strong electrostatic attraction and complexation with fb 550 surface compared to fb 850 with phpzc at 5 8 further the ftir findings have revealed the complexation of mps with hydrophilic functional groups oh cooh of adsorbents via electrostatic interaction in addition π π conjugation and hydrophobicity of the mps and adsorbents also played an imperative role in the sorption of mps by fb composites singh et al 2021 likewise metal modified magnetic biochar could eradicate higher ps mps as compared to simple magnetic biochar mbc which indicated that the loading of metals mg and zn could enhance the capturing capability of ps mps by creating more positively charged active sites for the interaction of negatively charged ps mps on the surface of adsorbent via electrostatic and metal o ps bonds interactions verified by sem observations fig 4 ii wang et al 2021a 2 3 2 nanoplastics regarding nps the biochar bc prepared at 750 c demonstrated significantly higher ps nps 500 nm removal 99 when compared to biochar prepared at 350 and 550 c because bc 750 had higher zeta potential 10 to 20 mv and surface area 540 36 m2 g when compared to bc 350 20 mv 1 44 m2 g and this elevated electrostatic attraction between nps and biochar composites the self aggregation capability of bc 750 after nps interaction and mechanical interlocking between nps and biochar ganie et al 2021 notably sem images have revealed the entrapment of nps between the two bc 750 grains besides being electrostatically attracted towards biochar fig 4 iii likewise the iron modified biochar pyrolyzed at 850 c fb 850 have depicted higher removal of ps cooh nps 30 nm when compared to iron modified biochar pyrolyzed at 550 c fb 550 due to the manifestation of iron hydroxide functionalities on the composites surface as ensured via ftir analysis because a peak visible at 880 cm 1 which helped in creating stronger electrostatic interactions between fb 850 and ps cooh nps because fb 850 had higher phpzc value 5 8 than fb 550 3 3 singh et al 2021 likewise the enquiry of magid et al 2021 reported that the adsorption capacity of corncob biochar cb for ps nps significantly improved with boosted pyrolysis temperature and after ageing through oxidation by 5 of hno3 h2so4 because the hydrophobicity specific surface area and aromaticity of biochar improved with temperature while the quantities of oxygen containing groups and specific surface area improved after oxidation table 1 notably the ftir findings have represented that oh functional groups played an important role in the sorption of ps nps on the surface of biochar due to the formation of hydrogen bonding because the band at 3429 cm 1 oh and 1102 cm 1 c o c declined significantly after ps nps adsorption in addition the decline of the ether group c o c after ps nps adsorption is implicit the presence of hydrophobic interaction between biochar and ps nps because c o c groups are nonpolar magid et al 2021 recently zhu et al 2022 narrated that ps nps could adsorb on in the functional mesoporous biochar mbc and then the adsorbed ps nps on mbc could be hydrothermally degraded notably the bet findings have revealed that ps nps 100 nm could not penetrate the pores and cracks of mbc because the average pore diameter of mbc was 4 58 nm in comparison the zeta potential values indicated that negatively charged ps nps 34 5 mv could be adsorbed on positively charged mbc 6 mv via electrostatic attraction zhu et al 2022 further it was perceived from sem images that ps nps adsorbed on mbc could be degraded through catalytic hydrolysis and radicals due to various oxygen containing functional groups in mbc fig 4 iv notably the quenching experiments depicted that o2 and h performed a governing role in the degradation of ps nps overall biochar based adsorbent could remove 75 mps and nps and this removal efficiency could be improved up to 99 by modifying the fabrication protocol of biochar biochar based adsorbents are inexpensive environment friendly and can be fabricated in single step pyrolysis process with exploiting any expensive and toxic chemical 2 4 other developed adsorbents few researchers have used activated carbon waste materials and biopolymers as adsorbents to remove mps and nps for instance bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers prepared by cultivating komagataeibacter saccharivorans in stationary situations could retain 84 to 98 68 spherical ps mps 10 µm from contaminated water by creating an electrostatic barrier against the negatively charged ps mps particles faria et al 2022 notably wet bc biopolymers have revealed highest removal efficiency 98 63 0 39 being able to retain 9 47 0 03 mg l of ps mps 10 µm because they were highly hydrated due to availability of abundant oh groups for interaction with water molecules further freeze dried fd bc showed comparatively higher removal performance 96 45 2 22 than oven dried od bc biopolymers 93 04 2 07 because fd bc biopolymers kept a better porous structure compared to od bc biopolymers drying the biopolymers would significantly enhance logistics and implementation of practicality with removal efficiencies declining by only 2 6 in addition the as prepared bc biopolymers did not show any signs of degradation throughout the 20 filtration cycles maintaining outstanding high removal efficiencies despite flux diminution and pore clogging faria et al 2022 further sem micrographs have illustrated the adsorption of ps mps across the bc biopolymer s surface in addition fluorescence microscopy has disclosed that besides adsorbing on the bc biopolymers surface ps mps were also systematically integrated faria et al 2022 however it is important to comprehend how to augment culture conditions at an industrial level to fabricate cost effective bc biopolymers in addition experiments on wastewater samples would be required to recommend bc biopolymers based technology for commercial applications moreover coffee grounds biowaste could remove positively charged nps ps nh2 via electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding owing to the manifestation of abundant oxygen containing hydrophilic functional groups oh cooh on the superficial of coffee grounds yen et al 2022 granular activated carbon gac could adsorb ps nps 97 nm due to the presence of electrostatic interactions between the positively charged nps and negatively charged gac and larger size internal pores 10 to 15 μm for the penetration and settlement of nps within the inner surface of gac through pore diffusion arenas et al 2021 recently qu et al 2022 developed novel magnetic effervescent tablets using hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent des fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles sodium carbonate and tartaric acid and these developed tablets could remove 94 0 0 8 ps nps 100 nm within 3 5 min under optimal conditions via the combination of hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding mechanisms in addition the developed tablets have shown little impact on the environment as ensured by analytical ecological scale and the green analysis process index values further cigarette butts cgb could remove ps nps 50 nm more efficiently as compared to ps mps 500 nm because 50 nm ps nps depicted the lowest energy barrier and strong partition coefficients as compared to 500 nm ps mps for overcoming electrostatic repulsion and entering into the porous organic matrices el hadri et al 2021 however cigarette butts are nonbiodegradable toxic compounds are present in cigarettes including chromium lead nicotine cadmium formaldehyde arsenic copper and contain a variety of polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs which may eventually generate secondary pollutants in the environment 2 5 techniques used for understanding adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism of mps nps with adsorbents is dependent on the characteristics of adsorbents i e specific surface area morphology surface charge porosity surface functional groups the contaminants size shape chemical structure coordination sites nature of functional fractions and characteristics of the environmental medium salinity ph temperature concentrations etc sajid et al 2022 it was observed that modern machinery including ftir transmission electron microscopy tem scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray eds x ray diffraction xrd brunauer emmett teller bet x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps atomic force microscopy afm selected area electron diffraction saed etc have been employed to comprehend the function of adsorbent morphology and functional groups in the removal of mps and nps arenas et al 2021 el hadri et al 2021 ganie et al 2021 urso et al 2022 yen et al 2022 for instance the manifestation of new peaks the elimination of peaks alterations in peak strengths and the red blue swing of peaks in the ftir spectrum could give some idea about the attachment of mps nps with the reactive functional groups of the adsorbents singh et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 likewise sem images could modify the adsorbents morphology urso et al 2022 notably combining different techniques could give a thorough delineation of the adsorption mechanism huang et al 2022 sun et al 2022 furthermore to better explore the adsorption mechanism various kinds of adsorption isotherms models langmuir freundlich tempkin and dubinin radushkevich d r sip s and kinetics models pseudo first order pseudo second order kinetics intraparticle diffusion models have been utilized to estimate adsorption capacity removal efficiency and possible sorption mechanisms langmuir and freundlich isotherms were the two most frequently applied isotherm models the langmuir isotherm is based on the supposition of homogenous monolayer adsorbate dissemination over all the adsorbent surfaces comprising limited similar spots with comparable sorption activated energy while freundlich isotherm is based on the hypothesis of heterogenous sorption surface energy which is exploited to explain both monolayer and multilayer adsorptions on the other hand pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetics were the most often employed adsorption kinetic models the pseudo first order kinetic model believes that the adsorption rate depends on the divergence between the prompt adsorption capacity and the pivotal step that influences the adsorbate elimination process is mass transfer while the pseudo second order kinetic model presumes that chemical sorption is the pivotal step influencing the adsorbate ejection process it was noticed that the value of linear correlation coefficients r2 was the main indicator to express the suitability of the respective model in addition the value of adsorption intensity 1 n was also estimated by many researchers to explore the feasibility of the adsorption process table 1 depicted that the langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm are frequently correlated with the adsorption of mps nps on adsorbents few studies indicated that sip s isotherm which is a permutation of both langmuir and freundlich and dubinin radushkevich which is allied with a pore filling mechanism and describe physisorption on a heterogenous surface models are concomitant with the adsorption of mps nps on adsorbents tiwari et al 2020 yen et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 on the other hand most of the reports are explained by pseudo second order kinetics whereas a few are by general order pseudo first order and intraparticle diffusion kinetics models for instance the adsorption of ps ps cooh and ps nh2 mps on chgo sponge mainly followed the intraparticle diffusion kinetic model and the adsorption kinetic investigation recommended that the hydrogen bond electrostatic and π π interactions were the main driving force for mps adsorption due to the presence of carboxyl and amino groups on the surface of adsorbent and mps sun et al 2021 during the adsorption process mps first transmitted from water to the surface of the sponges and then mps steadily permeated the core of sponges and finally the adsorption process gradually approached equilibrium when the diffusion rate declined with the diminution of the concentration of mps in the water arenas et al 2021 sun et al 2021 sun et al 2022 further the adsorption of pvc ps pet and abs mps on co mn kaolin mainly obeyed the pseudo first order kinetic model which hinted that the diffusion step controlled the adsorption in addition the freundlich isotherms model had a higher r2 value than the langmuir isotherms model implicit the heterogeneity nature of the adsorbent and or presence of multilayer adsorption huang et al 2022 similarly the adsorption of mps on aerogels was suitable for freundlich isotherm model thus demonstrated the uneven and multilayered forces on the surface of aerogels this also indicated the presence of other forces such as the physical adhesion of polydopamine as well as hydrogen bonding and π π interaction between chitosan and mps in addition to electrostatic interactions zheng et al 2022 likewise the adsorption behavior of ps nps on zn al ldh was well matched with general order kinetic and freundlich isotherm models suggested the multilayer stacking with the non ideal nature of sorption tiwari et al 2020 notably the rate constants kd1 acquired for ps nps in lake geneva water were superior than those for ultrapure water owing to aggregation and sedimentation whereas kd2 indicated that internal diffusion was less efficient in lake geneva water arenas et al 2021 overall different adsorbents depicted distinct adsorption mechanisms mainly depended on the morphology chemical composition effective binding sites of the adsorbents and characteristics of the environmental media and mps nps 3 influence of pertinent factors on the adsorptive removal of microplastics and nanoplastics various factors such as characteristics of adsorbents properties of mps and nps reaction temperature solution ph natural organic matter nom and co existing ions can influence the removal performance efficiencies of adsorbents against mps and nps 3 1 characteristics of adsorbents the attributes of the adsorbents such as surface area porosity morphology and surface charge can stimulus the elimination efficiency against mps and nps various researchers investigated the stimulus of adsorbents characteristics on the ejection of mps and nps by modifying the surface charge and morphology of the adsorbents for instance chgo sponge could remove higher mps 88 9 as compared to the plant protein based sponge 81 2 due to the presence of stronger electrostatic and π π interactions on go sun et al 2021 despite this truth the plant protein based sponge had a much better interconnected porous structure than the chgo sponge which rapidly helped the sponge remove 38 mps within 10 seconds wang et al 2021b further the loading of different kinds of nanoparticles could significantly enhance the active sites on the surfaces of adsorbents for instance pdms grafted fe3o4 particle based sponge could remove approximately 100 mps in 5 min because of having higher porosity surface area and reactive functional groups on the sponge rong et al 2022 likewise the loading of o c3n4 could enhance the removal capability 90 and water absorption capacity of the sponge sun et al 2021 as compared to chgo sponge 88 9 sun et al 2020 notably a positively charged o c3n4 based sponge could remove positively charged ps nh2 mps due to the conjugation effect between the lone electron pairs in n atoms and the benzene ring for π π interactions sun et al 2021 further a hygroscopic nanocellulose network could enhance the removal of nps because nps could enter into the inner core of the hydrogel via cohesion pores diffusion and capillary forces leppänen et al 2022 likewise functionalized spion nanoparticles could capture higher mps than nano fe3o4 particles due to stronger electrostatic interaction and additional hydrophobic and van der waals interactions between mps and functionalized spion sarcletti et al 2021 shi et al 2022 further co mn kaolin achieved higher adsorptive capacity 22 mg g than fe kaolin 13 68 mg g due to having a higher surface area and pores huang et al 2022 notably γ fe2o3 pt tio2 microrobots could capture higher nps 97 as compared to mxene mps 50 due to having stronger electrostatic interaction and multi layer stacks morphology urso et al 2022 moreover higher pyrolysis temperature could significantly improve the surface area porosity and active sites on the surfaces of biochar which eventually enhanced the removal capability of biochar as compared to biochar prepared at lower pyrolysis temperatures ganie et al 2021 singh et al 2021 in addition the anchoring of metals and aging of biochar significantly improved the mps and nps adsorption due to having higher specific surface area and oxygen containing groups wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2022 overall different kinds of modifications would create various interaction forces for the efficient adsorption of mps and nps 3 2 characteristics of microplastics nanoplastics the attributes of mps nps such as size shape chemical structure and chemical composition can influence the removal performance of adsorbents some researchers investigated these aspects for instance smaller size pp mps 6 5 μm could attach to both the internal pores and the skeleton of the sponge as compared to larger size pp mps 150 μm because the abundant porosity in the inner sponge could produce capillary forces that helped the entry of small particles into internal pores of sponge during the adsorption process likewise pvc mps 150 μm could penetrate the sponge pores more easily than spherical pe mps 250 μm due to the size effect and coincident with minor hydrogen bond interaction between the oxygen atom of pdms molecule and the hydrogen atom of pe molecule rong et al 2022 similarly ps nps 100 nm could diffuse deeper into the hydrogel when rivaled to the ps mps 1 µm and cnf hydrogels had a considerably higher capability to capture ps nps than ps mps leppänen et al 2022 further the elimination efficiency of large 900 μm and small 200 μm mps was greater than medium 500 μm mps in artificial seawater by nano fe3o4 in addition the mean removal rate of mps pe pp ps and pet was comparatively high than that of ultrapure water it might be because electrostatic interaction between mps and nano fe3o4 was dominant in seawater which would be different from hydrophobic interaction in ultrapure water shi et al 2022 surprisingly anionic tempo cnf film depicted higher removal efficacy for anionic ps nps than cationic ps nps because anionic ps nps could enter the nanocellulose network more efficiently to have low attractive energy between negatively charged surfaces in contrast cationic ps nps could attach on the surface of anionic tempo cnf film due to having high attractive power between oppositely charged surfaces but this could impede the particles to diffuse or penetrate inside the network leppänen et al 2022 further pvdf has shown higher removal 91 4 as compared to ps 42 5 on zif 8 aerogel because the c f on pvdf established hydrogen bonds with oh in cellulose you et al 2021 likewise the adsorption of pe on m cnt could be endorsed by the hydrophobic interactions in contrast the adsorption of pet could be attributed to the hydrophobic interaction and π π electron conjugate system between pet mps and m cnt due to the presence of highly polarized π electron cloud on carbon nanotube surfaces while the adsorption of pa was mainly due to the π π electron interaction complexation electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bond interaction because pa polar polymer had good hydrophilicity owing to the manifestation of a large number of amide groups on the molecular chain and pa could dissociate more cooh than amine groups at neutral conditions revealing negative surface charge whereas m cnts were positively charged because of the presence of fe3o4 on the surface also fe3o4 could make complex with the cooh on the m cnts and the hydrogen bonds between the pa amide groups and the m cnts tang et al 2021 notably the higher adsorption capacities of pe and pet than pa by m cnts depicted that hydrophobic interaction between pe pet and m cnts was much stronger than the electrostatic and complexation adsorption between pa and m cnts further the superior crystallinity of pe compared with pet began with higher hydrophobic interaction and resulted from higher adsorption capacity than pet tang et al 2021 the elimination rate of pet mps 200 μm was significantly lower than that of the other three types of mps including pe pp and ps because pet mps had higher density lower crystallinity and weakest hydrophobicity compared to other mps shi et al 2022 further the shape of mps can also influence the removal performance for instance the elimination rates of pe mps 200 μm particles fibers films and foams were 86 87 6 92 93 09 6 63 99 56 0 68 and 99 35 1 13 respectively by nano fe3o4 this might be due to the variations in agglomeration behavior of mps in water and interaction of mps surfaces and fe3o4 particles among size different mps shi et al 2022 overall characteristics of mps nps size shape surface charge chemical composition and structure could affect the removal performance by altering removal mechanisms 3 3 solution ph the ph of the solution dramatically influences the adsorbent s performance because it can change the charge of reactive functional groups on the surfaces of the adsorbent and the chemical status of pollutants in the solution various researchers investigated the impact of solution ph on the execution of different adsorbents against mps and nps the zeta potential and phpzc values of the adsorbents and plastic particles were essential to optimize the removal performance of adsorbents against specific mps nps because these values would decide the manifestation of electrostatic attraction between adsorbent and mps nps and the presence of competitive ions h oh in the system for instance the aerogel achieved maximum adsorption capacity at ph 7 at the same time it decreased when the ph improved or declined because the content of h in the solution increased under acidic ph and the cationic groups of the amended aerogel had the same charge as the mps which dwindled the adsorbable active sites of aerogel in contrast the presence of anion oh resulted from interference to negatively charged mps under alkaline ph and reduced the adsorption capacity zhuang et al 2022 likewise the chgo sponge achieved maximum removal 92 9 at ph 6 while the lowest 43 7 was observed at ph 10 because oh could compete with negative charge ps mps for the active sites at higher ph in the case of ps cooh mps the removal efficacy significantly declined at ph 8 because of a competitive effect between ps cooh and oh similarly h created a competitive effect for ps nh2 mps at ph 4 which inhibited removal efficiency sun et al 2020 similarly the lowest elimination performance of ps ps cooh and ps nh2 mps 1 µm was noticed at ph 10 mainly due to the competitive adsorption between oh and mps in addition the presence of h inhibited the elimination efficiency of ps nh2 mps by chitin based sponges at ph 4 sun et al 2021 further pda mcs aerogels retained removal performance at the ph range of 6 to 9 in contrast removal efficiency declined 20 at ph 10 because of the presence of competition between oh and negatively charged pet mps for active sites on aerogels under alkaline conditions indicating that electrostatic interaction was an imperative mechanism zheng et al 2022 likewise a sponge prepared by plant based protein depicted a decline in removal efficacy when ph decreased to 4 and increased to 10 because a higher negative charge on the surface of the sponge could attract more water molecules instead of ps mps and this phenomenon eventually diminished the hydrophobic interaction between sponge and ps mps wang et al 2021b further 3d oldh could maintain approximately 80 removal of ps nps 80 nm at ph 3 5 while the elimination reached up to 95 in the range of ph 7 11 notably 3d oldh could remove 60 ps nps even at ph 1 and 13 because the presence of graphitic carbon in g ldo700 could protect ldo at acid and alkaline ph surprisingly the higher removal of ps nps at ph 9 hinted at the sight of other dominant interactions i e hydrogen bonding π π conjunction and π π interaction because the surface charge of both ps nps and 3d oldh was negative due to having negative zeta potential values 5 to 32 mv peng et al 2022 moreover m cnts depicted the highest removal efficiency at ph 7 however the adsorption capacity of pe and pet declined under alkaline conditions due to the configuration of acidic oxygen containing groups on the surface of m cnts which declined the hydrophobicity and destabilized the hydrophobic interaction between m cnts and pe pet mps in contrast the adsorption of pa on m cnts diminished significantly only in a strongly acidic environment due to greater electrostatic repulsion between dissociable amine groups of pa and positively charged m cnts despite this truth pa had dissociable carboxylic groups in alkaline conditions which rivaled with hydroxide ions for the vacant sites and led to a minor decline in adsorption performance tang et al 2021 further the adsorption ability of co mn kaolin against nps pcv ps pet and abs declined significantly with the rise of ph from 3 to 12 because oh competed with nps for active sites on co mn kaolin in contrast fe kaolin adsorbed more nps with the rise of ph from 3 to 10 because the production of positively charged iron hydroxide colloid could enhance the sorption of negatively charged nps even with the increase of the concentration of oh however the sorption ability was significantly inhibited at ph 10 because of the formation of iron hydroxide precipitation rather than colloid huang et al 2022 similarly cuni c showed the lowest removal efficiency of ps nps 100 nm at ph 9 owing to electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged cuni c and ps nps in addition oh the content was greater at ph 9 and they could compete with ps nps for active adsorption sites zhou et al 2022 further the alkaline condition ph 9 significantly declined the sorption of ps nps on the exterior of zn al ldh due to improved competitive binding and destabilization of ldh because the phpzc of zn al ldh was above ph 10 while the ps nps were highly negatively charged in the experimented ph range hence the zeta potential of zn al ldh declined due to the deprotonation of surface hydroxyl groups and was near zero at ph 9 where electrostatic interaction was minimum tiwari et al 2020 likewise cellulose mg al ldh composite beads performed well under acidic and neutral conditions ph 2 7 because positively charged beads could strongly attract negatively charged ps nps however the removal gradually declined under alkaline conditions ph 8 11 because the negative charge on the surface of the beads lessened the electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged ps nps and directed to a state of mutual revulsion as ensured by zeta potential values sun et al 2022 further the sorption performance of ps nps 80 nm significantly boosted from 58 3 to 89 9 mg g at the ph range of 3 7 owing to positive charge on the surface of iron modified fly ash under an acidic condition which robustly attracted the negatively charged ps nps by forming acidic o containing groups and reducing hydrophobic interaction in contrast iron modified fly ash depicted the lowest adsorption performance for ps nps in an alkaline condition owing to electrostatic repulsion and surface complexation zhao et al 2022 moreover zn mbc depicted higher removal performance 97 5 in acidic and neutral ph and marginally lower 95 81 in an alkalescent ph because zno particles were negatively charged in alkaline ph ensuing the poor electrostatic attraction of mps wang et al 2021a notably solution ph did not influence the elimination efficacy of ps cooh mps ps nh2 mps by fb 550 and fb 850 in ph 3 5 9 5 it could be endorsed to the mutual effect of electrostatic attraction owing to heterogeneous charge dissemination on composite surfaces and surface complexation however higher removal of ps cooh nps 30 nm was detected in the acidic ph because of the aggregation these aggregates of nps could rapidly adsorb on the active sites of the adsorbent singh et al 2021 further the biochar prepared at 750 bc 750 demonstrated significantly lower ps nps removal efficiency at highly alkaline conditions ph 8 owing to having strong electrostatic repulsion between nps and bc 750 because phpzc of bc 750 was 4 7 ganie et al 2021 the adsorption of ps nps on corncob biochar declined with the rise of ph 5 because of the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged biochar and ps nps further the cation bridging effect was also noticed during the adsorption of ps nps on corncob biochar cb in the range of ph 3 to 5 owing to the interface of multivalent cations al3 ca2 and mg2 and biochar as well as with ps nps notably this cation bridging effect disappeared at ph 5 due to the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged biochar and ps nps on the other hand this cation bridging effect was also absent in the aged biochars because washing eliminated the acid magid et al 2021 in contrast coffee grounds biowaste depicted good adsorption capacity for ps nh2 nps 100 nm under alkaline conditions it might be because of the utilization of a high concentration 25 g l of coffee ground biowaste under alkaline conditions yen et al 2022 different adsorbents exhibited different removal capabilities at different solution ph due to their different phpzc and zeta potential values 3 4 reaction temperature the reaction temperature can influence the diffusion rate of mps nps and sorption capacity for instance it was noticed that the adsorption capacity of modified cellulose aerogel first increased with the rise of temperature up to 35 c and then declined by further increasing temperature from 35 to 65 c thus demonstrated the defect of physical adsorption zhuang et al 2022 fe kaolin could adsorb more nps pcv ps pet and abs with the rise in reaction temperature because the values of δg of nps adsorbed by fe kaolin declined from 7 02 to 3 49 kj mol with the increase in temperature from 293 15 to 313 15 k moreover the sorption behavior of nps on fe kaolin was endothermic because both δh and δs were more significant than zero co mn kaolin removed more nps with the decline of the reaction temperature because the values of δg of nps adsorbed by co mn kaolin boosted from 2 84 to 7 03 kj mol with the rise of the temperature from 293 15 to 313 15 k besides the sorption behavior of nps on co mn kaolin was exothermic because both δh and δs were less than zero huang et al 2022 while different reaction temperatures 15 25 and 40 c did not stimulus the removal efficacy of ps cooh mps ps nh2 mps by fb 550 and fb 850 as the decline in gibbs energy value was noticed leading to faster interaction and improved elimination singh et al 2021 different adsorbents showed different behaviors at different reaction temperatures due to their different natural chemical compositions 3 5 natural organic matter the manifestation of natural organic matter nom can influence the removal performance of adsorbents because it can attach to the surfaces of either plastic particles or adsorbents via electrostatic hydrophobic and π π interactions they can obstruct the adsorption process owing to steric hindrances and exertion of stability impact on plastic particles few researchers investigated the sway of nom on the removal performance of distinctive adsorbents against mps nps for instance a chitin based sponge has shown resistance against dom and the removal efficiency of ps ps cooh and ps nh2 mps 1 µm was slightly reduced in the manifestation of dom sun et al 2021 likewise humic acid ha did not intrude with ps mps adsorption which indicated that the adhesive surface was not fouled by water soluble hydrophobic materials chazovachii et al 2021 in contrast nom could decline the removal efficiency of zn mbc by creating direct competition between mps and nom during adsorption wang et al 2021a likewise ha also impacted the removal of negatively and positively charged mps by fb 550 and fb 850 and least affected the elimination of ps cooh mps compared to ps nh2 mps because amine functionalized mps with lone pairs could conjugate with ha rapidly through π π conjugation notably ha significantly inhibited the sorption of ps cooh nps 30 nm even at ha concentrations 5 mg l due to the rapid adsorption of ha on nps which led nps to steric stabilization and declined the electrostatic interaction between nps and adsorbent singh et al 2021 similarly the manifestation of ha significantly dropped the removal efficiency of ps nps by bc 750 even at a modest concentration 1 mg l this reduction could be ascribed to the steric hindrances caused by ha directing to declined heteroaggregation of nps and coating of ha on the surfaces of nps and bc 750 created very strong electrostatic repulsion which exerted a stabilizing effect on negative charged nps and declined removal percentage ganie et al 2021 recently sun et al 2022 narrated that ha significantly inhibited ps nps sorption on the cellulose mg al ldh composite beads because negatively charged ha developed electrostatic interactions with the positively charged beads impeding the sorption sites on the beads and thus hindering the adsorption of ps nps on the beads sun et al 2022 overall different adsorbents have presented different removal behavior in the presence of nom due to their morphology and tolerance capability against nom 3 6 co existing interfering ions the presence of cations and anions can influence the adsorption process by creating competition to obtain vacant sites on surfaces of adsorbents table 2 described various cations and anions used to examine the effect of co existing ions on the performance of different adsorbents against mps nps removal for instance the presence of cl significantly declined the adsorption performance of aerogel against ps mps because the greater content of cl protected the cationic group zhuang et al 2022 in contrast common competitive anions i e cl co3 2 and no3 did not influence the removal performance of 3d oldh against ps nps peng et al 2022 further the presence of cl declined the sorption of mps pcv ps pet and abs by co mn kaolin owing to the presence of competition between nps and cl for obtaining vacant sites notably cl first declined the sorption of mps by fe kaolin but when the concentration of cl amplified to a certain extent then cl stimulated the adsorption of the mps owing to the configuration of ferric chloride on the surface of fe kaolin because ferric chloride could generate positively charged ferric hydroxide colloid after hydrolysis which promoted sorption of negatively charged mps on fe kaolin huang et al 2022 thus it would be better to dechlorinate adsorbents before using them for the adsorption of mps nps further the manifestation of hco3 significantly declined the elimination efficiency of ps nps by cuni c because the hydrolysis of hco3 generated oh which altered zeta potential of ps nps 16 6 mv and cuni c 5 24 mv and this eventually enhanced the electrostatic repulsion in the system zhou et al 2022 further the presence of so4 2 and po4 2 drastically declined the sorption performance of ps nps by zn al ldh where 2 of removal was noticed this indicated that so4 2 and po4 3 had a higher specific affinity towards ldh than ps nps tiwari et al 2020 likewise the incidence of po4 3 considerably inhibited the removal efficiency ps mps by zn mbc because of having higher charge density than ps mps wang et al 2021a the manifestation of 5 mm concentration of hco3 noticeably dropped the ejection percentage 50 of ps nps by bc 750 this could be explained in this way that hco3 acted as a buffer and altered solution ph towards basic nature at which biochar acquired more net negative charge resulting in the repulsion of nps because the solution demonstrated an abrupt transformation of ph from 5 5 to 8 6 ganie et al 2021 further the adsorption capacity of ps cooh mps declined marginally with fb 550 and fb 850 in the occurrence of po4 3 further interfering ions did not impact the removal of ps nh2 mps by fb 550 and fb 850 due to the strong inner sphere complexation of mps with an adsorbent surface notably the presence of interfering ions significantly improved the sorption of ps cooh nps 30 nm onto fb 550 and fb 850 because of having charge screening effect and self aggregation which strongly bonded nps with the available sites on the adsorbent singh et al 2021 thus size along with the surface charge of the plastic particles would also influence the sorption behavior in the presence of interfering ions the presence of ca2 significantly dropped the adsorption performance of ps nps 80 nm by iron modified fly ash owing to ion exchange interaction between fe ions and ca2 on the surface of adsorbents while other cations mg2 na and k did not inhibit removal performance in contrast the existence of no3 2 and po4 2 substantially declined the removal of ps nps by iron modified fly ash adsorbent due to having a relatively high charge density than ps nps zhao et al 2022 likewise sun et al 2022 reported that the removal effect of ps nps by cellulose mg al ldh composite beads significantly inhibited the increase of ionic strength and the influence trend of ions was cacl2 nacl kcl notably the effect of divalent cations ca2 was more significant than that of monovalent anions na and k due to higher double layer compression and the combination of ca2 with the negatively charged functional groups of ps nps further the adsorption capacity of the beads significantly declined with the increased concentration of so4 2 which obstructed the positively charged vacant active sites of the beads sun et al 2022 overall different adsorbents indicated different removal performances in the presence of co existing ions due to their unique morphology charge screening effect and self aggregation attributes 4 regeneration and reusability of the developed adsorbents regeneration and reusability for adsorbents are often considered important to transfer adsorption based technology from lab scale to commercial applications regarding this various researchers have examined the regeneration and reusability potential of the developed adsorbents against mps nps removal it can be noticed that ethanol solution has been used to regenerate sponge aerogel based adsorbents table 3 most of the sponge based adsorbents could be reused for up to 3 to 5 consecutive treatment cycles and they could maintain their removal performance in the range of 60 80 depending on the initial concentration of plastic particles size adsorbent dosage and the number of the consecutive treatment cycle table 3 notably fe3o4 pdms halloysite pdms pdms coated sponge could be reused for up to 50 consecutive treatment cycles and maintain more than 99 removal efficiency rong et al 2022 further metal based adsorbents could be regenerated using various solutions i e ethanol naoh and water and thermal treatment noticeably metal based adsorbents showed good reusability performance about 8 12 decrease in removal efficiency was noticed up to five 05 consecutive treatment cycles further biochar based adsorbents could be regenerated using water acetone and thermal pyrolysis biochar based adsorbents showed remarkably high reusability performance up to 4 to 5 consecutive treatment cycles approximately 4 5 decline in removal efficiency was observed after regenerating by the thermal pyrolysis method because thermal treatment could completely degrade the adsorbed plastic particles from the surface and pores of biochar owing to having catalytic properties of biochar in the meantime thermal treatment could replenish the porosity and surface area of the biochar based adsorbents wang et al 2021a in summary different adsorbents depicted different reusability potentials due to their diverse chemical composition and the employment of different regeneration solutions techniques 5 practical application of the developed adsorbents practical application of the developed adsorbents is essential to transfer proposed adsorption based technology from laboratory scale to industrial implementations because natural water is more variable and authentic than ultrapure water used in the laboratory natural water samples usually enclose a variety of contaminants salts heavy metals toxic dyes natural organic matter and micropollutants which may alter the elimination performance of the proposed adsorbents regarding this researchers compared the removal performances of the proposed adsorbents by applying them to natural waters including river water lake water seawater domestic wastewater groundwater industrial wastewater hard water and drainage water table 4 for instance the removal efficiency of pet pe and ps mps by pda mcs reached 97 3 94 6 and 92 3 respectively in river water and drainage water however in ultrapure water the elimination efficiency of pet pe and ps mps was 91 6 35 and 46 respectively this difference in removal efficiencies could be endorsed to electrostatic interactions because non negatively charged mps pe and ps could act as a medium to adsorb ions and organic pollutants from natural waters they could transform their surface charge into negative then these negatively charged mps could attach to the surface of positively charged pda mcs aerogel via electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding and π π interactions zheng et al 2022 likewise spion systems improved their removal performance against mps ps pmma and mr in river water samples and it was projected that the presence of small molecule organic soaps herbicides or has could contribute to balancing unfavorable surface charges after adsorption on the surface of adsorbent sarcletti et al 2021 similarly 3d oldh could remove 90 ps nps 80 nm from lake water and tap water which was equivalent to adsorption performance in deionized water 96 in addition the removal efficiency of ps nps could reach up to 75 in industrial wastewater peng et al 2022 further pei ce sponge could remove approximately 98 nps pmma pvc and pvac within 30 min from commercial body scrub samples batool and valiyaveettil 2021 similarly zif 8 aerogel could remove 92 5 and 88 7 of pvdf and ps nps respectively from seawater samples you et al 2021 further fe2o3 mno2 core shell micromotors could remove over 10 pe mps within 2 h from wastewater through the synergy of catalytic degradation surface adsorption and adsorptive bubbles separations mechanisms ye et al 2021 m cnts could eradicate 100 mps pe pet and pa from kitchen wastewater within 300 min tang et al 2021 more than 80 removal of mps pe and pes was achieved when nano fe3o4 adsorbent was employed to river water domestic sewage and seawater samples shi et al 2022 in contrast a sharp decline in removal efficiency 53 of ps mps was noticed by zn mbc in the case of river water due to the incidence of abundant nom because nom could create direct competition during the adsorption process in addition the low removal performance 52 of zn mbc in the case of wastewater was mainly due to the presence of anionic dyes which could compete for positively charged vacant sites and chunk the small micropores owing to their smaller molecular sizes wang et al 2021a likewise the sorption of ps cooh and ps nh2 mps 1 µm by fb 550 and fb 850 depicted the removal trend as freshwater tap water groundwater due to having higher ionic strength of groundwater 18 97 103 m compared to tap water 14 78 103 m and freshwater 1 28 103 m however the quantity of nom content was higher in groundwater greater ionic strength had a leading effect singh et al 2021 further zn al ldh depicted the highest elimination of ps cooh nps 55 nm in the case of synthetic freshwater because of the self aggregation of nps owing to the presence of diverse ionic species in comparison zn al ldh depicted the lowest removal of nps in the case of synthetic hard water owing to competitive site binding by the high concentrations of anionic species which could decline the stability of ldh under alkaline conditions ph 8 in addition the coating of nom on the superficial of ldh could provide an additional stabilization effect via electrostatic repulsion in the system tiwari et al 2020 further the eradication of ps nps by bc 750 followed the order of groundwater 98 river water 75 wastewater 25 the low removal percentage in river water was mainly due to bicarbonate ions which altered the solution ph towards alkaline conditions ph 8 3 in contrast steric hindrances caused by a high concentration of dissolved organic carbon content sucrose extremely impacted the removal of ps nps in wastewater noticeably the high ionic strength of groundwater 1 7 10 2 m compared to river water 0 3 10 2 m caused higher homoaggregation of nps in groundwater this phenomenon played a key role in the adsorption process via the bridging effect owing to the incidence of high ca2 concentration in groundwater 80 16 mg l compared to river water 18 49 mg l although the ionic strength of wastewater was very high 7 9 10 1 m as rivaled to river water and groundwater however owing to the various high steric hindrances caused by high dissolved organic carbon concentration resulted from low interaction between ps nps and bc 750 ganie et al 2021 a team of investigators reported similar findings that the incidence of nom and divalent ions could decline the removal of ps nps on gac in lake water because of the development of large aggregates via bridging effects and these larger size aggregates could not penetrate the gac pores arenas et al 2021 in summary the co presence pollutants significantly inhibited the expected removal performance of the developed adsorbents thus pre optimization of environmental conditions or integration of adsorption based technology with other techniques coagulation filtration membrane bioreactor would be required to gain maximum removal efficiency at minimum operating expenses 6 barriers to market penetrations studies have indicated that various novel adsorbents have been established and utilized to remove mps and nps from contaminated waters table 1 however none of the developed adsorbents has been transferred from laboratory scale to commercial level to date because the selection of adsorbent is dependent on many factors including fabrication expenses accessibility the seriousness of targeted pollutant stability recovery functional design environmental risks removal performance regeneration and reusability etc table 5 represents the pros and cons of the developed adsorbents used for the remediation of mps and nps from polluted waters it can be noticed that most of the adsorbents were fabricated using expensive and toxic chemicals which would eventually increase the treatment cost in addition most of the developed adsorbents were a mixture of different metals excluding some sponge aerogel based adsorbents thus they can generate secondary pollutants in the environment after breakdown because of the leaching of metals and nanoparticles notably some adsorbents e g sponge aerogel could be biodegraded in the soil but the adsorbed plastic particles may negatively impact the soil environment no one has highlighted this point thus it should be considered in future investigations to better implement adsorbent based technology for the remediation of mps and nps likewise the adsorbents can develop new pollutants after interacting with other co presence pollutants in real sewage and this phenomenon would eventually alter the adsorbents performance and their fate in natural water environments on the other hand various technologies including coagulation granular media filtration or membrane processes photocatalysis and bioremediation have also been employed to eliminate mps and nps from contaminated waters chen et al 2022c however certain limitations owing to their mechanisms and the nature of treatment methods have hindered their practical implementations despite promising removal performance efficiencies energy utilization and incompetence in removing small sized plastic particles nps are the typical limitations of all the proposed treatment technologies golgoli et al 2021 for instance granular media filtration or membrane processes mbr and uf have shown excellent performance in removing plastic particles and these processes have been executed in many wastewater treatment plants enfrin et al 2020 however membrane fouling is an unavoidable problem for all membrane based processes eventually leading to the deterioration of separation performance and increased operational costs in terms of frequent membrane cleaning and replacement li et al 2021 li et al 2020 further the co presence of other pollutants including metal ions biological matter and natural organic matter can intensify the fouling tendency for instance some mps could tend to motivate microbial activity and result in the generation of extracellular polymeric substances thus promoting the development of biofilms and exaggerating biofouling xiong et al 2021 notably the fitting of pretreatment technologies including ozonation coagulation and uv chlorin could efficiently reduce membrane fouling susceptibility however these techniques have their own demerits as well du et al 2019 wan et al 2021 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 for example the deposit of al based coagulants in the remedied water is neurotoxic and can cause harmful human health consequences kimura et al 2013 in addition a substantial quantity of coagulants and polymeric essences has also been identified in the effluents owing to their heavy usage in the coagulation process further bioremediation by bacteria fungi enzymes and microalgae is assumed to be an environment friendly and cost effective treatment technology for mps and nps in addition it can be done in both in situ and ex situ conditions however the implementation of this technique is largely limited because of having comparatively low elimination efficiency even after a lengthy treatment time however the employment of genetically modified organisms could efficiently enhance the biodegradation rate jaiswal et al 2020 however the unquantifiable negative impacts introduced by genetically modified organisms on the environment are still unknown further the photocatalysis technique has shown the potential to completely mineralize mps without producing byproducts however the cost and energy depletion of photocatalysis is comparatively high when compared to traditional treatment technologies patil et al 2022 although the optimization of operational parameters and development of low cost photocatalysts can increase the mps nps degradation performance however some situations such as sustaining the solution temperature at 0ºc are considered impractical for the actual application ariza tarazona et al 2020 therefore under these circumstances adsorption can be one of the capable technologies for eliminating mps and nps from the water environment because a variety of novel adsorbents can be fabricated via different methods to improve adsorption techniques for targeted removal of mps nps in addition surface modification of adsorbents not only enhances their firmness and dispersibility but also supports to expedite the integration of adsorption technology with other technologies i e coagulation membrane bioreactor filtration to gain maximum removal at a minimum operational cost for instance nano adsorbents were integrated within the bulk polymeric membrane matrix to develop nanocomposite membrane to remove organic pollutants gupta et al 2021 such adsorbents based integrated membrane processes should also be examined for the elimination of mps nps because of the presence of abundant hydrophilic functional groups oh cooh which may enhance the performance capability of membrane process to capture even smaller size plastic polymers nps which could easily pass through membrane pores sun et al 2020 likewise integrating nano adsorbent carbon nanotube within polymeric membrane could improve ultrahigh water penetration flux under a low driving pressure goh et al 2013 as it can minimize the energy footprint of the membrane process without conceding the output of the method further it was observed that none of the available studies could highlight the end use of retrieved mps nps acquired from the regeneration process of adsorption thus the treatment of collected mps nps is important to minimize their adverse impacts on the environment and to propose adsorbent based technology commercially for this purpose adsorption technology can be integrated with post degradation technologies i e electrocatalysis biodegradation photocatalysis thermal degradation and advanced oxidation processes to minimize environmental footprint of mps nps pollution in addition the collected mps nps can be transferred into valuable products h2o carbon nanoparticles co2 green hydrogen gas and trim chain monomers chen et al 2022a wang et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 7 conclusions knowledge gaps and future recommendations published articles have indicated that novel adsorbents have been prepared via different fabrication routes and they can efficiently remove both microplastics and nanoplastics from synthetic and real sewage however considerable knowledge gaps still subsist recommending enduring debates to confirm water safety therefore the major conclusions knowledge gaps and looming perspectives of this critical review are as follows 1 innovations in the development of promising adsorbents the sponge aerogel based adsorbents have great potential in removing microplastics and nanoplastics from polluted waters due to their unique porous morphology and diverse reactive functional groups notably sponge aerogel can remove higher nanoplastics than microplastics because nanoplastics could enter the sponge s internal network due to attractive energy differences and capillary diffusion forces in addition the reactive sites can be increased by loading different nanoparticles into sponge aerogel notably biomass based fabricated sponge aerogel can be biodegraded thus can minimize the generation of secondary pollutants in the environment both microplastics and nanoplastics can attach to the surfaces of metal based adsorbents through diverse interactions forces surface complexation hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction ion exchange etc depending on the type of plastic particles and adsorbents morphology subsequently they can also develop agglomerates in the water environment notably small size plastic particles nanoplastics can also enter the pores of the metal based adsorbents via pore diffusion notably metal based adsorbents can also adsorb on the surfaces of microplastics indicating that both possibilities are existed depending on the size of plastic particles and the morphology of the adsorbents thus these adsorbents can completely remove micro nanoplastics from the water environment it is observed that biochar based adsorbents can remove 75 microplastics and nanoplastics from polluted waters notably the increase in pyrolysis temperature incorporation of metals and metal oxides and biochar ageing can boost this removal efficiency up to 99 both positively charged and negatively charged microplastics and nanoplastics can be removed using biochar based adsorbents due to their unique porous morphology and diverse reactive functional groups further the adsorbed plastic particles on biochar can be further completely degraded via catalytic hydrolysis it was observed that different kinds of adsorbents were employed for removal of microplastics 0 105 1240 μm and nanoplastics 30 100 nm therefore microplastics 1240 μm and nanoplastics 30 nm should also be used in future inspections to better realize the remediation of microplastics and nanoplastics by adsorption technology so far laboratory made virgin and surface functionalized plastic polymers are subjected to examine their removal using different kinds of advanced adsorbents thus other plastic polymers should also be utilized to better understand the remediation potential by adsorption technology till now isotherm kinetics model equations and modern machinery have been devoted to understand the adsorption mechanisms it was noticed that different adsorbents have shown distinct adsorption mechanisms which mainly depended on the characteristics of adsorbents medium and plastics particles thus computational studies like density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations should also be considered to better understand the role of functional groups in removing microplastics and nanoplastics because artificial factors can control surface chemistry none of the researcher has yet reported cost analysis calculations thus cost analysis studies should be performed in future experiments to better explicate the practical feasibility of advanced adsorbents at commercial levels although biochar based adsorbents are inexpensive environment friendly and can be fabricated in a single step pyrolysis without using expensive and toxic chemicals however more research efforts are required for increasing the cost effectiveness of adsorbents by investigating the performance of other waste materials e g fly ash clay biowaste etc such as coffee grounds and cigarette butts in addition artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques should also be employed to evaluate the fabrication of adsorbents with desired attributes for gaining maximum removal performance by investing minimum expenditures 2 influence of pertinent factors both microplastics and nanoplastics removal can be improved by altering fabrication protocols and after incorporation of different kinds of nanoparticles metals metal oxides and acids notably various modifications can create different interaction forces for the adsorption of microplastics and nanoplastics it is noticed that smaller size micro nanoplastics can adsorb on the inner network of the adsorbents as compared to larger size micro nanoplastics notably the difference in attractive energies between plastic particles and sponge based adsorbents can influence the adsorption of micro nanoplastics which can eventually alter the removal capability of adsorbents thus this direction would require more investigations into other adsorbents and plastic polymers further different surface properties of micro nanoplastics can show different removal mechanisms against the same adsorbent due to their different chemical structure and composition some specific plastic polymers including polyethylene terephthalate polyamide polyvinylidene fluoride and polyethylene have been engaged to explore removal mechanisms thus other plastic polymers should be involved against different adsorbents to better understand the changing in removal mechanisms further the shape of micro nanoplastics can also influence the removal performance thus more investigations are required for other plastic polymers to better comprehend the function of plastic polymer shapes on the removal performance of different adsorbents published reports have indicated that sponge aerogel based adsorbents can reduce removal efficiency under strong acidic and alkaline conditions these adsorbents can remove maximum micro nanoplastics at ph 6 8 further metal based adsorbents can decline removal efficiency under strongly alkaline conditions ph 9 and they depicted the highest removal performance at the ph range of 3 7 while biochar based adsorbents have shown different results because the biochar prepared by different pyrolysis temperatures depicted different removal trends due to having different phpzc values in addition the existence of multivalent cations in the composition of biochar can also alter the removal capability of the prepared biochar at different solution ph overall biochar based adsorbents showed maximum adsorption in the range of ph 5 8 notably contradictory findings were observed about the effect of reaction temperature on the performance of adsorbents despite this truth sponge aerogel based adsorbents have revealed higher removal at higher temperatures in contrast meta based adsorbents can improve or decline removal with the rise of reaction temperature moreover reaction temperature did not influence the performance of biochar against microplastics therefore more investigations are urgently needed to better understand the stimulus of reaction temperature on the performance of different adsorbents against microplastics and nanoplastics reports have shown that sponge aerogel based adsorbents can tolerate the manifestation of natural organic matter and maintain their removal performance however biochar based adsorbents dropped their removal performance in the incidence of natural organic matter owing to steric hindrances and electrostatic repulsion notably none of the available reports can highlight the impact of natural organic matter on the performance of metal based adsorbents against micro nanoplastics therefore more studies are urgently required to better elucidate the influence of natural organic matter on the performance of different developed adsorbents against micro nanoplastics removal findings have shown that the presence of co existing ions can alter the removal performance of different adsorbents against micro nanoplastics by creating competition generating other competitive ions showing higher affinity towards adsorbents showing higher charge density than plastic particles and altering solution ph notably some adsorbents have shown excellent resistance against these co existing ions and can maintain their removal performance their adsorption performance can be improved because they have a unique morphology charge screening effect and self aggregation characteristics thus more investigations would be required to fabricate novel adsorbents to maintain adsorption performance against micro nanoplastics in the presence of co existing ions or pollutants 3 regeneration and reusability to date limited studies have explored the regeneration and reusability potential of the developed adsorbents different adsorbents have revealed different reusability potentials such as sponge aerogel based adsorbents depicted the highest reusability potential and could be reused using a simple ethanol solution exhausted sponge aerogel based adsorbents can be biodegraded without generating secondary pollution notably the thermal pyrolysis method can improve the reusability potential of the biochar based adsorbents because it can replenish the porosity surface area surface activity and structure of the adsorbent however it is an expensive and harmful technique because thermal treatment may need high temperatures and produce gas pollutants that eventually affect air quality further water is a cost effective regeneration solution but it cannot confer acceptable reusability performance therefore more investigations are needed to develop novel adsorbents which can be regenerated using cheap and environment friendly eluents and they can also deliver maximum removal performance and reusability potential 4 practical implementations of the developed adsorbents it is observed that different adsorbents depicted different removal trends in real water samples some adsorbents can tolerate co presence pollutants and maintain their removal performance however most of the adsorbents cannot endure their presence further the incidence of natural organic matter toxic dyes salts and metal ions can inhibit the removal performance of adsorbents by creating steric hindrance electrostatic repulsion and aggregation in the system thus pre optimizing the environmental conditions is important before using these adsorbents for practical purposes in addition more investigations are urgently needed to understand how developed adsorbents can tolerate the presence of other co existing pollutants and maintain their adsorption performance in real environmental situations 5 barriers to market penetrations it is observed that sole adsorption based technology is insufficient to remove completely the plastic particles from contaminated waters therefore it is suggested that different adsorbents can be integrated with other existing treatment units to improve the overall treatment capability of microplastics and nanoplastics importantly such integration schemes can reduce the shortcomings of current treatment technologies and adsorption based technology therefore future studies should investigate these aspects to better implement adsorption based technology for the remediation of microplastics and nanoplastics credit authorship contribution statement imran ali conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft xiao tan supervision conceptualization writing review editing funding

15129,fires in forested catchments pose a water contamination risk from fire derived dissolved organic matter dom fire events are expected to increase under a projection of warmer and drier climatic conditions therefore understanding the consequences of fire derived dom is critical for water supply and management of drinking water and catchments this paper addresses how fire regime the intensity severity and frequency of fires influences dom quantity and composition in surface waters in forested catchments and how long it takes for water quality to recover to pre fire levels a review of post fire studies in mediterranean regions reporting on dom related parameters has been conducted the literature shows that post fire dom composition and reactivity is different from dom generated under processes of biological degradation and hence our reliance on dom bulk properties and surrogate dom bulk parameters may not provide sufficient information to deal with the potential complexity of the organic compounds produced by a catchment fire appropriate measures are important to adequately operate conventional water treatment facilities for example critical parameters for the effects of burning include the alteration of dom composition aromaticity and the relative amounts of labile recalcitrant organic components the literature shows mixed information for the influence of both burn severity and fire intensity on these parameters which indicates dom response to fire is highly variable for fire frequency the evidence is more unequivocal indicating that frequent fires change the composition of dom to components that are less bioavailable and elevate the degree of aromaticity which may be detrimental to water quality in addition and in general terms the more recent the fire the more aromatic and humified dom components are found and vice versa the recovery of surface water quality to pre fire conditions was variable with no safe temporal thresholds suggested in the literature in some cases fire induced changes in dom composition were observable up to 16 years post fire the lack of clearly observed trends in post fire dom with fire regimes could be attributed to numerous factors such as limited long term and event based observations experimental design challenges and site specific biological physical and hydrological factors the application of terminologies used to describe fire regimes such as burn severity and fire intensity also creates challenges in comparing the outcomes and results from numerous studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter water treatment fire forested catchment drinking water quality data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction this review paper provides a synthesis of the relationships between fire regime and post fire dissolved organic matter dom in surface waters the outcomes from the review are expected to provide the latest body of knowledge for water and catchment managers in fire prone forested catchments with more severe and frequent wildland fires forecasted under current climate scenarios for some ecosystems see moritz et al 2012 the direct and indirect effects of these fires will generate fire derived pyrogenic dom pydom with different characteristics both in quantity and composition which could have significant consequences for the quality of potable water supply hohner et al 2019 currently there is no standard protocol to treat wildland fire affected water chen et al 2020 other than taking the reservoir off line and using an alternate source of drinking water further as cottingham 2006 argues reduced flows in streams and abnormally low reservoir operating levels under warmer and drier climate conditions coupled with higher input loads of fire derived dom can cause raw water quality to further deteriorate pyrogenic materials generated by wildland fire may be transported across terrestrial landscapes and eventually transferred into water bodies causing imbalance to normal trophic functioning of aquatic ecosystems chen et al 2020 the pyrogenic materials and organic matter from fire impacted sites can be mobilized and deposited downstream bladon et al 2014 emelko et al 2016 substantial rain events typical of some climate types in combination with wet dry cycles could also cause breakage of soil aggregates exposing aggregate protected by soil organic matter som to leaching shakesby 2011 therefore a wildland fire may burn through a forested catchment for a short period but changes in dom quantity and composition may persist in such a landscape for a long period chow et al 2019 the quantity and reactivity of natural dom or pydom in freshwater is influenced by many factors the composition of dom depends on its source such as degrading plants soil organic matter som and decomposition products of bacterial and algal matter in the water column mcknight et al 2003 other factors include environmental and biological elements of the system chiefly hydrology vegetation type soil type and bedrock geology with their spatiotemporal variations cronan 2018 the quantity and composition of dom in natural water sources is dynamic exhibiting short term fluctuation due to diurnal influence from photo degradation or from storm event driven inputs seasonal and inter seasonal variability of the biogeochemical processes influence dom causing significant interpretative challenges cronan 2018 thus the changes in bulk dom concentration do not always reflect the differences in composition at a molecular level as observed by osterholz et al 2016 for example elevated water colour immediately following burning in a wetland was not matched by a rise in doc concentration clay et al 2012 similarly mansilha et al 2019 found no correlation between wildfire and colour of the water samples collected from burned areas in central portugal yet polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs were recorded at concentrations 1 2 to 4 times higher than in unburned control samples thus as proposed by clay et al 2012 fire effected dom composition could be missed when bulk parameters such as water colour or doc quantity are used alone to study pydom in fire effected catchments 1 1 dom composition and sources in forested catchments dom is generally considered the portion of organic material that passes through an average filter with a pore size of less than 0 45 μm cronan 2018 however the actual composition of dom is highly variable consisting of a large proportion of dissolved humic materials operationally divided into highly polymeric humic substances humic and fulvic acids together with a host of simpler compounds such as carbohydrates proteins and amino acids findlay et al 2002 cronan 2018 and their isomers most common organic substances are humic acids of terrestrial origin autochthonous fulvic acids of phytoplankton or algal origin and by products of metabolic processes like carbohydrates sugars amino acids proteins lipids organic acids phenols alcohols acetylated amino sugars and others mcknight et al 2003 mostofa et al 2013 the organic compounds that comprise the dom pool are 50 carbon by mass and thus dissolved organic carbon doc is generally used as a primary measure of the total dom content in natural waters cronan 2018 the transfer of organic material to surface waters is dominated by direct inputs of dom associated with the advective transport of surface water or groundwater at the catchment scale most of the advective inputs pass through or over the soil before entering surface water findlay et al 2002 the organic matter in forest soil exists in a continuum of detrital fractions ranging from recognizable litter and woody debris to humus to humic coatings on soil minerals and finally to dom in the soil solution phase thus changes in soil carbon pools subsequently affects dom production and transport findlay et al 2002 hohner et al 2019 these processes and pathways in forested catchments are therefore susceptible to significant disturbance caused by wildland fire 1 2 fire dom water quality nexus post fire precipitation promotes the leaching of chemicals from pyrogenic materials and ash to nearby surface waters the dissolution and deposition increases concentrations of dom in water abney and berhe 2018 and can challenge the operation of conventional drinking water treatment processes dom itself is not a contaminant with direct impacts on public health but can interfere with the water treatment processes resulting in the formation of disinfection by products dbps chen et al 2020 it also affects watercolour and taste and serves as a substrate for unwanted microbial growth and is a common foulant of membranes and adsorption processes chen et al 2020 one of the main challenges for effective dom removal in water treatment plants is due to the inherent complex composition of dom with varying degrees of reactivity both laboratory and treatment plant level studies report that coagulation does not consistently remove all dom chen et al 2020 there is an inherent difference in dom composition based on their sources for instance allochthonous dom is dominated by non polar hydrophobic humics with larger molecular weight and more aromatic structures with low nitrogen n content findlay et al 2002 while autochthonous dom is generally of a lower molecular weight with increased polarity and with n and carboxyl groups making them hydrophilic and more easily mobilized and metabolized ejarque et al 2017 findlay et al 2002 these variations in the quantity and composition of incoming dom influence treatment efficiency and may require customized optimization of processes such as flocculation filtration and disinfection moreover the post fire mixture of dom may also change honher et al 2019 reported that conventional water treatment options removed 54 of organic matter from unburned samples while only 24 was removed from leachates extracted from burned litter and soil lower efficiency dom removal 20 to 30 was also reported by chen et al 2020 from water samples from burned areas when compared to higher dom removals 50 to 60 in samples from unburned sites dom with larger molecular weights and more double bonds and rings are notable precursors of disinfection by products dbp and are reported to have been generated by fires chen et al 2021 the attributions of dom quantity and composition to the formation of dbps are well recorded by numerous studies becker et al 2018 kraus et al 2011 wang et al 2015 for example following 2007 and 2009 wildfires near santa barbara california revchuk and suffet 2014 recorded a 70 increase in doc in raw water resulting in a 49 increase in dbps measured as trihalomethane thm formation potential furthermore chow et al 2021 suggested unique chemical characteristics of fire derived dom may give rise to dbps that do not typically occur in water treatment and as observed by lavonen et al 2013 they have been neither identified nor had their toxicity assessed therefore characterizing dom in natural waters is a critical step in understanding the dynamics of dom and its implications on water quality andersson et al 2019 the physicochemical characterization of dom is even more essential in fire prone catchments for land management raw natural water source selection and drinking water treatment process optimization revchuk and suffet 2014 2 scope of review post fire catchment management strategies can be determined based on the fire regime often described as the history of fires fire interval and frequency fire intensity and burn severity this review synthesizes existing knowledge to explore how these attributes of fire regime influence dom quantity and composition in surface waters in forested catchments the review also builds on a body of knowledge from key review papers on post fire water quality by smith et al 2011 and a meta analysis on post fire water quality by hampton et al 2022 the paper discusses dom quantity and composition considering its inherent dynamic complexity and the limitations of analytical methods and field measurements the review focuses on studies conducted in forested biomes with a mediterranean type climate to allow comparison across similar fuel types fire behaviours and climatic conditions the world s mediterranean type ecosystems have a characteristic climate of mild wet winters and warm dry summers the ecosystems include both winter deciduous and evergreen woodlands and forests including iconic mediterranean type vegetation such as sclerophyll shrublands and woodlands adapted to long periods of dryness and heat rundel et al 2016 water supplies for humans in mediterranean settings depend upon winter rainfall surface runoff and reservoirs in forested catchments to store water for drier summer months wildfires in these regions moritz et al 2012 are attributable to high fuel loads high ambient temperatures and low humidity rodriguez et al 2018 in the review we accept the position taken by archibald et al 2018 and shakesby et al 2007 that an investigation of wildfire induced soil erosion and water quality is best achieved by framing post fire impacts in biogeographic terms and by recognising the influence of bioregional variation of vegetation types accordingly the review draws upon literature from the mediterranean basin and from regions on the pacific coast of north america and south america in southern africa and in southern australia all post fire studies from those geographical regions and mediterranean ecosystems reporting on dom quantity and composition have been considered including both field and laboratory scale investigations into water and leachate samples we are compelled to include the effects of all types of wildland fires in mediterranean ecosystems and indeed worldwide forms of management fires are used for land management to reduce fuel loads in the hope that they might reduce the intensity and severity of wildland fires and make them more controllable see for example boer et al 2009 and dellasalla et al 2022 we therefore examine the literature to determine if such prescribed burns are also able to protect water quality in drinking water supply areas in the context of dom the descriptors of burn severity and fire intensity are most often used to characterise and assess the effects of fire events on ecosystems and both are usually categorized as low moderate or high authors have interpreted their meaning differently and at times the terms have been used interchangeably for this paper the recommendations by keeley 2009 have been adopted burn severity implies the magnitude of post fire changes to an ecosystem such as amount of vegetation and litter consumed production of ash changes in surface reflectance and alteration in soil properties keeley 2009 see also pellegrini et al 2022 fire intensity wm 2 and the sometimes used burn intensity describe the physical combustion process of energy release from organic matter defined as energy per unit volume multiplied by the velocity at which the energy is moving keeley 2009 fire intensity is often quantified by the temperature of and heat released by the flaming front of fire lentile et al 2006 and it is also a relevant measure for the penetration of heat into deeper levels of the ground which can substantially alter underground biogeochemical processes keeley 2009 lentile et al 2006 thus burn temperature is often used as surrogate measure for categorizing fire intensity and this convention has also been applied in this review further more intense fire directly impacts the stock of organic matter pellegrini et al 2022 and thereby the severity of the burn using standard database searches all relevant studies within the above scope were gathered where possible the details of fire regime burn severity fire intensity and fire frequency were extracted from the study site descriptions or inferred from reported burn temperature descriptive degree of burning extent of burned areas or description of post fire ash and debris this has been done in an attempt to improve understandings of dom quantity and composition as a function of fire regime attributes as cautioned by keeley et al 2011 dissecting out one of the regime attributes and evaluating post fire response using that attribute alone may lead to erroneous information this is often done where the only information available after a wildfire event is a description of burn severity more infrequently a record of fire history is provided from which frequency can be inferred and only rarely is a measure of fire intensity available nevertheless an understanding of how pydom quantity and composition changes based on each of the attributes of fire regime is sought from the literature to provide information for post fire management the paper explores the literature for effects of burn severity on dom comparing low moderate to high burn severity and then the effects of low moderate fire intensity were compared to those of high fire intensity comparisons of dom quantity and composition were then analysed between less frequent and more frequent fires the effect of time since the last fire on dom was also discussed to supplement the observations of the effect of fire frequency the paper then presents recommendations for future research and a conclusion 3 fire behaviour and dom in surface waters 3 1 burn severity effects on dom characteristics higher burn severity in a forested catchment is associated with increased combustion of both above and belowground pools of organic matter laboratory and field studies have demonstrated that dom leached from burnt vegetation and soil residuals yielded concentrations 6 to 7 times higher than leachates from the unburned parent biomass further dom concentrations in stream water from a completely burned catchment were reportedly 67 higher than from unburned catchments following a severe wildfire chen et al 2020 uzun et al 2020 however the post fire responses in dom quantity and composition in relationship to burn severity are complex and there is little consensus in studies to date 3 1 1 the effects of high burn severity higher burn severity significantly reduces vegetation cover and generates more ash load that can be eroded and transported to waterways thermal alteration of organic matter in the absence of oxygen results in organic rich ash with widely varying organic content from less than 1 organics to more than half of the total ash mass bodi et al 2014 post fire ash leaches organic pollutants into water such as small sized polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs smith et al 2011 for example the balmoral fire of october 2013 which burned almost 13 000 ha of sydney s australia forested water supply catchment produced substantial ash loads that increased with burn severity with 6 16 and 34 t ha found in areas affected by low high and extreme burn severity respectively santín et al 2015 similarly santín et al 2018 reported that fire in dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest of south eastern australia produced an average of 6 3 3 1 t ha of ash with higher quantities in the areas subjected to high burn severity 6 9 3 3 t ha than in the areas of moderate burn severity 4 9 1 6 t ha as high severity wildfires combusted most of vegetation cover and soil organic matter in o horizons it often resulted in exposed soil reduced plant nutrient uptake and high post fire nutrient losses higher burn severity is also associated with slow vegetation recovery and reduced carbon uptake dynamics in post burn environments miesel et al 2015 which further increases dom loadings into aquatic systems in addition to increased generation of ash load high burn severity also altered post fire dom composition in surface water rust et al 2019 investigated long term data on water quality and other edaphic factors across the usa in fire affected catchments and reported increased burn severity to be associated with increased organic n no3 and total metal concentrations and their fluxes similarly chow et al 2019 found that stream doc and ultraviolet absorbance at specifically 254 nm suva254 were elevated in colorado catchments with high burn severity relative to unburned catchments further studies in colorado by kersher et al 2003 and in california by riggan et al 1994 reported high burn severity had the most detrimental effect on post fire water quality with increased doc and dissolved organic nitrogen in post fire water samples wang et al 2015 also reported the highest suva254 values under high burn severity compared to low burn severity illustrating the difference in dom composition under different burn severity the degree of burn severity could also affect dom composition in different ways martin et al 2009 reported that carbohydrates are immediately reduced by 34 and 55 under low and high burn severity respectively due to decrease of both hexoses and pentoses in two hydrolysis fractions this occurred while no significant difference was observed in the distribution of the neutral sugars in the hydrolysates between unburned and burned samples over time for this reason it is reasonable to assume that the proportion of soil carbon present as carbohydrates c could be a better measure for monitoring short and medium term changes induced by fire in soil organic matter rather than the overall organic carbon content overall there is a continuum of loss of organic matter via volatilization and combustion in both above and below ground organic matter pools and the amount of loss is highly variable see debano et al 1998 and knicker 2007 resulting in different post fire dom reactions 3 1 2 the effects of low moderate burn severity in contrast to what has been reported for higher burn severity many studies report higher post fire dom sum doc and don concentrations at low and moderate burn severity cawley et al 2018 hohner et al 2017 santos et al 2016 wang et al 2015 for example rhoades et al 2019 followed the hayman fire of 2002 in colorado and for forests dominated by ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii they reported elevated total carbon in streams originating from catchments that were burned to a lesser extent 30 to 60 of their areas burned compared to either unburned or extensively burned catchments this was attributed to the retention of a variety of organic matter sources including living and dead vegetation charred wood and som in o horizons which under high burn severity would have been completely combusted chow et al 2019 suggested moderate burn severities were the most important sources of long term differences in post fire dom quantity and composition as indicated by elevated concentration in stream doc formation of dbps trihalomethanes and chloral hydrate and high suva254 the association of moderate burn severity to higher doc release could be also attributed to increased mobility of ash derived dom during the initial flushes wang et al 2016 however uzun et al 2020 working in forest ecosystems primarily composed of longleaf pinus palustris and loblolly pine p taeda turkey oak quercus laevis and sweetgum liquidambar styraciflua reported minimal effect by moderate and low burn severity on post fire dom characteristics using pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms uzun et al 2020 observed no significant changes in functional groups i e phenolic compounds proteins carbohydrates aromatic 1 ring pahs and lipids within dom complexes further they showed that the prescribed burn decreased leaching of doc total dissolved nitrogen tdn dissolved organic nitrogen don nh4 and reactive phosphorus compared to unburned leachate samples 3 1 3 factors influencing the effects of burn severity the summary of the literature in fig 1 on the effects of burn severity on dom quantity and composition discussed above shows a lack of clear relationships between degree of burn severity and indicators of dom characteristics for example both high suva values and higher doc content are reported in both low moderate and high burn severity this may be attributed to our limited understanding of ecosystem impacts of fire on the interactions between complex biogeochemical processes the influence of burn severity on dom quantity and composition may be complicated by the other two fire regime attributes fire intensity and fire frequency as well as the complexity interplay of fire behaviour across site specific catchment conditions wang et al 2015 observed that at higher burn severity with higher temperature and oxygen availability a decrease in organic matter resulted which subsequently produced lower dom as a sum of doc and total dissolved nitrogen concentrations this implies a difference between combustion processes occurring in crown fires with more oxygen compared to ground fires with lower oxygen availability producing different post fire dom characteristics these include burned detritus extracts with lower molecular weight reflected by increased e2 e3 and fluorescence index and changes in aromaticity reflected by suva254 wang et al 2015 the effects of burn severity will be complicated where fire causes mineralogical changes in soil this includes an increase in ph and electrical conductivity that directly affects the reaction rates of biogeochemical transformations and where changes occur in the soil aggregate stability permeability of water and gas nutrient availability and transport of contaminants see santin and doer 2016 and vergnoux et al 2011 where there is unburnt vegetation and soil the organic layer was also found to reduce cawson et al 2013 transport of dom into surface waters however rainfall intensity could also result in increased runoff and transport of dom uzun et al 2020 accordingly as recognised by bird et al 2015 the process of degradation of pyrogenic materials and subsequent pydom transformation is still under investigation 3 2 fire intensity effects on dom characteristics fire intensity is associated with physical attributes such as temperature flame length duration of heating and emission of pyrogenic gases this section reviews the alteration in dom quantity and composition in relation to the measured burn temperature and derived categories of fire or burn intensity variation in burn temperature during a fire alters the normal breakdown processes of soil and terrestrial organic matter blake et al 2009 fernandes 2018 hohner et al 2019 tulau 2016 in a comprehensive review of fire effects on soil organic matter gonzalez perez et al 2004 show that fire intensity influences organic matter by i removing external oxygen groups yielding materials with comparatively reduced solubility ii reducing the chain length of alkyl compounds such as alkanes fatty acids and alcohols iii aromatising of sugars and lipids iv forming of heterocyclic n compounds and v producing an almost unalterable component often referred to as black carbon bc the latter is considered a long term repository of post fire dom while in the short term it has minimal contribution to dom in surface waters bird et al 2015 wagner and jaffé 2015 this suggests ageing of bc or pyrogenic materials in soil is one type of prerequisite to the dissolution and export into aquatic systems however the actual process of increased solubility of bc molecules is still unknown wagner et al 2017 zimmerman 2010 leachates of combusted som was attributed to increased aromaticity and an increase in relative proportion of o and n alkyl carbon using solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy not observed in leachate samples from unburned reference sites knicker et al 2005 3 2 1 effects of high fire intensity on dom higher burn temperature is likely to cause a loss of amount of organic matter from the fuel biomass and from soil organic layer according to debano et al 1998 higher burn temperature above 460 c caused irreversible changes in biological and physico chemical quality of soils making it highly erodible in some cases higher burn temperatures cause vaporization of soil organic compounds which condense and coat soil particles in a hydrophobic film prosser and williams 1998 tulau 2016 consequent changes in infiltration and erosivity in the burned catchments miesel et al 2015 tulau 2016 potentially influences downstream water quality in 2007 and 2009 revchuk and suffet 2014 assessed wildfires near santa barbara california with different fire intensities they found combustion under higher fire intensity breaks hydrophobic and hydrophilic structures into smaller fragments which are not bound and are easily washed away this resulted in significantly lower charged doc constituents amine groups linked carbon chain in leachate extracted from burned biomass compared to unburned sites further using ultrafiltration techniques dom from burned areas were found to be associated with the release of large size fragments of organic carbon dominated by molecular weights higher than 10 000 da while unburned sites were dominated by intermediate sized fragments 5000 to 10 000 da significant differences were also observed in fluorescence where optical properties of dom indicated structural changes with production of fulvic acid like dom which could either be fire derived or a contribution from post fire biological activity revchuk and suffet 2014 chen et al 2022 showed for leaf and wood materials burned at temperatures of 250 c 450 c and 600 c increasing values of suva254 and increasing degree of humification hix with increasing temperature with more aromatic compounds generated at higher burn temperatures 3 2 2 effects of low moderate fire intensity on dom at lower burn temperatures lesser amounts of organic matter may be lost via volatilization and convection see fig 2 often resulting in the retention of higher concentrations of biodegradable components such as tyrosine like and tryptophan like dom chen et al 2022 further wang et al 2015 observed that pyrolysis at 250 c increased extractable doc burned material was mixed with milli q water and filtered by 510 compared to unburned detritus indicating that post fire organic matter generated at low temperature could be an important part of the fire affected dom similarly soils heated to 225 c leached the greatest doc and had the highest c and n dbp precursor reactivity per unit carbon compared to the unheated material or soils heated to 350 or 500 c cawley et al 2018 this indicated higher dom release under low fire intensity one of the key concerns is the alteration of dom characteristics at moderate fire intensity where burn temperatures at 250 c produced more doc with proportionally higher aromatic content cawley et al 2018 wang et al 2015 than biomass burned at higher temperatures rhoades et al 2019 wang et al 2015 also reported that low temperature pyrolysis resulted in more soluble dom in the forest floor due to low temperature degradation and depolymerization of cellulose via trans glycosylation 250 to 300 c and lignocellulose components via cleavage of aryl alkyl ether linkages and dehydration 220 c soil samples collected from burned areas analysed in the laboratory after low intensity prescribed burn increased the aromaticity of water extracted organic matter hobley et al 2019 these results warrant attention of water managers to the potential challenges posed by the widespread use of low intensity prescribed fires to defuel forest catchments to reduce the effects of wildfires unlike under higher fire intensity areas burned at lower temperature may be less susceptible to post fire erosion as reported by cawson et al 2013 yet as mentioned above by chen et al 2022 and wang et al 2015 dom will undergo significant changes in concentration and composition 3 2 3 factors mediating the influence of fire intensity the current literature does not provide clear evidence to determine which levels of fire intensity affect water quality the most through alteration of dom composition and quantity see fig 2 this could be attributed to an array of site specific biogeochemical and ecosystem characteristics for example the transfer of heat depends on overall fuel biomass thickness packing ratio and moisture content of fuel bed certini 2005 the maximum temperature and duration of the burn are critical factors influencing the impact of fire intensity on post fire dom another factor influencing the dom concentration and composition is the patchiness of burned and unburned areas in fire impacted areas low intensity burns for example particularly prescribed burns have been found in eastern usa to have minimal detrimental effects on chemical physical and biological properties of surface waters this was attributed to unburned riparian zones that reduce and buffer the impact of fire on water quality hahn et al 2019 similar observations have also been reported by cawson et al 2013 where patchy unburned vegetation attenuated and buffered transportation of contaminants from burned areas to downstream the burn temperature can affect the microbial communities on the forest floor and can change the soil carbon stock for example combustion of biomass during fire was reported to be associated with decreased soil carbon stocks over the short term from a decrease in microbial anabolism relative to catabolism adkins and miesel 2021 3 3 effects of fire frequency and dom characteristics frequent fire events create a faster rate of nutrient release when compared to natural processes of nutrient release arising from weathering decomposition and mineralization bodi et al 2014 frequent fire affects c and n stocks through i their accessibility ii interactions with organic and inorganic matter iii their recalcitrance and iv the activity of decomposer communities pellegrini et al 2022 furthermore there may be significant variation in the effects of frequent forest fires on soil properties such as soil organic matter content santorufo et al 2021 and its effect on dom characteristics see fig 3 generally more frequently burned areas contain lower amounts of terrestrial organic matter for example regular prescribed burning in eucalyptus obliqua dominated lowland forests of south eastern australia was reported to have reduced total litter mass by 38 including a loss of 3 3 t ha carbon from the top 2 to 2 5 cm litter layer krishnaraj et al 2016 the total carbon stock gets transformed into various pyrogenic residues in the form of charcoal also referred to as pyrogenic carbon pyrogenic pahs and volatile organic compounds including organic carbon in smoke krishnaraj et al 2016 furthermore santorufo et al 2021 investigated the impact of fire frequency on mediterranean andosols and reported that fire caused a significant decrease in organic matter om content and lower total carbon tc in water samples from areas that are burned every year om decrease by 24 tc decrease by 30 or every two years om decrease by 30 tc decrease by 48 compared to unburned sites decrease in som with increase in fire frequency was also recorded by hinojosa et al 2021 in a study conducted in spain it was mainly attributed to loss of above ground vegetation cumulative loss of som from soil organic layer and limited vegetation recovery in frequently burned areas triggering soil erosion and leaching of organic matter in their work on the effects of prescribed burning in an australian eucalyptus forest hobley et al 2019 reported that repeated fire over decades reduced the quantity of soluble carbon and enhanced its aromaticity potentially reducing biological availability thus increasing fire frequency can be attributed to reducing terrestrial dom sources and thereby affecting the dom quantity and composition a study in south east of france by vergnoux et al 2011 conducted an experiment leaching soil samples collected from sites with different burn frequency and reported no significant difference between unburned and frequently burned sites for a bulk property like toc however frequent fire led to a significant increase in fulvic acid like compounds as observed using fluorescence spectroscopy on filtered samples of soil mixed with ultrapure water the increase was attributed to the transformations of non humified fraction into fulvic acid like compounds through aromatization and condensation processes further the quality of the hydrophilic fraction of water extractable organic matter weom was also found to be significantly altered resulting in higher molecular size and higher degree of aromaticity in very recently burned soil compared to unburned soil this was correlated with higher suva254 values observed in recently burned sites similarly for humic substances significant increases in aromaticity were also reported in its hydrophilic fraction this shows bulk parameters such as toc or doc do not reflect the actual change in dom composition and as emphasized by muqaddas et al 2019 it is critical to characterize post fire dom to better understand overall impacts of fire before making any post fire catchment management decisions 3 4 temporal effects post fire dom recovery the time since the last fire appears to play a critical role in influencing post fire dom quantity and composition and its effects on water quality knicker et al 2005 reported that high intensity forest fires in mediterranean ecosystems probably have long term effects on som as fire alters chemical composition of humic material towards higher aromaticity and generation of heterocyclic n compounds however the extent to which such alteration would survive the continuing humification processes and influence dom characteristics has not been ascertained santorufo et al 2021 rodriguez et al 2018 noted that increases in organic matter availability after a wildfire in andalusia spain increased microbial community activity for 2 to 3 years post fire other studies have also recorded similar effects of fire up to 16 years chow et al 2019 table 1 summarises the effects of time since the last fire for two categories where observed impacts are evident for i less than 5 years and ii greater than 5 years often during heavy post fire rainfall the initial flush mobilizes the newly generated post fire white ash and pahs resulting in high suva254 measurement uzun et al 2020 the higher aromaticity observed by wang et al 2015 was found to decrease towards the end of first rainy season s subsequent flushes of the catchment further the recently generated ash was also observed to have higher doc leaching potential than weathered and leached ash wang et al 2016 3 4 1 post fire impacts lasting 5 years the degree of change in dom composition and quantity is also a function of when the samples are collected after the fire revchuk and suffet 2014 recorded recently burned ash sampled 2 months after fire registered 10 times more doc leaching potential and was dominated by large size fragments compared to weathered 2 year old ash attributed to precipitation flushing out smaller hydrophobic and hydrophilic components see table 1 in addition the leachates from 2 months after fire were mainly composed of aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by products from either partially combusted vegetative matter or biological activity that consumed fire released organics this shows post fire dom undergoes numerous compositional changes as it is subject to microbially mediated biogeochemical processes it is not clear from the literature how long it takes for the catchment to return to a pre fire dom concentration for a 2015 wildfire in california a significant increase in doc concentration and changes in dom chemical properties lasted up to two years uzun et al 2020 for a wildfire in central portugal prats et al 2019 reported loss of organic material of 0 55 0 06 and 0 02 mg ha 1 y 1 for each of the following three years emphasizing the magnitude of loss in the first year short term effects of post fire change in dom have been shown in other mediterranean regions murphy et al 2006 reported an immediate increase in dom after a wildfire in nevada attributed to post fire erosion however after one year no differences in total carbon content or in soil leaching could be detected between before and after the wildfire vila escalé et al 2007 investigated post fire dom in the aquatic environment in a mediterranean creek in catalonia spain and found higher toc and doc concentrations and higher fluorescence intensity and uv absorbance when compared to background measurements these elevated values remained even after one and half years post fire with spikes in concentration following precipitation events by contrast pah concentrations approached background pre fire concentrations within 15 months after the fire vila escalé et al 2007 post fire pah concentrations in burned litter have also been reported to decline with time by uzun et al 2020 but there was noticeable variation in how long it takes to return to the pre fire level with site specific variability kim et al 2003 observed pahs being rapidly transported into the soil and returning to pre fire levels within months similarly mansilha et al 2019 reported a significant decrease in pahs concentrations after eight months from a study site in portugal due to degradation by atmospheric agents such as temperature humidity and adsorption on particles dom recovery less than five years was also reported by pierson et al 2019 where c and n yields from sediments collected 2 years post wildfire accounted for greater than 90 of the total sediment c and n yield over the 4 year study period overall the concentration of post fire contaminants is expected to be higher following the first rainfall events while returning to pre fire level might take a few more years and depends on the subsequent rainfall runoff events to flushing out the catchment 3 4 2 post fire impacts lasting 5 years while large scale fires often generate acute short term effects on water quality there is increasing evidence that in some catchments their effects can persist for many years chow et al 2019 rhoades et al 2011 vergnoux et al 2011 post fire water quality concerns were identified over 5 years after the 2002 hayman fire west of denver colorado rhoades et al 2011 while elevated stream doc and suva254 were detectable 14 years after the fire chow et al 2019 similarly vergnoux et al 2011 reported that fire derived humic substances with increased aromaticity were recorded for more than 16 years such long term observations call for more in depth exploration into the fate of pydom and its implications for water quality particularly given hampton et al 2022 meta analysis which revealed that more than 90 of studies have monitoring programs that ran for less than five years it is highly probable that short term extreme events could trigger complex alteration in hydrological systems hampton et al 2022 that result in long term effects on dom related water quality 3 4 3 factors influencing the effects of time since fire on dom the post fire recovery period is expected to be variable given differences in hydrological and biogeochemical processes and feedback bird et al 2015 operating at different temporal and spatial scales for example vegetation cover affects both precipitation and temperature through evapotranspiration and shading and the accumulation rates of detrital organic matter in the litter layer and soil influences soil moisture further changes in the species density and pattern of vegetation in a catchment can have profound impacts on the amount and timing of water levels and stream flow and water quality chow et al 2019 cawson et al 2013 studying prescribed burnt dry eucalypt forest in victoria australia noted post fire sediment loads over 16 months were approximately three orders of magnitude higher on burned compared with unburned hill slopes although there were small differences in runoff largely attributable to the removal of vegetation such large scale change would also result in significant alteration in fluxes of organic matter in post fire environment the persistence of pydom in natural waters could also be influenced by the patchiness of fire degree to which the riparian strip has remained unburnt and the presence or absence of extreme hydrological events it is quite possible that concentrations also diminish with distance downstream of fire impacted areas see blake et al 2020 finally such high variations in pydom could be attributed to lack of current estimate for pyrogenic carbon pool in terrestrial sediments which according to bird et al 2015 is a critical knowledge gap in pyrogenic carbon cycle 4 directions for future research given the uncertainties in composition and reactivity of post fire dom bulk properties such as doc toc turbidity colour uv absorbance may have only limited value in the more detailed understanding of water quality impacts post fire however these parameters might still play a role in the rapid assessment and monitoring of operations in treatment plants to meet specific water quality outcomes for the supply to communities once detailed correlative studies are performed this work shows the complexity of fire induced changes to catchment runoff which requires further understanding studies from regions in or proximal to mediterranean biomes show mixed results for the fluvial transport of dom for example increase in post fire dom after wildfire emelko et al 2011 mceachern et al 2000 minshall et al 2001 and prescribed fire mitchell and mcdonald 1995 yallop et al 2010 while some recent studies also found little or no effect of fire on dom export betts and jones 2009 burd et al 2018 evans et al 2017 granath et al 2021 interestingly the significance of dom composition is poorly acknowledged in such studies given the recognition that post fire water treatment options might need to be customized according to the specifics of dom composition chen et al 2020 an understanding of sources of variation and unraveling knowledge gaps is required one of the inherent challenges in understanding dynamics of post fire dom is due to high complexity of natural organic matter where each component may be degraded along multiple different pathways cooper et al 2022 thus identification of specific pydom molecular signatures that could be used for tracking the fate of post fire dom using both laboratory and field studies are urgently needed such investigations could start with firstly an untargeted approach gathering a complete set of pydom molecular information using latest technologies such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and fluorescence spectroscopy secondly taking a targeted approach tracking specific dom components relevant in understanding the fate of post fire dom like the more aromatic humified fulvic humic acid like and oxidized compounds with high degree of unsaturation as proposed by otto et al 2006 where source specific molecular markers for the burning of plant biomass were identified through tracing the biogeochemistry of charred residues in soils complementary analytical techniques using proteomics approaches would also provide more insights to microbial activity leading to a closer coupling of microbial and geochemical data in understanding post fire dom dynamics thevenot and roux 2019 as a further step the development of integrated models that link fire behaviour to water quality outcomes coupled with site specific biogeochemical and hydrological information could be developed to predict potential post fire dom impacts this needs the ability to integrate processes affecting dom stocks and fluxes pellegrini et al 2022 and the capability to cover temporal and spatial scales stegen 2018 this could be facilitated with the use of process based hydro biogeochemical models li et al 2021 such models may need to be built at the levels of catchment forest types and stream orders usda 2017 hampton et al 2022 to incorporate site specific spatiotemporal variations the ability to predict the dom concentration and its composition in fire affected catchments can be developed in a way similar to that progressing in non fire affected catchments over the last two decades laboratory studies alone may be insufficient to explain changes occurring during the generation and transport of pydom from land to water dom content along a river continuum generally decreases during the transport through selective removal of high molecular weight aromatics in favour of lower molecular weight aliphatic like compounds waggoner et al 2017 medium to long term in vivo post fire studies on dom production transportation and deposition sites are therefore required extending from a few years to over a decade event based measurements will also be important given sporadic peaks of key post fire contaminants pahs tocs and doc as observed by vila escalé et al 2007 and others high frequency data points through use of auto samplers in fire affected waters coupled with deployment of a cdom fdom sensors or in situ spectrophotometer are highly recommended for gathering preliminary data on dom composition burn temperature is an important factor resulting in the change in dom characteristics however records of actual temperature profile in the soil and duration of heating bodi et al 2014 attained in the organic layer during fire event are limited and highly variable for example a maximum temperature of 890 c was recorded in a litter layer during prescribed burns conducted in dry eucalypt forest within sydney s water supply catchments santín et al 2018 and 250 c was measured in the top 1 cm of soil for 27 min during an experimental burn in banksia eucalypt by tangney 2018 in urban woodland forest in perth australia thus monitoring of temperatures may be useful to improve our understanding of the underlying processes that lead to spatio temporal variability of the om stock and composition logistic difficulties such as defining exact location to install temperature loggers before the actual burn will need to be overcome 5 conclusion the literature clearly shows that fire causes significant alterations to the quantity and composition of dom compared with non fire conditions variation in dom under different fire regimes is mainly due to loss of water soluble fulvic acids or elimination of phenolic oh and cooh functional groups high burn temperature is associated with the production of increased aromatic humified fulvic humic acid like and oxidized compounds with a potentially high density of c c bonds chen et al 2022 significant increases in the c n ratios have also been reported in post fire soils generally attributed to preferential immobilization of n over c into recalcitrant heterocyclic n structures armas herrera et al 2016 despite these advances in understanding the existing literature is yet to provide sufficient evidence to establish a clear linkage between post fire dom changes in quality and components of fire regime such as burn severity and fire intensity with the current state of knowledge it is impossible to determine which level of burn severity and fire intensity is more detrimental to dom thereby significantly influencing the water quality with regards to fire frequency the literature does give a clear indication of how the frequency affects terrestrial dom sources and subsequently released pydom and consequences for water quality and the operation of water treatment plants further the literature shows short term post fire effects on dom are pronounced but there is insufficient information to identify long term impacts on dom despite recent investigations into pyrogenic carbon and carbon cycling key unresolved issues remain for the management of fire in catchments first the role and consequence of burn severity and fire intensity has been complicated by a host of mediating biogeographic and local variables and the terminology and significant challenges synthesizing and comparing the post fire observations yield ambiguity in establishing relationship between fire regime and pydom second the ways in which compositional differences of pydom drive degrees of local reactivity and bioavailability are an active area for research third the use of prescribed burns in the prevention of wildfires to reduce the burn severity or fire frequency in forested catchments has consequences for soil organic matter dissolved organic fractions water supply and water treatment process control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
15129,fires in forested catchments pose a water contamination risk from fire derived dissolved organic matter dom fire events are expected to increase under a projection of warmer and drier climatic conditions therefore understanding the consequences of fire derived dom is critical for water supply and management of drinking water and catchments this paper addresses how fire regime the intensity severity and frequency of fires influences dom quantity and composition in surface waters in forested catchments and how long it takes for water quality to recover to pre fire levels a review of post fire studies in mediterranean regions reporting on dom related parameters has been conducted the literature shows that post fire dom composition and reactivity is different from dom generated under processes of biological degradation and hence our reliance on dom bulk properties and surrogate dom bulk parameters may not provide sufficient information to deal with the potential complexity of the organic compounds produced by a catchment fire appropriate measures are important to adequately operate conventional water treatment facilities for example critical parameters for the effects of burning include the alteration of dom composition aromaticity and the relative amounts of labile recalcitrant organic components the literature shows mixed information for the influence of both burn severity and fire intensity on these parameters which indicates dom response to fire is highly variable for fire frequency the evidence is more unequivocal indicating that frequent fires change the composition of dom to components that are less bioavailable and elevate the degree of aromaticity which may be detrimental to water quality in addition and in general terms the more recent the fire the more aromatic and humified dom components are found and vice versa the recovery of surface water quality to pre fire conditions was variable with no safe temporal thresholds suggested in the literature in some cases fire induced changes in dom composition were observable up to 16 years post fire the lack of clearly observed trends in post fire dom with fire regimes could be attributed to numerous factors such as limited long term and event based observations experimental design challenges and site specific biological physical and hydrological factors the application of terminologies used to describe fire regimes such as burn severity and fire intensity also creates challenges in comparing the outcomes and results from numerous studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter water treatment fire forested catchment drinking water quality data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction this review paper provides a synthesis of the relationships between fire regime and post fire dissolved organic matter dom in surface waters the outcomes from the review are expected to provide the latest body of knowledge for water and catchment managers in fire prone forested catchments with more severe and frequent wildland fires forecasted under current climate scenarios for some ecosystems see moritz et al 2012 the direct and indirect effects of these fires will generate fire derived pyrogenic dom pydom with different characteristics both in quantity and composition which could have significant consequences for the quality of potable water supply hohner et al 2019 currently there is no standard protocol to treat wildland fire affected water chen et al 2020 other than taking the reservoir off line and using an alternate source of drinking water further as cottingham 2006 argues reduced flows in streams and abnormally low reservoir operating levels under warmer and drier climate conditions coupled with higher input loads of fire derived dom can cause raw water quality to further deteriorate pyrogenic materials generated by wildland fire may be transported across terrestrial landscapes and eventually transferred into water bodies causing imbalance to normal trophic functioning of aquatic ecosystems chen et al 2020 the pyrogenic materials and organic matter from fire impacted sites can be mobilized and deposited downstream bladon et al 2014 emelko et al 2016 substantial rain events typical of some climate types in combination with wet dry cycles could also cause breakage of soil aggregates exposing aggregate protected by soil organic matter som to leaching shakesby 2011 therefore a wildland fire may burn through a forested catchment for a short period but changes in dom quantity and composition may persist in such a landscape for a long period chow et al 2019 the quantity and reactivity of natural dom or pydom in freshwater is influenced by many factors the composition of dom depends on its source such as degrading plants soil organic matter som and decomposition products of bacterial and algal matter in the water column mcknight et al 2003 other factors include environmental and biological elements of the system chiefly hydrology vegetation type soil type and bedrock geology with their spatiotemporal variations cronan 2018 the quantity and composition of dom in natural water sources is dynamic exhibiting short term fluctuation due to diurnal influence from photo degradation or from storm event driven inputs seasonal and inter seasonal variability of the biogeochemical processes influence dom causing significant interpretative challenges cronan 2018 thus the changes in bulk dom concentration do not always reflect the differences in composition at a molecular level as observed by osterholz et al 2016 for example elevated water colour immediately following burning in a wetland was not matched by a rise in doc concentration clay et al 2012 similarly mansilha et al 2019 found no correlation between wildfire and colour of the water samples collected from burned areas in central portugal yet polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs were recorded at concentrations 1 2 to 4 times higher than in unburned control samples thus as proposed by clay et al 2012 fire effected dom composition could be missed when bulk parameters such as water colour or doc quantity are used alone to study pydom in fire effected catchments 1 1 dom composition and sources in forested catchments dom is generally considered the portion of organic material that passes through an average filter with a pore size of less than 0 45 μm cronan 2018 however the actual composition of dom is highly variable consisting of a large proportion of dissolved humic materials operationally divided into highly polymeric humic substances humic and fulvic acids together with a host of simpler compounds such as carbohydrates proteins and amino acids findlay et al 2002 cronan 2018 and their isomers most common organic substances are humic acids of terrestrial origin autochthonous fulvic acids of phytoplankton or algal origin and by products of metabolic processes like carbohydrates sugars amino acids proteins lipids organic acids phenols alcohols acetylated amino sugars and others mcknight et al 2003 mostofa et al 2013 the organic compounds that comprise the dom pool are 50 carbon by mass and thus dissolved organic carbon doc is generally used as a primary measure of the total dom content in natural waters cronan 2018 the transfer of organic material to surface waters is dominated by direct inputs of dom associated with the advective transport of surface water or groundwater at the catchment scale most of the advective inputs pass through or over the soil before entering surface water findlay et al 2002 the organic matter in forest soil exists in a continuum of detrital fractions ranging from recognizable litter and woody debris to humus to humic coatings on soil minerals and finally to dom in the soil solution phase thus changes in soil carbon pools subsequently affects dom production and transport findlay et al 2002 hohner et al 2019 these processes and pathways in forested catchments are therefore susceptible to significant disturbance caused by wildland fire 1 2 fire dom water quality nexus post fire precipitation promotes the leaching of chemicals from pyrogenic materials and ash to nearby surface waters the dissolution and deposition increases concentrations of dom in water abney and berhe 2018 and can challenge the operation of conventional drinking water treatment processes dom itself is not a contaminant with direct impacts on public health but can interfere with the water treatment processes resulting in the formation of disinfection by products dbps chen et al 2020 it also affects watercolour and taste and serves as a substrate for unwanted microbial growth and is a common foulant of membranes and adsorption processes chen et al 2020 one of the main challenges for effective dom removal in water treatment plants is due to the inherent complex composition of dom with varying degrees of reactivity both laboratory and treatment plant level studies report that coagulation does not consistently remove all dom chen et al 2020 there is an inherent difference in dom composition based on their sources for instance allochthonous dom is dominated by non polar hydrophobic humics with larger molecular weight and more aromatic structures with low nitrogen n content findlay et al 2002 while autochthonous dom is generally of a lower molecular weight with increased polarity and with n and carboxyl groups making them hydrophilic and more easily mobilized and metabolized ejarque et al 2017 findlay et al 2002 these variations in the quantity and composition of incoming dom influence treatment efficiency and may require customized optimization of processes such as flocculation filtration and disinfection moreover the post fire mixture of dom may also change honher et al 2019 reported that conventional water treatment options removed 54 of organic matter from unburned samples while only 24 was removed from leachates extracted from burned litter and soil lower efficiency dom removal 20 to 30 was also reported by chen et al 2020 from water samples from burned areas when compared to higher dom removals 50 to 60 in samples from unburned sites dom with larger molecular weights and more double bonds and rings are notable precursors of disinfection by products dbp and are reported to have been generated by fires chen et al 2021 the attributions of dom quantity and composition to the formation of dbps are well recorded by numerous studies becker et al 2018 kraus et al 2011 wang et al 2015 for example following 2007 and 2009 wildfires near santa barbara california revchuk and suffet 2014 recorded a 70 increase in doc in raw water resulting in a 49 increase in dbps measured as trihalomethane thm formation potential furthermore chow et al 2021 suggested unique chemical characteristics of fire derived dom may give rise to dbps that do not typically occur in water treatment and as observed by lavonen et al 2013 they have been neither identified nor had their toxicity assessed therefore characterizing dom in natural waters is a critical step in understanding the dynamics of dom and its implications on water quality andersson et al 2019 the physicochemical characterization of dom is even more essential in fire prone catchments for land management raw natural water source selection and drinking water treatment process optimization revchuk and suffet 2014 2 scope of review post fire catchment management strategies can be determined based on the fire regime often described as the history of fires fire interval and frequency fire intensity and burn severity this review synthesizes existing knowledge to explore how these attributes of fire regime influence dom quantity and composition in surface waters in forested catchments the review also builds on a body of knowledge from key review papers on post fire water quality by smith et al 2011 and a meta analysis on post fire water quality by hampton et al 2022 the paper discusses dom quantity and composition considering its inherent dynamic complexity and the limitations of analytical methods and field measurements the review focuses on studies conducted in forested biomes with a mediterranean type climate to allow comparison across similar fuel types fire behaviours and climatic conditions the world s mediterranean type ecosystems have a characteristic climate of mild wet winters and warm dry summers the ecosystems include both winter deciduous and evergreen woodlands and forests including iconic mediterranean type vegetation such as sclerophyll shrublands and woodlands adapted to long periods of dryness and heat rundel et al 2016 water supplies for humans in mediterranean settings depend upon winter rainfall surface runoff and reservoirs in forested catchments to store water for drier summer months wildfires in these regions moritz et al 2012 are attributable to high fuel loads high ambient temperatures and low humidity rodriguez et al 2018 in the review we accept the position taken by archibald et al 2018 and shakesby et al 2007 that an investigation of wildfire induced soil erosion and water quality is best achieved by framing post fire impacts in biogeographic terms and by recognising the influence of bioregional variation of vegetation types accordingly the review draws upon literature from the mediterranean basin and from regions on the pacific coast of north america and south america in southern africa and in southern australia all post fire studies from those geographical regions and mediterranean ecosystems reporting on dom quantity and composition have been considered including both field and laboratory scale investigations into water and leachate samples we are compelled to include the effects of all types of wildland fires in mediterranean ecosystems and indeed worldwide forms of management fires are used for land management to reduce fuel loads in the hope that they might reduce the intensity and severity of wildland fires and make them more controllable see for example boer et al 2009 and dellasalla et al 2022 we therefore examine the literature to determine if such prescribed burns are also able to protect water quality in drinking water supply areas in the context of dom the descriptors of burn severity and fire intensity are most often used to characterise and assess the effects of fire events on ecosystems and both are usually categorized as low moderate or high authors have interpreted their meaning differently and at times the terms have been used interchangeably for this paper the recommendations by keeley 2009 have been adopted burn severity implies the magnitude of post fire changes to an ecosystem such as amount of vegetation and litter consumed production of ash changes in surface reflectance and alteration in soil properties keeley 2009 see also pellegrini et al 2022 fire intensity wm 2 and the sometimes used burn intensity describe the physical combustion process of energy release from organic matter defined as energy per unit volume multiplied by the velocity at which the energy is moving keeley 2009 fire intensity is often quantified by the temperature of and heat released by the flaming front of fire lentile et al 2006 and it is also a relevant measure for the penetration of heat into deeper levels of the ground which can substantially alter underground biogeochemical processes keeley 2009 lentile et al 2006 thus burn temperature is often used as surrogate measure for categorizing fire intensity and this convention has also been applied in this review further more intense fire directly impacts the stock of organic matter pellegrini et al 2022 and thereby the severity of the burn using standard database searches all relevant studies within the above scope were gathered where possible the details of fire regime burn severity fire intensity and fire frequency were extracted from the study site descriptions or inferred from reported burn temperature descriptive degree of burning extent of burned areas or description of post fire ash and debris this has been done in an attempt to improve understandings of dom quantity and composition as a function of fire regime attributes as cautioned by keeley et al 2011 dissecting out one of the regime attributes and evaluating post fire response using that attribute alone may lead to erroneous information this is often done where the only information available after a wildfire event is a description of burn severity more infrequently a record of fire history is provided from which frequency can be inferred and only rarely is a measure of fire intensity available nevertheless an understanding of how pydom quantity and composition changes based on each of the attributes of fire regime is sought from the literature to provide information for post fire management the paper explores the literature for effects of burn severity on dom comparing low moderate to high burn severity and then the effects of low moderate fire intensity were compared to those of high fire intensity comparisons of dom quantity and composition were then analysed between less frequent and more frequent fires the effect of time since the last fire on dom was also discussed to supplement the observations of the effect of fire frequency the paper then presents recommendations for future research and a conclusion 3 fire behaviour and dom in surface waters 3 1 burn severity effects on dom characteristics higher burn severity in a forested catchment is associated with increased combustion of both above and belowground pools of organic matter laboratory and field studies have demonstrated that dom leached from burnt vegetation and soil residuals yielded concentrations 6 to 7 times higher than leachates from the unburned parent biomass further dom concentrations in stream water from a completely burned catchment were reportedly 67 higher than from unburned catchments following a severe wildfire chen et al 2020 uzun et al 2020 however the post fire responses in dom quantity and composition in relationship to burn severity are complex and there is little consensus in studies to date 3 1 1 the effects of high burn severity higher burn severity significantly reduces vegetation cover and generates more ash load that can be eroded and transported to waterways thermal alteration of organic matter in the absence of oxygen results in organic rich ash with widely varying organic content from less than 1 organics to more than half of the total ash mass bodi et al 2014 post fire ash leaches organic pollutants into water such as small sized polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs smith et al 2011 for example the balmoral fire of october 2013 which burned almost 13 000 ha of sydney s australia forested water supply catchment produced substantial ash loads that increased with burn severity with 6 16 and 34 t ha found in areas affected by low high and extreme burn severity respectively santín et al 2015 similarly santín et al 2018 reported that fire in dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest of south eastern australia produced an average of 6 3 3 1 t ha of ash with higher quantities in the areas subjected to high burn severity 6 9 3 3 t ha than in the areas of moderate burn severity 4 9 1 6 t ha as high severity wildfires combusted most of vegetation cover and soil organic matter in o horizons it often resulted in exposed soil reduced plant nutrient uptake and high post fire nutrient losses higher burn severity is also associated with slow vegetation recovery and reduced carbon uptake dynamics in post burn environments miesel et al 2015 which further increases dom loadings into aquatic systems in addition to increased generation of ash load high burn severity also altered post fire dom composition in surface water rust et al 2019 investigated long term data on water quality and other edaphic factors across the usa in fire affected catchments and reported increased burn severity to be associated with increased organic n no3 and total metal concentrations and their fluxes similarly chow et al 2019 found that stream doc and ultraviolet absorbance at specifically 254 nm suva254 were elevated in colorado catchments with high burn severity relative to unburned catchments further studies in colorado by kersher et al 2003 and in california by riggan et al 1994 reported high burn severity had the most detrimental effect on post fire water quality with increased doc and dissolved organic nitrogen in post fire water samples wang et al 2015 also reported the highest suva254 values under high burn severity compared to low burn severity illustrating the difference in dom composition under different burn severity the degree of burn severity could also affect dom composition in different ways martin et al 2009 reported that carbohydrates are immediately reduced by 34 and 55 under low and high burn severity respectively due to decrease of both hexoses and pentoses in two hydrolysis fractions this occurred while no significant difference was observed in the distribution of the neutral sugars in the hydrolysates between unburned and burned samples over time for this reason it is reasonable to assume that the proportion of soil carbon present as carbohydrates c could be a better measure for monitoring short and medium term changes induced by fire in soil organic matter rather than the overall organic carbon content overall there is a continuum of loss of organic matter via volatilization and combustion in both above and below ground organic matter pools and the amount of loss is highly variable see debano et al 1998 and knicker 2007 resulting in different post fire dom reactions 3 1 2 the effects of low moderate burn severity in contrast to what has been reported for higher burn severity many studies report higher post fire dom sum doc and don concentrations at low and moderate burn severity cawley et al 2018 hohner et al 2017 santos et al 2016 wang et al 2015 for example rhoades et al 2019 followed the hayman fire of 2002 in colorado and for forests dominated by ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii they reported elevated total carbon in streams originating from catchments that were burned to a lesser extent 30 to 60 of their areas burned compared to either unburned or extensively burned catchments this was attributed to the retention of a variety of organic matter sources including living and dead vegetation charred wood and som in o horizons which under high burn severity would have been completely combusted chow et al 2019 suggested moderate burn severities were the most important sources of long term differences in post fire dom quantity and composition as indicated by elevated concentration in stream doc formation of dbps trihalomethanes and chloral hydrate and high suva254 the association of moderate burn severity to higher doc release could be also attributed to increased mobility of ash derived dom during the initial flushes wang et al 2016 however uzun et al 2020 working in forest ecosystems primarily composed of longleaf pinus palustris and loblolly pine p taeda turkey oak quercus laevis and sweetgum liquidambar styraciflua reported minimal effect by moderate and low burn severity on post fire dom characteristics using pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms uzun et al 2020 observed no significant changes in functional groups i e phenolic compounds proteins carbohydrates aromatic 1 ring pahs and lipids within dom complexes further they showed that the prescribed burn decreased leaching of doc total dissolved nitrogen tdn dissolved organic nitrogen don nh4 and reactive phosphorus compared to unburned leachate samples 3 1 3 factors influencing the effects of burn severity the summary of the literature in fig 1 on the effects of burn severity on dom quantity and composition discussed above shows a lack of clear relationships between degree of burn severity and indicators of dom characteristics for example both high suva values and higher doc content are reported in both low moderate and high burn severity this may be attributed to our limited understanding of ecosystem impacts of fire on the interactions between complex biogeochemical processes the influence of burn severity on dom quantity and composition may be complicated by the other two fire regime attributes fire intensity and fire frequency as well as the complexity interplay of fire behaviour across site specific catchment conditions wang et al 2015 observed that at higher burn severity with higher temperature and oxygen availability a decrease in organic matter resulted which subsequently produced lower dom as a sum of doc and total dissolved nitrogen concentrations this implies a difference between combustion processes occurring in crown fires with more oxygen compared to ground fires with lower oxygen availability producing different post fire dom characteristics these include burned detritus extracts with lower molecular weight reflected by increased e2 e3 and fluorescence index and changes in aromaticity reflected by suva254 wang et al 2015 the effects of burn severity will be complicated where fire causes mineralogical changes in soil this includes an increase in ph and electrical conductivity that directly affects the reaction rates of biogeochemical transformations and where changes occur in the soil aggregate stability permeability of water and gas nutrient availability and transport of contaminants see santin and doer 2016 and vergnoux et al 2011 where there is unburnt vegetation and soil the organic layer was also found to reduce cawson et al 2013 transport of dom into surface waters however rainfall intensity could also result in increased runoff and transport of dom uzun et al 2020 accordingly as recognised by bird et al 2015 the process of degradation of pyrogenic materials and subsequent pydom transformation is still under investigation 3 2 fire intensity effects on dom characteristics fire intensity is associated with physical attributes such as temperature flame length duration of heating and emission of pyrogenic gases this section reviews the alteration in dom quantity and composition in relation to the measured burn temperature and derived categories of fire or burn intensity variation in burn temperature during a fire alters the normal breakdown processes of soil and terrestrial organic matter blake et al 2009 fernandes 2018 hohner et al 2019 tulau 2016 in a comprehensive review of fire effects on soil organic matter gonzalez perez et al 2004 show that fire intensity influences organic matter by i removing external oxygen groups yielding materials with comparatively reduced solubility ii reducing the chain length of alkyl compounds such as alkanes fatty acids and alcohols iii aromatising of sugars and lipids iv forming of heterocyclic n compounds and v producing an almost unalterable component often referred to as black carbon bc the latter is considered a long term repository of post fire dom while in the short term it has minimal contribution to dom in surface waters bird et al 2015 wagner and jaffé 2015 this suggests ageing of bc or pyrogenic materials in soil is one type of prerequisite to the dissolution and export into aquatic systems however the actual process of increased solubility of bc molecules is still unknown wagner et al 2017 zimmerman 2010 leachates of combusted som was attributed to increased aromaticity and an increase in relative proportion of o and n alkyl carbon using solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy not observed in leachate samples from unburned reference sites knicker et al 2005 3 2 1 effects of high fire intensity on dom higher burn temperature is likely to cause a loss of amount of organic matter from the fuel biomass and from soil organic layer according to debano et al 1998 higher burn temperature above 460 c caused irreversible changes in biological and physico chemical quality of soils making it highly erodible in some cases higher burn temperatures cause vaporization of soil organic compounds which condense and coat soil particles in a hydrophobic film prosser and williams 1998 tulau 2016 consequent changes in infiltration and erosivity in the burned catchments miesel et al 2015 tulau 2016 potentially influences downstream water quality in 2007 and 2009 revchuk and suffet 2014 assessed wildfires near santa barbara california with different fire intensities they found combustion under higher fire intensity breaks hydrophobic and hydrophilic structures into smaller fragments which are not bound and are easily washed away this resulted in significantly lower charged doc constituents amine groups linked carbon chain in leachate extracted from burned biomass compared to unburned sites further using ultrafiltration techniques dom from burned areas were found to be associated with the release of large size fragments of organic carbon dominated by molecular weights higher than 10 000 da while unburned sites were dominated by intermediate sized fragments 5000 to 10 000 da significant differences were also observed in fluorescence where optical properties of dom indicated structural changes with production of fulvic acid like dom which could either be fire derived or a contribution from post fire biological activity revchuk and suffet 2014 chen et al 2022 showed for leaf and wood materials burned at temperatures of 250 c 450 c and 600 c increasing values of suva254 and increasing degree of humification hix with increasing temperature with more aromatic compounds generated at higher burn temperatures 3 2 2 effects of low moderate fire intensity on dom at lower burn temperatures lesser amounts of organic matter may be lost via volatilization and convection see fig 2 often resulting in the retention of higher concentrations of biodegradable components such as tyrosine like and tryptophan like dom chen et al 2022 further wang et al 2015 observed that pyrolysis at 250 c increased extractable doc burned material was mixed with milli q water and filtered by 510 compared to unburned detritus indicating that post fire organic matter generated at low temperature could be an important part of the fire affected dom similarly soils heated to 225 c leached the greatest doc and had the highest c and n dbp precursor reactivity per unit carbon compared to the unheated material or soils heated to 350 or 500 c cawley et al 2018 this indicated higher dom release under low fire intensity one of the key concerns is the alteration of dom characteristics at moderate fire intensity where burn temperatures at 250 c produced more doc with proportionally higher aromatic content cawley et al 2018 wang et al 2015 than biomass burned at higher temperatures rhoades et al 2019 wang et al 2015 also reported that low temperature pyrolysis resulted in more soluble dom in the forest floor due to low temperature degradation and depolymerization of cellulose via trans glycosylation 250 to 300 c and lignocellulose components via cleavage of aryl alkyl ether linkages and dehydration 220 c soil samples collected from burned areas analysed in the laboratory after low intensity prescribed burn increased the aromaticity of water extracted organic matter hobley et al 2019 these results warrant attention of water managers to the potential challenges posed by the widespread use of low intensity prescribed fires to defuel forest catchments to reduce the effects of wildfires unlike under higher fire intensity areas burned at lower temperature may be less susceptible to post fire erosion as reported by cawson et al 2013 yet as mentioned above by chen et al 2022 and wang et al 2015 dom will undergo significant changes in concentration and composition 3 2 3 factors mediating the influence of fire intensity the current literature does not provide clear evidence to determine which levels of fire intensity affect water quality the most through alteration of dom composition and quantity see fig 2 this could be attributed to an array of site specific biogeochemical and ecosystem characteristics for example the transfer of heat depends on overall fuel biomass thickness packing ratio and moisture content of fuel bed certini 2005 the maximum temperature and duration of the burn are critical factors influencing the impact of fire intensity on post fire dom another factor influencing the dom concentration and composition is the patchiness of burned and unburned areas in fire impacted areas low intensity burns for example particularly prescribed burns have been found in eastern usa to have minimal detrimental effects on chemical physical and biological properties of surface waters this was attributed to unburned riparian zones that reduce and buffer the impact of fire on water quality hahn et al 2019 similar observations have also been reported by cawson et al 2013 where patchy unburned vegetation attenuated and buffered transportation of contaminants from burned areas to downstream the burn temperature can affect the microbial communities on the forest floor and can change the soil carbon stock for example combustion of biomass during fire was reported to be associated with decreased soil carbon stocks over the short term from a decrease in microbial anabolism relative to catabolism adkins and miesel 2021 3 3 effects of fire frequency and dom characteristics frequent fire events create a faster rate of nutrient release when compared to natural processes of nutrient release arising from weathering decomposition and mineralization bodi et al 2014 frequent fire affects c and n stocks through i their accessibility ii interactions with organic and inorganic matter iii their recalcitrance and iv the activity of decomposer communities pellegrini et al 2022 furthermore there may be significant variation in the effects of frequent forest fires on soil properties such as soil organic matter content santorufo et al 2021 and its effect on dom characteristics see fig 3 generally more frequently burned areas contain lower amounts of terrestrial organic matter for example regular prescribed burning in eucalyptus obliqua dominated lowland forests of south eastern australia was reported to have reduced total litter mass by 38 including a loss of 3 3 t ha carbon from the top 2 to 2 5 cm litter layer krishnaraj et al 2016 the total carbon stock gets transformed into various pyrogenic residues in the form of charcoal also referred to as pyrogenic carbon pyrogenic pahs and volatile organic compounds including organic carbon in smoke krishnaraj et al 2016 furthermore santorufo et al 2021 investigated the impact of fire frequency on mediterranean andosols and reported that fire caused a significant decrease in organic matter om content and lower total carbon tc in water samples from areas that are burned every year om decrease by 24 tc decrease by 30 or every two years om decrease by 30 tc decrease by 48 compared to unburned sites decrease in som with increase in fire frequency was also recorded by hinojosa et al 2021 in a study conducted in spain it was mainly attributed to loss of above ground vegetation cumulative loss of som from soil organic layer and limited vegetation recovery in frequently burned areas triggering soil erosion and leaching of organic matter in their work on the effects of prescribed burning in an australian eucalyptus forest hobley et al 2019 reported that repeated fire over decades reduced the quantity of soluble carbon and enhanced its aromaticity potentially reducing biological availability thus increasing fire frequency can be attributed to reducing terrestrial dom sources and thereby affecting the dom quantity and composition a study in south east of france by vergnoux et al 2011 conducted an experiment leaching soil samples collected from sites with different burn frequency and reported no significant difference between unburned and frequently burned sites for a bulk property like toc however frequent fire led to a significant increase in fulvic acid like compounds as observed using fluorescence spectroscopy on filtered samples of soil mixed with ultrapure water the increase was attributed to the transformations of non humified fraction into fulvic acid like compounds through aromatization and condensation processes further the quality of the hydrophilic fraction of water extractable organic matter weom was also found to be significantly altered resulting in higher molecular size and higher degree of aromaticity in very recently burned soil compared to unburned soil this was correlated with higher suva254 values observed in recently burned sites similarly for humic substances significant increases in aromaticity were also reported in its hydrophilic fraction this shows bulk parameters such as toc or doc do not reflect the actual change in dom composition and as emphasized by muqaddas et al 2019 it is critical to characterize post fire dom to better understand overall impacts of fire before making any post fire catchment management decisions 3 4 temporal effects post fire dom recovery the time since the last fire appears to play a critical role in influencing post fire dom quantity and composition and its effects on water quality knicker et al 2005 reported that high intensity forest fires in mediterranean ecosystems probably have long term effects on som as fire alters chemical composition of humic material towards higher aromaticity and generation of heterocyclic n compounds however the extent to which such alteration would survive the continuing humification processes and influence dom characteristics has not been ascertained santorufo et al 2021 rodriguez et al 2018 noted that increases in organic matter availability after a wildfire in andalusia spain increased microbial community activity for 2 to 3 years post fire other studies have also recorded similar effects of fire up to 16 years chow et al 2019 table 1 summarises the effects of time since the last fire for two categories where observed impacts are evident for i less than 5 years and ii greater than 5 years often during heavy post fire rainfall the initial flush mobilizes the newly generated post fire white ash and pahs resulting in high suva254 measurement uzun et al 2020 the higher aromaticity observed by wang et al 2015 was found to decrease towards the end of first rainy season s subsequent flushes of the catchment further the recently generated ash was also observed to have higher doc leaching potential than weathered and leached ash wang et al 2016 3 4 1 post fire impacts lasting 5 years the degree of change in dom composition and quantity is also a function of when the samples are collected after the fire revchuk and suffet 2014 recorded recently burned ash sampled 2 months after fire registered 10 times more doc leaching potential and was dominated by large size fragments compared to weathered 2 year old ash attributed to precipitation flushing out smaller hydrophobic and hydrophilic components see table 1 in addition the leachates from 2 months after fire were mainly composed of aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by products from either partially combusted vegetative matter or biological activity that consumed fire released organics this shows post fire dom undergoes numerous compositional changes as it is subject to microbially mediated biogeochemical processes it is not clear from the literature how long it takes for the catchment to return to a pre fire dom concentration for a 2015 wildfire in california a significant increase in doc concentration and changes in dom chemical properties lasted up to two years uzun et al 2020 for a wildfire in central portugal prats et al 2019 reported loss of organic material of 0 55 0 06 and 0 02 mg ha 1 y 1 for each of the following three years emphasizing the magnitude of loss in the first year short term effects of post fire change in dom have been shown in other mediterranean regions murphy et al 2006 reported an immediate increase in dom after a wildfire in nevada attributed to post fire erosion however after one year no differences in total carbon content or in soil leaching could be detected between before and after the wildfire vila escalé et al 2007 investigated post fire dom in the aquatic environment in a mediterranean creek in catalonia spain and found higher toc and doc concentrations and higher fluorescence intensity and uv absorbance when compared to background measurements these elevated values remained even after one and half years post fire with spikes in concentration following precipitation events by contrast pah concentrations approached background pre fire concentrations within 15 months after the fire vila escalé et al 2007 post fire pah concentrations in burned litter have also been reported to decline with time by uzun et al 2020 but there was noticeable variation in how long it takes to return to the pre fire level with site specific variability kim et al 2003 observed pahs being rapidly transported into the soil and returning to pre fire levels within months similarly mansilha et al 2019 reported a significant decrease in pahs concentrations after eight months from a study site in portugal due to degradation by atmospheric agents such as temperature humidity and adsorption on particles dom recovery less than five years was also reported by pierson et al 2019 where c and n yields from sediments collected 2 years post wildfire accounted for greater than 90 of the total sediment c and n yield over the 4 year study period overall the concentration of post fire contaminants is expected to be higher following the first rainfall events while returning to pre fire level might take a few more years and depends on the subsequent rainfall runoff events to flushing out the catchment 3 4 2 post fire impacts lasting 5 years while large scale fires often generate acute short term effects on water quality there is increasing evidence that in some catchments their effects can persist for many years chow et al 2019 rhoades et al 2011 vergnoux et al 2011 post fire water quality concerns were identified over 5 years after the 2002 hayman fire west of denver colorado rhoades et al 2011 while elevated stream doc and suva254 were detectable 14 years after the fire chow et al 2019 similarly vergnoux et al 2011 reported that fire derived humic substances with increased aromaticity were recorded for more than 16 years such long term observations call for more in depth exploration into the fate of pydom and its implications for water quality particularly given hampton et al 2022 meta analysis which revealed that more than 90 of studies have monitoring programs that ran for less than five years it is highly probable that short term extreme events could trigger complex alteration in hydrological systems hampton et al 2022 that result in long term effects on dom related water quality 3 4 3 factors influencing the effects of time since fire on dom the post fire recovery period is expected to be variable given differences in hydrological and biogeochemical processes and feedback bird et al 2015 operating at different temporal and spatial scales for example vegetation cover affects both precipitation and temperature through evapotranspiration and shading and the accumulation rates of detrital organic matter in the litter layer and soil influences soil moisture further changes in the species density and pattern of vegetation in a catchment can have profound impacts on the amount and timing of water levels and stream flow and water quality chow et al 2019 cawson et al 2013 studying prescribed burnt dry eucalypt forest in victoria australia noted post fire sediment loads over 16 months were approximately three orders of magnitude higher on burned compared with unburned hill slopes although there were small differences in runoff largely attributable to the removal of vegetation such large scale change would also result in significant alteration in fluxes of organic matter in post fire environment the persistence of pydom in natural waters could also be influenced by the patchiness of fire degree to which the riparian strip has remained unburnt and the presence or absence of extreme hydrological events it is quite possible that concentrations also diminish with distance downstream of fire impacted areas see blake et al 2020 finally such high variations in pydom could be attributed to lack of current estimate for pyrogenic carbon pool in terrestrial sediments which according to bird et al 2015 is a critical knowledge gap in pyrogenic carbon cycle 4 directions for future research given the uncertainties in composition and reactivity of post fire dom bulk properties such as doc toc turbidity colour uv absorbance may have only limited value in the more detailed understanding of water quality impacts post fire however these parameters might still play a role in the rapid assessment and monitoring of operations in treatment plants to meet specific water quality outcomes for the supply to communities once detailed correlative studies are performed this work shows the complexity of fire induced changes to catchment runoff which requires further understanding studies from regions in or proximal to mediterranean biomes show mixed results for the fluvial transport of dom for example increase in post fire dom after wildfire emelko et al 2011 mceachern et al 2000 minshall et al 2001 and prescribed fire mitchell and mcdonald 1995 yallop et al 2010 while some recent studies also found little or no effect of fire on dom export betts and jones 2009 burd et al 2018 evans et al 2017 granath et al 2021 interestingly the significance of dom composition is poorly acknowledged in such studies given the recognition that post fire water treatment options might need to be customized according to the specifics of dom composition chen et al 2020 an understanding of sources of variation and unraveling knowledge gaps is required one of the inherent challenges in understanding dynamics of post fire dom is due to high complexity of natural organic matter where each component may be degraded along multiple different pathways cooper et al 2022 thus identification of specific pydom molecular signatures that could be used for tracking the fate of post fire dom using both laboratory and field studies are urgently needed such investigations could start with firstly an untargeted approach gathering a complete set of pydom molecular information using latest technologies such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and fluorescence spectroscopy secondly taking a targeted approach tracking specific dom components relevant in understanding the fate of post fire dom like the more aromatic humified fulvic humic acid like and oxidized compounds with high degree of unsaturation as proposed by otto et al 2006 where source specific molecular markers for the burning of plant biomass were identified through tracing the biogeochemistry of charred residues in soils complementary analytical techniques using proteomics approaches would also provide more insights to microbial activity leading to a closer coupling of microbial and geochemical data in understanding post fire dom dynamics thevenot and roux 2019 as a further step the development of integrated models that link fire behaviour to water quality outcomes coupled with site specific biogeochemical and hydrological information could be developed to predict potential post fire dom impacts this needs the ability to integrate processes affecting dom stocks and fluxes pellegrini et al 2022 and the capability to cover temporal and spatial scales stegen 2018 this could be facilitated with the use of process based hydro biogeochemical models li et al 2021 such models may need to be built at the levels of catchment forest types and stream orders usda 2017 hampton et al 2022 to incorporate site specific spatiotemporal variations the ability to predict the dom concentration and its composition in fire affected catchments can be developed in a way similar to that progressing in non fire affected catchments over the last two decades laboratory studies alone may be insufficient to explain changes occurring during the generation and transport of pydom from land to water dom content along a river continuum generally decreases during the transport through selective removal of high molecular weight aromatics in favour of lower molecular weight aliphatic like compounds waggoner et al 2017 medium to long term in vivo post fire studies on dom production transportation and deposition sites are therefore required extending from a few years to over a decade event based measurements will also be important given sporadic peaks of key post fire contaminants pahs tocs and doc as observed by vila escalé et al 2007 and others high frequency data points through use of auto samplers in fire affected waters coupled with deployment of a cdom fdom sensors or in situ spectrophotometer are highly recommended for gathering preliminary data on dom composition burn temperature is an important factor resulting in the change in dom characteristics however records of actual temperature profile in the soil and duration of heating bodi et al 2014 attained in the organic layer during fire event are limited and highly variable for example a maximum temperature of 890 c was recorded in a litter layer during prescribed burns conducted in dry eucalypt forest within sydney s water supply catchments santín et al 2018 and 250 c was measured in the top 1 cm of soil for 27 min during an experimental burn in banksia eucalypt by tangney 2018 in urban woodland forest in perth australia thus monitoring of temperatures may be useful to improve our understanding of the underlying processes that lead to spatio temporal variability of the om stock and composition logistic difficulties such as defining exact location to install temperature loggers before the actual burn will need to be overcome 5 conclusion the literature clearly shows that fire causes significant alterations to the quantity and composition of dom compared with non fire conditions variation in dom under different fire regimes is mainly due to loss of water soluble fulvic acids or elimination of phenolic oh and cooh functional groups high burn temperature is associated with the production of increased aromatic humified fulvic humic acid like and oxidized compounds with a potentially high density of c c bonds chen et al 2022 significant increases in the c n ratios have also been reported in post fire soils generally attributed to preferential immobilization of n over c into recalcitrant heterocyclic n structures armas herrera et al 2016 despite these advances in understanding the existing literature is yet to provide sufficient evidence to establish a clear linkage between post fire dom changes in quality and components of fire regime such as burn severity and fire intensity with the current state of knowledge it is impossible to determine which level of burn severity and fire intensity is more detrimental to dom thereby significantly influencing the water quality with regards to fire frequency the literature does give a clear indication of how the frequency affects terrestrial dom sources and subsequently released pydom and consequences for water quality and the operation of water treatment plants further the literature shows short term post fire effects on dom are pronounced but there is insufficient information to identify long term impacts on dom despite recent investigations into pyrogenic carbon and carbon cycling key unresolved issues remain for the management of fire in catchments first the role and consequence of burn severity and fire intensity has been complicated by a host of mediating biogeographic and local variables and the terminology and significant challenges synthesizing and comparing the post fire observations yield ambiguity in establishing relationship between fire regime and pydom second the ways in which compositional differences of pydom drive degrees of local reactivity and bioavailability are an active area for research third the use of prescribed burns in the prevention of wildfires to reduce the burn severity or fire frequency in forested catchments has consequences for soil organic matter dissolved organic fractions water supply and water treatment process control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
