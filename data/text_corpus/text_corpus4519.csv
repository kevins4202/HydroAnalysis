22595,plate girders with web opening are commonly applied in marine structures for the demands of outfitting and light weight the presence of perforations will cause the structural discontinuity stress concentration and declining of ultimate bearing capacity in addition to the bending loading the deck strong beam is often subjected to transverse loading which belongs to the typical compression bending biaxial loadings in this paper the ultimate strengths of the perforated girders under compressive bending loadings was investigated by experimental analysis and nonlinear finite element analysis meanwhile the effect of welding induced initial deflections such as the shape of initial deflection and the magnitude of initial deflection on the collapse behavior of plate girders with web opening was investigated thoroughly by using numerical method in which the welding induced initial imperfections are simulated properly it is concluded that the initial imperfections and longitudinal load have important influences on the residual ultimate strength of perforated girder keywords perforated girder ultimate strength initial imperfections nonlinear finite element analysis experiments 1 introduction in the ship and ocean engineering the simplest type of plate girder structure consists of plates stiffeners and brackets stiffened plates are frequently used as the load bearing components in marine structures in order to guarantee the bearing capacity the openings and perforations are avoided in the design phase however plate girders with web opening are commonly used in marine structures for the demands of outfitting and light weight and the presence of perforations will cause the structural discontinuity stress concentration and declining of ultimate bearing capacity meanwhile hull beam structures often encounter complex external loads it is easier to cause local damage under the dual effect of geometric discontinuity and complex external loads plates with perforations are often appeared in aviation and navigation industries cui et al 2017 brown 1990 shakerley and brown 1996 used conjugate load displacement analysis method cldm to systematically analyze the elastic buckling and stability of perforated plates with different aspect ratios under two kinds of in plane constraints and four kinds of boundary conditions the results of the research on the rectangular perforated steel plate show that when the rectangular perforated hole with smaller size should be as far away from the center of the rectangular plate as possible while the perforated hole with larger size should coincide with the center of the plate as far as possible to avoid reducing the elastic buckling load of the steel plate narayanan and darwish 1985 conducted tests on the web perforated beam to investigate the ultimate shear capacity based on the test results the author proposed an approximate method for analyzing the ultimate bearing capacity of the web perforated beam shanmugam et al 1999 adopted finite element method to analyze the estimation formula of ultimate bearing capacity of rectangular plate under uniaxial compression the results show that the size of opening and the ratio of length to width of plate have great influence on ultimate bearing capacity and rectangular plate with circular hole has higher ultimate bearing capacity than rectangular hole then shanmugam et al 2002 numerically analyzed the ultimate strength of plate girders with web openings close agreement between the fe and test results has been observed cristopher and schafer 2009a b found that the presence of opening would lead to changes in critical elastic buckling which would change the length and size of buckling waves for plates with multiple openings saad eldeen et al 2015 experimentally examined and numerically validated the ultimate strength of wash plates under axial compressive and lateral pressure it is concluded that the remaining volume and number of openings are representative parameters for compressive strength capacity of plates with multiple openings saad eldeen et al 2019 as to hull girder structures a series of studies had also been carried out on stiffened panel and hull girder paik 2007a 2007b chung et al 2003 zhang et al 2013a 2013b cristopher and schafer 2009a b saad eldeen et al 2018 paik 2007a 2007b summarized the relevant regulations on the ultimate strength of classification societies and analyzed the relationship between buckling strength and ultimate strength of perforated plate structures under complex loads by nonlinear finite element method the ultimate strength of ship stiffened plate structure with initial deformation under complex stress state was studied by zhang et al 2013a it is shown that the existence of initial imperfections will weaken the ultimate strength of the structure in view of the lack of a corresponding design method for super standard openings in ship hull beams zhang et al 2013b proposed an effective design idea for super standard openings and calculated the deflection stress hot spot stress and bending stress under super standard load by finite element method the analysis of the perforated beam is much more complicated than that of the perforated plate as the upper and lower wing plates are added to the structure the boundary conditions and external force constraints of the plate model are changed cristopher and schafer 2009a b simplified the mechanical model for evaluating the mechanical behavior of steel beam structures with web openings he inferred that the open section of the steel beam is the critical section of the whole beam and the bearing capacity of the whole beam depends on the bearing capacity of this section under the shear force and bending moment through a series of experiments saad eldeen et al 2018 investigated the influence of different opening sizes and shapes different steel materials and structural configurations on the ultimate strength of steel plates on the premise of the same ultimate capacity it was observed that an elongated circular opening is more effective than a circular one for a large opening saad eldeen et al 2017 however for the deck strong beam it bears complicated hydrodynamic pressure and transverse load which belongs to a typical compressive bending biaxial loadings in order to account for the biaxial compressive effect several full scale plate girders with perforated web were used in this paper to analyze the ultimate strength under the compressive bending loadings as shown in fig 1 meanwhile the effect of welding induced initial deflections such as the shape of initial deflection and the magnitude of initial deflection on the collapse behaviour of plate girders with web opening was investigated thoroughly by using numerical method in which the welding induced initial imperfections are simulated properly validity of the numerical method was further verified by the results of ultimate strength tests 2 influence of initial imperfections on ultimate strength 2 1 geometric model as shown in fig 2 the plate girders t 80 8 240 6 with web opening were used in the numerical analysis considering the actual size requirements the span of the beam is l 3000 the web opening takes the commonly used waist round hole in hull structure and the waist round hole size is 240 120 mm in fig 2 material parameters and related properties are shown in table 1 as shown in fig 3 the bilinear kinematic hardening model was adopted to approximately fit the true stress strain curve the elastic modulus of the material e is 206 gpa and the yield strength σ y is 235 mpa in general steel material has strain hardening tangent modulus e t typically in the range of 5 15 of elastic modulus paik 2007b therefore the value of tangent modulus e t was considered as 10 of elastic modulus in this paper in order to consider the influence of the opening position two models of middle opening series a and end opening series b will be simulated separately to obtain the ultimate strength in fig 3 considering the actual loadings the maximum longitudinal load is applied as 450 kn then the transverse bending load will be calculated as the final ultimate load as shown in fig 4 a and b the actual bending loads are applied at 6 evenly spaced points in order to improve the local strength of the girder rectangular reinforcement blocks are welded to the end and the longitudinal compressive load is applied along the neutral axis of the section see fig 4c in the numerical simulation the cross sections at both ends are defined as rigid regions the bottom nodes at both ends of the panel are restrained from transverse line displacement uy 0 in order to ensure that the model can rotate freely around the z axis the angular displacement of top nodes in fig 4 around the z axis is released the line displacements in x and y directions and angular displacements rx ry 0 of the left endpoint are constrained while all the line displacements and angular displacements rx ry 0 of the left endpoint are constrained in fig 4 2 2 convergence analysis according to the courant criterion a balance between computing time and accuracy must be made for the mesh xu et al 2014 the influence of initial imperfections and longitudinal load are not considered first and the maximal displacement of intermediate node under different mesh sizes were compared in fig 5 the displacement would increase with the increase of transverse bending load when the mesh number at the hole was reduced to 10 10 the trend of load displacement curve of the intermediate node would not change any more as shown in fig 6 therefore the mesh number near the hole was control in 10 10 for the perforated girder considering the minimum calculation time 2 3 considering initial deformation effect 2 3 1 initial deformation plated structures are commonly treated by flame cutting and fusion welding in fabrication during these processes the imperfections will take place in the form of initial deformation and residual stress the initial imperfections have great influence on the ultimate strength of plate girders therefore the simulation method and influence of initial imperfections will be analyzed firstly in order to simplify the calculation the initial deformation is usually assumed to be in the following forms ueda and yao 1985 cui et al 2016 1 plate type imperfection fig 7 a 1 w p a 0 sin m π x a sin n π y b where a 0 is the amplitude of initial deformation of stiffened plates a 0 0 1 β 2 t β b t σ y e t is the plate thickness a and b are the length and width of the plate respectively m and n represent half wave numbers in the x longitudinal and y transverse directions of the plate respectively when a relatively long plate is mainly subjected to unidirectional compression of the x axis there is only one half wave in the plate width direction i e n 1 for a b rectangular plate if a b is an integer m a b otherwise the value of m is the minimum integer satisfying the condition a b m m 1 2 side shift imperfection fig 7b 2 w o s b 0 c o s m π x a s i n n π z 2 h where b 0 is the amplitude of initial deformation b 0 a 1000 n 1 3 column type imperfection fig 7c 3 w o h c 0 c o s n π x a where c 0 is the initial deformation amplitude of beam column type considering the transverse direction of reinforcement c 0 a 1000 n 1 taking three kinds of deformations as the initial imperfections the longitudinal load is kept unchanged with 450 kn and the ultimate value of transverse bending load is calculated in non linear fe method separately as shown in fig 8 a and table 2 compared with the ultimate bearing capacity of the non initial deformation structure the maximum transverse load with plate type initial imperfection the side shift imperfection and the beam column type imperfection are reduced by 8 08 4 66 and 0 59 respectively for the middle opening beam moreover the ultimate load for the end opening is about 6 larger than that of middle opening the initial imperfection in plate type has the greatest influence on the ultimate strength of the whole beam in fig 8 from the point of view of the whole buckling process the panel of stiffened panel will be the first to suffer from instability and failure which is verified by the following experimental results in fig 20 2 3 2 initial residual stress residual stress in steel structures is caused by uneven deformation of components during production fabrication and installation the distribution and size of residual stress are related to the geometric size shape manufacturing method and processing process of components vhanmane and bhattacharya 2008 in the stiffened plate structure the welding seam distributes residual tensile stress along the connecting area between the stiffened plate web and the plate while the middle part of the plate is distributed with residual compressive stress to satisfy the self equilibrium as shown in fig 9 in the finite element numerical calculation for the convenience of research the residual stress distribution in components is often simplified fig 10 shows several common simplified diagrams of residual stress distribution the residual stress distribution in this paper adopts the model shown in fig 10b during the welding process the stiffened plate is not constrained by the outside so the residual stress in the stiffened plate is in a self balancing state and the following expression can be obtained from the balancing condition in fig 11 4 2 b t σ r c x σ r c x σ r t x b 2 a t σ r c y σ r c y σ r t y a where σ r t x and σ r c x are the tensile and compressive residual stress in the x direction respectively σ r t y and σ r c y are the residual stresses in the y direction the tensile residual stress in the x direction σ r t x can generally reach the yield stress of material i e σ r t x σ y as for the compressive residual stress σ r c x smith et al 1992 divided the compressive residual stress σ r c x in the x direction into the following three grades 5 σ r c x σ y 0 05 slight level 0 15 average level 0 30 severity level when the magnitude and distribution of residual stress were determined the initial stress function of ansys finite element software was adopted to directly apply the residual stress to the structure as the initial condition which simplifies the calculation process it can be seen from literature bayatfar et al 2014 that the transverse residual stress in the y direction has little influence on the ultimate bearing capacity of stiffened plates while the longitudinal in the x direction residual stress will reduce the ultimate bearing capacity of stiffened plates and play a major role in the influence of residual stress therefore the influence of longitudinal residual stress on ultimate strength is mainly considered in this paper as shown in fig 12 and table 3 the transverse load intermediate node deflection curves under different residual stress levels basically coincide in the straight line segment which shows that the residual stress has little effect on the stiffness of the beams before the stiffened beams enter the elasto plastic state however with the increase of residual stress level the lower the proportional limit of the beam is which indicates that the existence of residual stress makes the reinforced beam yield in advance compared with the ultimate bearing capacity of the non initial stress structure the maximum transverse load with slight level average level and severity level residual stress are reduced by 0 26 0 71 and 1 63 respectively for the middle opening beam similarly the decrease in ultimate strength is within 3 for the end opening 2 3 3 combined effect of initial deformation and residual stress in the actual hull structure the initial deformation and welding residual stress of the perforated beam always exist at the same time therefore it is necessary to study the comprehensive impact of initial deformation and welding residual stress on the ultimate bearing capacity of the perforated beam in the calculation the plate type initial imperfection was selected as the initial deformation and the initial residual stress was taken as the average level from fig 13 and table 4 it can be seen that under the combined influence of initial deformation and residual stress the ultimate bearing capacity of the beam is lower than that under the separate influence of initial deformation or residual stress and the reduction is less than the sum of the two separate influences which shows that the combined influence is not a linear superposition of the single initial deformation and single residual stress the existence of initial deformation obviously reduces the ultimate bearing capacity while the residual stress has relatively little influence on the ultimate bearing capacity 3 experiment analysis the above numerical analysis analyzes the influence of the location of opening and the initial imperfections on the ultimate strength of the perforated girder on this basis the experimental research on the ultimate strength of web opening beams is mainly carried out below considering that the actual perforated beam needs to be reinforced five types of reinforced structures were designed in fig 14 and discussed to get the optimal structure in the previous research zhao et al 2015 considering the reinforcement effect and feasibility the combined reinforcement form ring and plate strengthening will be adopted for subsequent ultimate strength tests of perforated girders 3 1 specimen as shown in fig 15 a and table 5 six full scale plate girders with perforated web were used in the experiment specimens of h beam in low carbon steel σ y 235 mpa σ u 380 470 mpa were tested under axial compression and transverse bending loadings the opening was reinforced with the reinforcing plate and ring to improve the local strength see fig 15b plasma cutting technology was adopted for the processing of model panels and webs to ensure that the model dimensions meet the accuracy requirements as shown in fig 16 the steel hammer was used to strike the parts where the residual stress of the workpiece is concentrated to improve and balance the distribution of the original residual stress in hammering method in order to loading conveniently and safely the panel was inversed on the loading platform as shown in fig 17 the longitudinal load was applied in the position of neutral axis and the bending load was simulated six hydraulic jacks see fig 4c considering the actual load the maximum longitudinal load was limited to 450 kn and the transverse bending load was applied step by step the maximal displacements were measured under a series of longitudinal load and transverse bending load and the corresponding load displacement curve was recorded in the test 3 2 experiment results as the load increased the global bending of the girder and the local buckling deflection of the panel appeared and was visible the buckling failure of test specimens are shown in fig 18 the previous research huang et al 2013 has indicated that the global buckling mode and local buckling mode are sensitive to the position of holes and local buckling mostly occurred at the region adjacent to the hole however it is found that the local buckling happens near the reinforcing plate for series a and near the central of girder for series b therefore the reinforcing plate and ring has an important effect on the local buckling and even the global buckling which is effective to strengthen the strength of perforated girder the load displacement curves of series a and b are compared in fig 19 it is concluded that the change trend is consistent for each series the change of height position for the hole has little impact on the ultimate strength for the reinforced beam 3 3 numerical comparison in order to account for the longitudinal compressive effect on the buckling mode a fe model considering the initial deformation and residual stress was developed allowing elastic plastic analyses of specimens under compressive bending loadings the initial deformation was assumed to have the same shape of elastic buckling mode shape with average level magnitude as described in section 2 3 above the flow chart of ultimate bearing capacity calculation is shown in fig 20 the nonlinear material was defined in fig 3 and elastic plastic analysis after considering the initial imperfections 3 4 result comparison based on the above method numerical simulation method in section 3 3 was used to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity for specimens with different hole position taking the specimens no 3 and no 6 as the example the predicted results considering the longitudinal load and not considering the longitudinal load were simulated separately in fig 21 comparison between the predicted results and the corresponding experiment data reveals that the numerical simulation method proposed in this paper is reasonable and effective the following observations can be highlighted based on fig 21 1 the influence of longitudinal load on ultimate bearing capacity is significant the predicted displacement without considering the longitudinal load is constantly increasing with the increase of transverse bending load the ultimate load is higher than the experimental value obviously considering the longitudinal load the load displacement curve rises steadily at the initial stage and encounters a sudden drop due to the local buckling the longitudinal load accelerated the process of buckling 2 the ultimate load of no 3 obtained from the test is 366 kn and the ultimate load considering the longitudinal load is 371 kn the relative error is only 1 4 compared with the results of web opening girder without reinforcement in table 4 the ultimate load is increased by 1 6 times after strengthening as to series b no 6 the relative error is 4 5 in fig 21b and the ultimate load is increased by 1 55 times after strengthening the failure modes of no 3 and no 6 are extracted separately and represented in fig 22 it is verified that the local buckling happens near the reinforcing plate for series a and near the central of girder for series b compared with the experimental results the panel of stiffened panel will be the first to suffer from instability and failure and the failure location and forming are in good agreement with the numerical results in fig 22 4 conclusions in the present study the ultimate strengths of the perforated girders under compressive bending loadings have been investigated by experimental analysis and nonlinear finite element analysis 1 under the combined influence of initial deformation and residual stress the ultimate bearing capacity of the web opening girder is lower than that under the separate influence of initial deformation and residual stress but the reduction is less than the sum of the two separate influences which shows that the combined influence of initial deformation and residual stress is not a linear superposition of the single initial deformation and single residual stress the existence of initial deformation obviously reduces the ultimate bearing capacity while the residual stress has relatively little influence on the ultimate bearing capacity 2 the opening was reinforced with the reinforcing plate and ring to improve the local strength it is found that the local buckling happens near the reinforcing plate for series a and near the central of girder for series b after strengthening the ultimate load is increased by 1 6 times for series a and 1 55 times for series b the reinforcing plate and ring has an important effect on the local buckling and even the global buckling which is an effective measure to strengthen the strength of perforated girder 3 the longitudinal load accelerates the process of buckling the load displacement curve considering the longitudinal load rises steadily at the initial stage and encounters a sudden drop due to the local buckling acknowledgements this work is supported by the fundamental research

beams is mainly carried out below considering that the actual perforated beam needs to be reinforced five types of reinforced structures were designed in fig 14 and discussed to get the optimal structure in the previous research zhao et al 2015 considering the reinforcement effect and feasibility the combined reinforcement form ring and plate strengthening will be adopted for subsequent ultimate strength tests of perforated girders 3 1 specimen as shown in fig 15 a and table 5 six full scale plate girders with perforated web were used in the experiment specimens of h beam in low carbon steel σ y 235 mpa σ u 380 470 mpa were tested under axial compression and transverse bending loadings the opening was reinforced with the reinforcing plate and ring to improve the local strength see fig 15b plasma cutting technology was adopted for the processing of model panels and webs to ensure that the model dimensions meet the accuracy requirements as shown in fig 16 the steel hammer was used to strike the parts where the residual stress of the workpiece is concentrated to improve and balance the distribution of the original residual stress in hammering method in order to loading conveniently and safely the panel was inversed on the loading platform as shown in fig 17 the longitudinal load was applied in the position of neutral axis and the bending load was simulated six hydraulic jacks see fig 4c considering the actual load the maximum longitudinal load was limited to 450 kn and the transverse bending load was applied step by step the maximal displacements were measured under a series of longitudinal load and transverse bending load and the corresponding load displacement curve was recorded in the test 3 2 experiment results as the load increased the global bending of the girder and the local buckling deflection of the panel appeared and was visible the buckling failure of test specimens are shown in fig 18 the previous research huang et al 2013 has indicated that the global buckling mode and local buckling mode are sensitive to the position of holes and local buckling mostly occurred at the region adjacent to the hole however it is found that the local buckling happens near the reinforcing plate for series a and near the central of girder for series b therefore the reinforcing plate and ring has an important effect on the local buckling and even the global buckling which is effective to strengthen the strength of perforated girder the load displacement curves of series a and b are compared in fig 19 it is concluded that the change trend is consistent for each series the change of height position for the hole has little impact on the ultimate strength for the reinforced beam 3 3 numerical comparison in order to account for the longitudinal compressive effect on the buckling mode a fe model considering the initial deformation and residual stress was developed allowing elastic plastic analyses of specimens under compressive bending loadings the initial deformation was assumed to have the same shape of elastic buckling mode shape with average level magnitude as described in section 2 3 above the flow chart of ultimate bearing capacity calculation is shown in fig 20 the nonlinear material was defined in fig 3 and elastic plastic analysis after considering the initial imperfections 3 4 result comparison based on the above method numerical simulation method in section 3 3 was used to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity for specimens with different hole position taking the specimens no 3 and no 6 as the example the predicted results considering the longitudinal load and not considering the longitudinal load were simulated separately in fig 21 comparison between the predicted results and the corresponding experiment data reveals that the numerical simulation method proposed in this paper is reasonable and effective the following observations can be highlighted based on fig 21 1 the influence of longitudinal load on ultimate bearing capacity is significant the predicted displacement without considering the longitudinal load is constantly increasing with the increase of transverse bending load the ultimate load is higher than the experimental value obviously considering the longitudinal load the load displacement curve rises steadily at the initial stage and encounters a sudden drop due to the local buckling the longitudinal load accelerated the process of buckling 2 the ultimate load of no 3 obtained from the test is 366 kn and the ultimate load considering the longitudinal load is 371 kn the relative error is only 1 4 compared with the results of web opening girder without reinforcement in table 4 the ultimate load is increased by 1 6 times after strengthening as to series b no 6 the relative error is 4 5 in fig 21b and the ultimate load is increased by 1 55 times after strengthening the failure modes of no 3 and no 6 are extracted separately and represented in fig 22 it is verified that the local buckling happens near the reinforcing plate for series a and near the central of girder for series b compared with the experimental results the panel of stiffened panel will be the first to suffer from instability and failure and the failure location and forming are in good agreement with the numerical results in fig 22 4 conclusions in the present study the ultimate strengths of the perforated girders under compressive bending loadings have been investigated by experimental analysis and nonlinear finite element analysis 1 under the combined influence of initial deformation and residual stress the ultimate bearing capacity of the web opening girder is lower than that under the separate influence of initial deformation and residual stress but the reduction is less than the sum of the two separate influences which shows that the combined influence of initial deformation and residual stress is not a linear superposition of the single initial deformation and single residual stress the existence of initial deformation obviously reduces the ultimate bearing capacity while the residual stress has relatively little influence on the ultimate bearing capacity 2 the opening was reinforced with the reinforcing plate and ring to improve the local strength it is found that the local buckling happens near the reinforcing plate for series a and near the central of girder for series b after strengthening the ultimate load is increased by 1 6 times for series a and 1 55 times for series b the reinforcing plate and ring has an important effect on the local buckling and even the global buckling which is an effective measure to strengthen the strength of perforated girder 3 the longitudinal load accelerates the process of buckling the load displacement curve considering the longitudinal load rises steadily at the initial stage and encounters a sudden drop due to the local buckling acknowledgements this work is supported by the fundamental research

increasing energy demand marine resource development has moved into deep sea areas andersen et al 2008 li et al 2013a currently the development trends of submarine pipelines are ultra long transport more than 1000 km ultra deep water more than 2000 m and ultra large diameter more than 1 m zhou et al 2011 which render the laying and maintenance of pipelines increasingly difficult and the

migration processes the unstable slide masses gradually evolve into uniform high velocity fluidized flows via the complex water soil exchange which have a strong impact on submarine pipelines and threaten pipeline safety this evolution is a focus of current research locat and lee 2002 coyne and dollar 2005 thomson et al 2005 bruschi et al 2006 hsu et al 2008 zakeri et al 2008 zakeri 2009 randolph et al 2010 yuan et al 2012 vanneste et al 2014 liu et al 2015 dong 2016 nian et al 2018 wang et al 2018a and 2018b yin and rui 2018 to ensure the operational safety of submarine pipelines reasonable engineering route selection should be conducted in the initial stage of construction unfortunately the marine environment in many oil and gas enrichment areas is unsuitable and geological hazards are severely developed pipelines inevitably pass through these areas li et al 2013a guo et al 2019 route selection is the most economical and effective protective measure for pipelines there are three main types of submarine pipeline protection technologies for resisting or mitigating the hazards that are suffered by pipelines as illustrated in fig 1 first submarine pipelines must be buried at a suitable depth the american bureau of shipping abs stipulates that pipelines should be buried at a depth of at least 3 feet 0 9144 m second rigid protection technology for pipelines includes ripraps sandbag filling concrete cover short pile support and spoilers chiew 1992 yu et al 2007 third flexible protection technologies for pipelines include artificial water grass fiber and mesh mats crowhurst 1982 olsen 2001 yu et al 2007 these three approaches are widely used in shallow sea area however they are difficult to apply in deep sea areas this is because deep sea areas have more complex geological backgrounds and topographies require specialized construction techniques and are subject to water depth constraints hence deep sea pipelines can only be laid on the seabed surface yuan et al 2012 dutta and hawlader 2019 pipelines in deep sea areas rarely adopt external protection technology and are protected mainly via improved self design for increasing safety for example pipelines are made of high performance materials e g anti deformation anti fatigue and anti corrosion materials however their cost is very high and it is difficult to mitigate the impact of landslides inspired by bionics streamlined pipelines that reduce the impact of landslides have been proposed perez gruszkiewicz 2011 fan et al 2018 however streamlined pipelines require more complex processes and technologies in manufacturing transportation and installation which are currently difficult to apply in practical engineering deep sea areas have complex seabed topographies and active oceanic activities such as submarine canyons and bottom currents zheng and yan 2012 wang et al 2018c 2018d which lead to the suspension of pipelines and further increase the impact forces on the pipelines that are caused by landslides guo et al 2019 therefore in depth studies on mitigating this impact via advanced technologies are urgently needed in this paper a new type of submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes is proposed and the design standard of this pipeline is preliminarily quantified through the definition of parameters based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd method a natural low temperature rheological model of submarine landslides is employed to establish a numerical calculation model that has been verified several times and a comparative analysis of the traditional circular section and the new section with honeycomb holes is conducted in addition the resistance reduction effect of this new pipeline is quantified and the related resistance reduction mechanisms are deeply explored the results provide a basis for the corresponding engineering practice and scientific theoretical analysis 2 submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes submarine pipelines especially deep sea pipelines require sufficient self weight for maintaining their own stability many submarine pipelines are protected by a concrete counterweight layer the concrete counterweight layer is the outermost layer of a steel pipe as illustrated in fig 2 a when the required conveying capacity of the project is constant the diameter of the steel pipe is determined to increase the in situ stability of a submarine pipeline only the thickness of the concrete counterweight layer of submarine pipeline can be increased which directly leads to an increase in the overall diameter of the pipeline according to the calculation formulas for landslide impact forces on submarine pipeline zakeri et al 2008 liu et al 2015 nian et al 2018 the larger the diameter of the pipeline the larger the characteristic area will be thereby resulting in higher drag and lift forces being induced by landslides on the pipeline a british company unequivocally stated that the thickness of the concrete counterweight layer should not exceed the radius of the steel pipe yu 2009 to increase the in situ stability of submarine pipelines the thickness of the concrete counterweight layer should be increased as this thickness is increased the impact forces on the pipeline will become stronger this poses a difficult challenge in pipeline design the new pipeline design must urgently resolve this contradiction fig 2 illustrates the design of a submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes the diameter of the submarine pipeline is d mm the diameter of the holes in the submarine pipeline surface is d mm and the depth of the holes in the submarine pipeline surface is m mm in addition the number of holes per meter which is denoted as n is determined via the determination of these three parameters d m and n the design criterion for the detailed structure of a submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes can be standardized under the same conditions a ball with a pitted surface moves through the fluid air with less drag and for a longer distance than a ball with a smooth surface which is called the golf effect the simple treatment on only the concrete counterweight layer surface of submarine pipelines is likely to mitigate the impact on the pipeline this impact may come from the high velocity impact of submarine landslides in a devastating accidental load or from the low velocity erosion of ocean currents in a long term load moreover the processing difficulty of and the construction technology for this new pipeline have not changed substantially which is convenient for commercial production and engineering application compared with untreated pipelines submarine pipelines with honeycomb holes have larger surface area for example if d 5 mm n 8000 m 0 5 mm and d 25 mm the surface area of the pipeline is increased by 8 due to the contact and occlusion of the honeycomb holes with the seabed it is predicted to be more stable under the same gravitational conditions 3 numerical method currently many numerical methods are available for calculating the impact of submarine landslides on deep sea pipelines among them the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is one of the most widely used numerical methods zakeri et al 2009 liu et al 2015 fan et al 2018 nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 the validity of a numerical method for studying submarine landslides impact on pipelines has been successfully demonstrated by using cfd to handle fluid structure interactions nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 this method is used to perform systematically numerical simulations for exploring the resistance reduction effect and mechanism of the proposed honeycomb hole pipeline 3 1 shear strength of a submarine landslide a submarine slope soil layer gradually evolves from a slightly high shear strength prior to instability to a fluidized mass flow with a low shear strength and high plastic deformation and the shear strength change reaches 2 3 orders of magnitude the landslide shear strength of the whole process after generalization is expressed as follows 1 s u f γ f ξ s u0 where s u is the current shear strength of the submarine landslide kpa s u0 is the undisturbed shear strength of the marine soil layer kpa f ξ represents the strain softening effect of the marine soil shear strength in the initial stage and f γ represents the shear rate effect of the submarine landslide shear strength in addition the water content of a landslide body is continuously increased due to the intrusion and mixing effects of seawater and the landslide body evolves into a mudflow and continues to form a turbidity current the unit weight and shear strength of the landslide body in a turbidity current stage are much lower than in the mudflow stage thus according to bruschi et al 2006 the impact threat of submarine landslides on pipelines is mainly concentrated in a mudflow stage the mudflow stage of submarine landslides is selected for simulation in this paper a submarine mudflow can be regarded as a homogeneous non newtonian fluid zakeri et al 2009 and the strain softening relationship is not considered f ξ 1 the shear strength model of submarine landslides mudflows is described by the herschel bulkley model as follows 2 τ τ y k γ n s u f γ s u0 where τ is the shear strength of the submarine landslide pa τ y is the yield strength of the submarine landslide pa k is the consistency factor of the submarine landslide pa s n γ is the shear rate of the submarine landslide s 1 and n is the fluidity index in addition because the low temperature environment has a substantial influence on the rheological characteristics of submarine landslides in deep sea areas nian et al 2018 the low temperature rheological model is adopted in this paper the rheological model is listed in table 1 3 2 numerical modeling submarine pipelines especially those in the deep sea areas are laid on the seabed the complicated topographic environment and hydrodynamic conditions render the pipelines extremely prone to suspension and suspension conditions are highly dangerous for pipelines in accordance with previous simulation experience nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 a span height that is equal to the pipeline diameter is selected for the geometric model according to zakeri et al 2008 in engineering practice the following parameter values are employed a submarine pipeline diameter of 0 1 1 0 m a submarine landslide velocity of 1 10 m s and a reynolds number of approximately 0 6 240 based on the methodology for designing the numerical model guo et al 2018 combined with the rheological model of submarine landslides and other parameters via systematical theoretical calculations the submarine pipeline diameter is determined to be 25 mm in addition according to this methodology the impact velocity of submarine landslides is also determined and the simulation conditions are reported in table 2 these conditions cover the range of evaluation that is required in the engineering practice based on previous modeling studies zakeri 2009 liu et al 2015 nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 related geometric model settings are specified in fig 3 the geometric model cannot be directly used for cfd calculation it is necessary to divide the mesh of the geometric model to form the computational domain and to calculate the solution via the finite volume method each hole on the surface of the proposed submarine pipeline is carefully refined in the computational domain mesh a local mesh refinement method is applied to divide the mesh around the pipeline and a 7 layer boundary layer mesh with a total thickness of 2 mm is adopted for handling the detailed hole characteristics on the pipeline surface in addition the mesh encryption area of the pipeline is gradually transferred to the entire computational domain the maximum size of the computational domain mesh is 16 mm and the mesh of the entire computational domain is divided by this method as shown in fig 3 3 3 calculation settings in the simulation calculation of the impact of submarine landslides on pipelines two types of materials are considered namely the submarine landslide and seawater in a typical two phase flow analysis incompressible two phase flow theory is used to deal with the free surface flow simulation of the continuous fluid submarine landslide and seawater related control equations that were established by zakeri 2009 are as follows continuity equation 3 t r α ρ α r α ρ α u α m m s α β 1 n p γ α β where r α ρ α and u α are the volume fraction density and velocity respectively of phase α m m s α is the user specified quality source phase and γ α β is the mass flow rate of a unit volume from phase β to phase α which must satisfy γ α β γ β α β 1 n p γ α 0 for determining the direction of the mass exchange process if γ α β γ α β γ β α 0 the mass flow rate of the unit volume from phase β to phase α is positive and the volume fraction is α 1 n p r α 1 momentum equation 4 t r α ρ α u α r α ρ α u α u α r α p α r α μ α u α u α t β 1 n p γ α β u β γ β α u α s m α m α where p α and μ α are the pressure and viscosity coefficients respectively of phase α s m α is the momentum source phase that is caused by the external mass force and m α is the total interface force on phase α that is due to other phases which can be calculated via the following equation 5 m α β α m α β m α β d m α β l m α β l u b m α β v m m α β t d the above equations include the drag force lift force wall wetting force virtual mass force and turbulent dissipation force zakeri 2009 nian et al 2018 the solution calculation is carried out using the finite volume method and implemented on the ansys cfx 14 5 software platform the mesh that was subdivided in the previous section was imported into the computing platform the transient analysis was performed with a total duration of 1 2 s and the calculated time step was 0 001 s zakeri et al 2009 for additional parameter settings of the relevant calculation model see table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 quantification of impact forces on pipeline the impact of submarine landslides on pipelines is mainly due to the impact forces on the pipeline zakeri 2009 liu et al 2015 fan et al 2018 nian et al 2018 which include the drag force lift force and friction force as shown in fig 4 when the impact direction of the landslide is perpendicular to the axis of the pipeline there is no relative movement between the pipeline and the landslide along the axis this scenario in which the drag force and lift force on the pipeline are maximal and the friction force is considered to be zero is highly dangerous for the pipeline therefore when the impact angle is not considered only the drag force and the lift force on the pipeline are analyzed when a submarine landslide evolves into a mudflow with fluidized characteristics the theoretical framework of fluid mechanics is simpler and more popular for the analysis and prediction of the impact forces zakeri 2009 zhu and randolph 2011 liu et al 2015 fan et al 2018 nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 the formulas for quantitatively evaluating the impact forces on the pipeline are as follows 6 f d 0 5 ρ c d u 2 a d 7 f l 0 5 ρ c l u 2 a l where f d and f l are the drag force and lift force respectively on the pipeline n c d and c l are the drag force coefficient and lift force coefficient respectively which are dimensionless parameters and a d and a l are the normal and vertical projected frontal areas respectively of the pipeline m2 under the framework of fluid mechanics it is posited that c d c l and renon newtonian have a strong functional relationship which can be simplified as follows 8 c d a b re non newtonian 9 c l c d re non newtonian where a b c and d are constants that are greater than zero equation 8 eq 9 and the equation in table 1 are substituted into eqs 6 and 7 which are simplified as follows 10 f d 0 5 a d a ρ u 2 b τ 11 f l 0 5 a l c ρ u 2 d τ for the same pipeline that is a d and a l are fixed values with the increase of the landslide velocity the shear rate increases according to the calculation equation in table 1 and the landslide shear strength increases in accordance with eq 2 thereby leading to the reynolds number increasing according to the calculation equation in table 1 using eqs 10 and 11 for calculating the impact forces of landslides on pipelines as the velocity increases the square of the velocity increases faster thereby resulting in a substantial increase in the impact forces therefore for a high velocity impact process namely with a large reynolds number the drag and lift force coefficients are very low however due to the square term the pipeline is subjected to a stronger impact and additional consideration is necessary 4 2 numerical calculation results a total of 20 representative numerical calculations were conducted for two types of cross section submarine pipelines under the same working conditions the simulation results demonstrate that submarine pipelines with honeycomb holes can effectively reduce the drag force on the pipeline especially the more dangerous instantaneous impact force namely the peak drag force as shown in fig 5 compared with ordinary circular section pipelines the variations of the peak and stable drag forces on the pipeline with honeycomb holes are smaller the transitional state is more stable the change is slower and thus the influence on the pipeline is smaller the peak drag force coefficients of two cross section pipelines are extracted and calculated as listed in table 4 with the increase of the reynolds number the resistance reduction effect of the submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes increases according to fig 6 the impact process can be divided into two parts a slow sliding and a high velocity impact based on the analysis in section 4 1 more attention is paid to the larger forces on the pipeline in practical engineering that is the high velocity impact stage which is more dangerous for the pipeline when the pipeline is subjected to larger impact forces the resistance reduction effect of the submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes is more prominent when the reynolds number reaches 346 the resistance reduction of the pipeline can reach 20 for the lift force that is caused by submarine landslides according to analyses of many calculation results nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 the lift force constitutes only 27 of the drag force namely the drag force is 3 7 times the lift force the net force of the drag force and the lift force is only 3 5 larger than the drag force as shown in fig 4 for the impact force assessment on a submarine pipeline more attention is paid to the drag force that is caused by submarine landslides for the lift force the periodic vibration of the pipeline that is caused by the lift force is the main consideration the high velocity landslide leads to periodic force fluctuations in the vertical direction of the pipeline which result in vibration and fatigue of the pipeline thereby threatening the safe operation of the pipeline based on the simulation results a submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes can effectively reduce or even eliminate vertical vibration effects as shown in fig 7 especially for high reynolds number cases 4 3 discussion the resistance reduction effect of the submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes was briefly analyzed in the previous section this section mainly describes relevant mechanisms of resistance reduction when the submarine landslide flows through the surface of the pipeline the pipeline can be divided into two parts an upstream surface and a downstream surface there is a positive pressure zone on the upstream side and a negative pressure zone on the downstream side due to the landslide impact thereby resulting in a substantial pressure difference between the upstream side and the downstream side of the pipeline this is the reason for the generation of the drag force as shown in fig 8 the separation of boundary layer occurs near the junction of the upstream and downstream surfaces of the pipeline and this separation point is called the turning point as shown in fig 9 when a landslide flows through a submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes small eddies form near the holes on the pipeline surface due to the attraction of these eddies a local pressure difference is generated between the fluid and the pipeline contact zone which results in fluid elements being adsorbed to the pipeline surface and the turning point that causes the boundary layer to be separated is pushed back as plotted in fig 9 therefore when the pipeline is impacted by the landslide the horizontal pressure difference can be decreased namely the peak drag force can be reduced and a smoother transition to the stable state can be realized to reduce the resistance further it is necessary to further delay the position of the turning point namely to cause the pipeline holes to generate more eddies the number and size of the holes must be optimized submarine pipelines with honeycomb holes exhibit a resistance reduction effect on sudden loads such as submarine landslides and sand waves for pipelines in the deep sea area the marine geological environment is extremely complex and active ocean processes are developed such as bottom currents and waterways fang et al 1998 zheng and yan 2012 li et al 2013b gong et al 2015 these active currents continually erode the seabed and flush pipelines in various directions these fluids which exist throughout the service lifecycle of the pipeline have lower viscosity and generate a larger reynolds number it is predicted that submarine pipelines with honeycomb holes have a superior protective effect 5 conclusions in this paper a new cross section type of submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes is designed based on the cfd method a low temperature rheological model of submarine landslides is used to perform numerical calculations for the common circular and new type honeycomb hole pipelines under the impact of submarine landslides the main conclusions are as follows 1 the design methodology of a submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes is proposed and standardized by defining three index parameters d m and n 2 the impact forces on the pipeline are systematically investigated and three main working conditions are identified and quantified high reynolds number peak drag force and pipeline vibrations that are induced by the lift force 3 through the preliminary pipeline design the peak drag force on the pipeline can be reduced by 20 and the pipeline vertical vibration can be effectively reduced the higher the reynolds number the larger the resistance reduction effect 4 based on the theories of boundary layer separation and turning point delay the mechanisms of impact forces on pipeline and the corresponding disaster reduction and resistance reduction are revealed this paper mainly proposes a relevant preliminary design concept for submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes thus the resistance reduction effect is relatively conservative and limited via many numerical simulations 1 g flume experiments and ng centrifugal experiments in depth research was systematically conducted to continuously optimize and adjust the

includes ripraps sandbag filling concrete cover short pile support and spoilers chiew 1992 yu et al 2007 third flexible protection technologies for pipelines include artificial water grass fiber and mesh mats crowhurst 1982 olsen 2001 yu et al 2007 these three approaches are widely used in shallow sea area however they are difficult to apply in deep sea areas this is because deep sea areas have more complex geological backgrounds and topographies require specialized construction techniques and are subject to water depth constraints hence deep sea pipelines can only be laid on the seabed surface yuan et al 2012 dutta and hawlader 2019 pipelines in deep sea areas rarely adopt external protection technology and are protected mainly via improved self design for increasing safety for example pipelines are made of high performance materials e g anti deformation anti fatigue and anti corrosion materials however their cost is very high and it is difficult to mitigate the impact of landslides inspired by bionics streamlined pipelines that reduce the impact of landslides have been proposed perez gruszkiewicz 2011 fan et al 2018 however streamlined pipelines require more complex processes and technologies in manufacturing transportation and installation which are currently difficult to apply in practical engineering deep sea areas have complex seabed topographies and active oceanic activities such as submarine canyons and bottom currents zheng and yan 2012 wang et al 2018c 2018d which lead to the suspension of pipelines and further increase the impact forces on the pipelines that are caused by landslides guo et al 2019 therefore in depth studies on mitigating this impact via advanced technologies are urgently needed in this paper a new type of submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes is proposed and the design standard of this pipeline is preliminarily quantified through the definition of parameters based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd method a natural low temperature rheological model of submarine landslides is employed to establish a numerical calculation model that has been verified several times and a comparative analysis of the traditional circular section and the new section with honeycomb holes is conducted in addition the resistance reduction effect of this new pipeline is quantified and the related resistance reduction mechanisms are deeply explored the results provide a basis for the corresponding engineering practice and scientific theoretical analysis 2 submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes submarine pipelines especially deep sea pipelines require sufficient self weight for maintaining their own stability many submarine pipelines are protected by a concrete counterweight layer the concrete counterweight layer is the outermost layer of a steel pipe as illustrated in fig 2 a when the required conveying capacity of the project is constant the diameter of the steel pipe is determined to increase the in situ stability of a submarine pipeline only the thickness of the concrete counterweight layer of submarine pipeline can be increased which directly leads to an increase in the overall diameter of the pipeline according to the calculation formulas for landslide impact forces on submarine pipeline zakeri et al 2008 liu et al 2015 nian et al 2018 the larger the diameter of the pipeline the larger the characteristic area will be thereby resulting in higher drag and lift forces being induced by landslides on the pipeline a british company unequivocally stated that the thickness of the concrete counterweight layer should not exceed the radius of the steel pipe yu 2009 to increase the in situ stability of submarine pipelines the thickness of the concrete counterweight layer should be increased as this thickness is increased the impact forces on the pipeline will become stronger this poses a difficult challenge in pipeline design the new pipeline design must urgently resolve this contradiction fig 2 illustrates the design of a submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes the diameter of the submarine pipeline is d mm the diameter of the holes in the submarine pipeline surface is d mm and the depth of the holes in the submarine pipeline surface is m mm in addition the number of holes per meter which is denoted as n is determined via the determination of these three parameters d m and n the design criterion for the detailed structure of a submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes can be standardized under the same conditions a ball with a pitted surface moves through the fluid air with less drag and for a longer distance than a ball with a smooth surface which is called the golf effect the simple treatment on only the concrete counterweight layer surface of submarine pipelines is likely to mitigate the impact on the pipeline this impact may come from the high velocity impact of submarine landslides in a devastating accidental load or from the low velocity erosion of ocean currents in a long term load moreover the processing difficulty of and the construction technology for this new pipeline have not changed substantially which is convenient for commercial production and engineering application compared with untreated pipelines submarine pipelines with honeycomb holes have larger surface area for example if d 5 mm n 8000 m 0 5 mm and d 25 mm the surface area of the pipeline is increased by 8 due to the contact and occlusion of the honeycomb holes with the seabed it is predicted to be more stable under the same gravitational conditions 3 numerical method currently many numerical methods are available for calculating the impact of submarine landslides on deep sea pipelines among them the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is one of the most widely used numerical methods zakeri et al 2009 liu et al 2015 fan et al 2018 nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 the validity of a numerical method for studying submarine landslides impact on pipelines has been successfully demonstrated by using cfd to handle fluid structure interactions nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 this method is used to perform systematically numerical simulations for exploring the resistance reduction effect and mechanism of the proposed honeycomb hole pipeline 3 1 shear strength of a submarine landslide a submarine slope soil layer gradually evolves from a slightly high shear strength prior to instability to a fluidized mass flow with a low shear strength and high plastic deformation and the shear strength change reaches 2 3 orders of magnitude the landslide shear strength of the whole process after generalization is expressed as follows 1 s u f γ f ξ s u0 where s u is the current shear strength of the submarine landslide kpa s u0 is the undisturbed shear strength of the marine soil layer kpa f ξ represents the strain softening effect of the marine soil shear strength in the initial stage and f γ represents the shear rate effect of the submarine landslide shear strength in addition the water content of a landslide body is continuously increased due to the intrusion and mixing effects of seawater and the landslide body evolves into a mudflow and continues to form a turbidity current the unit weight and shear strength of the landslide body in a turbidity current stage are much lower than in the mudflow stage thus according to bruschi et al 2006 the impact threat of submarine landslides on pipelines is mainly concentrated in a mudflow stage the mudflow stage of submarine landslides is selected for simulation in this paper a submarine mudflow can be regarded as a homogeneous non newtonian fluid zakeri et al 2009 and the strain softening relationship is not considered f ξ 1 the shear strength model of submarine landslides mudflows is described by the herschel bulkley model as follows 2 τ τ y k γ n s u f γ s u0 where τ is the shear strength of the submarine landslide pa τ y is the yield strength of the submarine landslide pa k is the consistency factor of the submarine landslide pa s n γ is the shear rate of the submarine landslide s 1 and n is the fluidity index in addition because the low temperature environment has a substantial influence on the rheological characteristics of submarine landslides in deep sea areas nian et al 2018 the low temperature rheological model is adopted in this paper the rheological model is listed in table 1 3 2 numerical modeling submarine pipelines especially those in the deep sea areas are laid on the seabed the complicated topographic environment and hydrodynamic conditions render the pipelines extremely prone to suspension and suspension conditions are highly dangerous for pipelines in accordance with previous simulation experience nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 a span height that is equal to the pipeline diameter is selected for the geometric model according to zakeri et al 2008 in engineering practice the following parameter values are employed a submarine pipeline diameter of 0 1 1 0 m a submarine landslide velocity of 1 10 m s and a reynolds number of approximately 0 6 240 based on the methodology for designing the numerical model guo et al 2018 combined with the rheological model of submarine landslides and other parameters via systematical theoretical calculations the submarine pipeline diameter is determined to be 25 mm in addition according to this methodology the impact velocity of submarine landslides is also determined and the simulation conditions are reported in table 2 these conditions cover the range of evaluation that is required in the engineering practice based on previous modeling studies zakeri 2009 liu et al 2015 nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 related geometric model settings are specified in fig 3 the geometric model cannot be directly used for cfd calculation it is necessary to divide the mesh of the geometric model to form the computational domain and to calculate the solution via the finite volume method each hole on the surface of the proposed submarine pipeline is carefully refined in the computational domain mesh a local mesh refinement method is applied to divide the mesh around the pipeline and a 7 layer boundary layer mesh with a total thickness of 2 mm is adopted for handling the detailed hole characteristics on the pipeline surface in addition the mesh encryption area of the pipeline is gradually transferred to the entire computational domain the maximum size of the computational domain mesh is 16 mm and the mesh of the entire computational domain is divided by this method as shown in fig 3 3 3 calculation settings in the simulation calculation of the impact of submarine landslides on pipelines two types of materials are considered namely the submarine landslide and seawater in a typical two phase flow analysis incompressible two phase flow theory is used to deal with the free surface flow simulation of the continuous fluid submarine landslide and seawater related control equations that were established by zakeri 2009 are as follows continuity equation 3 t r α ρ α r α ρ α u α m m s α β 1 n p γ α β where r α ρ α and u α are the volume fraction density and velocity respectively of phase α m m s α is the user specified quality source phase and γ α β is the mass flow rate of a unit volume from phase β to phase α which must satisfy γ α β γ β α β 1 n p γ α 0 for determining the direction of the mass exchange process if γ α β γ α β γ β α 0 the mass flow rate of the unit volume from phase β to phase α is positive and the volume fraction is α 1 n p r α 1 momentum equation 4 t r α ρ α u α r α ρ α u α u α r α p α r α μ α u α u α t β 1 n p γ α β u β γ β α u α s m α m α where p α and μ α are the pressure and viscosity coefficients respectively of phase α s m α is the momentum source phase that is caused by the external mass force and m α is the total interface force on phase α that is due to other phases which can be calculated via the following equation 5 m α β α m α β m α β d m α β l m α β l u b m α β v m m α β t d the above equations include the drag force lift force wall wetting force virtual mass force and turbulent dissipation force zakeri 2009 nian et al 2018 the solution calculation is carried out using the finite volume method and implemented on the ansys cfx 14 5 software platform the mesh that was subdivided in the previous section was imported into the computing platform the transient analysis was performed with a total duration of 1 2 s and the calculated time step was 0 001 s zakeri et al 2009 for additional parameter settings of the relevant calculation model see table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 quantification of impact forces on pipeline the impact of submarine landslides on pipelines is mainly due to the impact forces on the pipeline zakeri 2009 liu et al 2015 fan et al 2018 nian et al 2018 which include the drag force lift force and friction force as shown in fig 4 when the impact direction of the landslide is perpendicular to the axis of the pipeline there is no relative movement between the pipeline and the landslide along the axis this scenario in which the drag force and lift force on the pipeline are maximal and the friction force is considered to be zero is highly dangerous for the pipeline therefore when the impact angle is not considered only the drag force and the lift force on the pipeline are analyzed when a submarine landslide evolves into a mudflow with fluidized characteristics the theoretical framework of fluid mechanics is simpler and more popular for the analysis and prediction of the impact forces zakeri 2009 zhu and randolph 2011 liu et al 2015 fan et al 2018 nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 the formulas for quantitatively evaluating the impact forces on the pipeline are as follows 6 f d 0 5 ρ c d u 2 a d 7 f l 0 5 ρ c l u 2 a l where f d and f l are the drag force and lift force respectively on the pipeline n c d and c l are the drag force coefficient and lift force coefficient respectively which are dimensionless parameters and a d and a l are the normal and vertical projected frontal areas respectively of the pipeline m2 under the framework of fluid mechanics it is posited that c d c l and renon newtonian have a strong functional relationship which can be simplified as follows 8 c d a b re non newtonian 9 c l c d re non newtonian where a b c and d are constants that are greater than zero equation 8 eq 9 and the equation in table 1 are substituted into eqs 6 and 7 which are simplified as follows 10 f d 0 5 a d a ρ u 2 b τ 11 f l 0 5 a l c ρ u 2 d τ for the same pipeline that is a d and a l are fixed values with the increase of the landslide velocity the shear rate increases according to the calculation equation in table 1 and the landslide shear strength increases in accordance with eq 2 thereby leading to the reynolds number increasing according to the calculation equation in table 1 using eqs 10 and 11 for calculating the impact forces of landslides on pipelines as the velocity increases the square of the velocity increases faster thereby resulting in a substantial increase in the impact forces therefore for a high velocity impact process namely with a large reynolds number the drag and lift force coefficients are very low however due to the square term the pipeline is subjected to a stronger impact and additional consideration is necessary 4 2 numerical calculation results a total of 20 representative numerical calculations were conducted for two types of cross section submarine pipelines under the same working conditions the simulation results demonstrate that submarine pipelines with honeycomb holes can effectively reduce the drag force on the pipeline especially the more dangerous instantaneous impact force namely the peak drag force as shown in fig 5 compared with ordinary circular section pipelines the variations of the peak and stable drag forces on the pipeline with honeycomb holes are smaller the transitional state is more stable the change is slower and thus the influence on the pipeline is smaller the peak drag force coefficients of two cross section pipelines are extracted and calculated as listed in table 4 with the increase of the reynolds number the resistance reduction effect of the submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes increases according to fig 6 the impact process can be divided into two parts a slow sliding and a high velocity impact based on the analysis in section 4 1 more attention is paid to the larger forces on the pipeline in practical engineering that is the high velocity impact stage which is more dangerous for the pipeline when the pipeline is subjected to larger impact forces the resistance reduction effect of the submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes is more prominent when the reynolds number reaches 346 the resistance reduction of the pipeline can reach 20 for the lift force that is caused by submarine landslides according to analyses of many calculation results nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 the lift force constitutes only 27 of the drag force namely the drag force is 3 7 times the lift force the net force of the drag force and the lift force is only 3 5 larger than the drag force as shown in fig 4 for the impact force assessment on a submarine pipeline more attention is paid to the drag force that is caused by submarine landslides for the lift force the periodic vibration of the pipeline that is caused by the lift force is the main consideration the high velocity landslide leads to periodic force fluctuations in the vertical direction of the pipeline which result in vibration and fatigue of the pipeline thereby threatening the safe operation of the pipeline based on the simulation results a submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes can effectively reduce or even eliminate vertical vibration effects as shown in fig 7 especially for high reynolds number cases 4 3 discussion the resistance reduction effect of the submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes was briefly analyzed in the previous section this section mainly describes relevant mechanisms of resistance reduction when the submarine landslide flows through the surface of the pipeline the pipeline can be divided into two parts an upstream surface and a downstream surface there is a positive pressure zone on the upstream side and a negative pressure zone on the downstream side due to the landslide impact thereby resulting in a substantial pressure difference between the upstream side and the downstream side of the pipeline this is the reason for the generation of the drag force as shown in fig 8 the separation of boundary layer occurs near the junction of the upstream and downstream surfaces of the pipeline and this separation point is called the turning point as shown in fig 9 when a landslide flows through a submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes small eddies form near the holes on the pipeline surface due to the attraction of these eddies a local pressure difference is generated between the fluid and the pipeline contact zone which results in fluid elements being adsorbed to the pipeline surface and the turning point that causes the boundary layer to be separated is pushed back as plotted in fig 9 therefore when the pipeline is impacted by the landslide the horizontal pressure difference can be decreased namely the peak drag force can be reduced and a smoother transition to the stable state can be realized to reduce the resistance further it is necessary to further delay the position of the turning point namely to cause the pipeline holes to generate more eddies the number and size of the holes must be optimized submarine pipelines with honeycomb holes exhibit a resistance reduction effect on sudden loads such as submarine landslides and sand waves for pipelines in the deep sea area the marine geological environment is extremely complex and active ocean processes are developed such as bottom currents and waterways fang et al 1998 zheng and yan 2012 li et al 2013b gong et al 2015 these active currents continually erode the seabed and flush pipelines in various directions these fluids which exist throughout the service lifecycle of the pipeline have lower viscosity and generate a larger reynolds number it is predicted that submarine pipelines with honeycomb holes have a superior protective effect 5 conclusions in this paper a new cross section type of submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes is designed based on the cfd method a low temperature rheological model of submarine landslides is used to perform numerical calculations for the common circular and new type honeycomb hole pipelines under the impact of submarine landslides the main conclusions are as follows 1 the design methodology of a submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes is proposed and standardized by defining three index parameters d m and n 2 the impact forces on the pipeline are systematically investigated and three main working conditions are identified and quantified high reynolds number peak drag force and pipeline vibrations that are induced by the lift force 3 through the preliminary pipeline design the peak drag force on the pipeline can be reduced by 20 and the pipeline vertical vibration can be effectively reduced the higher the reynolds number the larger the resistance reduction effect 4 based on the theories of boundary layer separation and turning point delay the mechanisms of impact forces on pipeline and the corresponding disaster reduction and resistance reduction are revealed this paper mainly proposes a relevant preliminary design concept for submarine pipeline with honeycomb holes thus the resistance reduction effect is relatively conservative and limited via many numerical simulations 1 g flume experiments and ng centrifugal experiments in depth research was systematically conducted to continuously optimize and adjust the combination of three parameters and to combine the industry and construction standards to optimize the resistance reduction effect for reducing the impact of landslides sand waves and deep water

22597,this paper presents an improved extended state observer based line of sight elos guidance law for robust path following of underactuated surface vehicles without linear velocity measurement first two extended state observers are resorted to separately estimate the surge and sway linear velocities such that the unmeasured side slip angle can be indirectly calculated and accurately compensated in the line of sight guidance law especially in this improved elos design no assumptions on constant or small side slip angle are made second a more high order sliding mode surface is defined for the input of third order heading tracking subsystem due to actuator dynamics subsequently an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control afsmc based tracking law is designed to robustly track the heading guidance angle without a prior on the vehicle s complex hydrodynamics parameters finally comparative simulation results are provided to show the performance of the designed path following controller composed of elos and afsmc for underactuated surface vehicles with actuator dynamics keywords underactuated surface vehicle extended state observer line of sight adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control actuator dynamics 1 introduction due to varying degrees of autonomy a growing number of unmanned marine vehicles have been developed to expand the abilities of human in marine scientific commercial and military applications such as bathymetric survey supporting underwater vehicles as communication relays underwater salvage and mine countermeasures tanakitkorn 2019 caccia et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 for unmanned marine vehicles to exploit the potential benefits a high precision tracking controller is required such that the quality of the collected data can be guaranteed cui et al 2017 in the past two decades a number of robust motion controllers for various unmanned vehicles have been designed and validated zarafshan et al 2008 peng et al 2018 liang et al 2018 yu et al 2018 for instance a canonical feedback linearization controller integrated with an adaptation law was designed to encounter uncertainty in an aerial robot system zarafshan et al 2010 in lu et al 2019 an adaptive dynamic surface controller was designed for a hybrid aerial underwater vehicle to deal with system uncertainties in chu et al 2018 an adaptive sliding mode controller based on fuzzy logic system was proposed to reject the modeling uncertainty of an auv s dynamic model a neural based path following controller was investigated to capture the vehicle uncertainties without the exact information of hydrodynamics damping structure and sea disturbances zhang et al 2015 recently the line of sight los guidance law is popular in path following control of marine vehicles for a fully actuated marine vessel a nonlinear vectorial backstepping controller was directly derived to achieve global exponential tracking in fossen and berge 1997 yet the underactuated configuration in yaw makes the above backstepping based design ineffective to this end a los based guidance law was introduced to transform the error in sway into the heading angle error breivik and fossen 2005 zheng et al 2018 in breivik and fossen 2004 a los guidance law together with backstepping technique was designed for path following of straight lines and circles in xiang et al 2015 the look ahead distance of the los guidance law was adjusted online by the path curvature in order to improve the adaptivity for curve paths in wang et al 2018 a surge varying los guidance law was proposed and then a robust heading tracking controller based on adaptive fuzzy observer was developed to ensure that heading error is uniformly ultimately bounded in the above classic los guidance law the accurate side slip angle needs to be measured online by acoustic doppler current profilers however small surface vehicles are not equipped with this kind of velocity sensors because of the estimated cost an alternative approach that estimates the side slip angle is the integral line of sight ilos where an integral term is introduced to compensate for the effect of the side slip angle in borhaug et al 2008 and lekkas and fossen 2014 a classic ilos guidance law was applied to straight line and curve path following respectively similar research results can be found in fossen et al 2015 and caharija et al 2016 note that in the ilos guidance law the side slip angle is usually assumed to be constant it is well known that the underactuated vehicle usually has a time varying sway linear velocity especially in the curve path following or in the presence of ocean currents hence the side slip angle is not constant in practical in zeng et al 2017 an adaptive los guidance law with a current observer was proposed to generate a variable side slip angle to compensate for the drift force in the curve path following in liu et al 2017 a reduced order extended state observer eso that can estimate the time varying side slip angle was derived and then a eso based los elos guidance law was used to generate the desired heading angle yet in the elos guidance law the side slip angle is seen as a relatively small angle that is lower than 5 degrees in addition the resultant velocity of the surface vehicle is known in advance in addition to these problems of system uncertainty underactuated configuration and unmeasured side slip angle in path following of surface vehicles emphases should be also placed on actuator dynamics which means that onboard actuators like thrusters and rudders have time constants between their input and output fossen and berge 1997 in qu et al 2017 a modified backstepping path following controller based on the work of fossen and berge 1997 was designed for marine crafts with actuator dynamics in fact actuator dynamics can be denoted by a first order differential equation which will result in the delay of control input acting on the vehicle the region tracking problem for underwater vehicle with input delay was studied based on a predictor in mukherjee et al 2015 in zhao 2018 a predictive control algorithm was proposed to compensate for the time delay in tracking control system of an underwater vehicle in xia et al 2018 backstepping control with fuzzy approximation approach was resorted to handle with problems of time delay and disturbances however the above research assumes that all the velocity states are known in advance motivated by the above considerations this paper proposes a velocity free robust path following controller for an underactuated surface vehicle with actuator dynamics and system uncertainty the main contributions are given as follows 1 compared with the existing elos in liu et al 2017 the improved elos guidance law is capable of estimating any time varying side slip angle and does not require the resultant velocity information of the vehicle 2 both actuator dynamics and system uncertainties are considered in the subsequent heading tracking design and the developed high order adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control afsmc law guarantees asymptotic stability of the heading error instead of uniformly ultimately boundness in wang et al 2018 the rest of this paper is organized as follows the modeling of underactuated surface vehicles with actuator dynamics is presented in section 2 the path following controller composed of the improved elos and afsmc is derived in section 3 section 4 shows numerical simulation results and concluding remarks and further research are contained in section 5 2 vehicle modeling to describe the vehicle model and subsequent control system we summarize main notations and the corresponding description in table 1 considering actuator dynamics three degrees of freedom motion equations of surface vehicles can be described as fossen and berge 1997 1 x j ψ v v m 1 c v v d v v u j ψ u e u t 1 u u c remark 1 in eq 1 v m c v d v and u e are unknown for control design in addition since there is no active control input in sway the surface vehicle considered in this paper is underactuated assumption 1 fossen and berge 1997 qu et al 2017 in control design we assume that τ u c keeps constant and t is known by actuator test in advance 3 control design 3 1 error dynamics let ϑ be the path scalar for any given ϑ the horizontal plane desired path can be represented by x p ϑ y p ϑ and the corresponding path tangential angle χ p ϑ is atan2 y p ϑ x p ϑ where y p ϑ y ϑ ϑ and x p ϑ x ϑ ϑ as shown in fig 1 assuming that a surface vehicle to track the above path is located at x y the along track error x e and the cross track error y e can be expanded in the path tangential frame f as 2 x e x x p ϑ cos χ p ϑ y y p ϑ sin χ p ϑ y e x x p ϑ sin χ p ϑ y y p ϑ cos χ p ϑ the derivatives of the

point p remark 2 the error dynamics equations indicate that the convergence of the along track and across track errors can be achieved by the heading adjustment which is beneficial for developing a path following controller for an underactuated surface vehicle in sway remark 3 it is well known that for a small surface vehicle the position x y and the heading angle ψ are measurable yet the surge and sway velocities u v are usually unknown in practice due to the lack of acoustic doppler current profilers different from the vehicle all the variables of the desired path are planned and known in path following control 3 2 elos design in the elos design we aim at deriving the desired heading angle ψ d to guide an underactuated surface vehicle to converge to the desired path in the absence of linear velocity measurement first the following assumption is made assumption 2 lekkas and fossen 2014 liu et al 2017 the desired heading angle can be perfectly tracked in the dynamics layer under assumption 2 eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 x e u cos ψ d χ p ϑ v sin ψ d χ p ϑ χ p ϑ y e u p ϑ y e u sin ψ d χ p ϑ v cos ψ d χ p ϑ χ p ϑ x e for the sake of estimating the surge and sway velocities as mentioned in remark 3 two reduced order extended state observers esos are proposed by using the known position and angles as 5 u ˆ p u k 1 x e p u k 1 u ˆ cos ψ d χ p ϑ v ˆ sin ψ d χ p ϑ χ p ϑ y e u p

k 1 is the observer gain note that these two esos have the same observer gain define the estimation errors of linear velocities as 7 u u ˆ u v v ˆ v and then by combining eqs 5 and 6 the corresponding error dynamics of velocity estimations are 8 u k 1 u cos ψ d χ p ϑ k 1 v sin ψ d χ p ϑ u v k 1 u sin ψ d χ p ϑ k 1 v cos ψ d χ p ϑ v substituting eq 7 into eq 4 yields that 9 x e u ˆ cos ψ d χ p ϑ v ˆ

asymptotically stable since the accurate hydrodynamics coefficients are difficult to measure the control law in eq 19 is impractical according to the universal approximation theorem there exists an optimal fuzzy control system ϖ ξ s so that 20 τ r c ϖ ξ s ε where the parameter vector is ϖ ϖ 1 ϖ 2 ϖ m the regressive vector is ξ s ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ m with ξ i w i i 1 m w i and w i being the weight of the

environmental disturbances are not included and the corresponding results are described in figs 3 and 4 the vehicle converges to the desired path regardless of shape and both the surge and sway linear velocities track the actual values accurately note that the sway linear velocity in sinusoidal path following crosses back and forth on the zero line the eso still estimates the time varying linear

uses the same parameters for different initial states the speed estimation errors in the stable stage are zero as shown in fig 7 which indicates that the designed controller has good adaptability the comparison between the given command and the actual state of actuators is plotted in fig 8 it is obvious that due to the time constant these two commands have difference at the same time stamp on the

perform well in the stable accuracy and robustness against sharp disturbances as shown in fig 11 the control input in yaw changes quickly to reject the elos based guidance error using the afsmc law in addition the pid controller maybe consume more energy than the afsmc law because of initial large shaking 5 conclusion this paper proposes an improved elos guidance law for velocity free robust path following of underactuated surface vehicles in the presence of actuator dynamics the elos guidance law together with a robust afsmc law is verified by theory analysis and simulation results compared

22597,this paper presents an improved extended state observer based line of sight elos guidance law for robust path following of underactuated surface vehicles without linear velocity measurement first two extended state observers are resorted to separately estimate the surge and sway linear velocities such that the unmeasured side slip angle can be indirectly calculated and accurately compensated in the line of sight guidance law especially in this improved elos design no assumptions on constant or small side slip angle are made second a more high order sliding mode surface is defined for the input of third order heading tracking subsystem due to actuator dynamics subsequently an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control afsmc based tracking law is designed to robustly track the heading guidance angle without a prior on the vehicle s complex hydrodynamics parameters finally comparative simulation results are provided to show the performance of the designed path following controller composed of elos and afsmc for underactuated surface vehicles with actuator dynamics keywords underactuated surface vehicle extended state observer line of sight adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control actuator dynamics 1 introduction due to varying degrees of autonomy a growing number of unmanned marine vehicles have been developed to expand the abilities of human in marine scientific commercial and military applications such as bathymetric survey supporting underwater vehicles as communication relays underwater salvage and mine countermeasures tanakitkorn 2019 caccia et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 for unmanned marine vehicles to exploit the potential benefits a high precision tracking controller is required such that the quality of the collected data can be guaranteed cui et al 2017 in the past two decades a number of robust motion controllers for various unmanned vehicles have been designed and validated zarafshan et al 2008 peng et al 2018 liang et al 2018 yu et al 2018 for instance a canonical feedback linearization controller integrated with an adaptation law was designed to encounter uncertainty in an aerial robot system zarafshan et al 2010 in lu et al 2019 an adaptive dynamic surface controller was designed for a hybrid aerial underwater vehicle to deal with system uncertainties in chu et al 2018 an adaptive sliding mode controller based on fuzzy logic system was proposed to reject the modeling uncertainty of an auv s dynamic model a neural based path following controller was investigated to capture the vehicle uncertainties without the exact information of hydrodynamics damping structure and sea disturbances zhang et al 2015 recently the line of sight los guidance law is popular in path following control of marine vehicles for a fully actuated marine vessel a nonlinear vectorial backstepping controller was directly derived to achieve global exponential tracking in fossen and berge 1997 yet the underactuated configuration in yaw makes the above backstepping based design ineffective to this end a los based guidance law was introduced to transform the error in sway into the heading angle error breivik and fossen 2005 zheng et al 2018 in breivik and fossen 2004 a los guidance law together with backstepping technique was designed for path following of straight lines and circles in xiang et al 2015 the look ahead distance of the los guidance law was adjusted online by the path curvature in order to improve the adaptivity for curve paths in wang et al 2018 a surge varying los guidance law was proposed and then a robust heading tracking controller based on adaptive fuzzy observer was developed to ensure that heading error is uniformly ultimately bounded in the above classic los guidance law the accurate side slip angle needs to be measured online by acoustic doppler current profilers however small surface vehicles are not equipped with this kind of velocity sensors because of the estimated cost an alternative approach that estimates the side slip angle is the integral line of sight ilos where an integral term is introduced to compensate for the effect of the side slip angle in borhaug et al 2008 and lekkas and fossen 2014 a classic ilos guidance law was applied to straight line and curve path following respectively similar research results can be found in fossen et al 2015 and caharija et al 2016 note that in the ilos guidance law the side slip angle is usually assumed to be constant it is well known that the underactuated vehicle usually has a time varying sway linear velocity especially in the curve path following or in the presence of ocean currents hence the side slip angle is not constant in practical in zeng et al 2017 an adaptive los guidance law with a current observer was proposed to generate a variable side slip angle to compensate for the drift force in the curve path following in liu et al 2017 a reduced order extended state observer eso that can estimate the time varying side slip angle was derived and then a eso based los elos guidance law was used to generate the desired heading angle yet in the elos guidance law the side slip angle is seen as a relatively small angle that is lower than 5 degrees in addition the resultant velocity of the surface vehicle is known in advance in addition to these problems of system uncertainty underactuated configuration and unmeasured side slip angle in path following of surface vehicles emphases should be also placed on actuator dynamics which means that onboard actuators like thrusters and rudders have time constants between their input and output fossen and berge 1997 in qu et al 2017 a modified backstepping path following controller based on the work of fossen and berge 1997 was designed for marine crafts with actuator dynamics in fact actuator dynamics can be denoted by a first order differential equation which will result in the delay of control input acting on the vehicle the region tracking problem for underwater vehicle with input delay was studied based on a predictor in mukherjee et al 2015 in zhao 2018 a predictive control algorithm was proposed to compensate for the time delay in tracking control system of an underwater vehicle in xia et al 2018 backstepping control with fuzzy approximation approach was resorted to handle with problems of time delay and disturbances however the above research assumes that all the velocity states are known in advance motivated by the above considerations this paper proposes a velocity free robust path following controller for an underactuated surface vehicle with actuator dynamics and system uncertainty the main contributions are given as follows 1 compared with the existing elos in liu et al 2017 the improved elos guidance law is capable of estimating any time varying side slip angle and does not require the resultant velocity information of the vehicle 2 both actuator dynamics and system uncertainties are considered in the subsequent heading tracking design and the developed high order adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control afsmc law guarantees asymptotic stability of the heading error instead of uniformly ultimately boundness in wang et al 2018 the rest of this paper is organized as follows the modeling of underactuated surface vehicles with actuator dynamics is presented in section 2 the path following controller composed of the improved elos and afsmc is derived in section 3 section 4 shows numerical simulation results and concluding remarks and further research are contained in section 5 2 vehicle modeling to describe the vehicle model and subsequent control system we summarize main notations and the corresponding description in table 1 considering actuator dynamics three degrees of freedom motion equations of surface vehicles can be described as fossen and berge 1997 1 x j ψ v v m 1 c v v d v v u j ψ u e u t 1 u u c remark 1 in eq 1 v m c v d v and u e are unknown for control design in addition since there is no active control input in sway the surface vehicle considered in this paper is underactuated assumption 1 fossen and berge 1997 qu et al 2017 in control design we assume that τ u c keeps constant and t is known by actuator test in advance 3 control design 3 1 error dynamics let ϑ be the path scalar for any given ϑ the horizontal plane desired path can be represented by x p ϑ y p ϑ and the corresponding path tangential angle χ p ϑ is atan2 y p ϑ x p ϑ where y p ϑ y ϑ ϑ and x p ϑ x ϑ ϑ as shown in fig 1 assuming that a surface vehicle to track the above path is located at x y the along track error x e and the cross track error y e can be expanded in the path tangential frame f as 2 x e x x p ϑ cos χ p ϑ y y p ϑ sin χ p ϑ y e x x p ϑ sin χ p ϑ y y p ϑ cos χ p ϑ the derivatives of the above errors in path following control are 3 x e u cos ψ χ p ϑ v sin ψ χ p ϑ χ p ϑ y e u p ϑ y e u sin ψ χ p ϑ v cos ψ χ p ϑ χ p ϑ x e here u p ϑ ϑ x p 2 ϑ y p 2 ϑ denotes the resultant velocity of point p remark 2 the error dynamics equations indicate that the convergence of the along track and across track errors can be achieved by the heading adjustment which is beneficial for developing a path following controller for an underactuated surface vehicle in sway remark 3 it is well known that for a small surface vehicle the position x y and the heading angle ψ are measurable yet the surge and sway velocities u v are usually unknown in practice due to the lack of acoustic doppler current profilers different from the vehicle all the variables of the desired path are planned and known in path following control 3 2 elos design in the elos design we aim at deriving the desired heading angle ψ d to guide an underactuated surface vehicle to converge to the desired path in the absence of linear velocity measurement first the following assumption is made assumption 2 lekkas and fossen 2014 liu et al 2017 the desired heading angle can be perfectly tracked in the dynamics layer under assumption 2 eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 x e u cos ψ d χ p ϑ v sin ψ d χ p ϑ χ p ϑ y e u p ϑ y e u sin ψ d χ p ϑ v cos ψ d χ p ϑ χ p ϑ x e for the sake of estimating the surge and sway velocities as mentioned in remark 3 two reduced order extended state observers esos are proposed by using the known position and angles as 5 u ˆ p u k 1 x e p u k 1 u ˆ cos ψ d χ p ϑ v ˆ sin ψ d χ p ϑ χ p ϑ y e u p

k 1 is the observer gain note that these two esos have the same observer gain define the estimation errors of linear velocities as 7 u u ˆ u v v ˆ v and then by combining eqs 5 and 6 the corresponding error dynamics of velocity estimations are 8 u k 1 u cos ψ d χ p ϑ k 1 v sin ψ d χ p ϑ u v k 1 u sin ψ d χ p ϑ k 1 v cos ψ d χ p ϑ v substituting eq 7 into eq 4 yields that 9 x e u ˆ cos ψ d χ p ϑ v ˆ

2 2 h hence the entire elos system composed of eqs 8 and 9 is input to state stable 3 3 afsmc tracking in the tracking stage the afsmc law is resorted to perfectly track the guidance heading angle in eq 10 and the entire control architecture composed of elos and afsmc is shown in fig 2 for this the following motion equations with respect to ψ are considered separately 17 ψ r r f v t 1 m 33 τ r τ r

22598,a novel platform named multi cylinder concrete production storage and offloading system mcpso is proposed for the marginal oilfield development it is constructed by multiple materials including concrete and steel the outer tank is constructed by concrete and the steel is adopted for the internal tank which is used for oil storage and water ballast this design takes the advantages of the structure as well as the materials the suction piles are adopted as the anchor foundation which make the platform easy to install and reuse both structural and hydrodynamic models of mcpso are established by finite element method fem firstly the mesh independence study is performed to ensure the calculation accuracy as the tensile strength of concrete is much lower than that of compressive strength a series of return periods are selected to analyze the tensile stress of the structure then the distributions and extreme value of stress are studied furthermore adjustments of platform parameters are taken to illustrate and study influence factors of high stress distribution results show that there is no obvious interaction between the concrete outer tank and the steel internal tank and the conceptual design of double layer tank ensures that the stress transmission of internal and external tanks is clear according to the structural analysis the wave load may induce increasing tension on the concrete tanks while extension bar as well as waterline shape have influence on the distribution of high tensile stress therefore reasonable adjustments of waterline shape should be taken to reduce the wave force pressure on platform keywords marginal oilfield concrete finite element method wave force numerical analysis 1 introduction energy shortage has been a strategic problem all over the world in the past decades few new large scale onshore oilfields were found in china daqing and shengli oilfield which represent the key oilfields in china have entered the later periods of development in other words the oil production is reducing but the exploitation difficulties and costs are increasing yu et al 2017 in these circumstances more and more attention has been paid to the offshore oilfield however most of the offshore oilfields found in recent years are marginal ones hui et al 2012 the common features of these oilfields are low abundance poor economic performance high cost and difficult development usually marginal oilfields are economically sensitive fields in the range of 5 20 million barrels reserves onolemhemhen et al 2017 therefore a kind of economical well performance and effective exploitation system is required for the development of offshore marginal oilfield fee and john 1986 concrete in water has been successfully applied in concrete gravity structure cgs like the ninian central platform by howard doris and hibernia offshore platform fernandez and lamas pardo 2013 floating production storage and offloading system fpso is one of the most representative facilities for offshore oilfield development it has been widely used in worldwide exploitation and production of offshore oil and gas resources other novel concepts like the paired column semi submersibles and offloading systems using chinese lantern configurations in oilfields have also been recognized in the industry wang et al 2012 odijie et al 2017b amaechi et al 2019 yu and huang 2010 yao et al 2014 wang 2012 wang and wang 2011 among ship shaped fpsos in china single point mooring system especially submerged turret production stp is the first choice in south china sea ji et al 2016 although this outstanding mooring system makes the whole floating system rotate freely with the changing environmental loads tang et al 2016 high cost in production and maintenance becomes the largest issue for them to be widely used in marginal oilfields moreover subsea wellhead production systems or wellhead platform must be built additionally in order to meet the requirement of oil production as there are few equipment for well drilling and completion on fpso from this aspect the traditional fpso becomes an expensive choice for marginal oilfields currently more scholars focus on the improvement of fpso so that the innovations could meet both economy and safety requirement of marginal oilfield development as early as 1995 the semi submersible mono hull floating production unit semo fpu was firstly proposed by haereid haereid and landbo 2000 the system was developed in response to the requirements for more cost efficient field developments in arctic terra nova field later in the twenty first century more new types of fpso have been designed even more some of them have already been built up in 2007 fpso piranema spirit ex sevan piranema the first cylinder fpso was successfully operated in brazil langemyr et al 2010 since then a series of cylindrical fpsos were designed and constructed all over the world aiming at checking structural strength against the abnormal ice actions in the arctic area of north sea huse 2010 established a finite element model for sevan fpso in abaqus and entirely checked this issue based on the innovation of sevan fpso a variety of novel non ship fpsos unlike the cylinder ones were proposed their dynamic performances were studied respectively vijayalakshmi and panneerselvam 2012 carried out a 1 45 scale model test of nonagonal fpso by comparing the numerical and experimental results the damping effect of skirt plate was observed gonçalves et al 2010 proposed a mono column production storage and offloading mpso system with a moonpool in the middle of it according to the model tests conducted by sphaier et al 2007 as well as the results of semi analytical and numerical simulations made by chen et al chen et al 2015 the good hydrodynamic performance of mpso was satisfactory besides there are many other kinds of novel structures proposed including the octagonal fpso spar type fpso iqfp fpso multi tubular fdpso sandglass type fpso etc fan et al 2010 srinivasan 2008 choi et al 2005 wang et al 2013 li et al 2013 gu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 among these creative facilities most of them are designed for deep water and large oilfields but they may not be suitable for marginal oilfields on one hand the marginal oilfields always distribute in the shallow water area which means the mooring system should be re designed if new type of fpsos are adopted on the other hand the expected output rate of marginal oilfields is usually much lower than the investment of these fpsos and their supporting facilities thus a kind of movable platform needs to be designed in order to meet both economic and safety requirements in the present work a novel multi cylinder concrete production storage and offloading system mcpso is proposed for marginal oilfield development the design of concrete structure is carried out in accordance with dnv os c502 offshore concrete structures det norske veritas dnv os c502 2012 while the steel components are based on dnv os c101 design of offshore steel structures general lrfd method det norske veritas 2004 based on this conceptual design a fe model as well as a panel model are established according to the 3d potential theory the hydrodynamic performance is acquired in ansys aqwa by applying the external loads and boundary conditions on the fe model and quasi static structural analysis is carried out by ansys14 5 in several scenarios furthermore the influence of environmental load and internal pressure on the double layer tanks are studied in the following sections the physical problem is described firstly including the design motivation this is followed by the design of concrete mcpso as well as its novelty besides the configuration as well as the physical parameters of mcpso is given afterwards brief descriptions of the numerical models are displayed including the hydrodynamics model and different environmental models then numerical results including wave loads the structural analysis results of system with different load cases are presented besides high stress regions are pointed out and the influence factors of high stress distribution are illustrated as well finally conclusions are drawn 2 problem description as mentioned above most of the marginal oilfields are always standalone from the large oilfield group and only a few facilities can support their productions in the domain of developing oilfields two dominant types of facilities were designed to proceed the crude one way is to storage the oil in large oil tankers e g fpso and transport it with shuttle tankers or oil carriers the other way is to export crude with submarine pipelines directly once it was produced from the field compared with the former method the construction of submarine pipelines faces various difficulties including high investment long construction period and recovery problems etc these shortages of pipeline increase the investment risk for marginal oilfields development thus it is more common to explore those oilfields by classic jacket platforms although it is a better choice than the pipelines other functional platforms should be established simultaneously including production ones storage ones and berthing facilities etc this undoubtedly would increase the cost rapidly and leads to lower benefits for the entire oilfield development when facing the imbalance between the cost and profit it needs some kinds of new type facilities to develop the offshore marginal oilfields from this aspect we propose a novel structure for development of marginal oilfield in this design concrete platform is adopted in order to decrease its cost furthermore suction piles are used as anchor foundation to achieve the reusable and movable functions the objective of our design is to gain good performance of the structure the offshore structures bear complex environmental states especially at the oilfields not only the wave height and wind speed vary all the year round but also the directions of environmental loads are changing with time the common solutions to this issue are divided into two parts one is to increase the strength of the structures such as choosing thicker steel plates or pipes the other way is adopting some unique systems so that the structures can adapt the changing environmental loads e g single point mooring system of fpsos nevertheless both these costly methods are not reasonable for marginal oilfields development in this work we proposed both axisymmetric and central symmetric design which could bear all directional loads similarly another advanced design for the structure is that suction piles are adopted as the anchor foundation most of the storage of marginal oilfields are usually less rich than normal offshore oilfields resulting in the shorter production period of marginal oilfields than that of normal offshore oilfields traditionally the platforms are abandoned after the development is finished for each oilfield which seriously affect the rate of return on investment with the help of suction piles the installation efficiency is improved moreover the easier pulling pile progress makes the entire facility reusable after the fully development of an oilfield the piles are can be freely moved to another workplace when being lift up to improve the economic feature and safety multiple materials are chosen to build up this structure there are mainly three types of concrete mentioned in the standards reinforced concrete pre cast concrete and plain concrete det norske veritas dnv os c502 2012 plain concrete is chosen to build up the outer wall of oil storage tank however concrete sustains compression loads but hardly sustains tension loads in case of occurring tension the structure of the oil storage tank should be strengthened in order to achieve enough pre stress resulting in the increase in both weight and cost what s more the oil storage tank need to bear loads caused by the hyper thermal crude which makes the stress on the structure more complex therefore a double layer structure composited of steel tanks and concrete shell are proposed which overcomes the shortage of plain concrete decrease the investment and simplifies the procedure of establishment as a mobile offshore structure there are different types of loads applying on the novel mcpso including wave loads wind loads gravity loads internal oil and air pressure etc thus it is necessary to analyze the novel structure under the combination of these loads to verify the rationality of the structural design the structural strength under different load cases is analyzed and the influence of different loads on the strength distribution is studied then high pressure regions caused by wave force are found which may lead to a significant degradation of structure strength and fatigue damage the influence of wave force on the high stress distribution are analyzed and the design parameters and the platform form are improved 3 conceptual design of mcpso 3 1 overview of the structure the mcpso is composed of topside module main body and suction pile foundation as shown in fig 1 each component is annotated in fig 2 respectively the topside module is fixed on the concrete main body with deck legs the main body consists of six tanks the tanks are tightly connected into a circular layout which greatly increases the oil storage capacity in addition a moon pool is formed in the center of the tanks it enables the multiple functions of mcpso such as drilling production and setting rov etc the brockets located in tangential position of adjacent tanks are perform as sleeves of the suction pile and the extension bar in the joint position of the sleeve and the main body a certain height of reinforcing bracket is designed among these components extension bars suction piles and internal tanks are made of steel and other parts of the platform are made of plain concrete including floor roof sleeves and cylindrical walls according to the pile sleeve each suction pile extends to the seafloor the mobility function one of the main functions of mcpso is provided by the suction piles in the process of marine wet towing the suction pile foundations are raised and fixed temporarily specifically according to our previous work it is validated that the structure has sufficient stability and robustness when it is being towed zhao et al 2016 when the platform is scheduled to arrive at the installation position the suction bucket foundation penetration is pushed into seabed on the contrary when the mcpso needs to be moved the suction pile foundation is raised again the top of each suction pile is connected with an extension bar fixed on the extension bar sleeve there are two main roles of extension bar on the platform on one hand it transfers the weight to the foundation including the topside module and main body on the other hand it performs guidance function when the suction pile rises as the mcpso is designed for the marginal oilfields where the water depth is shallower than normal offshore oilfields the main dimensions of corresponding platform are designed according to the oil reserves water depth geological conditions and environmental conditions of the marginal oil fields the range of applicable water depths is not yet certain and it needs to be determined through further research 3 2 main dimensions of mcpso in this work a specific marginal oilfield in south china sea is adopted to conduct the following simulations and its water depth is 22 m therefore we choose this water depth to establish our numerical model the main dimensions of mcpso are shown in table 1 the concrete tank height h see fig 2 and table 1 is primarily chosen as 30 m to expand operational area besides it makes the extension bar sleeves and the connecting positions of deck leg and main body far away from the concentrated position of wave load therefore the concrete tank height is larger than the water depth in present model 3 3 novelties and highlights firstly the double layer is chosen to design the tank each separate tank consists of a concrete outer barrier tank and a steel internal tank the ballast tanks are assigned at the top and bottom of the internal tank and the oil storage tank is located at the middle between the ballast tanks as fig 3 shows in order to keep the draft and the displacement of the mcpso during the progresses of loading and offloading the sea water is adopted as the ballast a wedge ring beam is excogitated at the bottom of the concrete tank in order to fix the steel storage tank on the internal roof of the concrete tank all directional deformations except the vertical one of the steel tank are fixed with the sliding contact of the top beam with the innovative design the deformation of the oil tank induced by the high temperature oil could be released and it will reduce the resistance of both tanks in this structure a 0 2 m thick circular gaping space which is filled up with nitrogen is designed between concrete and steel walls because of no contact exists between the walls the transmissions of stress strain and temperature are avoided hereby the load on the interfacial stress are not included in present model nor are the reaction forces due to the bodies of different surfaces secondly compared with the traditional ship typed fpso the mcpso has the function of well drilling and completion in addition due to the optimization of the shape the mcpso has better performance in towing condition on the other hand compared with the steel platform the cost of concrete platform is lower hoogendoorn 2011 the platform is transported to the designated location taking advantage of its great buoyancy after construction in the dock it shortens the engineering production cycle and reduces the investment of offshore oil and gas exploration projects because of the durability of concrete structures the concrete platform can serve multiple locations after completing its tasks in one place the mcpso will be refloated and moved to another service location thirdly the tank hull is made of concrete as the steel tank is unable to withstand external pressure therefore the steel hull of the internal tank is protected effectively by the concrete which has the features of anti buckling anti collision anti corrosion and so on due to the large gravity of concrete the suction pile foundation gravity penetration is effectively completed the large interior space also increases the buoyancy which contribute to refloat the structure and uplift the suction pile foundation finally in order to ensure the underwater weight of structure is invariable in the process of oil loading and offloading equal mass and flow rate replacement process of ballast seawater and crude oil are applied wu 2014 therefore the effect of the weight on vertical load of suction piles is avoided 4 numerical algorithm in view of the novel shape and large scale platform wave force analysis is very essential for hydrodynamic and structural analysis in real sea states wave forces are commonly time varying however at present the wave force can be adequately represented by static equivalent principle for most design water depths api rp 2a wsd therefore static equivalent method is adopted for the structural analysis of mcpso 4 1 hydrodynamic loads large scale offshore structures have significant effects on the wave field in the ocean environment in present study three dimensional potential flow theory is adopted to calculate wave force assuming that the fluid is ideal incompressible and irrotational the velocity potential satisfies the laplace equation the incident wave acting on the body is of small amplitude when compared to its length odijie et al 2017a velocity potential function φ x y z t is defined to describe the fluid flow field that is 1 φ x y z t re ϕ x y z e i ω t where ϕ x y z represents the spatial velocity potential function and ω is the wave angular frequency the mcpso is fixed on the seabed the wave forces acting on the fixed body are composed of incident and diffraction force the former part is also called as froude krylov force hence the total potential induced by unit amplitude incident wave can be written as follow 2 ϕ x y z e i ω t ϕ i ϕ d e i ω t where ϕ i and ϕ d represent the incident and diffraction wave potential respectively the linearized bernoulli s equation is used to calculate the first order wave pressure the various fluid forces may be calculated by integrating the pressure over the wetted surface of the body the fluid forces may be written as 3 f j s ρ φ t n j d s s i ω ρ ϕ i ϕ d n j d s s i ω ρ ϕ i n j d s s i ω ρ ϕ d n j d s j 1 6 where f j is the fluid force per unit wave amplitude in j th direction n j denotes the generalized surface normal for j th direction s represents the wetted surface of the body in equilibrium as mentioned above the two terms in eq 3 say s i ω ρ ϕ i n j d s and s i ω ρ ϕ d n j d s are the incident force and the diffraction force respectively 4 2 numerical model 4 2 1 structural model the structural fe model is established by ansys14 5 the concrete is regarded as a homogeneous elastic body without cracks and simulated by solid65 3d solid element which is mainly composed of hexahedral elements with high analysis accuracy shell63 element is used for steel plate and mainly divided into quadrilateral units mpc184 element is applied to simulate the rigid constraints between the topside and the main body those constraints are used to transfer gravity and wind load of the topside to the main body so that load constraint points are connected to the fe model and the force transfer function is performed meanwhile the mpc algorithm is used to couple the degrees of freedoms dofs between the solid65 and shell63 element to ensure the deformation of the contact surfaces are compatible zhou and gao 2011 according to the actual position of the suction pile the fixed boundary conditions are applied at the bottom of the pile sleeve the details of concrete and steel are listed in table 2 and partial section view of the structural model of mcpso is shown in fig 4 4 2 2 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic parameters are calculated by ansys aqwa while the structural analysis is performed in ansys14 5 taking advantage of double symmetry about the xoz plane and yoz plane a quarter of the hull model is established the numerical model for whole structure is illustrated in fig 5 and the wet surface is discretized into a number of panel elements see the blue panels in fig 5 b to fully investigate the wave load effect on the platform the loads induced by current are not included in the present model the definition of the incident wave heading angle is shown in fig 6 where a plan view of the mcpso is also presented the right handed cartesian coordinate system is adopted and the 0 is pointing along the positive x axis 4 3 environmental loads in real sea state different kinds of environmental loads are applied on the offshore oil storage platform including the hydrostatic pressure gravity acceleration wave load wind load tank liquid load gas phase space pressure etc all these loads are included in present work specifically the tank liquid load and gas phase space pressure are applied in the form of surface pressure the wind load is calculated based on the specification and applied on the gravity center of topside as a steady force api rp 2a wsd as it is important to have a detailed wave load transfer effectively on the wave structure interaction the material contribution of the weight of steel and concrete on the structure is listed in table 3 in the following simulations two different loading conditions full and ballast are defined respectively see table 3 the liquid distribution varies between these two conditions but the total mass of internal liquids including both storage and ballast keeps constant the quasi static analysis of mcpso is investigated for extreme conditions since the structure must be able to survive under the 100 year return period yr storm conditions table 4 lists the wave conditions of different return periods adopted for this study 4 4 mesh independence study mesh independence study was performed to increase the accuracy of wave force results to validate the effectiveness of mesh density and tolerance different element sizes were selected for model 1 to 3 fig 5 shows the model 1 with element size 1 5 m furthermore a special model 4 was also established in this model different mesh sizes were adopted in different positions in order to acquire the most regular mesh grids details could be found in table 5 including the number of nodes elements and the maximum wave force the result shows that with the increase of element size the number of nodes and elements decrease significantly which means to save more calculating time with the model of less nodes and elements however the change of the maximum wave force is less than 2 1 among these models hence model 4 is chosen in the following simulations 4 5 wave force the wave forces of six dofs are essential for further structural analysis based on 3 d potential theory the wave force transfer functions are calculated in following steps firstly both first order incident and diffraction wave potentials of mcpso are calculated under regular wave conditions qi and huangliang 2018 according to the node information of hydrodynamic model the wave forces is integrated on each elements in aqwa line then these forces are converted to pressure and acceleration by aqwa wave zhou and gao 2011 finally these forces are applied to structural models in forms of pressure and acceleration considering the symmetric shape of platform seven wave heading directions range from 0 to 90 are adopted at 15 degree intervals the wave load transfer functions of each dof are presented in fig 7 according to fig 7 a b d and e it can be seen that the wave loads of surge along x axis sway along y axis roll about x axis and pitch about y axis are sensitive to wave heading the heave forces along z axis and yaw moments about z axis are mainly not sensitive to wave headings specifically there exists some interesting phenomena for the yaw moments as shown in fig 7 f on one hand when incident wave headings are along the symmetry axis say 0 30 60 and 90 of the platform the yaw moments almost keep as small constants on the other hand when incident wave headings are 15 45 and 75 the structure is asymmetric about the axis of incident wave the yaw moments about z axis are also small constants at low frequency but amplify sharply with the frequency increasing furthermore the wave load transfer function of resultant force in horizontal plane is displayed in fig 8 according to the result we find an interesting phenomenon that the curve agrees with each other when the wave frequency is lower than 1 0 rad s that is to say in these wave conditions which have covered most of the common sea states the horizontal wave load of mcpso is not sensitive to the incident wave direction in fact the reason is that wave length is larger than the structure diameter at low frequency and the difference of the waterline shape with direction has little effect on the wave load however when the wave frequency is higher than 1 0 rad s the wave load was influenced noticeably by incident wave direction as shown in fig 8 a and table 6 they could be majorly divided into three groups which are 0 and 60 group a 15 45 and 75 group b 30 and 90 group c shown in fig 8 b due to the symmetry the different incident wave directions actually generate same horizontal wave force on the structure according to rotating a specific angle 5 results and discussion 5 1 results of structural analysis according to the hydrodynamic analysis results above four different cases see table 7 are defined to perform the structural strength simulations in this section the 100 yr sea state and two incident wave directions say 0 and 90 are chosen as the design sea conditions 5 1 1 results of different load cases the results of the tensile stress at different positions of the concrete tank are shown in fig 9 the extreme value of the principal stress in different positions of the main structure are recorded and showed in fig 10 the positive value of the y axis represents the tensile stress and the negative value represents the compressive stress the stress extremes of the lc1 and lc3 are identical and the stress extremes of the lc2 and lc4 are coincident approximately it is indicated that the principal stress of the concrete structure is related to the wave direction while not affected by the variation of the liquid load of the internal tank the von mises stress of oil tank in different load cases are extracted out and drawn in fig 11 it is obvious that the stress of lc1 is coincided with that of lc2 and the stress of lc3 and lc4 are also identical the results show that the stress distribution is mainly affected by the liquid load of the internal tank and independent to the wave force the study demonstrates that inner steel tank and external concrete tank are isolated and there is no direct stress transmission between them the path of the stress transmission is clear demonstrating the superiority of the structure and the materials 5 1 2 wave direction and height effect it is obvious that the wave energy is mainly concentrated around the waterline and the tensile stress on the concrete wall near this region is the largest therefore the node located near the waterline is studied and the effects of wave height period and wave direction on the structural strength are researched the nodal stresses near the waterline are chosen to be analyzed in the following parts because of the higher level of wave loads shown in fig 9 two major high stress areas are observed as shown in fig 12 to distinguish the area where azimuth is about 0 is named as region a while the other area which is located in 60 is called region b the tensile stress of all nodes in those regions under the 100 yr sea state is shown in fig 13 a and b according to the results two nodes node 1 and node 2 where the highest stress is detected are further chosen to be analyzed under all cases in fig 13 c we find that the highest tensile stress of node 1 remains at a high level and does not change significantly when the incident wave direction is in the range from 0 to 60 however the amplitude reduces while the wave direction keeps increasing to 90 on the other hand from fig 13 d we see that the tensile stress of node 2 in the region b remains at a high level when the incident wave is between 0 and 90 it is caused by the fact that node 2 is facing the incident wave among those cases besides there exists another interesting phenomenon that periodicity is observed specifically when the incident wave direction is 60 the tensile stresses of node 2 in all cases are almost same as those of node 1 in 0 degree incident direction similar issues are found in all scenarios when the phase difference of incident direction is 60 the answer lies in the symmetric layout of the concrete tanks this further demonstrates that the structure is not sensitive to the environmental direction from this aspect 0 degree and 90 degree incident waves are chosen in the following analysis similarly the results of compressive stress in both regions are shown in fig 14 a and b two nodes node 3 and node 4 with high compressive stress are analyzed under all cases as shown in fig 14 c and d results show that the trend of the compressive stress of node 3 is opposite to that of the tensile stress of node 1 compressive stress of node 3 remains at a low level and does not change significantly when the incident wave direction is in the range from 0 to 60 however the amplitude increase while the wave direction keeps increasing to 90 the reason for the phenomenon is that node 3 is shifting away from the incident wave among those cases the stress of node 4 where two tanks are tangent is almost invariable when the incident wave is between 0 and 90 it shows that the compressive stress of node 4 is less affected by the wave direction this result is determined by the special position of node 4 compared to the tensile stress the compressive stress is lower in region a and region b this is indicated that the structure is mainly subjected to tensile stress at wave ward side as the tensile strength of concrete is much lower than its compressive strength it is necessary to ensure that the structure meets the requirement of the design progress therefore the tensile stress of node 1 is studied under different sea states results show that the tensile stress increases with the rise of wave height therefore wave force analysis is the key issue to evaluate the tensile stress strength of the high stress zone of the concrete 5 2 analysis of high stress zone in this subsection the wave pressure distribution of mcpso in regular waves and the influence of different factors on this distribution are studied then the main factors affecting wave pressure distribution are evaluated to improve the design dimension and the form of mcpso 5 2 1 wave pressures of initial design the analysis results of the initial design are taken as the basis for further analysis the wave pressure contours distributed on the mcpso are given in fig 15 the frequencies of incident wave range from 0 3 rad s to 0 6 rad s while the incident direction is 0 and the phase is a quarter of wave period according to the results the pressure on the structure varies with the incident wave frequencies when the incident wave frequency is 0 3 rad s the maximum wave pressure is distributed in the outside transition region of two adjacent tanks when the frequency is 0 4 rad s the maximum wave pressure is distributed in about 180 direction which is the internal transition region of two adjacent tanks when the frequency is 0 5 rad s the maximum wave pressure is distributed in four outside transition regions when the frequency is 0 6 rad s the maximum wave pressure is distributed in two outside transition regions all in all the platform always keeps a relatively high level in the transition region of two adjacent tanks therefore the main factors affecting wave pressure distribution of the transition region are studied in the following analysis to improve the form and the wave pressure distribution of mcpso specifically there exists an interesting phenomenon when the wave frequency is 0 4 rad s that is the maximum wave elevation is much larger than other cases see fig 14 b indeed this freak elevation is caused by the moonpool between the tanks according to previous research guo et al 2017 sanchez mondragon et al 2017 the fluid motion in the moonpool could be divided into two types horizontal sloshing and vertical piston motion for mcpso the 0 4 rad s incident wave excites the vertical piston motion in the moonpool see fig 16 5 2 2 effects of extension bar on wave pressures since the extension bar and the transition region between the adjacent tanks are relatively close to each other the shadowing effect of the extension bar on the transition region is taken into account the influence of the extension bar on the wave elevation and the wave pressure distribution on the surface is studied in order to explore the effects of extension bar two distinct arrangements were considered which are the numerical model with and without extension bar respectively in the following simulations 0 6 rad s is chosen as the incident wave frequency and the wave phase is also a quarter of wave cycle t 4 the wave is assumed to inflow along the x axis fig 17 shows the wave elevation contours around the platform both incident and diffracted wave loads are taken into account in fig 17 the upper part shows the contours of the initial model which is with extension bars while the bottom half shows the results of the structure without extension bars results show that the maximum wave elevations always occur around the adjacent region of two tanks but the wave elevation of this region does not vary significantly with removing extension bar according to the transfer functions of wave loads in surge heave pitch and yaw shown in fig 18 it is seen that extension bar will affect the wave loads in each dof case by case in fig 18 a the surge wave force decreased little between these two cases similar phenomenon occurred in heave except the incident wave condition when the wave frequency is of 0 4 rad s see fig 18 b we believe that this slight increment is also caused by the resonance in moonpool which is clarified in previous section 5 2 1 for the pitch moment in fig 18 c the effect of extension bar is changing with the wave frequency on one hand the wave load decreased by removing the bar when the wave frequency is less than 0 7 rad s on the other hand when the high frequency wave is adopted adding the extension bars could reduce the pitch wave moment due to the zero yaw moment when the incident wave is at 0 hence the results of 15 are shown in fig 18 d it shows that the yaw moment of the model with extension bar increases significantly in the high frequency range 5 2 3 effects of transition shape according to the changing value of r1 and r2 see fig 6 which represents the shape of the transition region between the adjacent tanks the influence of waterline shape of mcpso on wave elevation and wave pressure distribution are investigated fig 19 presents the wave elevation on the optimized shapes bottom half compared to the initial ones upper half it shows that a significant change is applied in the region nearby transition position the wave elevation near the platform is reduced to some extent compared with the original platform the variation of wave force with the water line shape is analyzed shown in fig 20 the same sea state in section 5 2 2 is also adopted in these simulations according to fig 20 a and fig 20 c the results show that the surge and pitch loads are not sensitive to r1 but both of them reduce when r2 increases specifically sharp reductions occur when r2 is increased from 1 m to 2 m hence the radius of outside transition arc r2 is confirmed to be the controlling parameter for these loads besides the heave wave force along z axis see fig 20 b has a significant decline while r1 increases from 1 m to 2 m however as r1 continues to increase the load reduces step by step therefore according to the result it is seen that the heave wave force is more sensitive to r1 fig 20 d shows that the yaw moment about z axis is irrelevant to r1 with the increasing r1 the amplitude increases rapidly and then becomes even but the difference between these cases is less than 3 therefore the water line shape effect on yaw moment is relatively little according to the above simulation 2 m and 3 m are chosen as the optimized values of r1 and r2 respectively with these parameters the optimization procedure achieves the goal that the surge heave and pitch wave loads reduce 1 8 72 5 and 36 7 therefore the waterline shape has a significant influence on the wave pressure and wave elevation a reasonable value of r1 and r2 will reduce the wave force obviously 6 conclusions a novel offshore structure mcpso has been proposed for the development of marginal oilfields the layout of the main body is circumstantially described as well as the original double layer concrete steel oil tank fe model is established to investigate the hydrodynamic loads under different incident waves both effects of wave load and internal tank storage load are included in the numerical model a series of numerical analyses have been performed aiming at the reduction of the partial wave pressure both effects of extension bar and waterline shape on the partial wave pressure of structure are studied based on the present conceptual design mcpso takes both advantages of plain concrete and steel due to the mobility of bucket foundations both removable and reusable functions are realized additionally the suction piles could simplify the installation and adjustment progress of the offshore oil and gas production facility after it is towed to the oilfield the structural quasi static analysis shows that the strength of a concrete structure is affected by wave load and independent to the internal tank load on the contrary the von mises stress of the internal steel tank is mainly related to the storage load but has slight changes with the external wave force this phenomenon indicates that internal tank and concrete external tank are mutually separated and there are little direct stress transmissions between them besides it is seen that the path of stress transmission is clear therefore as demonstrated above the superiority of the structure and the materials are realized on the mcpso the relationship between the wave direction and the tensile stress of the structure is studied the results show that the wave direction has a certain influence on the tensile stress on the structure according to the investigations between tensile stress and wave height the results show that the extreme value of tensile stress near the waterline location is linear with the wave height increasing with wave height wave force analysis results show that the wave pressure always keeps a relatively high level in the transition region of adjacent tanks but it is not sensitive to wave headings the translation wave forces along x y and z axes achieve the maximum value when the frequency of incident wave is approximately 0 4 rad s the rotation wave forces about x and y axes achieve the maximum value when the frequency of incident wave is 0 3 rad s or so wave loads in different direction of the incident wave can be obtained by calculation wave pressure always keeps a relatively high level in the transition region of two adjacent tanks due to the closer distance between the extension bar and the transition region of two adjacent tanks the shadowing effect of the extension bar is taken into account results indicate that the wave elevation of the region behind the extension bar does not vary significantly the extension bar has little effect on the translational wave forces but has a greater influence on the rotational wave forces the most obvious reason for this phenomenon is that the extension bar is much smaller than the structure but the position of the extension bar is far away from the center of gravity which makes it more influential to the rotational load which is in good agreement with definition of rotating load the influence of the water surface shape on pressure and wave forces are analyzed through a series of numerical analyses results show that the wave forces along x axis about y axis and about z axis are sensitive to outside transition arc radius r2 but not to the internal transition arc radius r1 the wave forces along y axis are relevant to r1 but not sensitive to r2 therefore the waterline shape has a significant influence on wave pressure and wave elevation a reasonable value of r1 and r2 will reduce the wave force obviously it must be admitted that the viscous damping effect is not included in the potential theory which is assumed that the fluid is ideal hence the resonant vertical piston motion might be over evaluated in the following work we would adopt experimental study and cfd algorithm to further study on this phenomenon yang and kwon 2013 moreover in present work wave load transfer is obtained in regular wave cases based on three dimensional theory to simulate wave load performance in irregular wave more accurately we could adopt experimental study or cfd approach on the wave load transfer analysis in the following work gatin et al 2019 lee et al 2019 in reality the vortex induced vibration response of extension bar might result in structural failure due to fatigue damage accumulation xu et al 2018 we would adopt the cfd algorithm to further study on this phenomenon another potential issue is that vibration due to vortex from the two layered wall of outer concrete and inner steel is not included which may affect the strength of the tank to accurately simulate the vibration effect cfd algorithm and model test method may be necessary in the further like other investigation on paired column semi submersible offshore platform or spar type fowt kim et al 2018 duan et al 2016 it is necessary to point out that in the current work the plain concrete is applied to design and establish present mcpso model structures including floor roof cylindrical walls and sleeves in the following works we would adopt reinforce concrete rc to the structure however as behavior of steel plates in contact with concrete is more diverse than separate steel and concrete structures and the frictional effect between concrete and steel should be further evaluated for rc structures travush et al 2016 khabaz 2017 moreover based on the studies on concrete in offshore environment corrosion has always been an issue for rc structures the corrosion of reinforce leads to deterioration and damage in the concrete gao et al 2019 future investigations about the corrosion effect are required ouzaa and oucif 2019 in the following work proper reinforcement component will be arranged in the gap space to strengthen the inner tank besides the multi physics of the double walls of the concrete and the steel will be taken into consider by experimental method and finite element model in the future gatin et al 2019 nguyen et al 2019 especially when the structure is to be moved to another location the simulation of strength in the steel concrete contact zone may be necessary acknowledgments the authors would also like to show their sincere acknowledgements to the ministry of industry and information technology

22598,a novel platform named multi cylinder concrete production storage and offloading system mcpso is proposed for the marginal oilfield development it is constructed by multiple materials including concrete and steel the outer tank is constructed by concrete and the steel is adopted for the internal tank which is used for oil storage and water ballast this design takes the advantages of the structure as well as the materials the suction piles are adopted as the anchor foundation which make the platform easy to install and reuse both structural and hydrodynamic models of mcpso are established by finite element method fem firstly the mesh independence study is performed to ensure the calculation accuracy as the tensile strength of concrete is much lower than that of compressive strength a series of return periods are selected to analyze the tensile stress of the structure then the distributions and extreme value of stress are studied furthermore adjustments of platform parameters are taken to illustrate and study influence factors of high stress distribution results show that there is no obvious interaction between the concrete outer tank and the steel internal tank and the conceptual design of double layer tank ensures that the stress transmission of internal and external tanks is clear according to the structural analysis the wave load may induce increasing tension on the concrete tanks while extension bar as well as waterline shape have influence on the distribution of high tensile stress therefore reasonable adjustments of waterline shape should be taken to reduce the wave force pressure on platform keywords marginal oilfield concrete finite element method wave force numerical analysis 1 introduction energy shortage has been a strategic problem all over the world in the past decades few new large scale onshore oilfields were found in china daqing and shengli oilfield which represent the key oilfields in china have entered the later periods of development in other words the oil production is reducing but the exploitation difficulties and costs are increasing yu et al 2017 in these circumstances more and more attention has been paid to the offshore oilfield however most of the offshore oilfields found in recent years are marginal ones hui et al 2012 the common features of these oilfields are low abundance poor economic performance high cost and difficult development usually marginal oilfields are economically sensitive fields in the range of 5 20 million barrels reserves onolemhemhen et al 2017 therefore a kind of economical well performance and effective exploitation system is required for the development of offshore marginal oilfield fee and john 1986 concrete in water has been successfully applied in concrete gravity structure cgs like the ninian central platform by howard doris and hibernia offshore platform fernandez and lamas pardo 2013 floating production storage and offloading system fpso is one of the most representative facilities for offshore oilfield development it has been widely used in worldwide exploitation and production of offshore oil and gas resources other novel concepts like the paired column semi submersibles and offloading systems using chinese lantern configurations in oilfields have also been recognized in the industry wang et al 2012 odijie et al 2017b amaechi et al 2019 yu and huang 2010 yao et al 2014 wang 2012 wang and wang 2011 among ship shaped fpsos in china single point mooring system especially submerged turret production stp is the first choice in south china sea ji et al 2016 although this outstanding mooring system makes the whole floating system rotate freely with the changing environmental loads tang et al 2016 high cost in production and maintenance becomes the largest issue for them to be widely used in marginal oilfields moreover subsea wellhead production systems or wellhead platform must be built additionally in order to meet the requirement of oil production as there are few equipment for well drilling and completion on fpso from this aspect the traditional fpso becomes an expensive choice for marginal oilfields currently more scholars focus on the improvement of fpso so that the innovations could meet both economy and safety requirement of marginal oilfield development as early as 1995 the semi submersible mono hull floating production unit semo fpu was firstly proposed by haereid haereid and landbo 2000 the system was developed in response to the requirements for more cost efficient field developments in arctic terra nova field later in the twenty first century more new types of fpso have been designed even more some of them have already been built up in 2007 fpso piranema spirit ex sevan piranema the first cylinder fpso was successfully operated in brazil langemyr et al 2010 since then a series of cylindrical fpsos were designed and constructed all over the world aiming at checking structural strength against the abnormal ice actions in the arctic area of north sea huse 2010 established a finite element model for sevan fpso in abaqus and entirely checked this issue based on the innovation of sevan fpso a variety of novel non ship fpsos unlike the cylinder ones were proposed their dynamic performances were studied respectively vijayalakshmi and panneerselvam 2012 carried out a 1 45 scale model test of nonagonal fpso by comparing the numerical and experimental results the damping effect of skirt plate was observed gonçalves et al 2010 proposed a mono column production storage and offloading mpso system with a moonpool in the middle of it according to the model tests conducted by sphaier et al 2007 as well as the results of semi analytical and numerical simulations made by chen et al chen et al 2015 the good hydrodynamic performance of mpso was satisfactory besides there are many other kinds of novel structures proposed including the octagonal fpso spar type fpso iqfp fpso multi tubular fdpso sandglass type fpso etc fan et al 2010 srinivasan 2008 choi et al 2005 wang et al 2013 li et al 2013 gu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 among these creative facilities most of them are designed for deep water and large oilfields but they may not be suitable for marginal oilfields on one hand the marginal oilfields always distribute in the shallow water area which means the mooring system should be re designed if new type of fpsos are adopted on the other hand the expected output rate of marginal oilfields is usually much lower than the investment of these fpsos and their supporting facilities thus a kind of movable platform needs to be designed in order to meet both economic and safety requirements in the present work a novel multi cylinder concrete production storage and offloading system mcpso is proposed for marginal oilfield development the design of concrete structure is carried out in accordance with dnv os c502 offshore concrete structures det norske veritas dnv os c502 2012 while the steel components are based on dnv os c101 design of offshore steel structures general lrfd method det norske veritas 2004 based on this conceptual design a fe model as well as a panel model are established according to the 3d potential theory the hydrodynamic performance is acquired in ansys aqwa by applying the external loads and boundary conditions on the fe model and quasi static structural analysis is carried out by ansys14 5 in several scenarios furthermore the influence of environmental load and internal pressure on the double layer tanks are studied in the following sections the physical problem is described firstly including the design motivation this is followed by the design of concrete mcpso as well as its novelty besides the configuration as well as the physical parameters of mcpso is given afterwards brief descriptions of the numerical models are displayed including the hydrodynamics model and different environmental models then numerical results including wave loads the structural analysis results of system with different load cases are presented besides high stress regions are pointed out and the influence factors of high stress distribution are illustrated as well finally conclusions are drawn 2 problem description as mentioned above most of the marginal oilfields are always standalone from the large oilfield group and only a few facilities can support their productions in the domain of developing oilfields two dominant types of facilities were designed to proceed the crude one way is to storage the oil in large oil tankers e g fpso and transport it with shuttle tankers or oil carriers the other way is to export crude with submarine pipelines directly once it was produced from the field compared with the former method the construction of submarine pipelines faces various difficulties including high investment long construction period and recovery problems etc these shortages of pipeline increase the investment risk for marginal oilfields development thus it is more common to explore those oilfields by classic jacket platforms although it is a better choice than the pipelines other functional platforms should be established simultaneously including production ones storage ones and berthing facilities etc this undoubtedly would increase the cost rapidly and leads to lower benefits for the entire oilfield development when facing the imbalance between the cost and profit it needs some kinds of new type facilities to develop the offshore marginal oilfields from this aspect we propose a novel structure for development of marginal oilfield in this design concrete platform is adopted in order to decrease its cost furthermore suction piles are used as anchor foundation to achieve the reusable and movable functions the objective of our design is to gain good performance of the structure the offshore structures bear complex environmental states especially at the oilfields not only the wave height and wind speed vary all the year round but also the directions of environmental loads are changing with time the common solutions to this issue are divided into two parts one is to increase the strength of the structures such as choosing thicker steel plates or pipes the other way is adopting some unique systems so that the structures can adapt the changing environmental loads e g single point mooring system of fpsos nevertheless both these costly methods are not reasonable for marginal oilfields development in this work we proposed both axisymmetric and central symmetric design which could bear all directional loads similarly another advanced design for the structure is that suction piles are adopted as the anchor foundation most of the storage of marginal oilfields are usually less rich than normal offshore oilfields resulting in the shorter production period of marginal oilfields than that of normal offshore oilfields traditionally the platforms are abandoned after the development is finished for each oilfield which seriously affect the rate of return on investment with the help of suction piles the installation efficiency is improved moreover the easier pulling pile progress makes the entire facility reusable after the fully development of an oilfield the piles are can be freely moved to another workplace when being lift up to improve the economic feature and safety multiple materials are chosen to build up this structure there are mainly three types of concrete mentioned in the standards reinforced concrete pre cast concrete and plain concrete det norske veritas dnv os c502 2012 plain concrete is chosen to build up the outer wall of oil storage tank however concrete sustains compression loads but hardly sustains tension loads in case of occurring tension the structure of the oil storage tank should be strengthened in order to achieve enough pre stress resulting in the increase in both weight and cost what s more the oil storage tank need to bear loads caused by the hyper thermal crude which makes the stress on the structure more complex therefore a double layer structure composited of steel tanks and concrete shell are proposed which overcomes the shortage of plain concrete decrease the investment and simplifies the procedure of establishment as a mobile offshore structure there are different types of loads applying on the novel mcpso including wave loads wind loads gravity loads internal oil and air pressure etc thus it is necessary to analyze the novel structure under the combination of these loads to verify the rationality of the structural design the structural strength under different load cases is analyzed and the influence of different loads on the strength distribution is studied then high pressure regions caused by wave force are found which may lead to a significant degradation of structure strength and fatigue damage the influence of wave force on the high stress distribution are analyzed and the design parameters and the platform form are improved 3 conceptual design of mcpso 3 1 overview of the structure the mcpso is composed of topside module main body and suction pile foundation as shown in fig 1 each component is annotated in fig 2 respectively the topside module is fixed on the concrete main body with deck legs the main body consists of six tanks the tanks are tightly connected into a circular layout which greatly increases the oil storage capacity in addition a moon pool is formed in the center of the tanks it enables the multiple functions of mcpso such as drilling production and setting rov etc the brockets located in tangential position of adjacent tanks are perform as sleeves of the suction pile and the extension bar in the joint position of the sleeve and the main body a certain height of reinforcing bracket is designed among these components extension bars suction piles and internal tanks are made of steel and other parts of the platform are made of plain concrete including floor roof sleeves and cylindrical walls according to the pile sleeve each suction pile extends to the seafloor the mobility function one of the main functions of mcpso is provided by the suction piles in the process of marine wet towing the suction pile foundations are raised and fixed temporarily specifically according to our previous work it is validated that the structure has sufficient stability and robustness when it is being towed zhao et al 2016 when the platform is scheduled to arrive at the installation position the suction bucket foundation penetration is pushed into seabed on the contrary when the mcpso needs to be moved the suction pile foundation is raised again the top of each suction pile is connected with an extension bar fixed on the extension bar sleeve there are two main roles of extension bar on the platform on one hand it transfers the weight to the foundation including the topside module and main body on the other hand it performs guidance function when the suction pile rises as the mcpso is designed for the marginal oilfields where the water depth is shallower than normal offshore oilfields the main dimensions of corresponding platform are designed according to the oil reserves water depth geological conditions and environmental conditions of the marginal oil fields the range of applicable water depths is not yet certain and it needs to be determined through further research 3 2 main dimensions of mcpso in this work a specific marginal oilfield in south china sea is adopted to conduct the following simulations and its water depth is 22 m therefore we choose this water depth to establish our numerical model the main dimensions of mcpso are shown in table 1 the concrete tank height h see fig 2 and table 1 is primarily chosen as 30 m to expand operational area besides it makes the extension bar sleeves and the connecting positions of deck leg and main body far away from the concentrated position of wave load therefore the concrete tank height is larger than the water depth in present model 3 3 novelties and highlights firstly the double layer is chosen to design the tank each separate tank consists of a concrete outer barrier tank and a steel internal tank the ballast tanks are assigned at the top and bottom of the internal tank and the oil storage tank is located at the middle between the ballast tanks as fig 3 shows in order to keep the draft and the displacement of the mcpso during the progresses of loading and offloading the sea water is adopted as the ballast a wedge ring beam is excogitated at the bottom of the concrete tank in order to fix the steel storage tank on the internal roof of the concrete tank all directional deformations except the vertical one of the steel tank are fixed with the sliding contact of the top beam with the innovative design the deformation of the oil tank induced by the high temperature oil could be released and it will reduce the resistance of both tanks in this structure a 0 2 m thick circular gaping space which is filled up with nitrogen is designed between concrete and steel walls because of no contact exists between the walls the transmissions of stress strain and temperature are avoided hereby the load on the interfacial stress are not included in present model nor are the reaction forces due to the bodies of different surfaces secondly compared with the traditional ship typed fpso the mcpso has the function of well drilling and completion in addition due to the optimization of the shape the mcpso has better performance in towing condition on the other hand compared with the steel platform the cost of concrete platform is lower hoogendoorn 2011 the platform is transported to the designated location taking advantage of its great buoyancy after construction in the dock it shortens the engineering production cycle and reduces the investment of offshore oil and gas exploration projects because of the durability of concrete structures the concrete platform can serve multiple locations after completing its tasks in one place the mcpso will be refloated and moved to another service location thirdly the tank hull is made of concrete as the steel tank is unable to withstand external pressure therefore the steel hull of the internal tank is protected effectively by the concrete which has the features of anti buckling anti collision anti corrosion and so on due to the large gravity of concrete the suction pile foundation gravity penetration is effectively completed the large interior space also increases the buoyancy which contribute to refloat the structure and uplift the suction pile foundation finally in order to ensure the underwater weight of structure is invariable in the process of oil loading and offloading equal mass and flow rate replacement process of ballast seawater and crude oil are applied wu 2014 therefore the effect of the weight on vertical load of suction piles is avoided 4 numerical algorithm in view of the novel shape and large scale platform wave force analysis is very essential for hydrodynamic and structural analysis in real sea states wave forces are commonly time varying however at present the wave force can be adequately represented by static equivalent principle for most design water depths api rp 2a wsd therefore static equivalent method is adopted for the structural analysis of mcpso 4 1 hydrodynamic loads large scale offshore structures have significant effects on the wave field in the ocean environment in present study three dimensional potential flow theory is adopted to calculate wave force assuming that the fluid is ideal incompressible and irrotational the velocity potential satisfies the laplace equation the incident wave acting on the body is of small amplitude when compared to its length odijie et al 2017a velocity potential function φ x y z t is defined to describe the fluid flow field that is 1 φ x y z t re ϕ x y z e i ω t where ϕ x y z represents the spatial velocity potential function and ω is the wave angular frequency the mcpso is fixed on the seabed the wave forces acting on the fixed body are composed of incident and diffraction force the former part is also called as froude krylov force hence the total potential induced by unit amplitude incident wave can be written as follow 2 ϕ x y z e i ω t ϕ i ϕ d e i ω t where ϕ i and ϕ d represent the incident and diffraction wave potential respectively the linearized bernoulli s equation is used to calculate the first order wave pressure the various fluid forces may be calculated by integrating the pressure over the wetted surface of the body the fluid forces may be written as 3 f j s ρ φ t n j d s s i ω ρ ϕ i ϕ d n j d s s i ω ρ ϕ i n j d s s i ω ρ ϕ d n j d s j 1 6 where f j is the fluid force per unit wave amplitude in j th direction n j denotes the generalized surface normal for j th direction s represents the wetted surface of the body in equilibrium as mentioned above the two terms in eq 3 say s i ω ρ ϕ i n j d s and s i ω ρ ϕ d n j d s are the incident force and the diffraction force respectively 4 2 numerical model 4 2 1 structural model the structural fe model is established by ansys14 5 the concrete is regarded as a homogeneous elastic body without cracks and simulated by solid65 3d solid element which is mainly composed of hexahedral elements with high analysis accuracy shell63 element is used for steel plate and mainly divided into quadrilateral units mpc184 element is applied to simulate the rigid constraints between the topside and the main body those constraints are used to transfer gravity and wind load of the topside to the main body so that load constraint points are connected to the fe model and the force transfer function is performed meanwhile the mpc algorithm is used to couple the degrees of freedoms dofs between the solid65 and shell63 element to ensure the deformation of the contact surfaces are compatible zhou and gao 2011 according to the actual position of the suction pile the fixed boundary conditions are applied at the bottom of the pile sleeve the details of concrete and steel are listed in table 2 and partial section view of the structural model of mcpso is shown in fig 4 4 2 2 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic parameters are calculated by ansys aqwa while the structural analysis is performed in ansys14 5 taking advantage of double symmetry about the xoz plane and yoz plane a quarter of the hull model is established the numerical model for whole structure is illustrated in fig 5 and the wet surface is discretized into a number of panel elements see the blue panels in fig 5 b to fully investigate the wave load effect on the platform the loads induced by current are not included in the present model the definition of the incident wave heading angle is shown in fig 6 where a plan view of the mcpso is also presented the right handed cartesian coordinate system is adopted and the 0 is pointing along the positive x axis 4 3 environmental loads in real sea state different kinds of environmental loads are applied on the offshore oil storage platform including the hydrostatic pressure gravity acceleration wave load wind load tank liquid load gas phase space pressure etc all these loads are included in present work specifically the tank liquid load and gas phase space pressure are applied in the form of surface pressure the wind load is calculated based on the specification and applied on the gravity center of topside as a steady force api rp 2a wsd as it is important to have a detailed wave load transfer effectively on the wave structure interaction the material contribution of the weight of steel and concrete on the structure is listed in table 3 in the following simulations two different loading conditions full and ballast are defined respectively see table 3 the liquid distribution varies between these two conditions but the total mass of internal liquids including both storage and ballast keeps constant the quasi static analysis of mcpso is investigated for extreme conditions since the structure must be able to survive under the 100 year return period yr storm conditions table 4 lists the wave conditions of different return periods adopted for this study 4 4 mesh independence study mesh independence study was performed to increase the accuracy of wave force results to validate the effectiveness of mesh density and tolerance different element sizes were selected for model 1 to 3 fig 5 shows the model 1 with element size 1 5 m furthermore a special model 4 was also established in this model different mesh sizes were adopted in different positions in order to acquire the most regular mesh grids details could be found in table 5 including the number of nodes elements and the maximum wave force the result shows that with the increase of element size the number of nodes and elements decrease significantly which means to save more calculating time with the model of less nodes and elements however the change of the maximum wave force is less than 2 1 among these models hence model 4 is chosen in the following simulations 4 5 wave force the wave forces of six dofs are essential for further structural analysis based on 3 d potential theory the wave force transfer functions are calculated in following steps firstly both first order incident and diffraction wave potentials of mcpso are calculated under regular wave conditions qi and huangliang 2018 according to the node information of hydrodynamic model the wave forces is integrated on each elements in aqwa line then these forces are converted to pressure and acceleration by aqwa wave zhou and gao 2011 finally these forces are applied to structural models in forms of pressure and acceleration considering the symmetric shape of platform seven wave heading directions range from 0 to 90 are adopted at 15 degree intervals the wave load transfer functions of each dof are presented in fig 7 according to fig 7 a b d and e it can be seen that the wave loads of surge along x axis sway along y axis roll about x axis and pitch about y axis are sensitive to wave heading the heave forces along z axis and yaw moments about z axis are mainly not sensitive to wave headings specifically there exists some interesting phenomena for the yaw moments as shown in fig 7 f on one hand when incident wave headings are along the symmetry axis say 0 30 60 and 90 of the platform the yaw moments almost keep as small constants on the other hand when incident wave headings are 15 45 and 75 the structure is asymmetric about the axis of incident wave the yaw moments about z axis are also small constants at low frequency but amplify sharply with the frequency increasing furthermore the wave load transfer function of resultant force in horizontal plane is displayed in fig 8 according to the result we find an interesting phenomenon that the curve agrees with each other when the wave frequency is lower than 1 0 rad s that is to say in these wave conditions which have covered most of the common sea states the horizontal wave load of mcpso is not sensitive to the incident wave direction in fact the reason is that wave length is larger than the structure diameter at low frequency and the difference of the waterline shape with direction has little effect on the wave load however when the wave frequency is higher than 1 0 rad s the wave load was influenced noticeably by incident wave direction as shown in fig 8 a and table 6 they could be majorly divided into three groups which are 0 and 60 group a 15 45 and 75 group b 30 and 90 group c shown in fig 8 b due to the symmetry the different incident wave directions actually generate same horizontal wave force on the structure according to rotating a specific angle 5 results and discussion 5 1 results of structural analysis according to the hydrodynamic analysis results above four different cases see table 7 are defined to perform the structural strength simulations in this section the 100 yr sea state and two incident wave directions say 0 and 90 are chosen as the design sea conditions 5 1 1 results of different load cases the results of the tensile stress at different positions of the concrete tank are shown in fig 9 the extreme value of the principal stress in different positions of the main structure are recorded and showed in fig 10 the positive value of the y axis represents the tensile stress and the negative value represents the compressive stress the stress extremes of the lc1 and lc3 are identical and the stress extremes of the lc2 and lc4 are coincident approximately it is indicated that the principal stress of the concrete structure is related to the wave direction while not affected by the variation of the liquid load of the internal tank the von mises stress of oil tank in different load cases are extracted out and drawn in fig 11 it is obvious that the stress of lc1 is coincided with that of lc2 and the stress of lc3 and lc4 are also identical the results show that the stress distribution is mainly affected by the liquid load of the internal tank and independent to the wave force the study demonstrates that inner steel tank and external concrete tank are isolated and there is no direct stress transmission between them the path of the stress transmission is clear demonstrating the superiority of the structure and the materials 5 1 2 wave direction and height effect it is obvious that the wave energy is mainly concentrated around the waterline and the tensile stress on the concrete wall near this region is the largest therefore the node located near the waterline is studied and the effects of wave height period and wave direction on the structural strength are researched the nodal stresses near the waterline are chosen to be analyzed in the following parts because of the higher level of wave loads shown in fig 9 two major high stress areas are observed as shown in fig 12 to distinguish the area where azimuth is about 0 is named as region a while the other area which is located in 60 is called region b the tensile stress of all nodes in those regions under the 100 yr sea state is shown in fig 13 a and b according to the results two nodes node 1 and node 2 where the highest stress is detected are further chosen to be analyzed under all cases in fig 13 c we find that the highest tensile stress of node 1 remains at a high level and does not change significantly when the incident wave direction is in the range from 0 to 60 however the amplitude reduces while the wave direction keeps increasing to 90 on the other hand from fig 13 d we see that the tensile stress of node 2 in the region b remains at a high level when the incident wave is between 0 and 90 it is caused by the fact that node 2 is facing the incident wave among those cases besides there exists another interesting phenomenon that periodicity is observed specifically when the incident wave direction is 60 the tensile stresses of node 2 in all cases are almost same as those of node 1 in 0 degree incident direction similar issues are found in all scenarios when the phase difference of incident direction is 60 the answer lies in the symmetric layout of the concrete tanks this further demonstrates that the structure is not sensitive to the environmental direction from this aspect 0 degree and 90 degree incident waves are chosen in the following analysis similarly the results of compressive stress in both regions are shown in fig 14 a and b two nodes node 3 and node 4 with high compressive stress are analyzed under all cases as shown in fig 14 c and d results show that the trend of the compressive stress of node 3 is opposite to that of the tensile stress of node 1 compressive stress of node 3 remains at a low level and does not change significantly when the incident wave direction is in the range from 0 to 60 however the amplitude increase while the wave direction keeps increasing to 90 the reason for the phenomenon is that node 3 is shifting away from the incident wave among those cases the stress of node 4 where two tanks are tangent is almost invariable when the incident wave is between 0 and 90 it shows that the compressive stress of node 4 is less affected by the wave direction this result is determined by the special position of node 4 compared to the tensile stress the compressive stress is lower in region a and region b this is indicated that the structure is mainly subjected to tensile stress at wave ward side as the tensile strength of concrete is much lower than its compressive strength it is necessary to ensure that the structure meets the requirement of the design progress therefore the tensile stress of node 1 is studied under different sea states results show that the tensile stress increases with the rise of wave height therefore wave force analysis is the key issue to evaluate the tensile stress strength of the high stress zone of the concrete 5 2 analysis of high stress zone in this subsection the wave pressure distribution of mcpso in regular waves and the influence of different factors on this distribution are studied then the main factors affecting wave pressure distribution are evaluated to improve the design dimension and the form of mcpso 5 2 1 wave pressures of initial design the analysis results of the initial design are taken as the basis for further analysis the wave pressure contours distributed on the mcpso are given in fig 15 the frequencies of incident wave range from 0 3 rad s to 0 6 rad s while the incident direction is 0 and the phase is a quarter of wave period according to the results the pressure on the structure varies with the incident wave frequencies when the incident wave frequency is 0 3 rad s the maximum wave pressure is distributed in the outside transition region of two adjacent tanks when the frequency is 0 4 rad s the maximum wave pressure is distributed in about 180 direction which is the internal transition region of two adjacent tanks when the frequency is 0 5 rad s the maximum wave pressure is distributed in four outside transition regions when the frequency is 0 6 rad s the maximum wave pressure is distributed in two outside transition regions all in all the platform always keeps a relatively high level in the transition region of two adjacent tanks therefore the main factors affecting wave pressure distribution of the transition region are studied in the following analysis to improve the form and the wave pressure distribution of mcpso specifically there exists an interesting phenomenon when the wave frequency is 0 4 rad s that is the maximum wave elevation is much larger than other cases see fig 14 b indeed this freak elevation is caused by the moonpool between the tanks according to previous research guo et al 2017 sanchez mondragon et al 2017 the fluid motion in the moonpool could be divided into two types horizontal sloshing and vertical piston motion for mcpso the 0 4 rad s incident wave excites the vertical piston motion in the moonpool see fig 16 5 2 2 effects of extension bar on wave pressures since the extension bar and the transition region between the adjacent tanks are relatively close to each other the shadowing effect of the extension bar on the transition region is taken into account the influence of the extension bar on the wave elevation and the wave pressure distribution on the surface is studied in order to explore the effects of extension bar two distinct arrangements were considered which are the numerical model with and without extension bar respectively in the following simulations 0 6 rad s is chosen as the incident wave frequency and the wave phase is also a quarter of wave cycle t 4 the wave is assumed to inflow along the x axis fig 17 shows the wave elevation contours around the platform both incident and diffracted wave loads are taken into account in fig 17 the upper part shows the contours of the initial model which is with extension bars while the bottom half shows the results of the structure without extension bars results show that the maximum wave elevations always occur around the adjacent region of two tanks but the wave elevation of this region does not vary significantly with removing extension bar according to the transfer functions of wave loads in surge heave pitch and yaw shown in fig 18 it is seen that extension bar will affect the wave loads in each dof case by case in fig 18 a the surge wave force decreased little between these two cases similar phenomenon occurred in heave except the incident wave condition when the wave frequency is of 0 4 rad s see fig 18 b we believe that this slight increment is also caused by the resonance in moonpool which is clarified in previous section 5 2 1 for the pitch moment in fig 18 c the effect of extension bar is changing with the wave frequency on one hand the wave load decreased by removing the bar when the wave frequency is less than 0 7 rad s on the other hand when the high frequency wave is adopted adding the extension bars could reduce the pitch wave moment due to the zero yaw moment when the incident wave is at 0 hence the results of 15 are shown in fig 18 d it shows that the yaw moment of the model with extension bar increases significantly in the high frequency range 5 2 3 effects of transition shape according to the changing value of r1 and r2 see fig 6 which represents the shape of the transition region between the adjacent tanks the influence of waterline shape of mcpso on wave elevation and wave pressure distribution are investigated fig 19 presents the wave elevation on the optimized shapes bottom half compared to the initial ones upper half it shows that a significant change is applied in the region nearby transition position the wave elevation near the platform is reduced to some extent compared with the original platform the variation of wave force with the water line shape is analyzed shown in fig 20 the same sea state in section 5 2 2 is also adopted in these simulations according to fig 20 a and fig 20 c the results show that the surge and pitch loads are not sensitive to r1 but both of them reduce when r2 increases specifically sharp reductions occur when r2 is increased from 1 m to 2 m hence the radius of outside transition arc r2 is confirmed to be the controlling parameter for these loads besides the heave wave force along z axis see fig 20 b has a significant decline while r1 increases from 1 m to 2 m however as r1 continues to increase the load reduces step by step therefore according to the result it is seen that the heave wave force is more sensitive to r1 fig 20 d shows that the yaw moment about z axis is irrelevant to r1 with the increasing r1 the amplitude increases rapidly and then becomes even but the difference between these cases is less than 3 therefore the water line shape effect on yaw moment is relatively little according to the above simulation 2 m and 3 m are chosen as the optimized values of r1 and r2 respectively with these parameters the optimization procedure achieves the goal that the surge heave and pitch wave loads reduce 1 8 72 5 and 36 7 therefore the waterline shape has a significant influence on the wave pressure and wave elevation a reasonable value of r1 and r2 will reduce the wave force obviously 6 conclusions a novel offshore structure mcpso has been proposed for the development of marginal oilfields the layout of the main body is circumstantially described as well as the original double layer concrete steel oil tank fe model is established to investigate the hydrodynamic loads under different incident waves both effects of wave load and internal tank storage load are included in the numerical model a series of numerical analyses have been performed aiming at the reduction of the partial wave pressure both effects of extension bar and waterline shape on the partial wave pressure of structure are studied based on the present conceptual design mcpso takes both advantages of plain concrete and steel due to the mobility of bucket foundations both removable and reusable functions are realized additionally the suction piles could simplify the installation and adjustment progress of the offshore oil and gas production facility after it is towed to the oilfield the structural quasi static analysis shows that the strength of a concrete structure is affected by wave load and independent to the internal tank load on the contrary the von mises stress of the internal steel tank is mainly related to the storage load but has slight changes with the external wave force this phenomenon indicates that internal tank and concrete external tank are mutually separated and there are little direct stress transmissions between them besides it is seen that the path of stress transmission is clear therefore as demonstrated above the superiority of the structure and the materials are realized on the mcpso the relationship between the wave direction and the tensile stress of the structure is studied the results show that the wave direction has a certain influence on the tensile stress on the structure according to the investigations between tensile stress and wave height the results show that the extreme value of tensile stress near the waterline location is linear with the wave height increasing with wave height wave force analysis results show that the wave pressure always keeps a relatively high level in the transition region of adjacent tanks but it is not sensitive to wave headings the translation wave forces along x y and z axes achieve the maximum value when the frequency of incident wave is approximately 0 4 rad s the rotation wave forces about x and y axes achieve the maximum value when the frequency of incident wave is 0 3 rad s or so wave loads in different direction of the incident wave can be obtained by calculation wave pressure always keeps a relatively high level in the transition region of two adjacent tanks due to the closer distance between the extension bar and the transition region of two adjacent tanks the shadowing effect of the extension bar is taken into account results indicate that the wave elevation of the region behind the extension bar does not vary significantly the extension bar has little effect on the translational wave forces but has a greater influence on the rotational wave forces the most obvious reason for this phenomenon is that the extension bar is much smaller than the structure but the position of the extension bar is far away from the center of gravity which makes it more influential to the rotational load which is in good agreement with definition of rotating load the influence of the water surface shape on pressure and wave forces are analyzed through a series of numerical analyses results show that the wave forces along x axis about y axis and about z axis are sensitive to outside transition arc radius r2 but not to the internal transition arc radius r1 the wave forces along y axis are relevant to r1 but not sensitive to r2 therefore the waterline shape has a significant influence on wave pressure and wave elevation a reasonable value of r1 and r2 will reduce the wave force obviously it must be admitted that the viscous damping effect is not included in the potential theory which is assumed that the fluid is ideal hence the resonant vertical piston motion might be over evaluated in the following work we would adopt experimental study and cfd algorithm to further study on this phenomenon yang and kwon 2013 moreover in present work wave load transfer is obtained in regular wave cases based on three dimensional theory to simulate wave load performance in irregular wave more accurately we could adopt experimental study or cfd approach on the wave load transfer analysis in the following work gatin et al 2019 lee et al 2019 in reality the vortex induced vibration response of extension bar might result in structural failure due to fatigue damage accumulation xu et al 2018 we would adopt the cfd algorithm to further study on this phenomenon another potential issue is that vibration due to vortex from the two layered wall of outer concrete and inner steel is not included which may affect the strength of the tank to accurately simulate the vibration effect cfd algorithm and model test method may be necessary in the further like other investigation on paired column semi submersible offshore platform or spar type fowt kim et al 2018 duan et al 2016 it is necessary to point out that in the current work the plain concrete is applied to design and establish present mcpso model structures including floor roof cylindrical walls and sleeves in the following works we would adopt reinforce concrete rc to the structure however as behavior of steel plates in contact with concrete is more diverse than separate steel and concrete structures and the frictional effect between concrete and steel should be further evaluated for rc structures travush et al 2016 khabaz 2017 moreover based on the studies on concrete in offshore environment corrosion has always been an issue for rc structures the corrosion of reinforce leads to deterioration and damage in the concrete gao et al 2019 future investigations about the corrosion effect are required ouzaa and oucif 2019 in the following work proper reinforcement component will be arranged in the gap space to strengthen the inner tank besides the multi physics of the double walls of the concrete and the steel will be taken into consider by experimental method and finite element model in the future gatin et al 2019 nguyen et al 2019 especially when the structure is to be moved to another location the simulation of strength in the steel concrete contact zone may be necessary acknowledgments the authors would also like to show their sincere acknowledgements to the ministry of industry and information technology

parameterization characterization reduced order force model 1 introduction learning from nature can effectively improve the performance of human engineered devices flapping foils inspired from swimming fish fins or bird wings are examples of such devices wei et al 2013 wu 2011 the hydrodynamic performance of flapping foils in underwater vehicle technology has been investigated techet 2008 triantafyllou et al 2000 most relevant studies have focused on propulsion performance and underwater maneuvering using flapping foil motion to enhance efficiency flapping foils can be mounted on the bottom or side of ship hulls as unsteady thrusters to augment ship propulsion by creating auxiliary thrust in waves belibassakis and filippas 2015 npbkrishnankutty et al 2017 however biologically inspired propulsive devices equipped with highly maneuverable flapping foils have not been widely applied in engineering due to the lack of effective design tools such as representative mathematical models this study aims to develop tools that can assist in understanding and investigating this promising technology in this study flapping foils are modeled as active fin stabilizers for conventional ships or new innovative vehicles to significantly improve stability and safety at low speeds for example a small waterplane area twin hull swath vehicle with flapping foil stabilizers presented in the previous study wang et al 2016 is shown in fig 1 for vehicles working under special conditions i e barges driving pile ships installing ocean platforms and vehicles passing a lock stability and safety at low speeds must be properly addressed fan et al 2009 fin stabilizers have been utilized to damp rolling heaving and pitching motions of ships for years conventional fin stabilizers poorly perform when incoming flows passing them are too weak to generate sufficient lift forces several studies have improved the performance of fin stabilizers and certain methods have obtained effective force generation to overcome this problem fan et al 2009 gaillarde et al 2006 however the majority of previous investigations have relied on expensive model tests or ad hoc empirical equations to capture the hydrodynamic characteristics of fins in which the latter are usually ineffective in handing unsteady and large amplitude motions singh and wang 2002 notably magnus rotating roll stabilizer generates lift to stabilize ship roll motion through the rotating rotor wing at the bilge of ship hull based on magnus effect it can generate larger lift than the equivalent fin stabilizer at a low sailing speed liang et al 2017 however it requires power to keep rotation and generate larger drag and it cannot be mounted at some ships such as swath fig 1 given its long length in this study the three dimensional effects unsteady mechanisms and time varying hydrodynamic coefficients of flapping foils cannot be accurately modeled using empirical equations for low frequency updates that is path following of vessels in seas oh and sun 2010 feng et al 2013 or damping of rolling motion by ships vehicles subramanian et al 2007 the changing hydrodynamics of fins or rudders may be ignored conventional empirical equations can be used to construct force models of fins for control design and performance evaluation however the encounter frequency may be high for applications such as damping heaving and pitching motions of vehicles in head seas handa 2005 in which high frequency updates are required in these cases the changing characteristics of control fins must be considered otherwise large errors may result in misleading control simulations numerical simulations based on computational fluid dynamics cfd are usually performed to obtain data for characterizing the dynamic behavior of flapping foils and subsequent modeling purposes these simulations aim to capture time varying hydrodynamic details of flapping foils for flapping foil stabilizers the important and difficult step is to precisely simulate the large amplitude heaving and pitching motions of flapping foils in water while guaranteeing the good quality of computational meshes simultaneously in the present study a computational method that adopts overset grids associated with an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans solver is used to identify the hydrodynamic characteristics of flapping foils under different kinetic conditions the data generated by the cfd model are then used in constructing a control oriented mathematical model of the hydrodynamic force to further develop a control system the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the principal parameters that define the flapping foil motion section 3 introduces the cfd method for database generation in detail numerical simulations are compared with the experimental data and the cfd method is verified and validated this section also presents the lift force characteristics of the flapping foil a three dimensional moving body by adding bias angles to the pitch motions under various conditions section 4 proposes a characterization reduced order force model of flapping foil stabilizers based on the cfd results the proposed characterization reduced order model can be used to develop a control system for the damp rolling heaving and pitching motions of vehicles section 5 conducts simulations to verify the accuracy of the established characterization reduced order model finally section 6 provides the conclusions drawn in this study 2 principal parameters of a flapping foil as shown in fig 2 we consider a flapping foil with chord length c and span length s in the y direction and moves at constant forward velocity u 0 the flapping foil performs harmonic heave motion h t with amplitude h 0 and frequency f and pitch motion θ t heave motion of the foil with amplitude θ 0 and frequency f the phase difference between the pitch and heave motions is defined as ψ anderson et al 1998 under these conditions flapping foil motions can be expressed as follows 1 h t h 0 sin 2 π f t 2 θ t β θ θ 0 sin 2 π f t ψ where f denotes the frequency of foil oscillation h z β θ represents the bias angle then the following equation is considered techet 2008 handa 2005 3 θ 0 arctan 2 π f h 0 u 0 α 0 with α 0 approximating the maximum angle of attack when ψ π 2 and β θ 0 reynolds number which is based on the foil chord is defined as follows 4 re u 0 c ν where ν refers to the kinematic viscosity and ν 1 01 10 6 m 2 s 1 for water the nondimensional frequency strouhal number is defined as follows 5 s t 2 h 0 f u 0 under the motions described in equations 1 and 2 the foil experiences time varying forces f x t and f z t in the x and z directions respectively and torque m y t b refers to the point distance in which the foil pitches from the leading edge fig 2 t is set as the period of oscillation that is t 1 f f x and f z as the time averaged values of f x t and f z t respectively and p as the average input power per cycle the three averaged quantities are defined by the following equations 6 f x 1 t 0 t f x t dt f z 1 t 0 t f z t dt 7 p 1 t 0 t f z t h t m y t θ t dt power and force coefficients are defined as follows 8 c p p 1 2 ρ s 0 u 0 3 c t f x 1 2 ρ s 0 u 0 2 c l f z 1 2 ρ s 0 u 0 2 where ρ corresponds to water density and s 0 denotes the area of one side of the foil propulsive efficiency η is defined as the ratio of useful thrust over input power which is expressed as follows 9 η f x u o p c t c p 3 cfd method for database generation predictive models of forces and moments are required to evaluate the hydrodynamic efficiency of the flapping foil and develop control strategies for good maneuvering and propulsion enhancement adequate and reliable data can serve as the basis in constructing mathematical hydrodynamic force models of flapping foils numerical simulations based on cfd methods can generate added data at a lower cost than experiments or when experimental facilities are unavailable at the same time virtual cfd results such as vortical patterns can help researchers to clearly understand the fluid solid interaction and establish force models with various fidelities for extensive purposes techet 2008 in this section the cfd method for database generation is introduced and verified 3 1 numerical simulation methods simulations are conducted using overset grids associated with the urans approach provided by the commercial software star ccm overset grid is useful when handling moving bodies involving fluid structure interaction carrica et al 2007 the principle of this method is simple and the entire computational domain consists of static and motion grids fig 3 static grids do not move at all because the background region encloses the entire computational domain and is usually used to refine some important zones such as the free surface and prescribe the boundary conditions meanwhile motion grids are small regions in which the prescribed motions are applied and usually contain the moving bodies such as flapping foil and refinement grids designed to resolve the flow phenomena that move with the moving body the overset grid technique allows separate overlapping grids to move independently without restrictions and builds connection among them through interpolation at appropriate cells or points shen et al 2015 with this method mesh modification or deformation is not required which provides great flexibility over standard meshing techniques cell quality conservation that should be considered at each time step is not an issue in overset grids but rather a drawback of the deforming grids when large motions of the body inside the flow are motions sukas faruket al 2017 in view of the abovementioned factors the computational method for adopting overset grids is used to decipher the hydrodynamic characteristics of flapping foils unsteady viscous flow in the computational domain is governed by the following equations 10 cs ρ u n ds 0 11 t cv ρ u dv cs ρ u u n d s cs p n d s cs ν ρ u n d s where u is the velocity at each point in the computational domain p is the pressure and ρ is the density and gravity action ignored in the single phase incompressible flow without free surface cv and cs are the volume and surface area of the control volume respectively an implicit unsteady solver is selected in implementing urans with k ω shear stress transport turbulence model weymouth et al 2005 3 2 cfd method verification and validation numerical simulations are performed on a naca 0012 foil for all computational cases the foil model features a cord length of 0 1 m fig 3 the free surface effect decays with the submergence at a fast rate zhu et al 2006 filippas and belibassakis 2014 filippas et al 2018 de silva and yamaguchi 2012 thus the flapping foil as stabilizers mounted at the bilge of ship hull fig 1 has a large submergence and chord ratio hence the free surface is ignored in all simulations the computational domains selected are defined as 1 2 m x 3 6 m 1 2 m y 1 2 m and 1 6 m z 1 6 m trim mesh is used in this work twenty prism layers that meet various suitable constraints are applied along the near wall grids of the foil to capture the boundary layer at the no slip surface the near body resolution on the foil surface satisfies y 1 dense meshes are created in the fluid domain to accurately capture the flow around the flapping foil and vortex shedding fig 3 other far field meshes are created using large elements to save computational resources the inlet flow velocity is set to 0 4 m s which is in accordance with the experimental conditions a pressure outlet is specified for the outlet and other boundary conditions at the side boundaries top and bottom are symmetrical type the reynolds number is set as r e 40000 strouhal numbers ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 are selected for validation purposes other parameters are presented as ψ 90 o c 0 1 m β θ 0 and aspect ratio ar s c 1 2 3 6 foil motions satisfy equations 1 and 2 and are realized through user defined functions external pressure is set to 1 atm the fluid is seawater with density of ρ 1025 k g m 3 independence tests of mesh and time step sizes are initially conducted using three mesh densities and four time resolutions as shown in fig 4 the curves of thrust and lift coefficients are in good convergence although small discrepancies between mesh 1 and meshes 2 and 3 are observed at the crest and trough in detail the maximum and mean values of force coefficients with different mesh densities and time resolutions are listed in table 1 small discrepancies of less than 5 85 are observed when a coarse mesh e g mesh 1 or a large time step e g t 125 is applied thus subsequent simulations use mesh 2 and time step of t 625 to simulate the overall performance of the flapping foil while saving computational resources in total more than 70 simulations are conducted in present work for each simulation the computational time is sufficient to obtain a convergent result fig 5 presents the two selected simulation cases which agree well with the experimental data of anderson et al 1998 especially at the range of 0 1 s t 0 40 according to anderson et al 1998 and schouveilera et al schouveiler et al 2005 this range is where flapping foils are suggested to be functional and where their highest efficiency performance is expected fig 6 presents the comparison of numerical and experimental time recordings schouveiler et al 2005 of the horizontal and vertical force components and the torque around the pitching axis good agreement can be observed thus the computational method can be used in deciphering the hydrodynamic characteristics of flapping foils 3 3 numerical results and discussion a different trend of c t occurs at large strouhal numeber as shown in fig 5 a as shown in equation 3 the pitching amplitude θ 0 and frequency f become large with the increase in strouhal number prediction errors about the high frequency and large amplitude oscillation increase resulting in the different trend of c t as shown in fig 6 a where β θ 0 o the maximum values for instantaneous forces fx and fy are 5 2 n and 9 8 n respectively 3 2 n and 19 6 n respectively when β θ 15 o the peak value of fz can be considerably larger than fx especially when adding a bias angle to pitching the mean c t is zero fig 7 because of the symmetry of foil motion relative to the incoming flow when β θ 0 o adding a bias angle β θ to the pitch is a simple means to break this sysmmetry for generating a large peak and nonzero mean value of fz that is useful for maneuvering purposes evolution of mean thrust coefficient c t and mean lift coefficient c l when the bias angle of pitch motion β θ varies from 0 to 50 is plotted for comparison with the experimental data schouveiler et al 2005 in fig 7 for ψ 90 α ο 20 h ο c 0 75 st 0 3 and four a r s 1 2 3 6 under the experimental conditions of ar 6 the proposed cfd method has good agreement with the experimental data an ar of 6 is extremely large for stabilizers hence flapping motions should be simulated with other small values of ar such as ar 1 2 3 the effect of ar on the force performance is clearly illustrated in fig 7 the lift coefficient deceases with the ar whereas other conditions remain unchanged this finding is caused by the worsening end effect when the aspect ratio deceases the results show that the mean value of lift force for all four ar values almost linearly varies with the bias angle within an appropriate range β θ 15 but quadratically within a large range β θ 40 4 force model of flapping foil stabilizer this section presents a control oriented characterization reduced order force model for flapping foil stabilizers based on the cfd data generated in section 3 the mathematical force model can be expanded to augment the equations of motion for vehicles by considering the bias angle β θ as the control input for damping rolling and heaving or pitching motions of vehicles force component f z t is considered for demonstration purposes moment component m y t which evolves in the range of 0 2 nm in the example of fig 6 b is ignored because its value is relatively small in the body fixed coordinates of the foil readers can construct the models of other components f x m y by utilizing the proposed method on the basis of the quasi static approach martelli et al 2014 we define the unsteady mechanism of flapping foil stabilizer as follows 18 f z t β θ f β θ θ 0 ψ s t h 0 c

force linearly varies with β θ in an appropriate range β θ 15 but quadratically in a large range β θ 40 and the amplitude of foil force is a function of β θ triantafyllou et al 2004 thus expanding the flapping foil force in a taylor series around the value of β θ 0 is expressed as 20 f z t β θ f z t 0 f z β θ t 0 β θ 2 f z β θ 2 t 0 β θ 2 o β θ 3 where o β θ 3 denotes high order terms that can be ignored incorporating the fourier series of equation 19 f z t β θ in equation 20 can be approximated as follows 21 f z t β θ 1 2 a 0 c 0 a n c β θ 0 β θ 2 a n c β θ 2 0 β θ 2 n 1 n a n s 0 sin 2 π n f

computational resources and meet the accuracy requirement as shown in fig 8 o β θ 3 is ignored in the series expansion the above equation can be rewritten as follows 22 f z t β θ 1 2 a 0 c 0 a n c β θ

summarize the results of data fitting the mathematical model of flapping foil lift is obtained by substituting the results back into equation 22 given that force component f z t is established into the mathematical model moment component m y t can be handled using the same method vehicle motions can be solved by considering foil control forces modeling can be repeated for various parameter sets to establish a rich set of models for flapping foil stabilizers an example in our previous work is used to illustrate the use of force model for control system development of damping rolling heaving and pitching motions of ships wang et al 2016 given the control force provided by the two pairs of fore aft flapping foils fig 1 the coupled heaving and pitching motion equations of swath in the body

encounter frequency which is defined as ω e ω 2 π u 0 λ where u 0 is the vehicle speed in the earth fixed coordinate system and ω is the wave frequency and r e obtains the real part in the expressions subscripts f and a denote the fore and aft flapping foils respectively and the two fore aft flapping foils are treated as a pair with the same control angle input l represents the foil moment arm here l 0 9 m referring to wang et al 2016 as shown in the example in fig 6 b where βθ 15 the peak and mean values of the torque relative to the centre of the swath f z t β θ l which are produced by force component fz are 17 64 nm and 6 46 nm respectively these values are considerably larger than the torque around the pitch axis my evolving in the range of 0 2 nm the horizontal direction of force component fx has a relatively small damping effect on the pitch and heave motions of ships thus the two force components fx and my can be ignored the details of the solution of the above motion equations will not be given here but can be found in wang et al 2016 equation 29 can sufficiently depict the vertical plane motions of the swath vehicle with slender hulls for additional details about the model refer to salvesen et al 1970 and faltinsen 2005 5 simulation and discussion the operation of flapping foil stabilizer with different bias angles is simulated using the cfd method refer to section 3 to test the accuracy of the proposed mathematical model the computational domain and grid details are the same as those presented in section 3 2 the parameters of flapping foil stabilizer are selected for simulations as shown in table 2 and several cases with time varying bias angles are added foil motions in this study satisfy equations 1 and 2 fig 9 compares the simulations obtained using the cfd method with the results of the proposed characterization reduced order model in most cases the results agree well with one another as the bias angle increases large errors become increasingly notable in the range of nt 2 nt n 0 1 2 in these cases t 0 31 s the maximum angle of attack is also observed within this range where the nonlinear hydrodynamic characteristics of flapping foil should be accounted for schouveiler et al 2005 two more simulations are added with bias angles β θ 20 o 30 o where the largest discrepancies are observed more fourier series components n 15 are considered in these simulations and the discrepancies become small as shown in fig 10 for a small bias angle few fourier series components can guarantee the accuracy of the proposed force model thus the proposed characterization reduced order force model at a given range of bias angle can guarantee the accuracy of simulations by adjusting the number of fourier series components fig 11 indicates f z t on the flapping foil with time varying bias angle this variable can be used to evaluate the model the changing rates of the bias angle are addressed using β θ 5 deg s 1 15 deg s 1 30 deg s 1 except for certain small differences the results of the mathematical model agree well with those of cfd simulations which proves that the proposed model is accurate 6 conclusions for motion stabilization of vehicles the hydrodynamic characteristics of a three dimensional flapping foil stabilizer are investigated and its working mechanism is modeled an overset grid method coupled with a urans solver is adopted to determine the force and torque on flapping foils a virtual cfd test bed for data generation is established and validated by comparing numerical simulation values with the experimental ones the good agreement confirms that the overset mesh method can track the large amplitude motions of flapping foils well and provide sufficient useful information about their hydrodynamic characteristics within a large parameter range e g 0 1 st 0 4 the effect of added bias angle to pitch motion on the lift force of the foil with four different aspect ratios ar 1 2 3 4 is investigated using the proposed cfd method the end effect worsens with the decrease of ar thus the lift coefficient decreases with the ar whereas other conditions remain unchanged the results show that the mean value of lift force for all four ar values almost linearly varies with the bias angle within an appropriate range β θ 15 but quadratically within a large range β θ 40 on this basis this

parameterization characterization reduced order force model 1 introduction learning from nature can effectively improve the performance of human engineered devices flapping foils inspired from swimming fish fins or bird wings are examples of such devices wei et al 2013 wu 2011 the hydrodynamic performance of flapping foils in underwater vehicle technology has been investigated techet 2008 triantafyllou et al 2000 most relevant studies have focused on propulsion performance and underwater maneuvering using flapping foil motion to enhance efficiency flapping foils can be mounted on the bottom or side of ship hulls as unsteady thrusters to augment ship propulsion by creating auxiliary thrust in waves belibassakis and filippas 2015 npbkrishnankutty et al 2017 however biologically inspired propulsive devices equipped with highly maneuverable flapping foils have not been widely applied in engineering due to the lack of effective design tools such as representative mathematical models this study aims to develop tools that can assist in understanding and investigating this promising technology in this study flapping foils are modeled as active fin stabilizers for conventional ships or new innovative vehicles to significantly improve stability and safety at low speeds for example a small waterplane area twin hull swath vehicle with flapping foil stabilizers presented in the previous study wang et al 2016 is shown in fig 1 for vehicles working under special conditions i e barges driving pile ships installing ocean platforms and vehicles passing a lock stability and safety at low speeds must be properly addressed fan et al 2009 fin stabilizers have been utilized to damp rolling heaving and pitching motions of ships for years conventional fin stabilizers poorly perform when incoming flows passing them are too weak to generate sufficient lift forces several studies have improved the performance of fin stabilizers and certain methods have obtained effective force generation to overcome this problem fan et al 2009 gaillarde et al 2006 however the majority of previous investigations have relied on expensive model tests or ad hoc empirical equations to capture the hydrodynamic characteristics of fins in which the latter are usually ineffective in handing unsteady and large amplitude motions singh and wang 2002 notably magnus rotating roll stabilizer generates lift to stabilize ship roll motion through the rotating rotor wing at the bilge of ship hull based on magnus effect it can generate larger lift than the equivalent fin stabilizer at a low sailing speed liang et al 2017 however it requires power to keep rotation and generate larger drag and it cannot be mounted at some ships such as swath fig 1 given its long length in this study the three dimensional effects unsteady mechanisms and time varying hydrodynamic coefficients of flapping foils cannot be accurately modeled using empirical equations for low frequency updates that is path following of vessels in seas oh and sun 2010 feng et al 2013 or damping of rolling motion by ships vehicles subramanian et al 2007 the changing hydrodynamics of fins or rudders may be ignored conventional empirical equations can be used to construct force models of fins for control design and performance evaluation however the encounter frequency may be high for applications such as damping heaving and pitching motions of vehicles in head seas handa 2005 in which high frequency updates are required in these cases the changing characteristics of control fins must be considered otherwise large errors may result in misleading control simulations numerical simulations based on computational fluid dynamics cfd are usually performed to obtain data for characterizing the dynamic behavior of flapping foils and subsequent modeling purposes these simulations aim to capture time varying hydrodynamic details of flapping foils for flapping foil stabilizers the important and difficult step is to precisely simulate the large amplitude heaving and pitching motions of flapping foils in water while guaranteeing the good quality of computational meshes simultaneously in the present study a computational method that adopts overset grids associated with an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans solver is used to identify the hydrodynamic characteristics of flapping foils under different kinetic conditions the data generated by the cfd model are then used in constructing a control oriented mathematical model of the hydrodynamic force to further develop a control system the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the principal parameters that define the flapping foil motion section 3 introduces the cfd method for database generation

0 and frequency f and pitch motion θ t heave motion of the foil with amplitude θ 0 and frequency f the phase difference between the pitch and heave motions is defined as ψ anderson et al 1998 under these conditions flapping foil motions can be expressed as follows 1 h t h 0 sin 2 π f t 2 θ t β θ θ 0 sin 2 π f t ψ where f denotes the frequency of foil oscillation h z β θ represents the bias angle

on the foil chord is defined as follows 4 re u 0 c ν where ν refers to the kinematic viscosity and ν 1 01 10 6 m 2 s 1 for water the nondimensional frequency strouhal number is defined as follows 5 s t 2 h 0 f u 0 under the motions described in equations 1 and 2 the foil experiences time varying forces f x t and f z t in the x and z directions respectively and torque m y t b refers to the point distance in which the foil pitches from the leading edge fig 2 t is set as the period of oscillation that is t 1 f f x and f z as the time averaged values of f x t and f z t respectively and p as the average input power per cycle the three averaged quantities are defined by the following equations 6 f x 1 t 0 t f x t dt f z 1 t 0 t f z t dt 7 p 1 t 0 t f z t h t m y t θ t dt power and force

and moments are required to evaluate the hydrodynamic efficiency of the flapping foil and develop control strategies for good maneuvering and propulsion enhancement adequate and reliable data can serve as the basis in constructing mathematical hydrodynamic force models of flapping foils numerical simulations based on cfd methods can generate added data at a lower cost than experiments or when experimental facilities are unavailable at the same time virtual cfd results such as vortical patterns can help researchers to clearly understand the fluid solid interaction and establish force models with various fidelities for extensive purposes techet 2008 in this section the cfd method for database generation is introduced and verified 3 1 numerical simulation methods simulations are conducted using overset grids associated with the urans approach provided by the commercial software star ccm overset grid is useful when handling moving bodies involving fluid structure interaction carrica et al 2007 the principle of this method is simple and the entire computational domain consists of static and motion grids fig 3 static grids do not move at all because the background region encloses the entire computational domain and is usually used to refine some important zones such as the free surface and prescribe the boundary conditions meanwhile motion grids are small regions in which the prescribed motions are applied and usually contain the moving bodies such as flapping foil and refinement grids designed to resolve the flow phenomena that move with the moving body the overset grid technique allows separate overlapping grids to move independently without restrictions and builds connection among them through interpolation at appropriate cells or points shen et al 2015 with this method mesh modification or deformation is not required which provides great flexibility over standard meshing techniques cell quality conservation that should be considered at each time step is not an issue in overset grids but rather a drawback of the deforming grids when large motions of the body inside the flow are motions sukas faruket al 2017 in view of the abovementioned factors the computational method for adopting overset grids is used to decipher the hydrodynamic characteristics of flapping foils unsteady viscous flow in the computational domain is governed by the following equations 10 cs ρ u n ds 0 11 t cv ρ u dv cs ρ u u n d s cs p n d s cs ν ρ u n d s where u is the velocity at each point in the computational domain p is the pressure and ρ is the density and gravity action ignored in the single phase incompressible flow without free surface cv and cs are the volume and surface area of the control volume respectively an implicit unsteady solver is selected in implementing urans with k ω shear stress transport turbulence model weymouth et al 2005 3 2 cfd method verification and validation numerical simulations are performed on a naca 0012 foil for all computational cases the foil model features a cord length of 0 1 m fig 3 the free surface effect decays with the submergence at a fast rate zhu et al 2006 filippas and belibassakis 2014 filippas et al 2018 de silva and yamaguchi 2012 thus the flapping foil as stabilizers mounted at the bilge of ship hull fig 1 has a large submergence and chord ratio hence the free surface is ignored in all simulations the computational domains selected are defined as 1 2 m x 3 6 m 1 2 m y 1 2 m and 1 6 m z 1 6 m trim mesh is used in this work twenty prism layers that meet various suitable constraints are applied along the near wall grids of the foil to capture the boundary layer at the no slip surface the near body resolution on the foil surface satisfies y 1 dense meshes are created in the fluid domain to accurately capture the flow around the flapping foil and vortex shedding fig 3 other far field meshes are created using large elements to save computational resources the inlet flow velocity is set to 0 4 m s which is in accordance with the experimental conditions a pressure outlet is specified for the outlet and other boundary conditions at the side boundaries top and bottom are symmetrical type the reynolds number is set as r e 40000 strouhal numbers ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 are selected for validation purposes other parameters are presented as ψ 90 o c 0 1 m β θ 0 and aspect ratio ar s c 1 2 3 6 foil motions satisfy equations 1 and 2 and are realized through user defined functions external pressure is set to 1 atm the fluid is seawater with density of ρ 1025 k g m 3 independence tests of mesh and time step sizes are initially conducted using three mesh densities and four time resolutions as shown in fig 4 the curves of thrust and lift coefficients are in good convergence although small discrepancies between mesh 1 and meshes 2 and 3 are observed at the crest and trough in detail the maximum and mean values of force coefficients with different mesh densities and time resolutions are listed in table 1 small discrepancies of less than 5 85 are observed when a coarse mesh e g mesh 1 or a large time step e g t 125 is applied thus subsequent simulations use mesh 2 and time step of t 625 to simulate the overall performance of the flapping foil while saving computational resources in total more than 70 simulations are conducted in present work for each simulation the computational time is sufficient to obtain a convergent result fig 5 presents the two selected simulation cases which agree well with the experimental data of anderson et al 1998 especially at the range of 0 1 s t 0 40 according to anderson et al 1998 and schouveilera et al schouveiler et al 2005 this range is where flapping foils are suggested to be functional and where their highest efficiency performance is expected fig 6 presents the comparison of numerical and experimental time recordings schouveiler et al 2005 of the horizontal and vertical force components and the torque around the pitching axis good agreement can be observed thus the computational method can be used in deciphering the hydrodynamic characteristics of flapping foils 3 3 numerical results and discussion a different trend of c t occurs at large strouhal numeber as shown in fig 5 a as shown in equation 3 the pitching amplitude θ 0 and frequency f become large with the increase in strouhal number prediction errors about the high frequency and large amplitude oscillation increase resulting in the different trend of c t as shown in fig 6 a where β θ 0 o the maximum values for instantaneous forces fx and fy are 5 2 n and 9 8 n respectively 3 2 n and 19 6 n respectively when β θ 15 o the peak value of fz can be considerably larger than fx especially when adding a bias angle to pitching the mean c t is zero fig 7 because of the symmetry of foil motion relative to the incoming flow when β θ 0 o adding a bias angle β θ to the pitch is a simple means to break this sysmmetry for generating a large peak and nonzero mean value of fz that is useful for maneuvering purposes evolution of mean thrust coefficient c t and mean lift coefficient c l when the bias angle of pitch motion β θ varies from 0 to 50 is plotted for comparison with the experimental data schouveiler et al 2005 in fig 7 for ψ 90 α ο 20 h ο c 0 75 st 0 3 and four a r s 1 2 3 6 under the experimental conditions of ar 6 the proposed cfd method has good agreement with the experimental data an ar of 6 is extremely large for stabilizers hence flapping motions should be simulated with other small values of ar such as ar 1 2 3 the effect of ar on the force performance is clearly illustrated in fig 7 the lift coefficient deceases with the ar whereas other conditions remain unchanged this finding is caused by the worsening end effect when the aspect ratio deceases the results show that the mean value of lift force for all four ar values almost linearly varies with the bias angle within an appropriate range β θ 15 but quadratically within a large range β θ 40 4 force model of flapping foil stabilizer this section presents a control oriented characterization reduced order force model for flapping foil stabilizers based on the cfd data generated in section 3 the mathematical force model can be expanded to augment the equations of motion for vehicles by considering the bias angle β θ as the control input for damping rolling and heaving or pitching motions of vehicles force component f z t is considered for demonstration purposes moment component m y t which evolves in the range of 0 2 nm in the example of fig 6 b is ignored because its value is relatively small in the body fixed coordinates of the foil readers can construct the models of other components f x m y by utilizing the proposed method on the basis of the quasi static approach martelli et al 2014 we define the unsteady mechanism of flapping foil stabilizer as follows 18 f z t β θ f β θ θ 0 ψ s t h 0 c

force linearly varies with β θ in an appropriate range β θ 15 but quadratically in a large range β θ 40 and the amplitude of foil force is a function of β θ triantafyllou et al 2004 thus expanding the flapping foil force in a taylor series around the value of β θ 0 is expressed as 20 f z t β θ f z t 0 f z β θ t 0 β θ 2 f z β θ 2 t 0 β θ 2 o β θ 3 where o β θ 3 denotes high order terms that can be

summarize the results of data fitting the mathematical model of flapping foil lift is obtained by substituting the results back into equation 22 given that force component f z t is established into the mathematical model moment component m y t can be handled using the same method vehicle motions can be solved by considering foil control forces modeling can be repeated for various parameter sets to establish a rich set of models for flapping foil stabilizers an example in our previous work is used to illustrate the use of force model for control system development of damping rolling heaving

encounter frequency which is defined as ω e ω 2 π u 0 λ where u 0 is the vehicle speed in the earth fixed coordinate system and ω is the wave frequency and r e obtains the real part in the expressions subscripts f and a denote the fore and aft flapping foils respectively and the two fore aft flapping foils are treated as a pair with the same control angle input l represents the foil moment arm here l 0 9 m referring to wang et al 2016 as shown in the example in fig 6 b where βθ 15 the peak and mean values of the torque relative to the centre of the swath f z t β θ l which are produced by force component fz are 17 64 nm and 6 46 nm respectively these values are considerably larger than the torque around the pitch axis my evolving in the range of 0 2 nm the horizontal direction of force component fx has a relatively small damping effect on the pitch and heave motions of ships thus the two force components fx and my can be ignored the details of the solution of the above motion equations will not be given here but can be found in wang et al 2016 equation 29 can sufficiently depict the vertical plane motions of the swath vehicle with slender hulls for additional details about

considered in these simulations and the discrepancies become small as shown in fig 10 for a small bias angle few fourier series components can guarantee the accuracy of the proposed force model thus the proposed characterization reduced order force model at a given range of bias angle can guarantee the accuracy of simulations by adjusting the number of fourier series components fig 11 indicates f

except for certain small differences the results of the mathematical model agree well with those of cfd simulations which proves that the proposed model is accurate 6 conclusions for motion stabilization of vehicles the hydrodynamic characteristics of a three dimensional flapping foil stabilizer are investigated and its working mechanism is modeled an overset grid method coupled with a urans solver is adopted to determine the force and torque on flapping foils a virtual cfd test bed for data generation is established and validated by comparing numerical simulation values with the experimental ones the good agreement confirms that the overset mesh method can track the large amplitude motions of flapping foils well and provide sufficient useful information about their hydrodynamic characteristics within a large parameter range e g 0 1 st 0 4 the effect of added bias angle to pitch motion on the lift force of the foil with four different aspect ratios ar 1 2 3 4 is investigated using the proposed cfd method the end effect worsens with the decrease of ar thus the lift coefficient decreases with the ar whereas other conditions remain unchanged the results show that the mean value of lift force for all four ar values almost linearly varies with the bias angle within an appropriate range β θ 15 but quadratically within a large range β θ 40 on this basis this study presents a characterization reduced order hydrodynamic force model of flapping foil stabilizers with bias angle as the input this model is designed for the future development of a control system
