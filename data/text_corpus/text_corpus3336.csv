traditional catalysts is a promising method to improve removal efficiency presently the research into molecular imprinting targeting catalysts focuses mainly on material preparation and performance

keywords wastewater treatment refractory pollutants targeted degradation molecular imprinting advanced oxidation process 1 introduction advanced oxidation process aops has been one of the most widely used techniques for degrading refractory organic compounds in wastewater treatment an et al 2020 brillas 2020 luo et al 2020 olvera vargas et al 2021 in this process oxidants e g o3 h2o2 and persulfate are stimulated by light ultrasound or electricity to produce strong oxidizing radicals oh so4 these free radicals further mineralize pollutants into carbon dioxide water inorganic substances or other benign products he et al 2020 lee et al 2020 liu et al 2020 pan et al 2019 using aops organic pollutants in water can be rapidly oxidized and degraded thereby lowering the effluent cod toc and other indexes so far aop has been rapidly developed and widely used in treating various wastewaters such as those from papermaking shen et al 2018 pharmaceutical wang et al 2016 coking wang and wang 2020 printing and dyeing brillas and martínez huitle 2015 karimifard and alavi moghaddam 2018 industries however with the recent research development on the environmental impact of refractory organic pollutants problems associated with aop have also been exposed studies have shown that numerous refractory organics including antibiotics zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 endocrine disruptors lü et al 2018 sun et al 2018 and pesticides lu and astruc 2020 can be detected even in treated sewages or natural waters these distributed refractory pollutants are characteristically low in concentration and persistent they can be further circulated in the food chain harming humans directly or indirectly the existing challenges of aops for treating low concentration refractory pollutants are as follows first the short life span of free radicals oh 10 μs is a common problem to aops resulting in limited transport distances oh 90 nm zhang et al 2020 whereas refractory pollutants need to be degraded in milliseconds chuang et al 2017 feng et al 2021 moreover oxidation effectiveness often limited by the diffusion boundary layer that controls the mass transport of organic compounds from the bulk to the catalyst surface as a result it is challenging for aop systems to degrade low concentration refractory pollutants effectively secondly the concentrations of natural organic matter and inorganic salt such as hummus cl and co3 2 are usually higher than that of target pollutants leading to free radical quenching hodges et al 2018 these scenarios reduce activation efficiency brame et al 2014 initiating competitive adsorption on the catalyst s surface thereby hindering the aop degradation efficiency brame et al 2015 besides when the active free radicals near the pollutants are insufficient to carry out the subsequent oxidation the intermediate substances are likely to combine with other organic matter or ions to form by products such occurrence hinders the mineralization process and may produce toxins von gunten 2018 for instance the evolution of chlorine species is a critical issue during aops because of the possible formation of toxic by products chlorate or perchlorate zhang et al 2021 therefore it is imperative to ensure an adequate concentration of free radicals to mineralize the refractory pollutants completely considering that traditional aops are relatively expensive monteil et al 2019 thirdly the demerit of a large amount of iron sludge can be managed by using a heterogeneous catalyst generally the rate of free radical generation is slower than that of the homogeneous catalyst due to the restriction of particle morphology structure and limited specific surface area zhang et al 2020 as a result the degradation efficiency of the catalytic system to the low concentration pollutants is further limited therefore improving the efficiency of aops and the degradation rate of low concentration refractory pollutants are critical economic and environmental issues recently many researchers have been committed to developing multifunctional materials that degrade refractory pollutants alvarez et al 2018 for example ph adjustment to control the surface charge qin et al 2012 and surface modification via chemical doping canlas et al 2012 have been tested although these methods can selectively improve pollutant degradation via the incorporation of specific functional groups they exhibit significant limitations in complex water treatments lai et al 2018 shen et al 2012 molecular imprinting mip technology has been applied in sensor technology li et al 2019 drug delivery zhang 2020 adsorption zhou et al 2018 molecular detection samsidar et al 2018 and other fields chen et al 2016 with the increasing need to improve the degradation efficiency of refractory pollutants via aops the preparation of targeted catalytic materials via mip technology has attracted extensive attention figure 1 a kumar et al 2020 wei et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 however this study lacks a systematic overview that summarizes a comprehensive comparison of extensive studies and engineering designs there are many methods of molecular imprinting such as copolymerization precipitation method emulsion method chain transfer technology etc the methods for preparing molecularly imprinted catalysts can be divided into two categories one method is precipitation polymerization pp similar to forming imprinted polymers with traditional molecular imprinting technology in this method the target contaminants are added before the polymerization precipitation as the polymerization occurs the template molecules are enveloped by the catalyst then the template is removed to form the targeted catalytic material to match the template molecular structure with the characteristic pore structure another method is surface molecular imprint s mip this method builds a molecularly imprinted layer on the catalyst thereby improving the selective catalytic capacity different from the pp method the preparation of targeted catalytic by s mip involves three steps viz 1 the functional group and structural complementarities are used to form a non covalent weak interaction between the target pollutant and the functional monomer h n h o electrostatic force etc 2 as the initiator forms the free radicals the crosslinking agent polymerizes to form the imprint surface capable of selectively identifying the target pollutants li et al 2020c shi et al 2019 3 the imprinted surface layer is combined with the heterogeneous catalytic substrate to form a novel catalyst with a specific affinity toward the pollutants fu et al 2020 figure 1b both methods have peculiar merits and demerits for instance despite its popularity easy to use and speed advantages pp cannot remove the template molecules in a catalyst entirely by washing leading to low utilization of active sites and environmental risks from template leakage however the template can be removed entirely by calcination only for preparing metal oxide catalysts such as tio2 and sno2 and not carbon based materials in addition site loss and the imprinted pore collapse could ensue in high temperature calcination s mip can combine with various catalysts to form new catalysts with substrate catalytic and target identification properties gao et al 2008 liu et al 2011 however this method is restricted by many factors impacting the final catalytic effect significantly several scholars have investigated the process of targeted catalysis target degradation of refractory pollutants using imprinted catalytic in water treatment is usually divided into two steps figure 1c 1 materials with specific recognition sites and unique pore structures will selectively enrich target pollutants 2 free radicals will be activated catalytically and degrade the enriched target pollutants according to the traditional catalytic oxidation process sun et al 2019 according to this process the recognition site can accurately concentrate the target contaminants on the surface of the imprinting catalyst thus reducing spatial distance between free radicals and target pollutants hence in the target degradation process the mass transfer distance of the free radical acting on the target pollutant is reduced thereby improving the efficiency he et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 in the last decade with the target degradation of refractory pollutants in wastewater has become increasingly prominent using molecular imprinting technology to improve the efficiency of catalysts has received much attention this paper introduces the study of molecular imprinting technology to enhance the catalytic efficiency of aops and the application of targeted catalytic materials in the degradation of refractory pollutants on this basis the stability bio toxicology opportunities and challenges of applying these materials in water treatment are analyzed 2 modification of catalytic by mip 2 1 preparation of imprinting photocatalytic photocatalytic processes rely on light especially ultraviolet to form a conduction band electron e cb and valence band hole h vb the purpose is to generate o2 via heterogeneous reduction of dissolved o2 by e cb which ultimately produces ho cates 2017 jiang et al 2017 common photocatalysts include tio2 zno sno2 cu2o graphitic carbon nitride metal organic frameworks mofs etc albornoz et al 2021 chong et al 2010 lee et al 2016 li et al 2020 yue et al 2020 being the most widely studied photocatalyst with good application prospects tio2 has the advantages of high stability no corrosion and no toxic by products guo et al 2019 pan et al 2020 wang et al 2019 the modification of tio2 is also widely studied in mip and like most catalysts non specific selectivity is mainly due to the material properties and the generated non selective active radicals guo et al 2019 for the preparation of imprinted tio2 catalyst precipitation polymerization is the most simple and fast method figure 2 a de escobar et al 2016 for instance zhang et al prepared tio2 molecular imprinted material with high exposure 111 crystal surface by adding dimethyl phthalate dmp in the polymerization zhang et al 2020 where the dmp was immersed in the precipitated polymer after calcination to remove the template the structure in the highly exposed 111 crystal plane provides dmp characteristic imprinted pores and improves the photochemical activity of the catalyst the results show that the molecularly imprinted tio2 can specifically recognize the target pollutant and accelerate its oxidation rate while inhibiting the oxidation of coexisting substances elsewhere s mip has been used for selective detection and photodegradation of contaminants such as toxic metals organics such as pesticides and antibiotics achieving satisfactory results in the early 21st century fiorenza et al 2020a lai et al 2016 liu et al 2020 melvin ng et al 2017 qi and wang 2020 tang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 since the selective identification of target contaminants by imprint catalysts usually takes place on the surface the s mip is to improve the utilization efficiency of the identification sites in precipitation polymeric materials different from pp the s mip synthesized imprinting tio2 is usually divided into three steps 1 the template molecule interacts with the functional monomer in a solvent to form precursor prepolymer 2 tio2 is added to the mixing system and the surface imprinted layer is formed by crosslinking polymerization usually by controlling the initiation of temperature or uv irradiation 3 elution of template molecule lai et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 in the synthesis process the first and second steps are crucial to the material s selectivity toward pollutants however this process is affected by many factors such as functional monomer crosslinking agent polymerization time polymer mixture ratio and temperature ashley et al 2017 therefore all these factors need to be optimized to obtain ideal imprint tio2 catalysts previous results show that s mip can combine with various photocatalysts such as zno cantarella et al 2018 cofe2o4 carbon nanotubes guan et al 2021 bipo4 nanocubes amiri et al 2020 cofe f he et al 2019 bipo4 go kumar et al 2020 and graphene oxide go fe iii composite coating chen et al 2020 exhibit improved photocatalytic performances at the same time the characteristics of s mip such as easy to operate and the protection of substrate material make the synthesis and application more diverse than that of traditional steps for instance with p123 as a functional monomer and atrazine as a template the prepolymer can be used to form targeted recognition sites and as a template for mesoporous materials in subsequent processes figure 2b by removing template molecules the pore surface of mesoporous tio2 has atrazine specific recognition sites and characteristic pores shi et al 2019 also highly stable catalysts can be obtained via the emulsion polymerization method here the oil phase which played an important role in the synthesis comprises the monomer crosslinkers ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and trimethylolpropane trimetha crylate and toluene subsequently the 50 100 μm microspheres were formed using go nanosheets as stabilizers by removing the template a highly stable catalytic material is formed chen et al 2020 to some extent this method combines pp with s mip to expand the application of molecular imprinting and form high specific surface area imprinted catalysts although mip can significantly improve the specificity of photocatalysts some associated problems require further study it is necessary to study whether the imprinted layer on the surface will affect the activation via uv irradiation and whether the substrate s surface is stable under the irradiation figure 2c for instance cui et al investigated catalyst stability and uv effect on the imprinting layer lai et al 2018 they found that light radiation has no essential impact on forming the molecular imprinted layer structure and its stability can be maintained even under uv at the same time the results showed that the imprinted pore channel structure closely influences the imprinted layer stability given the above problems the available reports are not comprehensive proving inconclusive mechanisms 2 2 preparation of imprinting electrocatalyst electrochemical advanced oxidation processes are one method that most directly converts energy input to pollutant oxidation the oxidation process is carried out by applying an electric potential to the positive and negative electrodes in a reactor organic compounds can be oxidized directly through charge transfer occurring on the electrode surface and indirectly through the oxidizing agents generated by the electrochemical reactions feng et al 2020 ganiyu et al 2020 hodges et al 2018 in electrocatalysis the electrode is a crucial component of the electrochemical reactor since the electrochemical reaction occurs at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte the targeting property of the electrode determines the removal efficiency of refractory pollutants therefore researchers focus on the development of molecularly imprinted electrodes with various characteristics although most research has been based on electrochemical sensors ahmad et al 2019 anantha iyengar et al 2019 karimi maleh et al 2021 with the complexity of pollutants in wastewater and the severity of removing refractory pollutants the development of electrode materials with high speed sensitivity and specificity has attracted much attention in recent years niu et al 2020 aside from the imprinting photocatalyst method s mip is used as electrodes with enhanced basic morphology with similar steps to pp for instance using bisphenol a as the template molecule chai et al immersed boron doped diamond in precursor solution containing 0 03 m tioso4 and 2 4 mm bpa ph 1 3 the results showed that 40 80 nm spindle shaped tio2 particles are densely grown on the boron doped diamond substrate after soaking at 80 c for 24 h chai et al 2012 further spectrometric analyses revealed that bpa molecules were successfully imprinted on the tio2 substrate and calcination formed specific recognition sites on the template transient photocurrent response experiments confirmed that mip tio2 nanoelectrode has excellent photoelectrocatalytic activity and selectivity although the modification in the study adopted pp it was similar to the s mip method by using tio2 as the crosslinking agent thus maintaining the morphology of the bdd substrate similar to photocatalyst synthesis the s mip can combine with a variety of electrodes such as metals metal oxides wang et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 carbon based electrodes multi walled carbon nanotubes graphite anirudhan et al 2018 fan et al 2018 and conductive copolymer electrodes figure 3 a kumar et al 2019 okhokhonin used carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes with ni as an electrocatalyst and the self assembling electrostatic property of polyethyleneimine to crosslink with glutaric dialdehyde as a molecularly imprinted layer resulting in glucose oxidation electrode with good electrocatalytic activity and high stability okhokhonin et al 2021 similarly by electropolymerization liu prepared mip films modified by polyformaldehyde on the electrode surface using 2 4 dichlorophenol as template and o phenylenediamine as the monomer figure 3b liu et al 2019 elsewhere niu prepared a novel molecular imprinted facet sno2 mi sno2 electrode niu et al 2020 under 1 8 v nitrophenol can be degraded effectively from industrial wastewater as a result the ratio of bod5 to codcr bod5 codcr increased from 0 186 to 0 412 after electrode pretreatment and the biodegradability was significantly enhanced figure 3c the imprinted modified electrode has some advantages firstly the molecular layer enriching the target molecule can act as a medium between the target pollutants and the electrode which enhanced electrode efficiency secondly due to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity from the specificity of the interaction between the modified material and the target molecule the targeting ability is significantly enhanced when the electrode material has a large surface area this is because when the specific surface area of the material substrate is larger more imprinting polymerization can occur on the material surface and more recognition sites are exposed thirdly the fouling effect on the electrode surface can be reduced by rapid diffusion and enrichment of target molecules on the electrode surface ali et al 2019 sharma et al 2018 however there are still some problems in the preparation of targeted electrodes one of the critical issues of molecular imprinting on the electrode surface is the lack of conductivity and electrolytic activity of the imprinted layer which directly affects the feasibility of imprinted electrodes therefore making the electrode material have excellent conductivity and electrolytic activity while having being selective is a research prospect anantha iyengar et al 2019 cui et al 2020 some researchers have realized and started to solve this problem for instance gold nanoparticles are embedded in the mip coating to improve conductivity xue et al 2014 or the thickness of the imprinted layer is controlled to reduce the mass transfer resistance zheng et al 2018 besides by using high temperature calcination 400 c to remove the organic template can solve the lack of electrical conductivity and electrolysis activity issues from imprint layer however this method can only be applied to synthesizing some known metal oxide electrochemical materials using pp method such as sno2 niu et al 2020 other electrode materials such as conductive polymers and carbon based electrodes are less reported requiring further study in particular carbon based materials are not suitable for activation by high temperature calcination because of the severe damage to the material structure and morphology 2 3 preparation of imprinting fenton like heterogeneous catalytic materials heterogeneous catalysts have the advantages of high catalytic efficiency high stability and easy recovery a transition metal is usually used as the main reaction center for such catalysts for instance fe based materials have been extensively studied due to their high environmental abundance and low toxicity chi et al 2019 wang et al 2016 studies on other metals such as cu mn and co have also been widely reported deng et al 2013 feng et al 2016 however few studies are on the preparation of heterogeneous transition metal catalysts metal oxides zero valent metals composite metals mofs by pp most reports focused on combining electrochemical and photochemical materials mainly using zno sno2 and tio2 as the photocatalysts this may because the template molecules added in pp will affect the microstructure of the catalyst and the conditions required for the catalyst such as solubility synthesis temperature and synthesis conditions are also relatively strict on the contrary s mip can form an imprinting layer on the surface of heterogeneous catalysts without significant structural damage in addition s mip also provide a good foundation for the targeted degradation of refractory pollutants due to its advantages of easy separation high specific surface area and good catalytic performance shi and lin 2019 wei et al 2020 as a result s mip researchers are delving more into using metal oxides and mofs in recent years he et al 2020 li et al 2020a tang and wang 2018 there are two major problems associated with molecular imprinting on heterogeneous catalysts 1 the material agglomerate easily after molecular imprinting reducing the specific surface area thereby leading to limited catalytic performance despite the improved specificity this is mainly due to the high concentration of crosslinking agent however the polymerization process at low crosslinker concentration is slow and it is difficult to form an effective surface imprinted layer 2 the thickness of the imprinted layer directly affects the catalytic performance of the materials and the oxide transport because the free radicals activated by the transition metal exist for a short time and their linear transport distance is limited in other words too thick imprinted layer may lead to the catalytic capacity of the targeted catalyst reduced therefore these two conditions should be considered in the modification process of a heterogeneous catalyst especially s mip some researchers use porous materials with large specific surface areas for s mip as a countermeasure for instance the s mip process of fe zeolite can effectively protect the specific surface area of the material although some agglomeration may occur zhang et al 2017 in addition mofs can ensure a high specific surface area and improved binding figure 4 a between the organic skeleton and the crosslinker via a weak interaction such as van der waals force bagheri et al 2019 mohammadnejad et al 2018 tan and zeng 2017 on the other hand the regular nanopores 2 50 nm of mofs enable them to form molecular imprinting layers inside and outside the pores by selecting appropriate imprinting systems the imprinted catalytic materials prepared by this method usually have a high specific surface area as we have researched earlier li et al 2020c in our research s mip catalysts were synthesized by using fe mil 100 fe mofs and carbonized derivatives as substrate we observed that the molecular imprint layer formed on the catalyst surface and in the pore channels although adding crosslinkers usually causes agglomeration controlling the crosslinker concentration reduces the defect thereby reducing the inhibition of free radical transfer by the imprinted layer figure 4b other studies have significantly improved the removal efficiency of phthalate esters in simulated and actual wastewaters li et al 2020b c however the imprinting layer has several effects on the targeted degradation efficiency of the catalyst these include the pore structure of the imprinted layer and the unique electronic environment although these factors play a significant role in the rapid and accurate degradation of target pollutants they have not received enough research attention the research on these problems can further accelerate the identification efficiency and targeted degradation rate of imprinted materials to target pollutants 3 degradation of refractory pollutants by mip catalytic targeted degradation of refractory pollutants is a synergistic process of selective adsorption and catalysis in this process target pollutants and identification sites in imprinted catalyst were combined with weak interaction besides the pore morphology of the imprinted layer can match the target pollutant which can accurately find and seize as a result the local concentration of refractory pollutants on the surface of the material increases at the same time the activated free radicals degrade the target pollutants identified on the surface of the catalysts with the closest distance and high concentration therefore the influence of refractory pollutants degradation efficiency is usually divided into two parts 1 accuracy of identification sites of imprinted catalyst to target contaminants 2 activation and mass transfer ability of the catalyst to free radicals for the first part the identification of accuracy is usually based on the group and structural characteristics of different pollutants to carry out extensive screening for the second the control of the mass transfer capacity includes the catalytic properties of the substrate the imprinted modified crosslinking agent and the control of the mass transfer environment therefore targeted degradation of different pollutants usually requires the establishment of different imprinting catalytic systems to achieve better targeted degradation effect 3 1 targeted degradation of drugs and ppcps recent extensive research includes problems associated with residual drugs and personal care products ppcps in the environment including the most commonly used antibiotics antihypertensive drugs lipid lowering drugs analgesics preservatives etc zhao et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 these drugs are often widely distributed in industrial production and municipal water treatment systems due to the usual trace concentrations in water their removal via traditional oxidative degradation is limited in recent years mip catalyst has been adopted to improve the targeted degradation of refractory pollutants table 1 among these refractory pollutants to degrade antibiotics have attracted more attention in recent years due to their antibacterial property and the tendency to cause organism mutation kumar et al 2021 meng et al 2021 studies have shown that mip catalysts can significantly improve the targeted degradation efficiency of various ppcps and antibiotics the target degradation capacity of mip catalyst is significantly increased by 100 800 than those of traditional materials table 1 mostly interestingly with a better understanding of the mechanism and performance of catalysts and the optimization of the imprinting system in recent years the specificity of mip catalysts has been continuously improved for instance for ciprofloxacin cip degradation huo used ethylene glycol dimethacrylate egdma as crosslinker and acrylamide as the molecular template to synthesize surface molecularly imprinted catalyst in 2012 huo et al 2012 during the preparation process the nh2 structure of the functional monomer acrylamide first interacts with the n c c o and other characteristic functional groups in cip to form hydrogen bonds such as h o c c f h electrostatic force and other weak interactions after that the imprinted catalyst with cip characteristic pores are formed by the addition of photocatalytic substrate and the cross linking agent using 2 2 azobisisobutyronitrile aibn as initiating agent the results showed that the adsorption and photodegradation selectivity of imprinted photocatalyst on the molecular template ciprofloxacin was higher than that of the non imprinted photocatalyst under visible light irradiation the degradation rate of the molecular template can reach 70 within 60 min with the development of surface imprinting technology and the optimization of the catalytic system li et al prepared an imprinted tio2 catalyst in 2020 using methacrylic acid maa as the functional monomer and trimethylpropanol trimethacrylate trim as crosslinker li et al 2020 by contrast in this study n h and c oh in cip can form more kinds of hydrogen bonds with maa nh o and oh o which can provide more recognition sites and makes the targeted catalytic process of cip more accurate the catalyst has selectivity coefficients of 7 2 and 3 2 for ciprofloxacin adsorption and photocatalysis respectively superior to that of competitive pollutant sulfamethoxazole smz the molecular imprinting technology improved the removal rate of ciprofloxacin significantly to 99 and the catalytic reaction rate increased from 0 01892 to 0 025 min 1 much higher than results from previous studies furthermore materials synthesized by pp and s mip can significantly increase the ability of targeted catalysis however even mip catalysts prepared with the same method would exhibit different degradation efficiencies for instance the mip catalysts of various antibiotics and drugs prepared by escobar using the pp method have differ significantly in their targeted degradation efficiency against different pollutants de escobar et al 2016 it was reported that the three dimensional cavity formed by the pp method is not the best choice because it cannot achieve the ideal targeted degradation effect as an example several reports have shown that tetracycline structure contains characteristic functional groups such as benzene ring carboxyl group hydroxyl group c o c c and nh2 whereas the pp method usually prepares materials that lack functional groups that interact with the active functional groups such as hydrogen bonds electrostatic force π π stack etc guo et al 2018 he et al 2020 usually the metal oxide catalyst this method forms needs to be calcined at 400 c to achieve hydroxyl condensation and remove the template chai et al 2012 shi et al 2019 which reduces the limited recognition sites therefore to overcome this problem the pp method of catalytic materials at lower temperatures is investigated although changing the synthesis method is tedious for instance cantarella obtained nano sized mip zno materials by adding paracetamol in zno synthesis and fixing the ratio at 5 1 here a high temperature calcination process was avoided and the vacuum drying was carried out at 140 c which protected the characteristic channels and the effective recognition sites cantarella et al 2018 the catalyst synthesized by s mip also showed varied degradation efficiencies against refractory pollutants depending on the types of functional monomers solvents and crosslinker concentrations li et al 2020 liu et al 2013 imprinting components in the s mip process usually contain carboxyl ester amino and other functional groups such as maa acrylamide with a variety of recognition sites therefore theoretically the materials formed by s mip favorably promote targeted catalytic ability in theory however such an outcome is not certain because of the different characteristic structures of the pollutants leading to various optimal imprinting systems for s mip identifying the optimal imprint system is complicated mainly because of the unlimited combinations in theory between functional monomers solvents and crosslinkers on this basis it is more challenging to screen suitable s mip components for substrate catalysts therefore it is essential to identify the binding sites of target pollutants and the weak interaction in s mip components to build an imprinting system to improve the targeted catalytic performance 3 2 targeted degradation of hormones pollutant environmental hormones are endocrine disrupting chemicals which affect the normal hormonal secretions in humans and animals these substances lead to abnormal hormone regulation in the human body resulting in developmental disorders reproductive abnormalities organ diseases increased teratogenicity male reproductive disorders and other problems brander et al 2016 khanal et al 2006 liu and mabury 2020 environmental hormones consist of estrogens plasticizers pesticides and flame retardants one of the endocrine disruptors closely related to humans is phthalate esters paes gómez hens and aguilar caballos 2003 zhang et al 2018 as a plasticizer paes are widely used in hundreds of everyday products such as toys food packaging medical blood bags vinyl flooring wallpaper detergents lubricants personal care products such as nail polish hair gel soap shampoo etc due to their limited water solubility and biodegradability it is crucial to improve the degradation efficiency of these pollutants recently the use of mip to enhance the effectiveness of paes targeted degradation has also been studied for instance by adding dimethyl phthalate dmp as a molecular template in electrode synthesis zhao et al prepared an active iron doped carbon aerogel imprint catalyst to degrade paes zhao et al 2017 at first 90 of dmp was adsorbed on the surface of the dmp imprinted afec electrode and following dmp was proceed degradation with a final removal rate of 98 graphene layer with amorphous carbon generated in the material can produce strong π π and hydrophobic interactions with dmp enhancing the affinity for dmp and improving the removal efficiency two folds earlier ding prepared dmp imprinted catalyst by depositing mofs on molecularly imprinted polymers ding et al 2020 the results showed that the dmp selective adsorption ability of the catalyst was highly enhanced also the catalytic rate of the molecularly imprinted catalyst increased 1 5 times indicating that selective adsorption was crucial the proposed mechanism involves the selective adsorption of dmp on the catalyst through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction then it is degraded by active free radicals generated by persulfate ps activation the persulfate activation process is shown in the following equations 1 fe ii s2o8 2 fe iii so4 so4 2 2 so4 h2o oh h so4 2 unlike the other refractory pollutants containing amino or hydroxyl groups the characteristic functional groups in paes are esters and benzene rings devoid of hydrogen bond binding sites hence the molecular imprinting process needs to consider the availability of hydrogen bond donors such as using acrylic acid as the optimal monomer to provide hydrogen bond and reduce the hydrophobic force of methyl groups on this basis we used fe mofs with relatively large specific surface area mil 100 and optimize the transport distance of active substance by controlling the molecularly imprinted layer for improved catalytic performance of diethyl phthalate dep catalyst the efficiency of the active substance persulfate was also improved three folds over than that of the traditional conditions li et al 2020c in addition we also observed the adsorption and desorption of the oxidizer in the molecularly imprinted layer indicating that the layer contributes positively to the efficiency of the oxidizer as a result the dep degradation efficiency of the catalyst can also be improved 70 under lower oxidant conditions 11 1 molar ratio and complex actual water environment li et al 2020b the target degradation of other hormonal pollutants such as ethyl hydroxybenzoate 4 9 aminononyl pheno and ethylparaben has also been studied zhan successfully prepared a dawson type nanocomposite catalyst using ethylparaben as the template by impregnation segmentalized acidification and sol gel methods zhan et al 2020 the results show that the specific surface area and pore volume of molecularly imprinted tio2 increased after modification at the same time the photogenerated electron hole pair composite catalyst and the imprinted hole modified tio2 have stronger photoactivity than the pristine tio2 as a result the highest photoactivity and the optimal dosage on the catalyst was 0 25 wt resulting in ethylparaben photodegradation efficiency of 87 32 and 89 82 under uv for 70 min and visible light for 40 h irradiation respectively zhu et al used pp method to prepare mip catalyst ag zn mip tio2 with ethyl p hydroxybenzoate as the imprinted template zhu et al 2020 they reported that ag zn mip tio2 exhibited a high selective catalytic performance using three angles of uv vis multi wavelength viz spectral integral area change specific group absorbance change and traditional reaction kinetic parameter change as a result the photocatalytic degradation of ethyl p hydroxybenzoate for 2 h was 99 1 significantly higher than that of non imprint catalyst 3 3 targeted degradation of pesticides pesticides play a vital role in preventing pests and diseases while maintaining agricultural outputs however due to their complex structures and indiscriminate use pesticides and insecticides flow into rivers and lakes with rainwater and farmland drainage polluting the water bodies and harming aquatic organisms barletta et al 2019 coleman et al 2020 silva et al 2019 due to the carcinogenic teratogenic mutagenic endocrine disruptive hazards posed by organic pesticides several studies have been done on their selective treatment de barros et al 2021 veerakumar et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the use of mip technology to improve the degradation efficiency of organic pesticides has also been widely reported typical pesticides such as 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d atrazine and organophosphorus pesticides have been widely studied shi et al 2019 2015 tang et al 2018 wang et al shi et al 2015 wang et al 2019 used polypyridine ligand n 4 vinylbenzyl bis 2 pyridyl amine as a functional monomer to prepare nanocapsule imprinted material with high catalytic efficiency to degrade methyl parathion as a result the degradation rate was 355 times higher than that in a natural environment in a further study the hydrolysis rate of pesticides was further accelerated 415 times by controlling the imprinting system of alcohol assisted functional monomers using 2 4 d as target pollutant and template tang et al prepared molecular imprinted mesoporous sno2 electrode and two dimensional photocatalyst tio2 tang et al 2018 they found that both materials can achieve selective and efficient removal of 2 4 d in complex and neutral environment samples tang et al 2020 for mip sno2 degradation system 2 4 d concentration decreased to 54 ppb after 6 h in various coexisting sewage systems the selective adsorption of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by tio2 photoelectric material was 1 08 10 9 mol cm2 mg 1 and the vertically arranged single crystal nanoarrays had excellent photocatalytic oxidation performance shi et al further elaborated the mechanism of selective removal of atrazine using molecularly imprinted catalysts shi et al 2019 their results show that mip catalyst enhanced selective photochemical oxidation of atrazine due to the molecular imprinted sites on the catalyst surface these sites can act as surface structural defects accelerating the separation of photogenerated holes and electrons and enhancing the generation of hydroxyl radicals in addition the local concentration of contaminants on the electrode surface increased due to the multiple hydrogen and halogen bonds formed between the molecular imprinted site and atrazine as a result the contact probability of atrazine with free radical components increased and the degradation rate was improved 3 4 targeted degradation of dyes and other chemical intermediates dye wastewater is characterized by large volume high coloration poor bio degradability and high toxicity chandel et al 2020 huang et al 2020 ismail et al 2019 lops et al 2019 to degrade methyl green and auramine o dyes amiri synthesized a high surface area dual inorganic mip catalyst they used a sol gel method to coat a layer of molecularly imprinted ag2o cuo they reported that the coexisting conditions of the imprinted sites toward mg and ao selective recognition and degradation were well preserved amiri et al 2020 by using methylene blue as a template fang et al synthesized mip nano fe2o3 materials via pp and hydrothermal methods the results showed that the photocatalytic activity of fe2o3 for methylene blue increased by 168 with strong specificity fang et al 2016 wei et al prepared an imprinted catalyst by coupling tio2 photocatalytic substrate and magnetic fe3o4 with methyl orange using template molecule pyrrole as functional monomer the material evinced high degradation efficiency and rapid separation toward dyes it showed excellent catalytic reusability and stability and increased effectiveness in low light environments it is also susceptible to chemical modification to ensure a green and low cost material more rapid and efficient for degradation of dyes in industrial printing and dyeing wastewater wei et al 2015 targeted removal of some chemical intermediates has also been researched intensively chai et al 2012 luo et al 2013 these intermediates are usually useful in the synthesis of organic matter or as corresponding by products as a result such materials often carry the same or higher environmental risks toxicity than their chemical products for instance due to its substantial toxicity and carcinogenicity 2 nitrophenol and 4 nitrophenol are used as intermediates of pesticides these intermediates are also found in pharmaceuticals dyes and other fine chemicals such as sulfur dyes paracetamol organophosphate insecticides etc atta et al 2012 elshafei et al 2018 zou et al 2019 aiming to remove such pollutants using magnetic separation zhang prepared fe3o4 al2o3 molecularly imprinted tio2 nanocomposites using multiple steps zhang et al 2015 compared with unimprinted catalyst molecular imprinted tio2 has better photocatalytic selectivity for 2 nitrophenol attributed to the chemical interactions and size matching between the template molecules and the imprinted cavities elsewhere shen et al prepared 2 nitrophenol and 4 nitrophenol imprint catalysts as templates to reduce environmental impact shen et al 2008 the results showed that when the concentration of the target pollutant decreased and or when the difference in the structures of the target and other molecules was intensified the enhanced photocatalytic selectivity was significantly improved besides mip could inhibit the accumulation of intermediates indicating that the target material also had an excellent inhibition against catalytic intermediates although molecular imprinting technology has been applied for preparing targeted catalytic materials and achieved remarkable efficiencies there are still few reports most of which are based on the improvement of targeted degradation performance of refractory pollutants however there is a meager discussion on the mechanism of material preparation and targeted catalysis in particular few in depth analyses exist on the weak interaction between imprinted systems and the mass transfer of various components of the catalysis however these research contents directly affect the efficiency of targeted degradation of related refractory pollutants in addition the types of targeted degradation of refractory pollutants that have been reported are extremely limited however pollutants usually exist in the form of coexistence of multiple pollutants in the environment and there are few reports on the targeted degradation of refractory pollutants in the complex actual water environment 4 stability and reusability the stability and reusability of imprinted catalyst are the key issues that determine whether imprinted catalyst can be applied specifically the stability and reusability of s mip are worthier of discussion than those of the pp method because of the surface imprinted layer formed by the crosslinked polymerization of organic matter which contains several functional groups whether the organic components will be affected by the aop is the key issue that directly leads to the long term application of the material according to ft ir and sem characterization the surface morphology and characteristic functional groups of the mip material did not change significantly after ten cycles yuan et al 2020 similarly escobar ran six cycles on the imprinted catalyst and reported excellent performance and reusability although the total removal rate of the imprinted catalyst for the target pollutants decreased the imprinted factor if of the catalyst substrate maintained a higher level indicating that the catalyst was efficient de escobar et al 2018 furthermore sun studied the stability and reusability of the prepared photocatalysts sun et al 2019 the results showed that the removal rate of the non molecularly imprinted material decreased by 20 after four cycles while that of the surface imprinted material decreased by 5 the above studies indicate that the imprinted layer formed by the organic crosslinker is highly dense and can resist the aggregation of free radicals thereby exhibiting good stability in practical applications although many studies have investigated the recycling of targeted catalysts the surface imprinted layer is usually a polymeric material its stability depends on the number of functional monomeric recognition sites and templates therefore the proportion of functional monomers the number of template molecules and the ratio of crosslinking agent concentration in the imprinted system affect the stability of the imprinted layer however there are few studies on these conditions for mip prepared with different targeted catalysts in addition the theoretical basis for maintaining the stability of the imprinted layer during aop has not been thoroughly studied 5 ecotoxicological effects of mip catalysts although mip performs better on targeted degradation of refractory pollutants than traditional catalytic does their associated ecotoxicity has not been extensively studied lai et al 2018 the ecotoxicity of targeted materials is mainly reflected in three aspects figure 5 first more toxic intermediate products are generated during pollutant degradation by aop chaves et al 2020 trovó et al 2011 this situation has not been adequately researched as regards targeted catalytic degradation although some related studies exist for instance shen et al analyzed the targeted degradation of pentachlorophenol by intermediate analysis and toxicity assessment their results showed that the imprinted catalyst accelerates the photocatalytic degradation of pentachlorophenol and significantly inhibits the generation of toxic intermediates shen et al 2009b theoretically molecular imprinting can also exhibit selective oxidation toward intermediates with similar structures morphology and characteristic functional groups here refractory pollutants and their intermediates are subjected to more free radical attacks accelerating the mineralization process of the target pollutants however this process has not been widely reported and confirmed moreso there are few studies on using targeted materials to degrade various intermediates of refractory pollutants secondly similar to the problems associated with traditional nanomaterials imprinted catalysts can also enter organisms from water through enrichment and migration processes li et al 2014 sendra et al 2017 valant et al 2009 usually the biotoxicity of s mip catalysts can be divided into two viz substrate catalyst toxicity and surface imprinted polymer toxicity among them the former has been extensively studied maynard 2006 ochiai and fujishima 2012 in contrast the ecotoxicity of the latter has not received much attention although many organic reagents are used in the process of crosslinking polymerization there are meager reports on the unstable molecular imprint loss and its toxicity effect on the ecosystem on this basis more environmentally friendly catalysts s are being synthesized xu et al 2012 thirdly the emission of quantitated organic matter i e organic solvents functional monomers crosslinking agents etc and the risk of template molecule leakage during the imprinting process would cause some negative irreversible effects on the ecosystem lai et al 2018 in particular the potential risk of highly toxic template molecules may cause incalculable and irreversible damage to organisms such as nerve damage dna damage ecological imbalance etc due to the characteristics of the imprinting process the concentration of pollutants in the system could be hundreds of times higher than found in water in addition the potential toxicity of crosslinkers and functional monomers is also of concern although polyacrylamide has been widely used in water treatment its monomer acrylamide has significant neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity enhancing the degree of polymerization and reducing the emission of oligomers in the imprinting process is another means to reduce the ecotoxicity therefore many scholars have tried to develop low toxicity and high efficiency molecular imprinting methods to solve these problems besides the dynamic simulation calculation has a good application prospect in the process of imprinting system screening aside from finding the optimal imprinting system rapidly it also reduces the use of chemicals 6 challenge and prospect many problems associated with wastewater treatment require attention to improve the target degradation efficiency of refractory pollutants figure 6 the first challenge is the widespread problem of molecularly imprinted materials specifically the improvement of hydrophilicity efficiency of template elution stability of recognition site and rapid establishment of the optimized imprinting system are more critical in wastewater treatment catalyst synthesis erdem et al 2018 madikizela et al 2018 to solve these problems researchers have attempted to improve the degree of crosslinking using different functional monomers to form various imprinting systems for recognition sites and using molecular dynamics calculation to find the optimal imprinting system he et al 2020 li et al 2020b among them computational chemistry can significantly save the time and cost of mip system screening reduce the emission impact on the environment from the mip process rebelo et al 2021 secondly finding low toxic affordable and environmentally friendly catalytic substrates and molecular imprinting systems to ensure the environmental friendliness and engineering feasibility of materials preparation is challenging in water treatment nasrollahzadeh et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however since template molecules and organic solvents need to be added during the imprinting process reducing or recycling organic reagents in the synthesis process must also be considered although the use of pp method can reduce the use of organic solvents the removal of template molecules and organics during the calcination process is worth exploring especially the effect on specific recognition sites and characteristic channels in addition many existing studies use synthetic water containing only the target contaminants or adding a limited variety of environmental disturbances to measure oxidation efficiency where pollutant concentrations are often much higher than the actual conditions and pollutant composition are simple hence more attention should be paid to the research on the removal of pollutants from the actual water with lower concentration and the collaborative degradation of complex pollutants natural organic matter such as humus produced by the decomposition of plants is often in higher concentrations than the pollutants of interest at present some scholars have begun to pay attention to this problem in the application of molecularly imprinted materials in the study of actual wastewater and achieved well results shi et al 2019 however the influences of these factors on mip catalysts for targeted identifying refractory pollutants the activation and oxidation behavior of free radicals have not been thoroughly studied thirdly although magnetic separation technology is used for material recycling it can not solve imprinting layer loss however the loss of catalyst and imprinted layer is inevitable in practical application therefore how to quickly restore reconstruct and enhance the life of the surface molecularly imprinted layer also requires diligent consideration for further research finally although many studies have shown that imprinted catalytic materials can significantly accelerate the degradation of target pollutants the study of mass transfer between components and intermediate ecotoxic in the degradation process has not been studied adequately therefore to control the possible secondary contamination to further optimize the imprinted system and prepare novel imprinted catalysts that can targeted degrade toxic intermediates in aops are also important research contents despite many challenges with the practical application of mip in targeted degradation of refractory pollutants it is worthy of consideration that the technology is advantageous these advantages include a wide range of application prospects especially in the terminal treatment of industrial and domestic wastewater

16680,efficient removal of low concentration refractory pollutants is a crucial problem to ensuring water safety the use of heterogeneous catalysis of molecular imprinting technology combined with traditional catalysts is a promising method to improve removal efficiency presently the research into molecular imprinting targeting catalysts focuses mainly on material preparation and performance optimization however more researchers are investigating other applications of imprinting materials this review provides recent progress in photocatalyst preparation electrocatalyst and fenton like catalysts synthesized by molecular imprinting the principle and control points of target catalysts prepared by precipitation polymerization pp and surface molecular imprinting s mip are introduced also the application of imprinted catalysts in targeted degradation of drugs pesticides environmental hormones and other refractory pollutants is summarized in addition the reusability and stability of imprinted catalyst in water treatment are discussed and the possible ecotoxicity risk is analyzed finally we appraised the prospects challenges and opportunities of imprinted catalysts in the advanced oxidation process this paper provides a reference for the targeted degradation of refractory pollutants and the preparation of targeted catalysts graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment refractory pollutants targeted degradation molecular imprinting advanced oxidation process 1 introduction advanced oxidation process aops has been one of the most widely used techniques for degrading refractory organic compounds in wastewater treatment an et al 2020 brillas 2020 luo et al 2020 olvera vargas et al 2021 in this process oxidants e g o3 h2o2 and persulfate are stimulated by light ultrasound or electricity to produce strong oxidizing radicals oh so4 these free radicals further mineralize pollutants into carbon dioxide water inorganic substances or other benign products he et al 2020 lee et al 2020 liu et al 2020 pan et al 2019 using aops organic pollutants in water can be rapidly oxidized and degraded thereby lowering the effluent cod toc and other indexes so far aop has been rapidly developed and widely used in treating various wastewaters such as those from papermaking shen et al 2018 pharmaceutical wang et al 2016 coking wang and wang 2020 printing and dyeing brillas and martínez huitle 2015 karimifard and alavi moghaddam 2018 industries however with the recent research development on the environmental impact of refractory organic pollutants problems associated with aop have also been exposed studies have shown that numerous refractory organics including antibiotics zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 endocrine disruptors lü et al 2018 sun et al 2018 and pesticides lu and astruc 2020 can be detected even in treated sewages or natural waters these distributed refractory pollutants are characteristically low in concentration and persistent they can be further circulated in the food chain harming humans directly or indirectly the existing challenges of aops for treating low concentration refractory pollutants are as follows first the short life span of free radicals oh 10 μs is a common problem to aops resulting in limited transport distances oh 90 nm zhang et al 2020 whereas refractory pollutants need to be degraded in milliseconds chuang et al 2017 feng et al 2021 moreover oxidation effectiveness often limited by the diffusion boundary layer that controls the mass transport of organic compounds from the bulk to the catalyst surface as a result it is challenging for aop systems to degrade low concentration refractory pollutants effectively secondly the concentrations of natural organic matter and inorganic salt such as hummus cl and co3 2 are usually higher than that of target pollutants leading to free radical quenching hodges et al 2018 these scenarios reduce activation efficiency brame et al 2014 initiating competitive adsorption on the catalyst s surface thereby hindering the aop degradation efficiency brame et al 2015 besides when the active free radicals near the pollutants are insufficient to carry out the subsequent oxidation the intermediate substances are likely to combine with other organic matter or ions to form by products such occurrence hinders the mineralization process and may produce toxins von gunten 2018 for instance the evolution of chlorine species is a critical issue during aops because of the possible formation of toxic by products chlorate or perchlorate zhang et al 2021 therefore it is imperative to ensure an adequate concentration of free radicals to mineralize the refractory pollutants completely considering that traditional aops are relatively expensive monteil et al 2019 thirdly the demerit of a large amount of iron sludge can be managed by using a heterogeneous catalyst generally the rate of free radical generation is slower than that of the homogeneous catalyst due to the restriction of particle morphology structure and limited specific surface area zhang et al 2020 as a result the degradation efficiency of the catalytic system to the low concentration pollutants is further limited therefore improving the efficiency of aops and the degradation rate of low concentration refractory pollutants are critical economic and environmental issues recently many researchers have been committed to developing multifunctional materials that degrade refractory pollutants alvarez et al 2018 for example ph adjustment to control the surface charge qin et al 2012 and surface modification via chemical doping canlas et al 2012 have been tested although these methods can selectively improve pollutant degradation via the incorporation of specific functional groups they exhibit significant limitations in complex water treatments lai et al 2018 shen et al 2012 molecular imprinting mip technology has been applied in sensor technology li et al 2019 drug delivery zhang 2020 adsorption zhou et al 2018 molecular detection samsidar et al 2018 and other fields chen et al 2016 with the increasing need to improve the degradation efficiency of refractory pollutants via aops the preparation of targeted catalytic materials via mip technology has attracted extensive attention figure 1 a kumar et al 2020 wei et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 however this study lacks a systematic overview that summarizes a comprehensive comparison of extensive studies and engineering designs there are many methods of molecular imprinting such as copolymerization precipitation method emulsion method chain transfer technology etc the methods for preparing molecularly imprinted catalysts can be divided into two categories one method is precipitation polymerization pp similar to forming imprinted polymers with traditional molecular imprinting technology in this method the target contaminants are added before the polymerization precipitation as the polymerization occurs the template molecules are enveloped by the catalyst then the template is removed to form the targeted catalytic material to match the template molecular structure with the characteristic pore structure another method is surface molecular imprint s mip this method builds a molecularly imprinted layer on the catalyst thereby improving the selective catalytic capacity different from the pp method the preparation of targeted catalytic by s mip involves three steps viz 1 the functional group and structural complementarities are used to form a non covalent weak interaction between the target pollutant and the functional monomer h n h o electrostatic force etc 2 as the initiator forms the free radicals the crosslinking agent polymerizes to form the imprint surface capable of selectively identifying the target pollutants li et al 2020c shi et al 2019 3 the imprinted surface layer is combined with the heterogeneous catalytic substrate to form a novel catalyst with a specific affinity toward the pollutants fu et al 2020 figure 1b both methods have peculiar merits and demerits for instance despite its popularity easy to use and speed advantages pp cannot remove the template molecules in a catalyst entirely by washing leading to low utilization of active sites and environmental risks from template leakage however the template can be removed entirely by calcination only for preparing metal oxide catalysts such as tio2 and sno2 and not carbon based materials in addition site loss and the imprinted pore collapse could ensue in high temperature calcination s mip can combine with various catalysts to form new catalysts with substrate catalytic and target identification properties gao et al 2008 liu et al 2011 however this method is restricted by many factors impacting the final catalytic effect significantly several scholars have investigated the process of targeted catalysis target degradation of refractory pollutants using imprinted catalytic in water treatment is usually divided into two steps figure 1c 1 materials with specific recognition sites and unique pore structures will selectively enrich target pollutants 2 free radicals will be activated catalytically and degrade the enriched target pollutants according to the traditional catalytic oxidation process sun et al 2019 according to this process the recognition site can accurately concentrate the target contaminants on the surface of the imprinting catalyst thus reducing spatial distance between free radicals and target pollutants hence in the target degradation process the mass transfer distance of the free radical acting on the target pollutant is reduced thereby improving the efficiency he et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 in the last decade with the target degradation of refractory pollutants in wastewater has become increasingly prominent using molecular imprinting technology to improve the efficiency of catalysts has received much attention this paper introduces the study of molecular imprinting technology to enhance the catalytic efficiency of aops and the application of targeted catalytic materials in the degradation of refractory pollutants on this basis the stability bio toxicology opportunities and challenges of applying these materials in water treatment are analyzed 2 modification of catalytic by mip 2 1 preparation of imprinting photocatalytic photocatalytic processes rely on light especially ultraviolet to form a conduction band electron e cb and valence band hole h vb the purpose is to generate o2 via heterogeneous reduction of dissolved o2 by e cb which ultimately produces ho cates 2017 jiang et al 2017 common photocatalysts include tio2 zno sno2 cu2o graphitic carbon nitride metal organic frameworks mofs etc albornoz et al 2021 chong et al 2010 lee et al 2016 li et al 2020 yue et al 2020 being the most widely studied photocatalyst with good application prospects tio2 has the advantages of high stability no corrosion and no toxic by products guo et al 2019 pan et al 2020 wang et al 2019 the modification of tio2 is also widely studied in mip and like most catalysts non specific selectivity is mainly due to the material properties and the generated non selective active radicals guo et al 2019 for the preparation of imprinted tio2 catalyst precipitation polymerization is the most simple and fast method figure 2 a de escobar et al 2016 for instance zhang et al prepared tio2 molecular imprinted material with high exposure 111 crystal surface by adding dimethyl phthalate dmp in the polymerization zhang et al 2020 where the dmp was immersed in the precipitated polymer after calcination to remove the template the structure in the highly exposed 111 crystal plane provides dmp characteristic imprinted pores and improves the photochemical activity of the catalyst the results show that the molecularly imprinted tio2 can specifically recognize the target pollutant and accelerate its oxidation rate while inhibiting the oxidation of coexisting substances elsewhere s mip has been used for selective detection and photodegradation of contaminants such as toxic metals organics such as pesticides and antibiotics achieving satisfactory results in the early 21st century fiorenza et al 2020a lai et al 2016 liu et al 2020 melvin ng et al 2017 qi and wang 2020 tang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 since the selective identification of target contaminants by imprint catalysts usually takes place on the surface the s mip is to improve the utilization efficiency of the identification sites in precipitation polymeric materials different from pp the s mip synthesized imprinting tio2 is usually divided into three steps 1 the template molecule interacts with the functional monomer in a solvent to form precursor prepolymer 2 tio2 is added to the mixing system and the surface imprinted layer is formed by crosslinking polymerization usually by controlling the initiation of temperature or uv irradiation 3 elution of template molecule lai et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 in the synthesis process the first and second steps are crucial to the material s selectivity toward pollutants however this process is affected by many factors such as functional monomer crosslinking agent polymerization time polymer mixture ratio and temperature ashley et al 2017 therefore all these factors need to be optimized to obtain ideal imprint tio2 catalysts previous results show that s mip can combine with various photocatalysts such as zno cantarella et al 2018 cofe2o4 carbon nanotubes guan et al 2021 bipo4 nanocubes amiri et al 2020 cofe f he et al 2019 bipo4 go kumar et al 2020 and graphene oxide go fe iii composite coating chen et al 2020 exhibit improved photocatalytic performances at the same time the characteristics of s mip such as easy to operate and the protection of substrate material make the synthesis and application more diverse than that of traditional steps for instance with p123 as a functional monomer and atrazine as a template the prepolymer can be used to form targeted recognition sites and as a template for mesoporous materials in subsequent processes figure 2b by removing template molecules the pore surface of mesoporous tio2 has atrazine specific recognition sites and characteristic pores shi et al 2019 also highly stable catalysts can be obtained via the emulsion polymerization method here the oil phase which played an important role in the synthesis comprises the monomer crosslinkers ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and trimethylolpropane trimetha crylate and toluene subsequently the 50 100 μm microspheres were formed using go nanosheets as stabilizers by removing the template a highly stable catalytic material is formed chen et al 2020 to some extent this method combines pp with s mip to expand the application of molecular imprinting and form high specific surface area imprinted catalysts although mip can significantly improve the specificity of photocatalysts some associated problems require further study it is necessary to study whether the imprinted layer on the surface will affect the activation via uv irradiation and whether the substrate s surface is stable under the irradiation figure 2c for instance cui et al investigated catalyst stability and uv effect on the imprinting layer lai et al 2018 they found that light radiation has no essential impact on forming the molecular imprinted layer structure and its stability can be maintained even under uv at the same time the results showed that the imprinted pore channel structure closely influences the imprinted layer stability given the above problems the available reports are not comprehensive proving inconclusive mechanisms 2 2 preparation of imprinting electrocatalyst electrochemical advanced oxidation processes are one method that most directly converts energy input to pollutant oxidation the oxidation process is carried out by applying an electric potential to the positive and negative electrodes in a reactor organic compounds can be oxidized directly through charge transfer occurring on the electrode surface and indirectly through the oxidizing agents generated by the electrochemical reactions feng et al 2020 ganiyu et al 2020 hodges et al 2018 in electrocatalysis the electrode is a crucial component of the electrochemical reactor since the electrochemical reaction occurs at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte the targeting property of the electrode determines the removal efficiency of refractory pollutants therefore researchers focus on the development of molecularly imprinted electrodes with various characteristics although most research has been based on electrochemical sensors ahmad et al 2019 anantha iyengar et al 2019 karimi maleh et al 2021 with the complexity of pollutants in wastewater and the severity of removing refractory pollutants the development of electrode materials with high speed sensitivity and specificity has attracted much attention in recent years niu et al 2020 aside from the imprinting photocatalyst method s mip is used as electrodes with enhanced basic morphology with similar steps to pp for instance using bisphenol a as the template molecule chai et al immersed boron doped diamond in precursor solution containing 0 03 m tioso4 and 2 4 mm bpa ph 1 3 the results showed that 40 80 nm spindle shaped tio2 particles are densely grown on the boron doped diamond substrate after soaking at 80 c for 24 h chai et al 2012 further spectrometric analyses revealed that bpa molecules were successfully imprinted on the tio2 substrate and calcination formed specific recognition sites on the template transient photocurrent response experiments confirmed that mip tio2 nanoelectrode has excellent photoelectrocatalytic activity and selectivity although the modification in the study adopted pp it was similar to the s mip method by using tio2 as the crosslinking agent thus maintaining the morphology of the bdd substrate similar to photocatalyst synthesis the s mip can combine with a variety of electrodes such as metals metal oxides wang et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 carbon based electrodes multi walled carbon nanotubes graphite anirudhan et al 2018 fan et al 2018 and conductive copolymer electrodes figure 3 a kumar et al 2019 okhokhonin used carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes with ni as an electrocatalyst and the self assembling electrostatic property of polyethyleneimine to crosslink with glutaric dialdehyde as a molecularly imprinted layer resulting in glucose oxidation electrode with good electrocatalytic activity and high stability okhokhonin et al 2021 similarly by electropolymerization liu prepared mip films modified by polyformaldehyde on the electrode surface using 2 4 dichlorophenol as template and o phenylenediamine as the monomer figure 3b liu et al 2019 elsewhere niu prepared a novel molecular imprinted facet sno2 mi sno2 electrode niu et al 2020 under 1 8 v nitrophenol can be degraded effectively from industrial wastewater as a result the ratio of bod5 to codcr bod5 codcr increased from 0 186 to 0 412 after electrode pretreatment and the biodegradability was significantly enhanced figure 3c the imprinted modified electrode has some advantages firstly the molecular layer enriching the target molecule can act as a medium between the target pollutants and the electrode which enhanced electrode efficiency secondly due to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity from the specificity of the interaction between the modified material and the target molecule the targeting ability is significantly enhanced when the electrode material has a large surface area this is because when the specific surface area of the material substrate is larger more imprinting polymerization can occur on the material surface and more recognition sites are exposed thirdly the fouling effect on the electrode surface can be reduced by rapid diffusion and enrichment of target molecules on the electrode surface ali et al 2019 sharma et al 2018 however there are still some problems in the preparation of targeted electrodes one of the critical issues of molecular imprinting on the electrode surface is the lack of conductivity and electrolytic activity of the imprinted layer which directly affects the feasibility of imprinted electrodes therefore making the electrode material have excellent conductivity and electrolytic activity while having being selective is a research prospect anantha iyengar et al 2019 cui et al 2020 some researchers have realized and started to solve this problem for instance gold nanoparticles are embedded in the mip coating to improve conductivity xue et al 2014 or the thickness of the imprinted layer is controlled to reduce the mass transfer resistance zheng et al 2018 besides by using high temperature calcination 400 c to remove the organic template can solve the lack of electrical conductivity and electrolysis activity issues from imprint layer however this method can only be applied to synthesizing some known metal oxide electrochemical materials using pp method such as sno2 niu et al 2020 other electrode materials such as conductive polymers and carbon based electrodes are less reported requiring further study in particular carbon based materials are not suitable for activation by high temperature calcination because of the severe damage to the material structure and morphology 2 3 preparation of imprinting fenton like heterogeneous catalytic materials heterogeneous catalysts have the advantages of high catalytic efficiency high stability and easy recovery a transition metal is usually used as the main reaction center for such catalysts for instance fe based materials have been extensively studied due to their high environmental abundance and low toxicity chi et al 2019 wang et al 2016 studies on other metals such as cu mn and co have also been widely reported deng et al 2013 feng et al 2016 however few studies are on the preparation of heterogeneous transition metal catalysts metal oxides zero valent metals composite metals mofs by pp most reports focused on combining electrochemical and photochemical materials mainly using zno sno2 and tio2 as the photocatalysts this may because the template molecules added in pp will affect the microstructure of the catalyst and the conditions required for the catalyst such as solubility synthesis temperature and synthesis conditions are also relatively strict on the contrary s mip can form an imprinting layer on the surface of heterogeneous catalysts without significant structural damage in addition s mip also provide a good foundation for the targeted degradation of refractory pollutants due to its advantages of easy separation high specific surface area and good catalytic performance shi and lin 2019 wei et al 2020 as a result s mip researchers are delving more into using metal oxides and mofs in recent years he et al 2020 li et al 2020a tang and wang 2018 there are two major problems associated with molecular imprinting on heterogeneous catalysts 1 the material agglomerate easily after molecular imprinting reducing the specific surface area thereby leading to limited catalytic performance despite the improved specificity this is mainly due to the high concentration of crosslinking agent however the polymerization process at low crosslinker concentration is slow and it is difficult to form an effective surface imprinted layer 2 the thickness of the imprinted layer directly affects the catalytic performance of the materials and the oxide transport because the free radicals activated by the transition metal exist for a short time and their linear transport distance is limited in other words too thick imprinted layer may lead to the catalytic capacity of the targeted catalyst reduced therefore these two conditions should be considered in the modification process of a heterogeneous catalyst especially s mip some researchers use porous materials with large specific surface areas for s mip as a countermeasure for instance the s mip process of fe zeolite can effectively protect the specific surface area of the material although some agglomeration may occur zhang et al 2017 in addition mofs can ensure a high specific surface area and improved binding figure 4 a between the organic skeleton and the crosslinker via a weak interaction such as van der waals force bagheri et al 2019 mohammadnejad et al 2018 tan and zeng 2017 on the other hand the regular nanopores 2 50 nm of mofs enable them to form molecular imprinting layers inside and outside the pores by selecting appropriate imprinting systems the imprinted catalytic materials prepared by this method usually have a high specific surface area as we have researched earlier li et al 2020c in our research s mip catalysts were synthesized by using fe mil 100 fe mofs and carbonized derivatives as substrate we observed that the molecular imprint layer formed on the catalyst surface and in the pore channels although adding crosslinkers usually causes agglomeration controlling the crosslinker concentration reduces the defect thereby reducing the inhibition of free radical transfer by the imprinted layer figure 4b other studies have significantly improved the removal efficiency of phthalate esters in simulated and actual wastewaters li et al 2020b c however the imprinting layer has several effects on the targeted degradation efficiency of the catalyst these include the pore structure of the imprinted layer and the unique electronic environment although these factors play a significant role in the rapid and accurate degradation of target pollutants they have not received enough research attention the research on these problems can further accelerate the identification efficiency and targeted degradation rate of imprinted materials to target pollutants 3 degradation of refractory pollutants by mip catalytic targeted degradation of refractory pollutants is a synergistic process of selective adsorption and catalysis in this process target pollutants and identification sites in imprinted catalyst were combined with weak interaction besides the pore morphology of the imprinted layer can match the target pollutant which can accurately find and seize as a result the local concentration of refractory pollutants on the surface of the material increases at the same time the activated free radicals degrade the target pollutants identified on the surface of the catalysts with the closest distance and high concentration therefore the influence of refractory pollutants degradation efficiency is usually divided into two parts 1 accuracy of identification sites of imprinted catalyst to target contaminants 2 activation and mass transfer ability of the catalyst to free radicals for the first part the identification of accuracy is usually based on the group and structural characteristics of different pollutants to carry out extensive screening for the second the control of the mass transfer capacity includes the catalytic properties of the substrate the imprinted modified crosslinking agent and the control of the mass transfer environment therefore targeted degradation of different pollutants usually requires the establishment of different imprinting catalytic systems to achieve better targeted degradation effect 3 1 targeted degradation of drugs and ppcps recent extensive research includes problems associated with residual drugs and personal care products ppcps in the environment including the most commonly used antibiotics antihypertensive drugs lipid lowering drugs analgesics preservatives etc zhao et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 these drugs are often widely distributed in industrial production and municipal water treatment systems due to the usual trace concentrations in water their removal via traditional oxidative degradation is limited in recent years mip catalyst has been adopted to improve the targeted degradation of refractory pollutants table 1 among these refractory pollutants to degrade antibiotics have attracted more attention in recent years due to their antibacterial property and the tendency to cause organism mutation kumar et al 2021 meng et al 2021 studies have shown that mip catalysts can significantly improve the targeted degradation efficiency of various ppcps and antibiotics the target degradation capacity of mip catalyst is significantly increased by 100 800 than those of traditional materials table 1 mostly interestingly with a better understanding of the mechanism and performance of catalysts and the optimization of the imprinting system in recent years the specificity of mip catalysts has been continuously improved for instance for ciprofloxacin cip degradation huo used ethylene glycol dimethacrylate egdma as crosslinker and acrylamide as the molecular template to synthesize surface molecularly imprinted catalyst in 2012 huo et al 2012 during the preparation process the nh2 structure of the functional monomer acrylamide first interacts with the n c c o and other characteristic functional groups in cip to form hydrogen bonds such as h o c c f h electrostatic force and other weak interactions after that the imprinted catalyst with cip characteristic pores are formed by the addition of photocatalytic substrate and the cross linking agent using 2 2 azobisisobutyronitrile aibn as initiating agent the results showed that the adsorption and photodegradation selectivity of imprinted photocatalyst on the molecular template ciprofloxacin was higher than that of the non imprinted photocatalyst under visible light irradiation the degradation rate of the molecular template can reach 70 within 60 min with the development of surface imprinting technology and the optimization of the catalytic system li et al prepared an imprinted tio2 catalyst in 2020 using methacrylic acid maa as the functional monomer and trimethylpropanol trimethacrylate trim as crosslinker li et al 2020 by contrast in this study n h and c oh in cip can form more kinds of hydrogen bonds with maa nh o and oh o which can provide more recognition sites and makes the targeted catalytic process of cip more accurate the catalyst has selectivity coefficients of 7 2 and 3 2 for ciprofloxacin adsorption and photocatalysis respectively superior to that of competitive pollutant sulfamethoxazole smz the molecular imprinting technology improved the removal rate of ciprofloxacin significantly to 99 and the catalytic reaction rate increased from 0 01892 to 0 025 min 1 much higher than results from previous studies furthermore materials synthesized by pp and s mip can significantly increase the ability of targeted catalysis however even mip catalysts prepared with the same method would exhibit different degradation efficiencies for instance the mip catalysts of various antibiotics and drugs prepared by escobar using the pp method have differ significantly in their targeted degradation efficiency against different pollutants de escobar et al 2016 it was reported that the three dimensional cavity formed by the pp method is not the best choice because it cannot achieve the ideal targeted degradation effect as an example several reports have shown that tetracycline structure contains characteristic functional groups such as benzene ring carboxyl group hydroxyl group c o c c and nh2 whereas the pp method usually prepares materials that lack functional groups that interact with the active functional groups such as hydrogen bonds electrostatic force π π stack etc guo et al 2018 he et al 2020 usually the metal oxide catalyst this method forms needs to be calcined at 400 c to achieve hydroxyl condensation and remove the template chai et al 2012 shi et al 2019 which reduces the limited recognition sites therefore to overcome this problem the pp method of catalytic materials at lower temperatures is investigated although changing the synthesis method is tedious for instance cantarella obtained nano sized mip zno materials by adding paracetamol in zno synthesis and fixing the ratio at 5 1 here a high temperature calcination process was avoided and the vacuum drying was carried out at 140 c which protected the characteristic channels and the effective recognition sites cantarella et al 2018 the catalyst synthesized by s mip also showed varied degradation efficiencies against refractory pollutants depending on the types of functional monomers solvents and crosslinker concentrations li et al 2020 liu et al 2013 imprinting components in the s mip process usually contain carboxyl ester amino and other functional groups such as maa acrylamide with a variety of recognition sites therefore theoretically the materials formed by s mip favorably promote targeted catalytic ability in theory however such an outcome is not certain because of the different characteristic structures of the pollutants leading to various optimal imprinting systems for s mip identifying the optimal imprint system is complicated mainly because of the unlimited combinations in theory between functional monomers solvents and crosslinkers on this basis it is more challenging to screen suitable s mip components for substrate catalysts therefore it is essential to identify the binding sites of target pollutants and the weak interaction in s mip components to build an imprinting system to improve the targeted catalytic performance 3 2 targeted degradation of hormones pollutant environmental hormones are endocrine disrupting chemicals which affect the normal hormonal secretions in humans and animals these substances lead to abnormal hormone regulation in the human body resulting in developmental disorders reproductive abnormalities organ diseases increased teratogenicity male reproductive disorders and other problems brander et al 2016 khanal et al 2006 liu and mabury 2020 environmental hormones consist of estrogens plasticizers pesticides and flame retardants one of the endocrine disruptors closely related to humans is phthalate esters paes gómez hens and aguilar caballos 2003 zhang et al 2018 as a plasticizer paes are widely used in hundreds of everyday products such as toys food packaging medical blood bags vinyl flooring wallpaper detergents lubricants personal care products such as nail polish hair gel soap shampoo etc due to their limited water solubility and biodegradability it is crucial to improve the degradation efficiency of these pollutants recently the use of mip to enhance the effectiveness of paes targeted degradation has also been studied for instance by adding dimethyl phthalate dmp as a molecular template in electrode synthesis zhao et al prepared an active iron doped carbon aerogel imprint catalyst to degrade paes zhao et al 2017 at first 90 of dmp was adsorbed on the surface of the dmp imprinted afec electrode and following dmp was proceed degradation with a final removal rate of 98 graphene layer with amorphous carbon generated in the material can produce strong π π and hydrophobic interactions with dmp enhancing the affinity for dmp and improving the removal efficiency two folds earlier ding prepared dmp imprinted catalyst by depositing mofs on molecularly imprinted polymers ding et al 2020 the results showed that the dmp selective adsorption ability of the catalyst was highly enhanced also the catalytic rate of the molecularly imprinted catalyst increased 1 5 times indicating that selective adsorption was crucial the proposed mechanism involves the selective adsorption of dmp on the catalyst through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction then it is degraded by active free radicals generated by persulfate ps activation the persulfate activation process is shown in the following equations 1 fe ii s2o8 2 fe iii so4 so4 2 2 so4 h2o oh h so4 2 unlike the other refractory pollutants containing amino or hydroxyl groups the characteristic functional groups in paes are esters and benzene rings devoid of hydrogen bond binding sites hence the molecular imprinting process needs to consider the availability of hydrogen bond donors such as using acrylic acid as the optimal monomer to provide hydrogen bond and reduce the hydrophobic force of methyl groups on this basis we used fe mofs with relatively large specific surface area mil 100 and optimize the transport distance of active substance by controlling the molecularly imprinted layer for improved catalytic performance of diethyl phthalate dep catalyst the efficiency of the active substance persulfate was also improved three folds over than that of the traditional conditions li et al 2020c in addition we also observed the adsorption and desorption of the oxidizer in the molecularly imprinted layer indicating that the layer contributes positively to the efficiency of the oxidizer as a result the dep degradation efficiency of the catalyst can also be improved 70 under lower oxidant conditions 11 1 molar ratio and complex actual water environment li et al 2020b the target degradation of other hormonal pollutants such as ethyl hydroxybenzoate 4 9 aminononyl pheno and ethylparaben has also been studied zhan successfully prepared a dawson type nanocomposite catalyst using ethylparaben as the template by impregnation segmentalized acidification and sol gel methods zhan et al 2020 the results show that the specific surface area and pore volume of molecularly imprinted tio2 increased after modification at the same time the photogenerated electron hole pair composite catalyst and the imprinted hole modified tio2 have stronger photoactivity than the pristine tio2 as a result the highest photoactivity and the optimal dosage on the catalyst was 0 25 wt resulting in ethylparaben photodegradation efficiency of 87 32 and 89 82 under uv for 70 min and visible light for 40 h irradiation respectively zhu et al used pp method to prepare mip catalyst ag zn mip tio2 with ethyl p hydroxybenzoate as the imprinted template zhu et al 2020 they reported that ag zn mip tio2 exhibited a high selective catalytic performance using three angles of uv vis multi wavelength viz spectral integral area change specific group absorbance change and traditional reaction kinetic parameter change as a result the photocatalytic degradation of ethyl p hydroxybenzoate for 2 h was 99 1 significantly higher than that of non imprint catalyst 3 3 targeted degradation of pesticides pesticides play a vital role in preventing pests and diseases while maintaining agricultural outputs however due to their complex structures and indiscriminate use pesticides and insecticides flow into rivers and lakes with rainwater and farmland drainage polluting the water bodies and harming aquatic organisms barletta et al 2019 coleman et al 2020 silva et al 2019 due to the carcinogenic teratogenic mutagenic endocrine disruptive hazards posed by organic pesticides several studies have been done on their selective treatment de barros et al 2021 veerakumar et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the use of mip technology to improve the degradation efficiency of organic pesticides has also been widely reported typical pesticides such as 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d atrazine and organophosphorus pesticides have been widely studied shi et al 2019 2015 tang et al 2018 wang et al shi et al 2015 wang et al 2019 used polypyridine ligand n 4 vinylbenzyl bis 2 pyridyl amine as a functional monomer to prepare nanocapsule imprinted material with high catalytic efficiency to degrade methyl parathion as a result the degradation rate was 355 times higher than that in a natural environment in a further study the hydrolysis rate of pesticides was further accelerated 415 times by controlling the imprinting system of alcohol assisted functional monomers using 2 4 d as target pollutant and template tang et al prepared molecular imprinted mesoporous sno2 electrode and two dimensional photocatalyst tio2 tang et al 2018 they found that both materials can achieve selective and efficient removal of 2 4 d in complex and neutral environment samples tang et al 2020 for mip sno2 degradation system 2 4 d concentration decreased to 54 ppb after 6 h in various coexisting sewage systems the selective adsorption of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by tio2 photoelectric material was 1 08 10 9 mol cm2 mg 1 and the vertically arranged single crystal nanoarrays had excellent photocatalytic oxidation performance shi et al further elaborated the mechanism of selective removal of atrazine using molecularly imprinted catalysts shi et al 2019 their results show that mip catalyst enhanced selective photochemical oxidation of atrazine due to the molecular imprinted sites on the catalyst surface these sites can act as surface structural defects accelerating the separation of photogenerated holes and electrons and enhancing the generation of hydroxyl radicals in addition the local concentration of contaminants on the electrode surface increased due to the multiple hydrogen and halogen bonds formed between the molecular imprinted site and atrazine as a result the contact probability of atrazine with free radical components increased and the degradation rate was improved 3 4 targeted degradation of dyes and other chemical intermediates dye wastewater is characterized by large volume high coloration poor bio degradability and high toxicity chandel et al 2020 huang et al 2020 ismail et al 2019 lops et al 2019 to degrade methyl green and auramine o dyes amiri synthesized a high surface area dual inorganic mip catalyst they used a sol gel method to coat a layer of molecularly imprinted ag2o cuo they reported that the coexisting conditions of the imprinted sites toward mg and ao selective recognition and degradation were well preserved amiri et al 2020 by using methylene blue as a template fang et al synthesized mip nano fe2o3 materials via pp and hydrothermal methods the results showed that the photocatalytic activity of fe2o3 for methylene blue increased by 168 with strong specificity fang et al 2016 wei et al prepared an imprinted catalyst by coupling tio2 photocatalytic substrate and magnetic fe3o4 with methyl orange using template molecule pyrrole as functional monomer the material evinced high degradation efficiency and rapid separation toward dyes it showed excellent catalytic reusability and stability and increased effectiveness in low light environments it is also susceptible to chemical modification to ensure a green and low cost material more rapid and efficient for degradation of dyes in industrial printing and dyeing wastewater wei et al 2015 targeted removal of some chemical intermediates has also been researched intensively chai et al 2012 luo et al 2013 these intermediates are usually useful in the synthesis of organic matter or as corresponding by products as a result such materials often carry the same or higher environmental risks toxicity than their chemical products for instance due to its substantial toxicity and carcinogenicity 2 nitrophenol and 4 nitrophenol are used as intermediates of pesticides these intermediates are also found in pharmaceuticals dyes and other fine chemicals such as sulfur dyes paracetamol organophosphate insecticides etc atta et al 2012 elshafei et al 2018 zou et al 2019 aiming to remove such pollutants using magnetic separation zhang prepared fe3o4 al2o3 molecularly imprinted tio2 nanocomposites using multiple steps zhang et al 2015 compared with unimprinted catalyst molecular imprinted tio2 has better photocatalytic selectivity for 2 nitrophenol attributed to the chemical interactions and size matching between the template molecules and the imprinted cavities elsewhere shen et al prepared 2 nitrophenol and 4 nitrophenol imprint catalysts as templates to reduce environmental impact shen et al 2008 the results showed that when the concentration of the target pollutant decreased and or when the difference in the structures of the target and other molecules was intensified the enhanced photocatalytic selectivity was significantly improved besides mip could inhibit the accumulation of intermediates indicating that the target material also had an excellent inhibition against catalytic intermediates although molecular imprinting technology has been applied for preparing targeted catalytic materials and achieved remarkable efficiencies there are still few reports most of which are based on the improvement of targeted degradation performance of refractory pollutants however there is a meager discussion on the mechanism of material preparation and targeted catalysis in particular few in depth analyses exist on the weak interaction between imprinted systems and the mass transfer of various components of the catalysis however these research contents directly affect the efficiency of targeted degradation of related refractory pollutants in addition the types of targeted degradation of refractory pollutants that have been reported are extremely limited however pollutants usually exist in the form of coexistence of multiple pollutants in the environment and there are few reports on the targeted degradation of refractory pollutants in the complex actual water environment 4 stability and reusability the stability and reusability of imprinted catalyst are the key issues that determine whether imprinted catalyst can be applied specifically the stability and reusability of s mip are worthier of discussion than those of the pp method because of the surface imprinted layer formed by the crosslinked polymerization of organic matter which contains several functional groups whether the organic components will be affected by the aop is the key issue that directly leads to the long term application of the material according to ft ir and sem characterization the surface morphology and characteristic functional groups of the mip material did not change significantly after ten cycles yuan et al 2020 similarly escobar ran six cycles on the imprinted catalyst and reported excellent performance and reusability although the total removal rate of the imprinted catalyst for the target pollutants decreased the imprinted factor if of the catalyst substrate maintained a higher level indicating that the catalyst was efficient de escobar et al 2018 furthermore sun studied the stability and reusability of the prepared photocatalysts sun et al 2019 the results showed that the removal rate of the non molecularly imprinted material decreased by 20 after four cycles while that of the surface imprinted material decreased by 5 the above studies indicate that the imprinted layer formed by the organic crosslinker is highly dense and can resist the aggregation of free radicals thereby exhibiting good stability in practical applications although many studies have investigated the recycling of targeted catalysts the surface imprinted layer is usually a polymeric material its stability depends on the number of functional monomeric recognition sites and templates therefore the proportion of functional monomers the number of template molecules and the ratio of crosslinking agent concentration in the imprinted system affect the stability of the imprinted layer however there are few studies on these conditions for mip prepared with different targeted catalysts in addition the theoretical basis for maintaining the stability of the imprinted layer during aop has not been thoroughly studied 5 ecotoxicological effects of mip catalysts although mip performs better on targeted degradation of refractory pollutants than traditional catalytic does their associated ecotoxicity has not been extensively studied lai et al 2018 the ecotoxicity of targeted materials is mainly reflected in three aspects figure 5 first more toxic intermediate products are generated during pollutant degradation by aop chaves et al 2020 trovó et al 2011 this situation has not been adequately researched as regards targeted catalytic degradation although some related studies exist for instance shen et al analyzed the targeted degradation of pentachlorophenol by intermediate analysis and toxicity assessment their results showed that the imprinted catalyst accelerates the photocatalytic degradation of pentachlorophenol and significantly inhibits the generation of toxic intermediates shen et al 2009b theoretically molecular imprinting can also exhibit selective oxidation toward intermediates with similar structures morphology and characteristic functional groups here refractory pollutants and their intermediates are subjected to more free radical attacks accelerating the mineralization process of the target pollutants however this process has not been widely reported and confirmed moreso there are few studies on using targeted materials to degrade various intermediates of refractory pollutants secondly similar to the problems associated with traditional nanomaterials imprinted catalysts can also enter organisms from water through enrichment and migration processes li et al 2014 sendra et al 2017 valant et al 2009 usually the biotoxicity of s mip catalysts can be divided into two viz substrate catalyst toxicity and surface imprinted polymer toxicity among them the former has been extensively studied maynard 2006 ochiai and fujishima 2012 in contrast the ecotoxicity of the latter has not received much attention although many organic reagents are used in the process of crosslinking polymerization there are meager reports on the unstable molecular imprint loss and its toxicity effect on the ecosystem on this basis more environmentally friendly catalysts s are being synthesized xu et al 2012 thirdly the emission of quantitated organic matter i e organic solvents functional monomers crosslinking agents etc and the risk of template molecule leakage during the imprinting process would cause some negative irreversible effects on the ecosystem lai et al 2018 in particular the potential risk of highly toxic template molecules may cause incalculable and irreversible damage to organisms such as nerve damage dna damage ecological imbalance etc due to the characteristics of the imprinting process the concentration of pollutants in the system could be hundreds of times higher than found in water in addition the potential toxicity of crosslinkers and functional monomers is also of concern although polyacrylamide has been widely used in water treatment its monomer acrylamide has significant neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity enhancing the degree of polymerization and reducing the emission of oligomers in the imprinting process is another means to reduce the ecotoxicity therefore many scholars have tried to develop low toxicity and high efficiency molecular imprinting methods to solve these problems besides the dynamic simulation calculation has a good application prospect in the process of imprinting system screening aside from finding the optimal imprinting system rapidly it also reduces the use of chemicals 6 challenge and prospect many problems associated with wastewater treatment require attention to improve the target degradation efficiency of refractory pollutants figure 6 the first challenge is the widespread problem of molecularly imprinted materials specifically the improvement of hydrophilicity efficiency of template elution stability of recognition site and rapid establishment of the optimized imprinting system are more critical in wastewater treatment catalyst synthesis erdem et al 2018 madikizela et al 2018 to solve these problems researchers have attempted to improve the degree of crosslinking using different functional monomers to form various imprinting systems for recognition sites and using molecular dynamics calculation to find the optimal imprinting system he et al 2020 li et al 2020b among them computational chemistry can significantly save the time and cost of mip system screening reduce the emission impact on the environment from the mip process rebelo et al 2021 secondly finding low toxic affordable and environmentally friendly catalytic substrates and molecular imprinting systems to ensure the environmental friendliness and engineering feasibility of materials preparation is challenging in water treatment nasrollahzadeh et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however since template molecules and organic solvents need to be added during the imprinting process reducing or recycling organic reagents in the synthesis process must also be considered although the use of pp method can reduce the use of organic solvents the removal of template molecules and organics during the calcination process is worth exploring especially the effect on specific recognition sites and characteristic channels in addition many existing studies use synthetic water containing only the target contaminants or adding a limited variety of environmental disturbances to measure oxidation efficiency where pollutant concentrations are often much higher than the actual conditions and pollutant composition are simple hence more attention should be paid to the research on the removal of pollutants from the actual water with lower concentration and the collaborative degradation of complex pollutants natural organic matter such as humus produced by the decomposition of plants is often in higher concentrations than the pollutants of interest at present some scholars have begun to pay attention to this problem in the application of molecularly imprinted materials in the study of actual wastewater and achieved well results shi et al 2019 however the influences of these factors on mip catalysts for targeted identifying refractory pollutants the activation and oxidation behavior of free radicals have not been thoroughly studied thirdly although magnetic separation technology is used for material recycling it can not solve imprinting layer loss however the loss of catalyst and imprinted layer is inevitable in practical application therefore how to quickly restore reconstruct and enhance the life of the surface molecularly imprinted layer also requires diligent consideration for further research finally although many studies have shown that imprinted catalytic materials can significantly accelerate the degradation of target pollutants the study of mass transfer between components and intermediate ecotoxic in the degradation process has not been studied adequately therefore to control the possible secondary contamination to further optimize the imprinted system and prepare novel imprinted catalysts that can targeted degrade toxic intermediates in aops are also important research contents despite many challenges with the practical application of mip in targeted degradation of refractory pollutants it is worthy of consideration that the technology is advantageous these advantages include a wide range of application prospects especially in the terminal treatment of industrial and domestic wastewater

16681,landfill leachate is a complicated organic wastewater generated in the sanitary landfilling process landfill leachate must be appropriately disposed to avoid ecotoxicity and environmental damage an in depth understanding of the physiochemical characteristics and environmental behaviors of landfill leachate is essential for its effective treatment in this study recent advances on the properties of landfill leachate its characterization methods and treatment techniques are critically reviewed specifically the up to date spectroscopic techniques for landfill leachate characterization and advanced oxidation treatment techniques are highlighted moreover the drawbacks and challenges of current techniques for landfill leachate characterization and treatment are

inherent water in waste which contains large amounts of dissolved organic matter dom salts heavy metal ions and other organic compounds e g chlorinated aliphatics and pesticides liu et al 2015 landfill leachate has been generally found toxic presenting potential threats to the surrounding environment and ecosystems baderna et al 2019 leachate dom can affect microbial activity cause membrane fouling decrease the effluent quality of coagulation process interact with organic contaminants and change the fate of heavy metals in their transport behavior stability and bioavailability yang et al 2019 therefore it is imperative to develop effective treatment technologies to remove dom from landfill leachate various technologies including biological treatments e g activated sludge and fluidized bed reactor processes chemical treatments e g fenton process chemical precipitation and physical chemical treatments e g adsorption and membrane processes have been developed for the treatment of landfill leachate however a tradeoff is typically required between treatment performance and the cost associated with these techniques an in depth understanding of the composition of landfill leachate and its variation and degradation characteristics is important for landfill leachate treatment since 2000 the number of publications on landfill leachate has been increased steadily and a critical review on the characterization and treatment of landfill leachate can help to advance the development in this field the existing literature reviews on landfill leachate can be divided into three types one is focused on the treatment techniques of landfill leachate renou et al 2008 while the connections between leachate properties characterizations and treatment efficiencies have not been systematically discussed the second is mainly about a certain type of treatment approach such as fenton ozone related advanced treatment electrochemical processes and membrane techniques li et al 2010a fernandes et al 2015 dabaghian et al 2018 or a certain type of pollutant such as ultraviolet quenching substances and heavy metals carvajal flórez and cardona gallo 2019 iskander et al 2018 which are too specialized the third type summarizes various characterization methods nebbioso and piccolo 2013 but lacks the discussion in actual landfill leachate therefore this review aims to present a compendium of the characterization methods and treatment technologies for landfill leachate specifically the evolution of molecular spectroscopic techniques for characterizing monitoring dom in landfill leachate and advanced oxidation techniques for landfill leachate treatment are highlighted moreover the main shortcomings and limitations of the current treatment techniques and analytical approaches for landfill leachate are discussed and suggestions on addressing these defects are envisaged in addition ideas and directions for developing and improving treatment technologies and structural characterization during the treatment process are presented 2 properties of landfill leachate in general landfill leachate is characterized by conventional parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc biochemical oxygen demand bod suspended solids ph ammonia nh4 n and heavy metal concentrations the ratios of bod5 cod and cod toc are typical indicators for the biodegradability of organic compounds and the oxidized state of organic carbon the quality of landfill leachate is affected by various factors such as the waste type operational conditions climate hydrogeology and landfill age dabaghian et al 2018 the characteristics of landfill leachate exhibit considerable differences due to variations in refuse composition and moisture content as well as seasonal factors such as temperature and precipitation costa et al 2019 the higher temperatures in summer result in lower cod and doc concentrations while ph total nitrogen and electrical conductivity are usually higher in winter than in summer in contrast oxidation reduction potential and the concentrations of metals total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids exhibit no significant seasonal variation zhao et al 2013 the ratio of absorbance at 254 nm to toc concentration suva254 indicates the degree of aromaticity in landfill leachate and exhibits significant seasonal difference which is higher in summer than in winter yang et al 2019 as a result dom derived from leachate contains a higher proportion of aromatic structure in summer probably owing to greater efficiency of landfill biodegradation under higher temperature conditions landfill age is a key factor that can affect the composition and properties of landfill leachate landfill leachate can be divided into three categories according to landfill age as shown in fig 1 leachate with less than 5 years age is classified as young leachate whereas medium leachate is 5 10 years old and old leachate is generated for more than ten years miao et al 2019 young landfill leachate is mainly composed of low molecular weight hydrophilic organic matter with a low ph value and high biodegradability index bod5 cod in comparison ha and fa with high molecular weights are the predominant components of old landfill leachate resulting in an elevated ph value and low biodegradability index notably heavy metal concentrations tend to decline with aging as the increased ph value reduces the solubility of metals according to different criteria dom can be divided into distinct fractions which respond differently to various treatments depending on the emittance of fluorescence dom fractions can be categorized as either chromophoric dom cdom or fluorescent dom fdom helms et al 2009 cdom is an important part of the total dom which has a strong absorption of uv and visible light resulting in the dark color of solution lozinski et al 2019 fdom is a small part of the total dom due to the difference in solubility of landfill leachate dom in different solvents three fractions can be isolated by the combination of xad 8 resin and cation exchange resin classified as humic acid ha fulvic acid fa and hydrophilic hpi fractions zhang et al 2013 furthermore four fractions including hydrophilic component hydrophobic base hydrophobic neutral and hydrophobic acid can be isolated from landfill leachate using the xad 8 resin method based on hydrophobicity he et al 2016 it has previously been demonstrated that the hydrophobic fraction of dom is rich in aromatic moieties which contributes to the formation of disinfection byproducts during chlorination korshin et al 2007 dom can also be classified into biodegradable and non biodegradable fractions the non biodegradable fractions mainly consist of humic substances originating from the condensation and polymerization of microbial degradation byproducts iskander et al 2018 in contrast biodegradable organic matter mainly comes from the initial decomposition of organic solid waste this fraction is composed of simple carbon chained structures and can be easily removed by biological treatment processes in recent years emerging organic contaminants eocs such as persistent organic pollutants endocrine disrupting chemicals pharmaceutical and personal care products antibiotic resistance genes and disinfection by products have attracted significant attention due to their ubiquity in the landfill leachate and potential to adversely affect the surrounding environment and human health seventeen types of microplastics were found in landfill leachate with the concentration ranging from 0 42 24 58 items l he et al 2019 phenolic compounds were also usually detected at high concentrations 10 mg l in landfill leachate especially for bisphenol a and 2 4 di tert butylphenol aziz et al 2018 a total of 172 pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps were reported in landfill leachate globally over the last two decades including antibiotics anti inflammatories stimulants and beta blockers yu et al 2020 besides the occurrence of high levels of antibiotic resistance genes in landfill leachate makes it considered as an antibiotic resistance reservoir therefore landfill leachate represents a significant source of eocs which increases the urgency to treat it effectively 3 landfill leachate characterization methods 3 1 basic parameters the characteristics of landfill leachate are usually defined using basic parameters including cod bod bod cod ratio toc ph suspended solids nh4 n total kjeldahl nitrogen and heavy metal concentrations these parameters vary greatly in different samples ranging from 100 70900 mg l cod ph 5 8 to 8 5 0 2 13000 mg l total kjeldahl nitrogen 50 2200 mg l nh4 n 150 5000 mg l cl 10 8000 mg l so4 2 and 600 7500 mg l hco3 with 0 04 0 7 bod cod ratio and heavy metal concentration ranging from 0 01 to 1 0 104 mg kg kjeldsen et al 2002 the composition and concentration of dom in landfill leachate cannot be precisely predicted based on the aforementioned bulk parameters ishii and boyer 2012 various analytical techniques have been employed for the characterization of landfill leachate dom with these analytical methods and their associated parameters illustrated in detail in table 1 3 2 molecular weight associated techniques the distribution of molecular weight is a key parameter reflecting the compositions of leachate dom as shown in table 1 the molecular weight related techniques used in landfill leachate characterization include membrane filtration with different molecular weight cutoffs and size exclusion chromatography sec ultrafiltration uf membranes with different molecular sheet flows have been applied to investigate the molecular weight distribution in landfill leachate chen et al 2019a with an increase in molecular weight cutoff from 1 to 8 kda the cod removal efficiency was found to decrease from 92 7 to 72 2 indicating the prioritized removal of macromolecular organic matter during uf processes pi et al 2009 sec can be divided into two types based on different mobile phases gel filtration chromatography with water solution or buffer as the mobile phase and gel permeation chromatography with organic solvent such as tetramethylene oxide and methylbenzene as the mobile phase five different size fractions can be identified and quantified by sec categorized as biopolymers higher than 10 kda humic substances 1 kda building blocks 300 da to 500 da low molecular neutrals and acids less than 350 da aftab and hur 2019a the molecular weight related techniques are advantageous than conventional approaches since there is no sample loss and no reaction during the separation process and the service life is also lengthened however they cannot distinguish compounds with similar molecular sizes and only the molecular weight difference higher than 10 can be separated 3 3 structural analytical approaches elemental analysis can provide a wealth of information about the composition and structural formulae of landfill leachate as listed in table 1 chai et al 2008 the h c ratio establishes the degree of maturity and aromatic condensations while the o c ratio is an indicator of the carbohydrate and carboxylic acid contents huo et al 2008 in addition o c 0 3 represents a relatively low oxidation state while o c 0 4 represents a high degree of oxidation yuan et al 2017 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry coupled with electrospray ionization esi ft icr ms has ultra high resolution and can distinguish the composition of landfill leachate at the molecular level zhang et al 2019 overall ft icr ms can accurately identify elements and their combinations with high resolution and sensitivity despite that esi ft icr ms has been effectively utilized for analyzing environmental samples and shown to be a remarkable technique for dom characterization the use of this technique is limited by the requirement for complex sample pretreatment and high analytical costs nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr is a technique based on quantum mechanics and nuclear magnetic induction 1h nmr can provide key structural information establishing the chemical shifts coupling constants and signal intensity ratios of various nuclei compared to 1h nmr 13c nmr achieves larger chemical shifts and higher sensitivity with the capacity for determination of organic structure without hydrogen ions tong et al 2015 15n nmr has also been used to identify the nitrogen species in landfill leachate the results showed that only the fresh leachate with proteinaceous nitrogen were easily biodegradable and the aged leachate mainly contained refractory heterocyclic nitrogen zhao et al 2017 3 4 spectroscopic approaches spectroscopic techniques can rapidly identify the chemical composition and relative content of substances in leachate samples with the continuous development of spectroscopy this technique has become one of the most extensively used comprehensive and powerful analytical methods due to its high sensitivity simple fast analysis and good selectivity application of spectroscopic techniques in landfill leachate characterization is summarized in table 1 3 4 1 uv vis absorption spectroscopy uv vis absorption spectroscopy can provide a range of molecular information including aromatic content distribution of molecular weight and reactivity of substances the original uv vis absorption spectroscopy data and the indices generated through data processing are widely employed in characterizing leachate dom absorption in the wavelengths 250 nm 250 290 nm and 290 350 nm indicate the existence of conjugated unsaturated bonds heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and carbonyl or conjugated groups respectively chen et al 2019b different dom fractions display varying spectroscopic characteristics compared with hpi ha and fa fractions are more complex and exhibit major peaks at wavelengths between 210 to 375 nm suggesting the existence of aromatic compounds and macromolecular organic matter containing carbonyl and conjugated double bonds liu et al 2015 uv absorbance at specific wavelengths can provide valuable structural information for example absorbance values at 254 nm e254 and 280 nm e280 are commonly used as indicators of hydrophobicity and aromaticity respectively which are directly proportional to the concentration of dom in landfill leachate similarly suva254 is strongly correlated with dom aromaticity furthermore the absorbance ratio at 250 365 nm a250 a365 i e the e2 e3 ratio has been introduced to evaluate the molecular weight of dom with the e2 e3 ratio decreasing as molecular size increases lv et al 2020 similarly the a265 a465 ratio e2 e4 is applied to indicate the contents of c o and c c groups in addition it has been reported that the cod value is highly correlated with the uv absorbance at 320 nm while the absorption ratio at 465 665 nm e4 e6 has been found to be inversely related to cdom aromaticity valencia et al 2013 uv vis spectroscopy provides superiority among spectral approaches such as simple operational procedures fast analysis time no requirements for sample pretreatment and the potential to monitor various parameters simultaneously chen et al 2015 however the absorption peaks of different substances may overlap significantly making it difficult to distinguish individual peaks in addition the uv vis spectra are susceptible to various factors such as temperature ph and the presence of coexisting substances such as metal ions and nitrates as a consequence interference during spectral data acquisition should be eliminated and the interpretation of leachate dom characteristics should be very cautious 3 4 2 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence spectra provide qualitative and semi quantitative information on leachate fdom composition and biogeochemical cycling huguet et al 2009 based on the location of fluorescent peaks the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem map is divided into five regions he et al 2016 in general regions i and ii are associated with simple aromatic proteins such as tyrosine with excitation ex wavelengths 250 nm and emission em wavelengths 350 nm region iii is associated with fa like materials with ex wavelengths 250 nm and em wavelengths 350 nm region iv is associated with soluble microbial byproduct like material with ex wavelengths between 250 280 nm and em wavelength 380 nm region v is associated with ha like organics with ex wavelengths 280 nm and em wavelengths 380 nm leachate dom has been characterized by eem at different stages of landfill aging demonstrating that fluorescent species are mainly protein like species in young landfill leachate while ha like and fa like species occupy the predominant moieties in medium and old landfill leachates huo et al 2008 fluorescence eem can also characterize the origin and the degree of humification through calculating the fluorescence indices the humification index is calculated based on the ratio of fluorescence peak areas at em ex wavelengths of 435 480 254 nm to 300 345 254 nm the biological index is obtained using the ratio of fluorescence intensity at em ex wavelengths of 380 310 nm to 500 310 nm while the fluorescence index is the ratio of fluorescence intensity at em ex wavelengths of 450 370 nm to 500 370 nm zhang et al 2019 various mathematical tools have been developed to identify quantitative and qualitative structural information on dom including parallel factor analysis parafac fluorescence regional integration fri and self organizing map analysis eem parafac has broadened the application of eem by allowing eem datasets for landfill leachate to be decomposed to several independent fluorescence components which possess distinct spectral features relating to different compositions origins and reactivities three independent fdom components tryptophan like fa like and ha like components have been identified in landfill leachate by eem parafac aftab et al 2019b the ha like component had higher molecular size and hydrophobicity compared with the fa like component while the tryptophan like component had the smallest molecular weight and was attributed to aromatic amino acids the eem of dom can be divided into regionally specific eem volumes using the fri method in which total and regional fluorescence intensity data is calculated from eem spectra to quantitatively establish the composition and configuration of dom in landfill leachate wang et al 2017 analysis of seven landfill leachate samples using the fri method showed that the proportion of fluorescent protein like species and phenolic compounds were low in leachate dom compared to fluorescent fulvic like and humic like species he et al 2013 however application of fri to identify the dom component in landfill leachate is not universally accepted as a suitable method as the concentration of a fluorescent component is not always linearly correlated to fluorescence intensity self organizing map analysis is a powerful computational tool which can convert eem spectra data into a low dimensional map providing structural and functional information cuss and guéguen 2015 once the optimal reference vector is discerned its weight and the weights of the closest neurons are modified and moved towards the input vector the self organizing map technique has been applied to reveal the organic matter properties and fluorescence variables according to the u matrix and best matching unit bieroza et al 2009 analysis of parafac derived components with self organizing map enabled clustering of similar samples and can be used to monitor the removal of leachate dom oloibiri et al 2017 fluorescence spectroscopy is a useful tool for high sensitivity analysis of the chemical composition and structural variation of leachate dom however only a small fraction 1 of dom components in landfill leachate are fluorescent and therefore the use of these fluorophores to represent the whole dom structure remains a challenge 3 4 3 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy ftir spectroscopy offers a comprehensive insight into the fundamental structure of leachate dom including both fluorescent and non fluorescent components ftir is a relatively quick and nondestructive technique that requires minimal sample preparation when used in attenuated total reflectance mode bolyard et al 2019 the ftir spectroscopy wavelength ranges from 2 5 to 25 μm 400 4000 cm 1 which can be divided into functional group region and the fingerprint region both of which can be applied to characterize the chemical properties based on previous literature the major ir peaks and the corresponding functional groups in landfill leachate are listed in table 2 ha fa and hpi fractions in leachate dom exhibit different adsorption peaks in ftir spectrum strong absorbance bands at 1460 cm 1 and 866 cm 1 in ha and fa fractions were attributed to abundant carboxylic acid and amide i groups respectively in addition a pronounced band at 1110 cm 1 in hpi fractions was assigned to c o while the band at 615 cm 1 was attributed to the bending vibration of c h indicating the presence of carbohydrates esters polysaccharides and benzene liu et al 2015 the degradation of leachate dom during various treatment processes can be examined using ftir spectroscopy based on chemical changes for instance the change of ftir spectra indicates that aromatic rings or n h structures were increased in semi aerobic landfill treatment compared to anaerobic landfill chai et al 2013 n h nh2 and s h groups can be removed by biological treatment processes forming nitrates and sulphates as products huo et al 2009 furthermore alcohols phenols carboxylic acids and esters containing c o asymmetric vibration can be removed using fenton processes liu et al 2015 the integration of uv vis spectroscopy and ftir spectroscopy has proven that aromatic groups are responsible for the uv quenching phenomenon zhao et al 2012 besides ftir spectra has been applied to identify microplastics polymer types and the results showed that the contents of polyether urethane ethylene propylene copolymer and polyethylene terephthalate in old landfill were lower than those in young and medium landfills while the change trend of polyethylene and polystyrene first increased and then decreased with the increasing landfill age su et al 2019 there are however some inherent limitations associated with the application of ftir spectroscopic techniques in landfill leachate characterization it is difficult to directly interpret the ftir spectroscopy data due to the severe overlap of peak positions of dom in landfill leachate owing to the high polyfunctionality and complexity moreover the ftir spectroscopic method is more of a qualitative approach than a quantitative approach for leachate dom characterization in addition oxygen hydrogen bonds in water molecule induce major interferences during measurements due to their strong absorption in the infrared region 3 4 4 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos 2dcos analysis is a mathematical tool which can enhance the spectral resolution by spreading spectra along a second dimension the applicability of spectroscopic methods have been significantly improved with 2dcos integration they can be used to distinguish the priority change order of spectral signals under specific external disturbances such as solution ph reaction time temperature and ion strength yang et al 2018 chen et al 2019c synchronous and asynchronous 2dcos maps generated from the data matrices can provide valuable information according to the noda s rules noda 1990 the synchronous map represents the similarity or changes in spectral intensity with external disturbances chen et al 2014 asynchronous 2dcos spectra represent the differences in spectral intensity indicating the occurrence of sequential changes in accordance with external disturbances 2dcos coupled with uv vis spectroscopy can reveal the degradation characteristics of uv absorbing substances hur et al 2011 2dcos uv vis analysis showed that the unsaturated conjugated bonds in membrane concentrated landfill leachate changed prior to aromatic rings breakage during the fenton process teng et al 2020 however 2dcos analysis only establishes the sequence of spectral intensity variations rather than the degree of spectral signal variation due to the limitation of dimensionality 2dcos is more about analyzing synchronous fluorescence spectra rather than fluorescence eem synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy scans samples under the condition of a fixed excitation and emission wavelength difference which can avoid rayleigh scattering and raman scattering 2dcos coupled with synchronous fluorescence has been used to establish the preferential removal of fulvic like species over humic like species during fenton processes teng et al 2020 the 2dcos technique has been applied to extract information from ftir spectra to trace the structural changes in landfill leachate results demonstrated the order the oxidation of aromatic functional groups the removal of carboxylic groups the formation of inorganic functional groups aftab et al 2018 hetero spectral 2dcos analysis integrates spectral signals from two different types of probes in systems exposed to the same external perturbation uv vis synchronous fluorescence hetero 2dcos has been applied to investigate the structural changes in landfill leachate during the electrocatalytic oxidation process with results showing that structural changes in dom occur in the order of unsaturated double bonds fulvic like components aromatic structures terrestrial humic like components zhang et al 2020 4 treatment of landfill leachate lab scale studies of the treatment process for landfill leachate have been reported in the past five decades the treatment methods for landfill leachate can be categorized as conventional methods i e recirculation to landfills and transfer to sewage plants biological physical chemical and chemical methods fig 2 a comparison of landfill leachate treatment techniques is shown in table 3 4 1 conventional treatments traditional techniques for landfill leachate treatment are recirculation and transfer to sewage plants landfill leachate recirculation has been widely employed in previous decades due to its convenience and low operational costs recirculation frequency and volume are the key influencing factors in the effectiveness of this system however multiple cycles of recirculation may result in the accumulation of refractory substances in landfill leachate affecting the stability of the landfill system and increasing the difficulty of subsequent landfill leachate treatment chugh et al 2016 transfer of landfill leachate to sewage plants involves in biological and chemical treatment depending on the sewage treatment plant receiving the landfill leachate a convenient and inexpensive approach for landfill leachate disposal is discharge to wastewater treatment plants wwtps however the addition of leachate containing high concentrations of dom significantly impacts on the effectiveness of downstream treatment processes and reduces the overall treatment efficiency deng et al 2018 furthermore recalcitrant organic compounds have been found resistant to biological degradation allowing them to pass through wwtps in addition the non degraded organic compounds especially persistent uv absorbing dom can significantly interfere with uv disinfection in wwtps zhao et al 2012 as a result effective pretreatment should be employed to remove uv quenched substances to reduce the negative effect of landfill leachate on uv disinfection 4 2 biological treatment biological treatment of landfill leachate is broadly used due to its low economic costs and environmental impacts however a considerable number of refractory species remain in the effluent in addition organics inorganic salts and metals have been found to pose inhibitory effects on activated sludge gotvajn et al 2009 therefore the effectiveness of biological treatment largely depends on the type and composition of landfill leachate consequently biological treatments are usually selected to treat young landfill leachate with high biodegradability activated sludge process has been reported to remove up to 52 5 of cod from landfill leachate with a bod5 cod ratio of 0 17 setiadi and fairus 2003 however the activated sludge process may produce large amounts of sewage sludge standalone biological treatments generally fail to meet discharge standards because of their ineffectiveness in the degradation of bio refractory organics to overcome this limitation biological treatments are often coupled with physicochemical processes in a recent study electrocoagulation biofiltration hybrid techniques have been used to treat landfill leachate with the electrocoagulation process achieving 37 2 cod removal mainly in the form of insoluble cod and ha followed by 42 7 cod removal in the subsequent biofiltration process dia et al 2018 the integration of the air stripping mbr and nanofiltration nf processes can provide highly efficient landfill leachate treatment resulting in an overall reduction in cod ammonia color and toxicity of approximately 88 95 100 and 100 respectively amaral et al 2016 recently mbr technology has emerged as a promising method for the treatment of landfill leachate utilizing a combination of membrane separation and biodegradation processes mbr has many advantages in the treatment of landfill leachate such as high effluent quality acquisition high process stability low environmental impacts increased retention of mixed liquor suspended solids biomass and low sludge production mbr has been adapted to treat landfill leachate resulting in a wide variation in cod removal efficiencies ranging from 23 90 depending on the landfill age and operational conditions ahmed and lan 2012 compared with conventional activated sludge processes mbr has a higher loading rate and higher cod removal efficiency at a shorter hydraulic retention time 4 3 chemical treatments 4 3 1 chemical precipitation chemical precipitation is widely used as a pre treatment approach for the removal of heavy metals and nh4 n both of which negatively affect the biological treatment of landfill leachate struvite i e magnesium ammonium phosphate map and lime are typically used as the precipitants for nh4 n precipitation in the treatment of landfill leachate map precipitation can effectively remove nh4 n from landfill leachate with the highest nh4 n removal rate of 85 under optimal condition of n mg n n n p molar ratio of 1 4 1 0 8 reaction time of 60 min ph 8 9 5 and settling time of 30 min li et al 2012 the precipitation characteristics of ha and fa have been compared during the precipitant processes of mg and ca carbonates and the results showed that the precipitation yield of ha was higher than fa li et al 2015 chemical precipitation has been extensively applied for the treatment of landfill leachate due to its high capability simplicity and low economic costs however this technique has some obvious drawbacks limiting its practical application 1 low cod removal efficiency 2 high ph dependency 3 the requirement for large volumes of precipitants and 4 the generation of excessive quantities of sludge however the reuse of sludge and development of new precipitant agents are valuable research directions which can address these limitations 4 3 2 advanced oxidation processes aops the use of biological pre treatment processes to remove biodegradable organic matter can be followed by aops to remove refractory organic substances aops can convert large molecular organics into non toxic small molecular organic matter or directly mineralize it into h2o and co2 the efficiency of aops mainly depends on the generation of radicals from the oxidizing agents with high oxidation potentials fig 3 aops can be classified as fenton related o3 based uv based and other energy driven processes hydroxyl radicals oh are the dominant oxidizing agents applied in aops due to their excellent characteristics including high oxidation potential non selective oxidation of organic matter high reaction rate constants in the range 108 1010 m 1 s 1 in situ production and ability to convert refractory organic compounds into co2 and h2o zhang et al 2016 fenton related aops fenton process is initialized by fe ii catalyzing hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to generate active oxidants to degrade organic compounds such as oh the generally accepted oxidation mechanism of the fenton process is shown in eq 1 as follows brillas et al 2009 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh k2 63 m 1s 1 the ph and fenton reagent dosages are key factors affecting the removal of dom the removal rates of cod in the fenton process was approximately 35 90 jung et al 2017 fenton oxidation possesses many advantages including no requirement for extra energy inputs easy operation low system maintenance fast reaction rates and the occurrence of homogeneous reactions without energy loss however there are also some disadvantages limiting the application of this technique such as the requirement of large volumes of chemical reagents which increases operational costs the narrow operational ph range between ph 2 3 and the production of iron containing sludge which causes secondary pollution in order to overcome these drawbacks fenton like processes have been investigated for landfill leachate treatment including homogenous and heterogeneous while energy enhanced fenton processes such as the electro fenton process and photo fenton process have also been brought to treat landfill leachate in order to increase process efficiency the heterogeneous fenton like process can broaden the effective ph range to near neutral conditions and the solid catalysts can be easily separated catalysts can be categorized as fe based catalysts and non iron catalysts landfill leachate was treated with zero value iron as the catalyst coupled with microwave irradiation resulting in 58 7 cod removal under the optimal conditions of 20 ml l h2o2 ph 2 and 500 mg l catalyst dosage chen et al 2018 multi metal catalysts are also gradually being developed iron manganese binary oxide loaded zeolite has been used to treat stabilized landfill leachate achieving 88 6 cod removal under optimal condition of 0 033 mol l h2o2 ph 3 and 700 mg l catalyst dosage sruthi et al 2018 electro fenton process includes four types based on the addition and production of h2o2 and fe2 1 fe2 is added externally while h2o2 is generated in situ 2 h2o2 is externally added while fe2 is produced by a sacrificial anode 3 both h2o2 and fe2 are externally added 4 both h2o2 and fe2 are generated in situ by the addition of fe3 and o2 through electro advanced fenton process 70 of cod in landfill leachate can be removed under the condition of ph 2 0 0 187 mol l h2o2 dosage the addition of 1 745 g l fe 20 6 ma cm2 current density and a 1 8 cm inter electrode gap wang et al 2019 in the photo fenton process uv irradiation is combined with the traditional fenton reaction to accelerate the reduction of dissolved fe3 to fe2 during the treatment of landfill leachate by fenton fenton like and photo fenton processes under optimal conditions 69 6 65 9 and 83 2 cod removal can be achieved respectively zazouli et al 2012 the application of fenton like processes can address some of the drawbacks of fenton processes to a certain degree however the h2o2 utilization rates of most catalysts are relatively low moreover the stability of catalysts is also a challenge while the high catalyst synthesis costs and complex synthesis procedures limit the widespread application of these processes in addition energy consumption is extremely critical for both electro fenton and photo fenton processes o3 based aops compared to fenton processes o3 based processes result in lower levels of sludge generation and have higher oxidative power e0 2 08 v treating landfill leachate o3 can convert refractory macromolecular matter to biodegradable compounds leading to an increase in biodegradability o3 based processes can remove dom via two types of mechanisms de brito et al 2019 the first mechanism is the molecular ozone reaction based on the direct electrophilic attack of recalcitrant pollutants and the second mechanism is indirect attack by the generation of oh radicals as shown in eq 2 jung et al 2017 2 3o3 h2o 2 oh 4o2 ozonation time and o3 dose are the major influencing factors for landfill leachate treatment generally a high o3 dosage can result in high dom removal efficiency during ozonation the removal efficiencies of ha and fa can achieve up to 88 and 83 3 respectively in mbr treated landfill leachate under optimal experimental conditions chen and li 2020a however o3 production is proportional to operating costs and the landfill leachate cod removal rate catalytic ozonation i e ozone combined with catalysts is an effective way to remove dom from landfill leachate increasing the efficiency of dom removal by controlling radical generation according to the form of catalyst utilized catalytic ozonation can be classified as either homogenous catalytic ozonation or heterogeneous catalytic ozonation nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 however homogenous catalytic ozonation can cause secondary pollution and requires further separation before disposal heterogeneous catalytic ozonation can be enhanced using metal oxides while low mass transfer efficiency in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation limits its practical application he et al 2018 to enhance the landfill leachate treatment performance ozonation is often combined with other aop techniques such as electrochemistry o3 o3 h2o2 o3 uv and o3 s2o8 2 ghahrchi and rezaee 2020 the integrated process of fe0 o3 h2o2 was used to treat semi aerobic aged refuse biofilter pre treated landfill leachate achieving 43 cod removal under the conditions of 0 6 g l fe0 the generation of 26 80 mg min o3 and 1 ml l h2o2 ozonation remains a suitable option for the treatment of landfill leachate ensuring that measures are in place to improve ozone efficiency wang et al 2020 uv based aops uv irradiation is regarded as a low environmental impact and efficient way to activate peroxides in order to generate active oxidative species uv based aops are increasingly being applied in the treatment of landfill leachate to eliminate pollutants and improve the quality by producing highly reactive free radicals such as oh and so4 the uv h2o2 process is the most widely used uv based aop in both laboratory and pilot scale studies due to its high oxidation rates simple operational procedures and no sludge generation rehman et al 2018 however the uv h2o2 process needs high energy inputs to produce sufficient oh due to the low uv absorbance of h2o2 and high oh scavenging rate of water and dom in order to overcome this drawback the uv h2o2 coupled with fe2 can be used the treatment efficiencies of fenton uv h2o2 and uv fenton processes on nf concentrate from biologically pretreated landfill leachate have been compared implying that uv fenton achieved the best performance with a cod removal rate of 93 under optimal conditions zhao et al 2020 techniques based on the sulfate radical so4 such as uv persulfate s2o8 2 and uv peroxomonosulfate hso5 have also attracted broad interests so4 with high standard redox potential ranging from 2 5 to 3 1 v can react with organic matter with rate constants 105 to 109 m 1 s 1 lin and wu 2014 furthermore so4 is transformed to non toxic sulfate after oxidation reactions which does not require extra treatment and disposal processes gao et al 2012 in addition s2o8 2 and hso5 are more stable and economical than h2o2 in the photocatalytic process ultra reactive species such as oh are generated during illumination of photocatalysts resulting in the successful mineralization of organic pollutants when tio2 absorbs uv light electron hole pairs e h are formed during the process of electron transferring from the valence band to the conduction band accompanied by the generation of radicals i e oh and o2 tio2 photocatalytic degradation has attracted wide attention due to its non toxic low cost high chemical stability and environmental friendliness for landfill leachate treatment however the band gap width of tio2 is wide and only uv light can be utilized which only accounts for less than 5 of sunlight exploitation of visible light by the tio2 photocatalytic process is a key focus in photocatalytic technology development in addition low quantum yield high ohmic impedance at the solid liquid interface and subsequent separation problems are factors that limit the widespread applications of photocatalysis processes other aop processes apart from the aforementioned aops additional aop techniques have been reported for landfill leachate treatment such as ultrasound and high energy electron irradiation ultrasonic cavitation provides physical conditions of high temperature and high pressure which greatly increases the yield of oh thereby accelerating the rate of oxidation reaction and degradation ability irradiation of water with high energy electrons results in the formation of the reactive free radicals among the aops oh so4 and o3 are the main active oxidants which prefer to degrade macromolecular organics and have less effect on biodegradable small molecular hydrophilic organics the removal extent among the fdom components exhibited the order humic like component tryptophan like component fulvic like component and the sequential changes can be interpreted as biopolymers low molecular weight neutral low molecular weight acid humic substances during the fenton process aftab et al 2019b compared with oh o3 is more preferred to react with macromolecular with conjugated structure and limited to remove low molecular weight organic matter which is not suitable as a downstream treatment process to degrade down sized molecular weight byproducts derived from upstream oxidation process jung et al 2017 microwave activated peroxydisulfate process showed that 94 17 of fulvic acid with small molecular weight and high fluorescence intensity and 91 09 of fulvic acid with relatively stable and macromolecular aromatics were removed in concentrated leachate gu et al 2018 since the mechanisms of different treatment techniques are quite different their preferential removal of organic substances in landfill leachate may also exhibit difference therefore a prior knowledge about the structural characterization of dom in landfill leachate can provide a guidance for the evaluation of treatment efficiency aops have emerged as powerful tools for the treatment of landfill leachate however there are some inherent limitations such as high volumes of sludge generation high chemical dosages and narrow operating ph ranges although energy enhanced aops can improve the removal efficiency of traditional methods the energy consumption increases the overall operating cost these problems make most of the aops process lab scale even though with relatively good effluent quality finding a tradeoff between energy consumption and processing efficiency is critical for maximizing environmental benefits at the lowest cost 4 3 3 coagulation flocculation coagulation flocculation process is a simple physical chemical technique that transfers pollutants from liquid to solid phase in the form of sludge which has been frequently employed for landfill leachate pre treatment or final polishing treatment coagulation flocculation process can effectively remove organic pollutants and heavy metals but the impact on nh4 n is negligible al2 so4 3 feso4 fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 are commonly used coagulants generally iron salts are more efficient than aluminum salts due to the insolubility of ferric ion salts across a wider ph range moradi and ghanbari 2014 besides coagulation process has been proven more effective in removing high molecular weight organics with high hydrophobicity compared to low molecular weight hydrophilic organics he et al 2006 poly aluminum chloride and alum have been applied as coagulants for the treatment of landfill leachate with results showing that cod removal rates of 43 1 were achieved using poly aluminum chloride while 62 8 removal was achieved using alum ghafari et al 2009 86 of cod can be removed through the combination of coagulation flocculation process and powder activated carbon adsorption li et al 2010b however coagulation flocculation treatment has some drawbacks for example the utilization of conventional coagulation systems generates excessive sludge and cause an increase in the concentrations of soluble iron and aluminum therefore enhanced coagulation flocculation methods have been developed enhanced coagulation with in situ formation of mn fe hydroxides was employed to treat air stripped fenton oxidized leachate achieving a maximum cod removal rate of 55 98 de et al 2019 electrocoagulation has been utilized for the treatment of landfill leachate through the production of metal ions in situ by electrolytic oxidation the generated metal ions can produce polymeric hydroxides that serve as coagulants which can destroy the stability of colloids to form flocs capable of precipitation and settling xu et al 2020 the removal efficiency of cod varied from 17 to 70 under different operational conditions fernandes et al 2015 compared with the traditional coagulation flocculation process electrocoagulation generates low sludge volumes electrocoagulation flocculants can overcome the drawbacks of traditional flocculants making this method a valuable potential treatment technology 4 4 physical chemical treatment 4 4 1 adsorption adsorption process is considered as one of the most effective and promising approaches for remove dom and nh4 n in landfill leachate adsorbents with a large surface area microporous structure surface reactivity and thermostability have been utilized for the treatment of landfill leachate activated carbon ac are the most commonly used absorbents ac adsorption can improve the biodegradability of old landfill leachate although the overall cod removal rate is low with only 40 of organic matter removal achieved with 10 g l ac while the bod5 cod ratio increased from 0 18 to 0 56 gotvajn et al 2009 ac adsorption preferentially removed the chromophoric dom with hydrophobicity and microbial by products in fluorescent dom deng et al 2018 adsorption is usually combined with other physicochemical methods such as coagulation ozonation and fenton processes as a pre treatment or post treatment step using combined ozone ac adsorption treatment the highest removal rates for cod and nh4 n were 86 and 92 respectively kurniawan et al 2006 a combination of coagulation and adsorption has been imported to treat biologically treated landfill leachate achieving a cod removal rate of 80 under optimal conditions papastavrou et al 2009 the main drawbacks of ac adsorption include the requirement for ac regeneration and high levels of adsorbent consumption therefore finding a low cost and effective adsorbent has attracted much research attention ac prepared from zncl2 treatment of sewage sludge and cabbage has been applied to treat landfill leachate by adsorbing dom achieving a cod removal rate of 85 61 under optimal conditions zeng et al 2019 zeolite has also been applied for the treatment of landfill leachate as post treatment with cod removal rates of 30 poblete et al 2019 recently biochar has emerged as a good substitute for ac phosphoric acid activated biochar prepared from rice husk has been successfully used for the treatment of landfill leachate resulting in about 80 removal of cod luo et al 2019 4 4 2 air stripping the air stripping process is widely used as the pre treatment to remove nh4 n transferring nh4 n from the aqueous phase to air in the state of nh3 absorbed to either h2so4 or hcl renou et al 2008 air stripping can achieve nh4 n removal of 85 95 with initial concentrations ranging from 220 to 3260 m l bonmati and flotats 2003 51 5 of cod 74 6 of bod5 and 97 6 nh3 n were removed by air stripping within 36 h of optimum retention time followed with fenton oxidation and enhanced coagulation de et al 2019 the air stripping process can remove more ha than fa and hpi liu et al 2015 4 4 3 membrane treatment membrane techniques includes microfiltration mf uf nf and reverse osmosis ro which are widely used for selective separation according to size using semi permeable membranes membrane based techniques exhibit some outstanding characteristics such as small occupation of areas high volume loading good effluent quality and strong disinfection capability therefore membrane based techniques are regarded as a promising method to treat landfill leachate in recent decades fig 4 represents the filtration spectrum and the applicable range for each type of membrane process abdel fatah 2018 mf is typically applied as a pre treatment unit for landfill leachate treatment to eliminate colloids and suspended matter with apertures ranging from 0 1 to 1 μm uf is effective for the elimination of macromolecules and particles with an aperture ranging from 2 nm to 0 1 μm using this method cod removal rates range from 10 to 75 renou et al 2008 uf is commonly applied as a pre treatment for ro to remove the large molecular weight components in landfill leachate which may cause membrane fouling during the ro process nf process can effectively remove organic inorganic and microbial contaminants with a molecular cut offs between 200 2000 da amaral et al 2016 the interception rates for anions are ranked in the order of no3 cl oh so4 2 co3 2 and for cations in the order of h na ca2 mg2 lin et al 2020 nf processes followed by ro are more energy efficient as both stages can be operated under lower pressure conditions ramaswami et al 2018 therefore the ro process appears to be the most promising treatment method due to its strong interception capability allowing only water molecules to pass through membranes while heavy metals suspended and dissolved solids organic matter and dissolved inorganic species can be effectively removed from leachate chen et al 2020b although membrane processes have been proven to generate high quality effluent two inherent disadvantages limit the wide application first the accumulation of organic inorganic or biological species on the membrane surface and or inside the membrane pores results in membrane fouling which can severely affect the life of membrane modules and increase operating cost chen et al 2016 the second is the production of membrane concentrated landfill leachate membrane technologies cannot degrade pollutants but merely concentrates them into smaller volumes of membrane concentrated landfill leachate about 20 30 of the initial volume which contains a large amounts of recalcitrant organic compounds and inorganic salts compared to the original leachate membrane concentrated landfill leachate is more complicated and difficult to treat some pretreatment techniques can reduce membrane fouling such as the removal of suspended matter inhibition of precipitation of insoluble salts inhibition of scaling and removal of organic matter bacteria and other microorganisms improving the permeability of membranes is worthwhile to reduce the yield of membrane concentrated landfill leachate the integration of membrane processes with other treatments have been intensively investigated in recent years mbr has been employed to treat landfill leachate containing high concentrations of organic matter and heavy metals the performance of mbr varies considerably under different conditions from 23 to 98 korajlija jakopović et al 2008 combining membrane processes with chemical treatments presents a number of benefits for example the use of membranes coupled with fenton oxidation can drastically minimize membrane fouling as colloidal particle coagulation occurs during the oxidation process which can prevent colloidal particles from entering the membrane chiu and james 2006 the integrated process of fenton mf nf has been utilized to treat landfill leachate achieving highly efficient removal of cod 63 color 76 and humic substances 50 under optimal condition moravia et al 2013 5 conclusions and outlook generally the characteristics of landfill leachate such as cod bod cod ratio and landfill age are required to determine the selection of suitable treatment technologies however the chemical compositions of different landfill leachates vary notably even when they have the same cod value resulting in differences in performance during the treatment process therefore it is necessary to understand the structural characteristics of leachate dom and the induced changes during treatment in order to select the most economical and effective treatment technology our understanding of leachate characteristics has increased significantly due to the rapid development of techniques to elucidate dom characteristic considering the present developments and applications of characterization methods for landfill leachate prospective are suggested as follows 1 innovations of in situ measurements effective real time monitoring technologies are necessary to understand the intermediate state of the organic matter in landfill leachate during the treatment process especially identifying the accurate changes of chemical compositions from the molecular level is beneficial for interpreting the reaction mechanisms paths so as to optimize the processing technology although the existing characterization methods of landfill leachate such as molecular weight and structural analysis associated measurements can provide a wealth of information from different aspects they fail to monitor the intermediate state of the organic matter in landfill leachate in real time since sample pretreatment or a delay in measurement may cause changes in the characteristics offline monitoring fails to reflect the structural information of intermediates in real scenarios during treatment process to address this concern future studies should focus on the design and development of online sampling monitoring setups label free and nondestructive characterizing techniques improvement of instrumental sensitivity for detection and design of appropriate software to reduce analysis procedure and time and increase the intelligence of the detection process 2 establishment of a spectral database for landfill leachate spectral techniques can rapidly detect the main components structural characteristics and changes in dom in landfill leachate establishing a library to share and collect spectra related to landfill leachate including different waste types operational conditions climate hydrogeology and landfill age is beneficial to obtaining comprehensive information about the origin structural characteristics and fate of landfill leachate by comparing the measured spectral data with those in the database researchers can quickly capture a series of physiochemical properties of the landfill leachate samples and their treatment performance by different treatment approaches as a result some invalid methods can be filtered out saving analyzing time and economy 3 development of chemometrics for data processing data information obtained from characterization methods often overlaps and interferes due to the complex composition of landfill leachate integration of chemometrics with characterization methods especially spectroscopic methods is a useful way to unearth compositional information hidden in data from both a qualitative and quantitative point of view for instance through using parafac algorithm to analyze eem more information about the composition origin and reactivity of fluorescent components can be obtained some other stoichiometric methods such as partial least squares soft independent modeling class analog and artificial neural networks can be integrated with the characterization techniques to optimize the experimental design correct the analysis signal improve the resolution and strengthen the structural recognition despite the existence of various approaches for landfill leachate treatment no single method is effective and cost effective enough to meet the effluent standard requirements given the application and development of treatment technologies for landfill leachate studies future directions and perspectives are envisaged 1 reduction of membrane concentrates since biological treatment followed by membrane filtration is the main technology applied for landfill leachate treatment worldwide reducing the generation of membrane concentrates allows straightforward follow up treatment and avoids the production of secondary pollution the key to addressing this problem is the improvement of membrane permeability and the alleviation of membrane fouling membrane flux is determined by the external driving force and the resistance of the membrane variations in membrane fouling mainly depend on characteristics of membrane modules operating conditions and the composition of landfill leachate since the fouling process is controlled by the interaction of fluid dynamics and solution chemistry to strengthen membrane processes and reduce membrane concentrates some requirements and challenges should be considered design of novel membrane materials with high filtration and anti fouling performance application of pre treatments e g reducing the salt content prior to membrane filtration study on the mechanism of membrane fouling e g the influence of main components in landfill leachate on membrane filtration processes 2 integration of multiple treatment technologies each processing technology has its own distinctive advantages shortcomings and applicability integration of different treatments for landfill leachate synergizes the merits of single treatment and overcomes the respective defects and has been proven with higher efficiency and lower cost for example aops have high efficiency in removing organic pollutants from landfill leachate but the reagents and or operational costs can be high as a result they can be used as a pretreatment or post treatment step to enhance removal efficiency and reduce costs alternatively hierarchical treatment can be one direction worthy of study as the reaction efficiency may be reduced inhibited due to the change of reaction conditions in the single stage reaction process e g the ineffective decomposition of h2o2 and variation in solution ph through the multi stage combination the thoroughly reaction can be achieved to the utmost extent 3 recovery and reuse of valuable substances landfill leachate contains an abundance of metal elements and humic substances and the recycling of landfill leachate as secondary resources such as fertilizers is a promising approach for this point efforts should be devoted to the development of approaches for efficient separation e g resin separation and enrichment of valuable substances in landfill leachate in addition the added solid chemical reagents may be recycled and reused multiple times while the added ionic chemical reagents may be separated and extracted as raw materials for other applications it is important to make full use of the vast resources available in landfill leachate to reduce the use of expensive synthetic substances 4 treatment and characterization of eocs eocs possess the characteristics of low concentration various types and complex properties traditional pollutants i e cod and heavy metal can be effectively eliminated during the leachate treatment process however the effectiveness of eocs removal and potential toxicity during these processes has not been clearly understood therefore it is necessary to track the occurrence removal and environmental behavior of eocs in landfill leachate exploring the mutual influence and mixed toxicity of different types of eocs by developing high precision characterization methods can help to optimize the treatment technologies to conclude the evolution of instrument and analytical methodologies are important ways to drive the development in the characterization and monitoring of landfill leachate treatment efficiency cost and environmental consequences are the primary criteria for the development of sustainable

16681,landfill leachate is a complicated organic wastewater generated in the sanitary landfilling process landfill leachate must be appropriately disposed to avoid ecotoxicity and environmental damage an in depth understanding of the physiochemical characteristics and environmental behaviors of landfill leachate is essential for its effective treatment in this study recent advances on the

inherent water in waste which contains large amounts of dissolved organic matter dom salts heavy metal ions and other organic compounds e g chlorinated aliphatics and pesticides liu et al 2015 landfill leachate has been generally found toxic presenting potential threats to the surrounding environment and ecosystems baderna et al 2019 leachate dom can affect microbial activity cause membrane fouling decrease the effluent quality of coagulation process interact with organic contaminants and change the fate of heavy metals in their transport behavior stability and bioavailability yang et al 2019 therefore it is imperative to develop effective treatment technologies to remove dom from landfill leachate various technologies including biological treatments e g activated sludge and fluidized bed reactor processes chemical treatments e g fenton process chemical precipitation and physical chemical treatments e g adsorption and membrane processes have been developed for the treatment of landfill leachate however a tradeoff is typically required between treatment performance and the cost associated with these techniques an in depth understanding of the composition of landfill leachate and its variation and degradation characteristics is important for landfill leachate treatment since 2000 the number of publications on landfill leachate has been increased steadily and a critical review on the characterization and treatment of landfill leachate can help to advance the development in this field the existing literature reviews on landfill leachate can be divided into three types one is focused on the treatment techniques of landfill leachate renou et al 2008 while the connections between leachate properties characterizations and treatment efficiencies have not been systematically discussed the second is mainly about a certain type of treatment approach such as fenton ozone related advanced treatment electrochemical processes and membrane techniques li et al 2010a fernandes et al 2015 dabaghian et al 2018 or a certain type of pollutant such as ultraviolet quenching substances and heavy metals carvajal flórez and cardona gallo 2019 iskander et al 2018 which are too specialized the third type summarizes various characterization methods nebbioso and piccolo 2013 but lacks the discussion in actual landfill leachate therefore this review aims to present a compendium of the characterization methods and treatment technologies for landfill leachate specifically the evolution of molecular spectroscopic techniques for characterizing monitoring dom in landfill leachate and advanced oxidation techniques for landfill leachate treatment are highlighted moreover the main shortcomings and limitations of the current treatment techniques and analytical approaches for landfill leachate are discussed and suggestions on addressing these defects are envisaged in addition ideas and directions for developing and improving treatment technologies and structural characterization during the treatment process are presented 2 properties of landfill leachate in general landfill leachate is characterized by conventional parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc biochemical oxygen demand bod suspended solids ph ammonia nh4 n and heavy metal concentrations the ratios of bod5 cod and cod toc are typical indicators for the biodegradability of organic compounds and the oxidized state of organic carbon the quality of landfill leachate is affected by various factors such as the waste type operational conditions climate hydrogeology and landfill age dabaghian et al 2018 the characteristics of landfill leachate exhibit considerable differences due to variations in refuse composition and moisture content as well as seasonal factors such as temperature and precipitation costa et al 2019 the higher temperatures in summer result in lower cod and doc concentrations while ph total nitrogen and electrical conductivity are usually higher in winter than in summer in contrast oxidation reduction potential and the concentrations of metals total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids exhibit no significant seasonal variation zhao et al 2013 the ratio of absorbance at 254 nm to toc concentration suva254 indicates the degree of aromaticity in landfill leachate and exhibits significant seasonal difference which is higher in summer than in winter yang et al 2019 as a result dom derived from leachate contains a higher proportion of aromatic structure in summer probably owing to greater efficiency of landfill biodegradation under higher temperature conditions landfill age is a key factor that can affect the composition and properties of landfill leachate landfill leachate can be divided into three categories according to landfill age as shown in fig 1 leachate with less than 5 years age is classified as young leachate whereas medium leachate is 5 10 years old and old leachate is generated for more than ten years miao et al 2019 young landfill leachate is mainly composed of low molecular weight hydrophilic organic matter with a low ph value and high biodegradability index bod5 cod in comparison ha and fa with high molecular weights are the predominant components of old landfill leachate resulting in an elevated ph value and low biodegradability index notably heavy metal concentrations tend to decline with aging as the increased ph value reduces the solubility of metals according to different criteria dom can be divided into distinct fractions which respond differently to various treatments depending on the emittance of fluorescence dom fractions can be categorized as either chromophoric dom cdom or fluorescent dom fdom helms et al 2009 cdom is an important part of the total dom which has a strong absorption of uv and visible light resulting in the dark color of solution lozinski et al 2019 fdom is a small part of the total dom due to the difference in solubility of landfill leachate dom in different solvents three fractions can be isolated by the combination of xad 8 resin and cation exchange resin classified as humic acid ha fulvic acid fa and hydrophilic hpi fractions zhang et al 2013 furthermore four fractions including hydrophilic component hydrophobic base hydrophobic neutral and hydrophobic acid can be isolated from landfill leachate using the xad 8 resin method based on hydrophobicity he et al 2016 it has previously been demonstrated that the hydrophobic fraction of dom is rich in aromatic moieties which contributes to the formation of disinfection byproducts during chlorination korshin et al 2007 dom can also be classified into biodegradable and non biodegradable fractions the non biodegradable fractions mainly consist of humic substances originating from the condensation and polymerization of microbial degradation byproducts iskander et al 2018 in contrast biodegradable organic matter mainly comes from the initial decomposition of organic solid waste this fraction is composed of simple carbon chained structures and can be easily removed by biological treatment processes in recent years emerging organic contaminants eocs such as persistent organic pollutants endocrine disrupting chemicals pharmaceutical and personal care products antibiotic resistance genes and disinfection by products have attracted significant attention due to their ubiquity in the landfill leachate and potential to adversely affect the surrounding environment and human health seventeen types of microplastics were found in landfill leachate with the concentration ranging from 0 42 24 58 items l he et al 2019 phenolic compounds were also usually detected at high concentrations 10 mg l in landfill leachate especially for bisphenol a and 2 4 di tert butylphenol aziz et al 2018 a total of 172 pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps were reported in landfill leachate globally over the last two decades including antibiotics anti inflammatories stimulants and beta blockers yu et al 2020 besides the occurrence of high levels of antibiotic resistance genes in landfill leachate makes it considered as an antibiotic resistance reservoir therefore landfill leachate represents a significant source of eocs which increases the urgency to treat it effectively 3 landfill leachate characterization methods 3 1 basic parameters the characteristics of landfill leachate are usually defined using basic parameters including cod bod bod cod ratio toc ph suspended solids nh4 n total kjeldahl nitrogen and heavy metal concentrations these parameters vary greatly in different samples ranging from 100 70900 mg l cod ph 5 8 to 8 5 0 2 13000 mg l total kjeldahl nitrogen 50 2200 mg l nh4 n 150 5000 mg l cl 10 8000 mg l so4 2 and 600 7500 mg l hco3 with 0 04 0 7 bod cod ratio and heavy metal concentration ranging from 0 01 to 1 0 104 mg kg kjeldsen et al 2002 the composition and concentration of dom in landfill leachate cannot be precisely predicted based on the aforementioned bulk parameters ishii and boyer 2012 various analytical techniques have been employed for the characterization of landfill leachate dom with these analytical methods and their associated parameters illustrated in detail in table 1 3 2 molecular weight associated techniques the distribution of molecular weight is a key parameter reflecting the compositions of leachate dom as shown in table 1 the molecular weight related techniques used in landfill leachate characterization include membrane filtration with different molecular weight cutoffs and size exclusion chromatography sec ultrafiltration uf membranes with different molecular sheet flows have been applied to investigate the molecular weight distribution in landfill leachate chen et al 2019a with an increase in molecular weight cutoff from 1 to 8 kda the cod removal efficiency was found to decrease from 92 7 to 72 2 indicating the prioritized removal of macromolecular organic matter during uf processes pi et al 2009 sec can be divided into two types based on different mobile phases gel filtration chromatography with water solution or buffer as the mobile phase and gel permeation chromatography with organic solvent such as tetramethylene oxide and methylbenzene as the mobile phase five different size fractions can be identified and quantified by sec categorized as biopolymers higher than 10 kda humic substances 1 kda building blocks 300 da to 500 da low molecular neutrals and acids less than 350 da aftab and hur 2019a the molecular weight related techniques are advantageous than conventional approaches since there is no sample loss and no reaction during the separation process and the service life is also lengthened however they cannot distinguish compounds with similar molecular sizes and only the molecular weight difference higher than 10 can be separated 3 3 structural analytical approaches elemental analysis can provide a wealth of information about the composition and structural formulae of landfill leachate as listed in table 1 chai et al 2008 the h c ratio establishes the degree of maturity and aromatic condensations while the o c ratio is an indicator of the carbohydrate and carboxylic acid contents huo et al 2008 in addition o c 0 3 represents a relatively low oxidation state while o c 0 4 represents a high degree of oxidation yuan et al 2017 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry coupled with electrospray ionization esi ft icr ms has ultra high resolution and can distinguish the composition of landfill leachate at the molecular level zhang et al 2019 overall ft icr ms can accurately identify elements and their combinations with high resolution and sensitivity despite that esi ft icr ms has been effectively utilized for analyzing environmental samples and shown to be a remarkable technique for dom characterization the use of this technique is limited by the requirement for complex sample pretreatment and high analytical costs nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr is a technique based on quantum mechanics and nuclear magnetic induction 1h nmr can provide key structural information establishing the chemical shifts coupling constants and signal intensity ratios of various nuclei compared to 1h nmr 13c nmr achieves larger chemical shifts and higher sensitivity with the capacity for determination of organic structure without hydrogen ions tong et al 2015 15n nmr has also been used to identify the nitrogen species in landfill leachate the results showed that only the fresh leachate with proteinaceous nitrogen were easily biodegradable and the aged leachate mainly contained refractory heterocyclic nitrogen zhao et al 2017 3 4 spectroscopic approaches spectroscopic techniques can rapidly identify the chemical composition and relative content of substances in leachate samples with the continuous development of spectroscopy this technique has become one of the most extensively used comprehensive and powerful analytical methods due to its high sensitivity simple fast analysis and good selectivity application of spectroscopic techniques in landfill leachate characterization is summarized in table 1 3 4 1 uv vis absorption spectroscopy uv vis absorption spectroscopy can provide a range of molecular information including aromatic content distribution of molecular weight and reactivity of substances the original uv vis absorption spectroscopy data and the indices generated through data processing are widely employed in characterizing leachate dom absorption in the wavelengths 250 nm 250 290 nm and 290 350 nm indicate the existence of conjugated unsaturated bonds heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and carbonyl or conjugated groups respectively chen et al 2019b different dom fractions display varying spectroscopic characteristics compared with hpi ha and fa fractions are more complex and exhibit major peaks at wavelengths between 210 to 375 nm suggesting the existence of aromatic compounds and macromolecular organic matter containing carbonyl and conjugated double bonds liu et al 2015 uv absorbance at specific wavelengths can provide valuable structural information for example absorbance values at 254 nm e254 and 280 nm e280 are commonly used as indicators of hydrophobicity and aromaticity respectively which are directly proportional to the concentration of dom in landfill leachate similarly suva254 is strongly correlated with dom aromaticity furthermore the absorbance ratio at 250 365 nm a250 a365 i e the e2 e3 ratio has been introduced to evaluate the molecular weight of dom with the e2 e3 ratio decreasing as molecular size increases lv et al 2020 similarly the a265 a465 ratio e2 e4 is applied to indicate the contents of c o and c c groups in addition it has been reported that the cod value is highly correlated with the uv absorbance at 320 nm while the absorption ratio at 465 665 nm e4 e6 has been found to be inversely related to cdom aromaticity valencia et al 2013 uv vis spectroscopy provides superiority among spectral approaches such as simple operational procedures fast analysis time no requirements for sample pretreatment and the potential to monitor various parameters simultaneously chen et al 2015 however the absorption peaks of different substances may overlap significantly making it difficult to distinguish individual peaks in addition the uv vis spectra are susceptible to various factors such as temperature ph and the presence of coexisting substances such as metal ions and nitrates as a consequence interference during spectral data acquisition should be eliminated and the interpretation of leachate dom characteristics should be very cautious 3 4 2 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence spectra provide qualitative and semi quantitative information on leachate fdom composition and biogeochemical cycling huguet et al 2009 based on the location of fluorescent peaks the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem map is divided into five regions he et al 2016 in general regions i and ii are associated with simple aromatic proteins such as tyrosine with excitation ex wavelengths 250 nm and emission em wavelengths 350 nm region iii is associated with fa like materials with ex wavelengths 250 nm and em wavelengths 350 nm region iv is associated with soluble microbial byproduct like material with ex wavelengths between 250 280 nm and em wavelength 380 nm region v is associated with ha like organics with ex wavelengths 280 nm and em wavelengths 380 nm leachate dom has been characterized by eem at different stages of landfill aging demonstrating that fluorescent species are mainly protein like species in young landfill leachate while ha like and fa like species occupy the predominant moieties in medium and old landfill leachates huo et al 2008 fluorescence eem can also characterize the origin and the degree of humification through calculating the fluorescence indices the humification index is calculated based on the ratio of fluorescence peak areas at em ex wavelengths of 435 480 254 nm to 300 345 254 nm the biological index is obtained using the ratio of fluorescence intensity at em ex wavelengths of 380 310 nm to 500 310 nm while the fluorescence index is the ratio of fluorescence intensity at em ex wavelengths of 450 370 nm to 500 370 nm zhang et al 2019 various mathematical tools have been developed to identify quantitative and qualitative structural information on dom including parallel factor analysis parafac fluorescence regional integration fri and self organizing map analysis eem parafac has broadened the application of eem by allowing eem datasets for landfill leachate to be decomposed to several independent fluorescence components which possess distinct spectral features relating to different compositions origins and reactivities three independent fdom components tryptophan like fa like and ha like components have been identified in landfill leachate by eem parafac aftab et al 2019b the ha like component had higher molecular size and hydrophobicity compared with the fa like component while the tryptophan like component had the smallest molecular weight and was attributed to aromatic amino acids the eem of dom can be divided into regionally specific eem volumes using the fri method in which total and regional fluorescence intensity data is calculated from eem spectra to quantitatively establish the composition and configuration of dom in landfill leachate wang et al 2017 analysis of seven landfill leachate samples using the fri method showed that the proportion of fluorescent protein like species and phenolic compounds were low in leachate dom compared to fluorescent fulvic like and humic like species he et al 2013 however application of fri to identify the dom component in landfill leachate is not universally accepted as a suitable method as the concentration of a fluorescent component is not always linearly correlated to fluorescence intensity self organizing map analysis is a powerful computational tool which can convert eem spectra data into a low dimensional map providing structural and functional information cuss and guéguen 2015 once the optimal reference vector is discerned its weight and the weights of the closest neurons are modified and moved towards the input vector the self organizing map technique has been applied to reveal the organic matter properties and fluorescence variables according to the u matrix and best matching unit bieroza et al 2009 analysis of parafac derived components with self organizing map enabled clustering of similar samples and can be used to monitor the removal of leachate dom oloibiri et al 2017 fluorescence spectroscopy is a useful tool for high sensitivity analysis of the chemical composition and structural variation of leachate dom however only a small fraction 1 of dom components in landfill leachate are fluorescent and therefore the use of these fluorophores to represent the whole dom structure remains a challenge 3 4 3 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy ftir spectroscopy offers a comprehensive insight into the fundamental structure of leachate dom including both fluorescent and non fluorescent components ftir is a relatively quick and nondestructive technique that requires minimal sample preparation when used in attenuated total reflectance mode bolyard et al 2019 the ftir spectroscopy wavelength ranges from 2 5 to 25 μm 400 4000 cm 1 which can be divided into functional group region and the fingerprint region both of which can be applied to characterize the chemical properties based on previous literature the major ir peaks and the corresponding functional groups in landfill leachate are listed in table 2 ha fa and hpi fractions in leachate dom exhibit different adsorption peaks in ftir spectrum strong absorbance bands at 1460 cm 1 and 866 cm 1 in ha and fa fractions were attributed to abundant carboxylic acid and amide i groups respectively in addition a pronounced band at 1110 cm 1 in hpi fractions was assigned to c o while the band at 615 cm 1 was attributed to the bending vibration of c h indicating the presence of carbohydrates esters polysaccharides and benzene liu et al 2015 the degradation of leachate dom during various treatment processes can be examined using ftir spectroscopy based on chemical changes for instance the change of ftir spectra indicates that aromatic rings or n h structures were increased in semi aerobic landfill treatment compared to anaerobic landfill chai et al 2013 n h nh2 and s h groups can be removed by biological treatment processes forming nitrates and sulphates as products huo et al 2009 furthermore alcohols phenols carboxylic acids and esters containing c o asymmetric vibration can be removed using fenton processes liu et al 2015 the integration of uv vis spectroscopy and ftir spectroscopy has proven that aromatic groups are responsible for the uv quenching phenomenon zhao et al 2012 besides ftir spectra has been applied to identify microplastics polymer types and the results showed that the contents of polyether urethane ethylene propylene copolymer and polyethylene terephthalate in old landfill were lower than those in young and medium landfills while the change trend of polyethylene and polystyrene first increased and then decreased with the increasing landfill age su et al 2019 there are however some inherent limitations associated with the application of ftir spectroscopic techniques in landfill leachate characterization it is difficult to directly interpret the ftir spectroscopy data due to the severe overlap of peak positions of dom in landfill leachate owing to the high polyfunctionality and complexity moreover the ftir spectroscopic method is more of a qualitative approach than a quantitative approach for leachate dom characterization in addition oxygen hydrogen bonds in water molecule induce major interferences during measurements due to their strong absorption in the infrared region 3 4 4 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos 2dcos analysis is a mathematical tool which can enhance the spectral resolution by spreading spectra along a second dimension the applicability of spectroscopic methods have been significantly improved with 2dcos integration they can be used to distinguish the priority change order of spectral signals under specific external disturbances such as solution ph reaction time temperature and ion strength yang et al 2018 chen et al 2019c synchronous and asynchronous 2dcos maps generated from the data matrices can provide valuable information according to the noda s rules noda 1990 the synchronous map represents the similarity or changes in spectral intensity with external disturbances chen et al 2014 asynchronous 2dcos spectra represent the differences in spectral intensity indicating the occurrence of sequential changes in accordance with external disturbances 2dcos coupled with uv vis spectroscopy can reveal the degradation characteristics of uv absorbing substances hur et al 2011 2dcos uv vis analysis showed that the unsaturated conjugated bonds in membrane concentrated landfill leachate changed prior to aromatic rings breakage during the fenton process teng et al 2020 however 2dcos analysis only establishes the sequence of spectral intensity variations rather than the degree of spectral signal variation due to the limitation of dimensionality 2dcos is more about analyzing synchronous fluorescence spectra rather than fluorescence eem synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy scans samples under the condition of a fixed excitation and emission wavelength difference which can avoid rayleigh scattering and raman scattering 2dcos coupled with synchronous fluorescence has been used to establish the preferential removal of fulvic like species over humic like species during fenton processes teng et al 2020 the 2dcos technique has been applied to extract information from ftir spectra to trace the structural changes in landfill leachate results demonstrated the order the oxidation of aromatic functional groups the removal of carboxylic groups the formation of inorganic functional groups aftab et al 2018 hetero spectral 2dcos analysis integrates spectral signals from two different types of probes in systems exposed to the same external perturbation uv vis synchronous fluorescence hetero 2dcos has been applied to investigate the structural changes in landfill leachate during the electrocatalytic oxidation process with results showing that structural changes in dom occur in the order of unsaturated double bonds fulvic like components aromatic structures terrestrial humic like components zhang et al 2020 4 treatment of landfill leachate lab scale studies of the treatment process for landfill leachate have been reported in the past five decades the treatment methods for landfill leachate can be categorized as conventional methods i e recirculation to landfills and transfer to sewage plants biological physical chemical and chemical methods fig 2 a comparison of landfill leachate treatment techniques is shown in table 3 4 1 conventional treatments traditional techniques for landfill leachate treatment are recirculation and transfer to sewage plants landfill leachate recirculation has been widely employed in previous decades due to its convenience and low operational costs recirculation frequency and volume are the key influencing factors in the effectiveness of this system however multiple cycles of recirculation may result in the accumulation of refractory substances in landfill leachate affecting the stability of the landfill system and increasing the difficulty of subsequent landfill leachate treatment chugh et al 2016 transfer of landfill leachate to sewage plants involves in biological and chemical treatment depending on the sewage treatment plant receiving the landfill leachate a convenient and inexpensive approach for landfill leachate disposal is discharge to wastewater treatment plants wwtps however the addition of leachate containing high concentrations of dom significantly impacts on the effectiveness of downstream treatment processes and reduces the overall treatment efficiency deng et al 2018 furthermore recalcitrant organic compounds have been found resistant to biological degradation allowing them to pass through wwtps in addition the non degraded organic compounds especially persistent uv absorbing dom can significantly interfere with uv disinfection in wwtps zhao et al 2012 as a result effective pretreatment should be employed to remove uv quenched substances to reduce the negative effect of landfill leachate on uv disinfection 4 2 biological treatment biological treatment of landfill leachate is broadly used due to its low economic costs and environmental impacts however a considerable number of refractory species remain in the effluent in addition organics inorganic salts and metals have been found to pose inhibitory effects on activated sludge gotvajn et al 2009 therefore the effectiveness of biological treatment largely depends on the type and composition of landfill leachate consequently biological treatments are usually selected to treat young landfill leachate with high biodegradability activated sludge process has been reported to remove up to 52 5 of cod from landfill leachate with a bod5 cod ratio of 0 17 setiadi and fairus 2003 however the activated sludge process may produce large amounts of sewage sludge standalone biological treatments generally fail to meet discharge standards because of their ineffectiveness in the degradation of bio refractory organics to overcome this limitation biological treatments are often coupled with physicochemical processes in a recent study electrocoagulation biofiltration hybrid techniques have been used to treat landfill leachate with the electrocoagulation process achieving 37 2 cod removal mainly in the form of insoluble cod and ha followed by 42 7 cod removal in the subsequent biofiltration process dia et al 2018 the integration of the air stripping mbr and nanofiltration nf processes can provide highly efficient landfill leachate treatment resulting in an overall reduction in cod ammonia color and toxicity of approximately 88 95 100 and 100 respectively amaral et al 2016 recently mbr technology has emerged as a promising method for the treatment of landfill leachate utilizing a combination of membrane separation and biodegradation processes mbr has many advantages in the treatment of landfill leachate such as high effluent quality acquisition high process stability low environmental impacts increased retention of mixed liquor suspended solids biomass and low sludge production mbr has been adapted to treat landfill leachate resulting in a wide variation in cod removal efficiencies ranging from 23 90 depending on the landfill age and operational conditions ahmed and lan 2012 compared with conventional activated sludge processes mbr has a higher loading rate and higher cod removal efficiency at a shorter hydraulic retention time 4 3 chemical treatments 4 3 1 chemical precipitation chemical precipitation is widely used as a pre treatment approach for the removal of heavy metals and nh4 n both of which negatively affect the biological treatment of landfill leachate struvite i e magnesium ammonium phosphate map and lime are typically used as the precipitants for nh4 n precipitation in the treatment of landfill leachate map precipitation can effectively remove nh4 n from landfill leachate with the highest nh4 n removal rate of 85 under optimal condition of n mg n n n p molar ratio of 1 4 1 0 8 reaction time of 60 min ph 8 9 5 and settling time of 30 min li et al 2012 the precipitation characteristics of ha and fa have been compared during the precipitant processes of mg and ca carbonates and the results showed that the precipitation yield of ha was higher than fa li et al 2015 chemical precipitation has been extensively applied for the treatment of landfill leachate due to its high capability simplicity and low economic costs however this technique has some obvious drawbacks limiting its practical application 1 low cod removal efficiency 2 high ph dependency 3 the requirement for large volumes of precipitants and 4 the generation of excessive quantities of sludge however the reuse of sludge and development of new precipitant agents are valuable research directions which can address these limitations 4 3 2 advanced oxidation processes aops the use of biological pre treatment processes to remove biodegradable organic matter can be followed by aops to remove refractory organic substances aops can convert large molecular organics into non toxic small molecular organic matter or directly mineralize it into h2o and co2 the efficiency of aops mainly depends on the generation of radicals from the oxidizing agents with high oxidation potentials fig 3 aops can be classified as fenton related o3 based uv based and other energy driven processes hydroxyl radicals oh are the dominant oxidizing agents applied in aops due to their excellent characteristics including high oxidation potential non selective oxidation of organic matter high reaction rate constants in the range 108 1010 m 1 s 1 in situ production and ability to convert refractory organic compounds into co2 and h2o zhang et al 2016 fenton related aops fenton process is initialized by fe ii catalyzing hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to generate active oxidants to degrade organic compounds such as oh the generally accepted oxidation mechanism of the fenton process is shown in eq 1 as follows brillas et al 2009 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh k2 63 m 1s 1 the ph and fenton reagent dosages are key factors affecting the removal of dom the removal rates of cod in the fenton process was approximately 35 90 jung et al 2017 fenton oxidation possesses many advantages including no requirement for extra energy inputs easy operation low system maintenance fast reaction rates and the occurrence of homogeneous reactions without energy loss however there are also some disadvantages limiting the application of this technique such as the requirement of large volumes of chemical reagents which increases operational costs the narrow operational ph range between ph 2 3 and the production of iron containing sludge which causes secondary pollution in order to overcome these drawbacks fenton like processes have been investigated for landfill leachate treatment including homogenous and heterogeneous while energy enhanced fenton processes such as the electro fenton process and photo fenton process have also been brought to treat landfill leachate in order to increase process efficiency the heterogeneous fenton like process can broaden the effective ph range to near neutral conditions and the solid catalysts can be easily separated catalysts can be categorized as fe based catalysts and non iron catalysts landfill leachate was treated with zero value iron as the catalyst coupled with microwave irradiation resulting in 58 7 cod removal under the optimal conditions of 20 ml l h2o2 ph 2 and 500 mg l catalyst dosage chen et al 2018 multi metal catalysts are also gradually being developed iron manganese binary oxide loaded zeolite has been used to treat stabilized landfill leachate achieving 88 6 cod removal under optimal condition of 0 033 mol l h2o2 ph 3 and 700 mg l catalyst dosage sruthi et al 2018 electro fenton process includes four types based on the addition and production of h2o2 and fe2 1 fe2 is added externally while h2o2 is generated in situ 2 h2o2 is externally added while fe2 is produced by a sacrificial anode 3 both h2o2 and fe2 are externally added 4 both h2o2 and fe2 are generated in situ by the addition of fe3 and o2 through electro advanced fenton process 70 of cod in landfill leachate can be removed under the condition of ph 2 0 0 187 mol l h2o2 dosage the addition of 1 745 g l fe 20 6 ma cm2 current density and a 1 8 cm inter electrode gap wang et al 2019 in the photo fenton process uv irradiation is combined with the traditional fenton reaction to accelerate the reduction of dissolved fe3 to fe2 during the treatment of landfill leachate by fenton fenton like and photo fenton processes under optimal conditions 69 6 65 9 and 83 2 cod removal can be achieved respectively zazouli et al 2012 the application of fenton like processes can address some of the drawbacks of fenton processes to a certain degree however the h2o2 utilization rates of most catalysts are relatively low moreover the stability of catalysts is also a challenge while the high catalyst synthesis costs and complex synthesis procedures limit the widespread application of these processes in addition energy consumption is extremely critical for both electro fenton and photo fenton processes o3 based aops compared to fenton processes o3 based processes result in lower levels of sludge generation and have higher oxidative power e0 2 08 v treating landfill leachate o3 can convert refractory macromolecular matter to biodegradable compounds leading to an increase in biodegradability o3 based processes can remove dom via two types of mechanisms de brito et al 2019 the first mechanism is the molecular ozone reaction based on the direct electrophilic attack of recalcitrant pollutants and the second mechanism is indirect attack by the generation of oh radicals as shown in eq 2 jung et al 2017 2 3o3 h2o 2 oh 4o2 ozonation time and o3 dose are the major influencing factors for landfill leachate treatment generally a high o3 dosage can result in high dom removal efficiency during ozonation the removal efficiencies of ha and fa can achieve up to 88 and 83 3 respectively in mbr treated landfill leachate under optimal experimental conditions chen and li 2020a however o3 production is proportional to operating costs and the landfill leachate cod removal rate catalytic ozonation i e ozone combined with catalysts is an effective way to remove dom from landfill leachate increasing the efficiency of dom removal by controlling radical generation according to the form of catalyst utilized catalytic ozonation can be classified as either homogenous catalytic ozonation or heterogeneous catalytic ozonation nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 however homogenous catalytic ozonation can cause secondary pollution and requires further separation before disposal heterogeneous catalytic ozonation can be enhanced using metal oxides while low mass transfer efficiency in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation limits its practical application he et al 2018 to enhance the landfill leachate treatment performance ozonation is often combined with other aop techniques such as electrochemistry o3 o3 h2o2 o3 uv and o3 s2o8 2 ghahrchi and rezaee 2020 the integrated process of fe0 o3 h2o2 was used to treat semi aerobic aged refuse biofilter pre treated landfill leachate achieving 43 cod removal under the conditions of 0 6 g l fe0 the generation of 26 80 mg min o3 and 1 ml l h2o2 ozonation remains a suitable option for the treatment of landfill leachate ensuring that measures are in place to improve ozone efficiency wang et al 2020 uv based aops uv irradiation is regarded as a low environmental impact and efficient way to activate peroxides in order to generate active oxidative species uv based aops are increasingly being applied in the treatment of landfill leachate to eliminate pollutants and improve the quality by producing highly reactive free radicals such as oh and so4 the uv h2o2 process is the most widely used uv based aop in both laboratory and pilot scale studies due to its high oxidation rates simple operational procedures and no sludge generation rehman et al 2018 however the uv h2o2 process needs high energy inputs to produce sufficient oh due to the low uv absorbance of h2o2 and high oh scavenging rate of water and dom in order to overcome this drawback the uv h2o2 coupled with fe2 can be used the treatment efficiencies of fenton uv h2o2 and uv fenton processes on nf concentrate from biologically pretreated landfill leachate have been compared implying that uv fenton achieved the best performance with a cod removal rate of 93 under optimal conditions zhao et al 2020 techniques based on the sulfate radical so4 such as uv persulfate s2o8 2 and uv peroxomonosulfate hso5 have also attracted broad interests so4 with high standard redox potential ranging from 2 5 to 3 1 v can react with organic matter with rate constants 105 to 109 m 1 s 1 lin and wu 2014 furthermore so4 is transformed to non toxic sulfate after oxidation reactions which does not require extra treatment and disposal processes gao et al 2012 in addition s2o8 2 and hso5 are more stable and economical than h2o2 in the photocatalytic process ultra reactive species such as oh are generated during illumination of photocatalysts resulting in the successful mineralization of organic pollutants when tio2 absorbs uv light electron hole pairs e h are formed during the process of electron transferring from the valence band to the conduction band accompanied by the generation of radicals i e oh and o2 tio2 photocatalytic degradation has attracted wide attention due to its non toxic low cost high chemical stability and environmental friendliness for landfill leachate treatment however the band gap width of tio2 is wide and only uv light can be utilized which only accounts for less than 5 of sunlight exploitation of visible light by the tio2 photocatalytic process is a key focus in photocatalytic technology development in addition low quantum yield high ohmic impedance at the solid liquid interface and subsequent separation problems are factors that limit the widespread applications of photocatalysis processes other aop processes apart from the aforementioned aops additional aop techniques have been reported for landfill leachate treatment such as ultrasound and high energy electron irradiation ultrasonic cavitation provides physical conditions of high temperature and high pressure which greatly increases the yield of oh thereby accelerating the rate of oxidation reaction and degradation ability irradiation of water with high energy electrons results in the formation of the reactive free radicals among the aops oh so4 and o3 are the main active oxidants which prefer to degrade macromolecular organics and have less effect on biodegradable small molecular hydrophilic organics the removal extent among the fdom components exhibited the order humic like component tryptophan like component fulvic like component and the sequential changes can be interpreted as biopolymers low molecular weight neutral low molecular weight acid humic substances during the fenton process aftab et al 2019b compared with oh o3 is more preferred to react with macromolecular with conjugated structure and limited to remove low molecular weight organic matter which is not suitable as a downstream treatment process to degrade down sized molecular weight byproducts derived from upstream oxidation process jung et al 2017 microwave activated peroxydisulfate process showed that 94 17 of fulvic acid with small molecular weight and high fluorescence intensity and 91 09 of fulvic acid with relatively stable and macromolecular aromatics were removed in concentrated leachate gu et al 2018 since the mechanisms of different treatment techniques are quite different their preferential removal of organic substances in landfill leachate may also exhibit difference therefore a prior knowledge about the structural characterization of dom in landfill leachate can provide a guidance for the evaluation of treatment efficiency aops have emerged as powerful tools for the treatment of landfill leachate however there are some inherent limitations such as high volumes of sludge generation high chemical dosages and narrow operating ph ranges although energy enhanced aops can improve the removal efficiency of traditional methods the energy consumption increases the overall operating cost these problems make most of the aops process lab scale even though with relatively good effluent quality finding a tradeoff between energy consumption and processing efficiency is critical for maximizing environmental benefits at the lowest cost 4 3 3 coagulation flocculation coagulation flocculation process is a simple physical chemical technique that transfers pollutants from liquid to solid phase in the form of sludge which has been frequently employed for landfill leachate pre treatment or final polishing treatment coagulation flocculation process can effectively remove organic pollutants and heavy metals but the impact on nh4 n is negligible al2 so4 3 feso4 fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 are commonly used coagulants generally iron salts are more efficient than aluminum salts due to the insolubility of ferric ion salts across a wider ph range moradi and ghanbari 2014 besides coagulation process has been proven more effective in removing high molecular weight organics with high hydrophobicity compared to low molecular weight hydrophilic organics he et al 2006 poly aluminum chloride and alum have been applied as coagulants for the treatment of landfill leachate with results showing that cod removal rates of 43 1 were achieved using poly aluminum chloride while 62 8 removal was achieved using alum ghafari et al 2009 86 of cod can be removed through the combination of coagulation flocculation process and powder activated carbon adsorption li et al 2010b however coagulation flocculation treatment has some drawbacks for example the utilization of conventional coagulation systems generates excessive sludge and cause an increase in the concentrations of soluble iron and aluminum therefore enhanced coagulation flocculation methods have been developed enhanced coagulation with in situ formation of mn fe hydroxides was employed to treat air stripped fenton oxidized leachate achieving a maximum cod removal rate of 55 98 de et al 2019 electrocoagulation has been utilized for the treatment of landfill leachate through the production of metal ions in situ by electrolytic oxidation the generated metal ions can produce polymeric hydroxides that serve as coagulants which can destroy the stability of colloids to form flocs capable of precipitation and settling xu et al 2020 the removal efficiency of cod varied from 17 to 70 under different operational conditions fernandes et al 2015 compared with the traditional coagulation flocculation process electrocoagulation generates low sludge volumes electrocoagulation flocculants can overcome the drawbacks of traditional flocculants making this method a valuable potential treatment technology 4 4 physical chemical treatment 4 4 1 adsorption adsorption process is considered as one of the most effective and promising approaches for remove dom and nh4 n in landfill leachate adsorbents with a large surface area microporous structure surface reactivity and thermostability have been utilized for the treatment of landfill leachate activated carbon ac are the most commonly used absorbents ac adsorption can improve the biodegradability of old landfill leachate although the overall cod removal rate is low with only 40 of organic matter removal achieved with 10 g l ac while the bod5 cod ratio increased from 0 18 to 0 56 gotvajn et al 2009 ac adsorption preferentially removed the chromophoric dom with hydrophobicity and microbial by products in fluorescent dom deng et al 2018 adsorption is usually combined with other physicochemical methods such as coagulation ozonation and fenton processes as a pre treatment or post treatment step using combined ozone ac adsorption treatment the highest removal rates for cod and nh4 n were 86 and 92 respectively kurniawan et al 2006 a combination of coagulation and adsorption has been imported to treat biologically treated landfill leachate achieving a cod removal rate of 80 under optimal conditions papastavrou et al 2009 the main drawbacks of ac adsorption include the requirement for ac regeneration and high levels of adsorbent consumption therefore finding a low cost and effective adsorbent has attracted much research attention ac prepared from zncl2 treatment of sewage sludge and cabbage has been applied to treat landfill leachate by adsorbing dom achieving a cod removal rate of 85 61 under optimal conditions zeng et al 2019 zeolite has also been applied for the treatment of landfill leachate as post treatment with cod removal rates of 30 poblete et al 2019 recently biochar has emerged as a good substitute for ac phosphoric acid activated biochar prepared from rice husk has been successfully used for the treatment of landfill leachate resulting in about 80 removal of cod luo et al 2019 4 4 2 air stripping the air stripping process is widely used as the pre treatment to remove nh4 n transferring nh4 n from the aqueous phase to air in the state of nh3 absorbed to either h2so4 or hcl renou et al 2008 air stripping can achieve nh4 n removal of 85 95 with initial concentrations ranging from 220 to 3260 m l bonmati and flotats 2003 51 5 of cod 74 6 of bod5 and 97 6 nh3 n were removed by air stripping within 36 h of optimum retention time followed with fenton oxidation and enhanced coagulation de et al 2019 the air stripping process can remove more ha than fa and hpi liu et al 2015 4 4 3 membrane treatment membrane techniques includes microfiltration mf uf nf and reverse osmosis ro which are widely used for selective separation according to size using semi permeable membranes membrane based techniques exhibit some outstanding characteristics such as small occupation of areas high volume loading good effluent quality and strong disinfection capability therefore membrane based techniques are regarded as a promising method to treat landfill leachate in recent decades fig 4 represents the filtration spectrum and the applicable range for each type of membrane process abdel fatah 2018 mf is typically applied as a pre treatment unit for landfill leachate treatment to eliminate colloids and suspended matter with apertures ranging from 0 1 to 1 μm uf is effective for the elimination of macromolecules and particles with an aperture ranging from 2 nm to 0 1 μm using this method cod removal rates range from 10 to 75 renou et al 2008 uf is commonly applied as a pre treatment for ro to remove the large molecular weight components in landfill leachate which may cause membrane fouling during the ro process nf process can effectively remove organic inorganic and microbial contaminants with a molecular cut offs between 200 2000 da amaral et al 2016 the interception rates for anions are ranked in the order of no3 cl oh so4 2 co3 2 and for cations in the order of h na ca2 mg2 lin et al 2020 nf processes followed by ro are more energy efficient as both stages can be operated under lower pressure conditions ramaswami et al 2018 therefore the ro process appears to be the most promising treatment method due to its strong interception capability allowing only water molecules to pass through membranes while heavy metals suspended and dissolved solids organic matter and dissolved inorganic species can be effectively removed from leachate chen et al 2020b although membrane processes have been proven to generate high quality effluent two inherent disadvantages limit the wide application first the accumulation of organic inorganic or biological species on the membrane surface and or inside the membrane pores results in membrane fouling which can severely affect the life of membrane modules and increase operating cost chen et al 2016 the second is the production of membrane concentrated landfill leachate membrane technologies cannot degrade pollutants but merely concentrates them into smaller volumes of membrane concentrated landfill leachate about 20 30 of the initial volume which contains a large amounts of recalcitrant organic compounds and inorganic salts compared to the original leachate membrane concentrated landfill leachate is more complicated and difficult to treat some pretreatment techniques can reduce membrane fouling such as the removal of suspended matter inhibition of precipitation of insoluble salts inhibition of scaling and removal of organic matter bacteria and other microorganisms improving the permeability of membranes is worthwhile to reduce the yield of membrane concentrated landfill leachate the integration of membrane processes with other treatments have been intensively investigated in recent years mbr has been employed to treat landfill leachate containing high concentrations of organic matter and heavy metals the performance of mbr varies considerably under different conditions from 23 to 98 korajlija jakopović et al 2008 combining membrane processes with chemical treatments presents a number of benefits for example the use of membranes coupled with fenton oxidation can drastically minimize membrane fouling as colloidal particle coagulation occurs during the oxidation process which can prevent colloidal particles from entering the membrane chiu and james 2006 the integrated process of fenton mf nf has been utilized to treat landfill leachate achieving highly efficient removal of cod 63 color 76 and humic substances 50 under optimal condition moravia et al 2013 5 conclusions and outlook generally the characteristics of landfill leachate such as cod bod cod ratio and landfill age are required to determine the selection of suitable treatment technologies however the chemical compositions of different landfill leachates vary notably even when they have the same cod value resulting in differences in performance during the treatment process therefore it is necessary to understand the structural characteristics of leachate dom and the induced changes during treatment in order to select the most economical and effective treatment technology our understanding of leachate characteristics has increased significantly due to the rapid development of techniques to elucidate dom characteristic considering the present developments and applications of characterization methods for landfill leachate prospective are suggested as follows 1 innovations of in situ measurements effective real time monitoring technologies are necessary to understand the intermediate state of the organic matter in landfill leachate during the treatment process especially identifying the accurate changes of chemical compositions from the molecular level is beneficial for interpreting the reaction mechanisms paths so as to optimize the processing technology although the existing characterization methods of landfill leachate such as molecular weight and structural analysis associated measurements can provide a wealth of information from different aspects they fail to monitor the intermediate state of the organic matter in landfill leachate in real time since sample pretreatment or a delay in measurement may cause changes in the characteristics offline monitoring fails to reflect the structural information of intermediates in real scenarios during treatment process to address this concern future studies should focus on the design and development of online sampling monitoring setups label free and nondestructive characterizing techniques improvement of instrumental sensitivity for detection and design of appropriate software to reduce analysis procedure and time and increase the intelligence of the detection process 2 establishment of a spectral database for landfill leachate spectral techniques can rapidly detect the main components structural characteristics and changes in dom in landfill leachate establishing a library to share and collect spectra related to landfill leachate including different waste types operational conditions climate hydrogeology and landfill age is beneficial to obtaining comprehensive information about the origin structural characteristics and fate of landfill leachate by comparing the measured spectral data with those in the database researchers can quickly capture a series of physiochemical properties of the landfill leachate samples and their treatment performance by different treatment approaches as a result some invalid methods can be filtered out saving analyzing time and economy 3 development of chemometrics for data processing data information obtained from characterization methods often overlaps and interferes due to the complex composition of landfill leachate integration of chemometrics with characterization methods especially spectroscopic methods is a useful way to unearth compositional information hidden in data from both a qualitative and quantitative point of view for instance through using parafac algorithm to analyze eem more information about the composition origin and reactivity of fluorescent components can be obtained some other stoichiometric methods such as partial least squares soft independent modeling class analog and artificial neural networks can be integrated with the characterization techniques to optimize the experimental design correct the analysis signal improve the resolution and strengthen the structural recognition despite the existence of various approaches for landfill leachate treatment no single method is effective and cost effective enough to meet the effluent standard requirements given the application and development of treatment technologies for landfill leachate studies future directions and perspectives are envisaged 1 reduction of membrane concentrates since biological treatment followed by membrane filtration is the main technology applied for landfill leachate treatment worldwide reducing the generation of membrane concentrates allows straightforward follow up treatment and avoids the production of secondary pollution the key to addressing this problem is the improvement of membrane permeability and the alleviation of membrane fouling membrane flux is determined by the external driving force and the resistance of the membrane variations in membrane fouling mainly depend on characteristics of membrane modules operating conditions and the composition of landfill leachate since the fouling process is controlled by the interaction of fluid dynamics and solution chemistry to strengthen membrane processes and reduce membrane concentrates some requirements and challenges should be considered design of novel membrane materials with high filtration and anti fouling performance application of pre treatments e g reducing the salt content prior to membrane filtration study on the mechanism of membrane fouling e g the influence of main components in landfill leachate on membrane filtration processes 2 integration of multiple treatment technologies each processing technology has its own distinctive advantages shortcomings and applicability integration of different treatments for landfill leachate synergizes the merits of single treatment and overcomes the respective defects and has been proven with higher efficiency and lower cost for example aops have high efficiency in removing organic pollutants from landfill leachate but the reagents and or operational costs can be high as a result they can be used as a pretreatment or post treatment step to enhance removal efficiency and reduce costs alternatively hierarchical treatment can be one direction worthy of study as the reaction efficiency may be reduced inhibited due to the change of reaction conditions in the single stage reaction process e g the ineffective decomposition of h2o2 and variation in solution ph through the multi stage combination the thoroughly reaction can be achieved to the utmost extent 3 recovery and reuse of valuable substances landfill leachate contains an abundance of metal elements and humic substances and the recycling of landfill leachate as secondary resources such as fertilizers is a promising approach for this point efforts should be devoted to the development of approaches for efficient separation e g resin separation and enrichment of valuable substances in landfill leachate in addition the added solid chemical reagents may be recycled and reused multiple times while the added ionic chemical reagents may be separated and extracted as raw materials for other applications it is important to make full use of the vast resources available in landfill leachate to reduce the use of expensive synthetic substances 4 treatment and characterization of eocs eocs possess the characteristics of low concentration various types and complex properties traditional pollutants i e cod and heavy metal can be effectively eliminated during the leachate treatment process however the effectiveness of eocs removal and potential toxicity during these processes has not been clearly understood therefore it is necessary to track the occurrence removal and environmental behavior of eocs in landfill leachate exploring the mutual influence and mixed toxicity of different types of eocs by developing high precision characterization methods can help to optimize the treatment technologies to conclude the evolution of instrument and analytical methodologies are important ways to drive the development in the characterization and monitoring of landfill leachate treatment efficiency cost and environmental consequences are the primary criteria for the development of sustainable

16682,pollution by heavy metal ions in aqueous systems gained researchers attention gradually toxic metal ions were always present in the environment and the living organisms could get used to specific concentrations of contaminants with given time however sudden concentration rise we are observing can make it impossible for the living organisms to adapt many ion removal technologies were developed and optimised over the years to cope with this problem including chemical precipitation adsorption membrane filtration and ion exchange adsorption and ion exchange are processes that employ certain materials that can be collectively named ion scavengers to remove ions from aqueous solutions some of the scavenger materials are still barely studied in particular polyampholytes polymeric zwitterionic materials this review showcases papers published on toxic metal ion removal by polyampholytes both commercial and experimental over last two decades many recent publications show promising properties of experimental materials that match or even outperform commercial scavengers this review was prepared to encourage other researchers to investigate this broad and still not well studied class of materials especially in context of their ion scavenging properties polyamphytes which may be especially worth the attention and further research have been highlighted as literature studies show that the most unexplored materials in the class of polyamphytes are those containing aminomethylphosphonate aminomethylsulfonate or hypophosphorous acid group graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords toxic metal ions adsorption ion scavengers ion exchange polyampholytes metal ion removal 1 introduction toxic ion removal from water systems is in high demand alike for industrial effluent treatment and water purification for drinking technological or production purposes the need for toxic metal ions removal in these cases may differ superficially however it is always crucial for protecting the environment which leads to the conservation of human health ireland 1991 vernet 1992 fӧrstner wittmann 1981 the requirement of regulating toxic substances content in water was proven boldly many times in history like in minamata japan in 1956 where water contamination by methylmercury caused many citizens to suffer from neurological disease there are countless records on lead poisoning cases worldwide through the xx century or even recent years needleman 1991 ayraulta et al 2012 eades et al 2002 hanna attisha et al 2016 to date many removal technologies were developed to stop such tragedies some of which became the best available techniques as reference methods for the new concepts best available techniques bat 2010 mosby and co workers distinguished 23 heavy metals harmful to human health mosby et al 1996 some of those metals e g lead mercury and arsenic can be detrimental to human health or the environment even though they do not bear any significant function in the physiological processes of organisms some of these metals have biological functions but exposure to higher doses can cause poisoning in humans e g iron zinc and chromium jaishankar et al 2014 in general toxic metal contamination mostly has its source in anthropogenic activities including mining metal processing and agriculture morais et al 2012 another significant source of metal ion contamination is the incineration of fossil fuels in the energy industry chen et al 2012 however according to morais and co workers some toxic metal contamination can also have natural sources like natural weathering of the earth crust or soil erosion morais et al 2012 fig 1 presents a summary of toxic metal ion sources in the environment many toxic ion removal technologies have already been developed and optimised to comply with safety regulations and effectively eliminate hazardous metal ions these methods include chemical precipitation adsorption membrane filtration precipitation flotation coagulation flotation ion exchange and electrochemical processes each method has specific advantages and downsides and found different use in water treatment technologies adsorption and ion exchange which can be considered as a particular variant of adsorption are methods that utilise materials that can be collectively named ion scavengers mcnaught wilkinson 1997a through years different ion scavengers were used or tested for toxic ions removal purposes activated carbon kluczka et al 2007 chelating agents wasay et al 1990 ion exchange resins jermakowicz bartkowiak et al 2005 kabay et al 2007 modified and unmodified biomass or biopolymers macchi et al 1986 melchor et al 1990 zhao et al 2020 modified silica mendonca 2008 iron hydroxides or oxides music 1986 polowczyk et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 xi et al 2020 fly ash ulatowska et al 2020 bituminous coal karthikeyan chaudhari 1986 nagesh krishnaiah 1989 clay yadava et al 1988 or zinc powder kimura et al 1989 the possibility of accumulative removal by plants or microorganisms was and still is researched ferrara et al 1985 hardy raber 1985 padervand gholami 2013 edokpayi et al 2015 zinicovscaia et al 2019 those materials and corresponding ion removal methods were characterised by different effectiveness therefore some of them were never used in extensive scale processes trends for water treatment and overall water technology as in any other industry sector are regulated by law and influenced by cost effectiveness hence there is a constant pursuit of environmentally safe and economically viable solutions the scavengers in the water processing industry are mostly used to collect precious metals or remove toxic trace ions ahmad 2005 cui zhang 2008 huang et al 2009 jermakowicz bartkowiak et al 2017 some of these materials are very effective in ion removal however due to their production costs they are costly an example could be special chelating resins used for special purposes in such sectors as pharmaceuticals and electronic industries due to their operational costs bunnik 1986 convention on the elaboration of a european pharmacopoeia 2000 the possible usage of scavengers especially ones that show the ability to regenerate and are recyclable or biodegradable at the end of their lifecycle could improve general wastewater treatment techniques and water production practices the ultimate goal for researchers in ion scavenger development studies would be finding a cheap efficient reusable and recyclable material that could be produced by green and cheap methods however this goal has still not been achieved most of the commercially available ion scavengers and those used in water treatment can be regenerated however in some cases the used material such as ion exchange resin is disposed of by incineration douglas 2008 in the case of selectivity of such scavengers some developed technologies show high selectivity towards specific ions these technologies use the molecular recognition technology mrt basing on the material structure that possesses specially arranged functional groups capable of complexation of specific ions mrt products are often designed to remove and recover precious metals or metalloids shinoda et al 2005 polido legaria et al 2017 callura et al 2018 an example of a group of substances used for toxic ion scavenging could be polyelectrolytes the primary mechanism of ion removal by polyelectrolytes is ion exchange or complexation gregor et al 1955 miyajima et al 1992 navarro et al 2005 okesola smith 2016 wang wang 2016 song et al 2019 however some of them can also remove contaminants by precipitation kudaibergenov et al 1983 a special group of polyelectrolytes is assembled of monomers consisting of functional groups of opposite charge or groups capable of ionising such charges kudaibergenov 2002 these materials are called polyampholytes pas and have interesting properties that regular polyelectrolytes do not possess such as the isoelectric effect of polyampholytes the phenomenon is caused by electrostatic attraction between groups of opposite charge being at a close distance to each other in the pa structure at the isoelectric point of the material kudaibergenov et al 1983 koetz et al 1991 kurmaeva et al 1991 koetz et al 1993 kudaibergenov 2002 it can lead previously swollen material to shrink causing the solvent to exit the porous material structure kudaibergenov et al 1983 kudaibergenov 2002 polyampholytes found use in multiple fields like in mining as drilling fluids in pharmacology as drug delivery systems as cryoprotective agents for cell storage and transportation or as biocompatible scaffolds in tissue engineering lin et al 2019 haag bernards 2020 stubbs 2020 however even though they have strong structural predispositions they are rarely used or researched as ion scavengers polyampholytes used in ion removal can be classified by their functional groups or by their solubility in water recovery of metal ions can be achieved using either water soluble or insoluble polyampholytes in different ways water soluble pas metal ions are complexed by functional groups of polymers and are removed from the solution as a precipitate water insoluble pas work mostly by regular ion exchange mechanism or complexation kudaibergenov et al 1983 kudaibergenov 2002 in the chemical abstracts database the first use of the term polyampholyte dates to publication by katchalsky in 1951 describing mechanical properties of co polymers of vinylpyridine and methacrylic acid katchalsky 1951 however the implementation of polyampholytes as ion scavengers got some attention in the seventies starting with work by gold and gregor in 1962 on poly n methyleneglycine complexes with copper ions gold gregor 1962 smirnov et al 1968 smirnov et al 1970 this work reviews publication from the last two decades in using polyampholytes as ion scavengers most of the papers taken into account focus mostly on ion scavenging properties of water insoluble polyampholytes with some exceptions some reviews concerning polyampholytes were published but they treat ion scavenging properties of these materials as marginal focusing mostly on their different implementations or physical properties bernards 2015 dimassi et al 2018 kudaibergenov et al 2018 kudaibergenov nuraje 2018 blackmann et al 2019 strubbs et al 2020 this paper covers recent works published between 2000 and 2020 in the further part of the paper details concerning sorption experiments are featured with corresponding short synthesis method summaries all the presented data were collected into one table containing data on materials described in this review 2 polyampholites as ions scavengers most of the commercially available ion exchangers have either anionic or cationic groups incorporated in their structure because of this only cations or anions can be exchanged by such materials polyampholytes have both group types present in their structure and they could be used as both anionites and cationites depending on ph didukh et al 2003 constantinou et al 2016 ionic strength and ph can also cause polyampholytic structures to swell with the solvent when the intramolecular ionic bonds are not existent on the contrary while the conditions allow the formation of ionic bonds inside of the polymeric structure it shrinks squeezing out the excess solvent swelling properties of polyampholytes are not the scope of this paper and they were discussed widely by kudaibergenov and other researchers didukh et al 2003 kudaibergenov 2008 vaghani et al 2012 constantinou et al 2016 nebhani et al 2016 the zwitterionic properties of polyampholytic resins can be explained on the example of imidazole carboxylate resins which can remove different ions of chromium chopabaeva et al 2010 under acidic conditions with an excess of hydrogen ions the nitrogen atom incorporated into resin is protonated due to this phenomenon the nitrogen can take part in complexing anions like oxyanion of chromium vi cr2o7 2 on the other hand this resin can easily exchange protons from the hydroxyl group for cr3 cations in basic conditions due to these phenomena the same ion exchanger type can remove different chromium species like cr3 or cro4 2 lehto et al 1997 polyampholytes could be classified by two criteria water solubility or functional groups incorporated into the polymeric matrix the first classification could base upon the fact that water soluble and water insoluble polyampholytes function differently in the presence of water soluble pas metal ions are complexed by functional groups of polymers and are removed from the solution as a precipitate in the case of water insoluble polyampholytes the ions are removed mostly by means of regular ion exchange zagorodni 2007 the second classification based on the functional groups present in the polymeric structure of these materials distinguish polyampholytes containing carboxylate and 2 methylimidazole groups aminophosphonic dimethylphosphinic iminodiacetic or other functional groups zagorodni 2007 polyampholytes can be based on polystyrene matrix as in commercially available purolite s940 and chelex 100 resins and biopolymers like lignin or chitosan kono 2014 chopabaeva et al 2010 chen et al 2016 some examples of polyampholytic structures were presented in fig 2 the ion exchange mechanism of cation scavenging by polyampholytes can be seen in fig 3 a if resin containing aminomethylphosphonic groups is introduced to an alkaline environment where metal cations are present the hydroxyl groups will exchange their protons for cation available in the solution zagorodni 2007 this kind of exchange can be efficiently conducted only under basic conditions with a low amount of concurring hydrogen cations present ali et al 2017 if metal cations were to compete with hydrogen cations in the acidic environment the exchange would be possible however the equilibrium would favour hydrogen cations over metal cations fig 3b the other rather unique mechanism of ion scavenging by polyampholytes is removing metal ions by precipitation of their corresponding hydroxides in the resins isoelectric point this phenomenon was firstly described by kudaibergenov and co workers kudaibergenov 2002 kudaibergenov et al 1983a b in fig 4 the proposed mechanism of this phenomenon is presented while the polyampholytic structure is in normal conditions either basic or acidic it can scavenge metal ions into the structure on an equilibrium basis however when the conditions come close enough to the materials isoelectric point the structure starts to shrink and this causes antagonistic functional groups to come close enough to bind together and force out previously attached metal ions from the structure which then are precipitated as hydroxides 2 1 commercial polyampholytes there is a wide range of commercial ion exchangers currently available on the market which can be used for the removal of toxic metal ions especially divalent metal cations but only a few of those materials are polyampholytes commercial polyampholyte ion exchangers are mostly those containing iminodiacetic groups or aminomethylphosphonic groups in the case of commercial iminodiacetic group bearing resins some papers were published about the performance of chelex 100 describe its affinity towards a wide range of toxic metal ions including rare earth metals esma et al 2014 hérès et al 2018 other commercial resins that employ iminodiacetic groups include amberlite irc718 and irc748 diaion cr 11 lewatit tp 207 and tp 208 purolite s930 table 1 shows experimental sorption capacities and information on isotherm and kinetic models if available as for aminomethylphosphonate group bearing ion exchangers their chelating properties were described in the literature hérès et al 2018 gholivand 2016 on the market there are already commercialised aminomethylphosphonic resins under the names amberlite irc 747 lewatit tp260 purolite 930 purolite 940 purolite 950 and unitika ur3300s these commercial resins were characterised in the literature in many publications presenting their performance in toxic metal ion removal experiments the capacities and information on isotherm and kinetic models were provided in table 2 commercial polyampholytes are only distinguishable from standard ion exchange resins by their two type charge groups present in the same structure the matrix for those materials is most commonly poly divinylbenzene or polystyrene according to collected data in tables 1 and 2 the predominant isotherm model for both iminodiacetic and aminomethylphosphonic resins is the langmuir model the first exception was the sorption of la iii on lewatit tp 260 described by esma et al and the difference in langmuir and freundlich coefficients of determination r squared was insignificantly low esma et al 2014 the second exception was the sorption of co ii and ni ii on purolite s950 and purolite s930 where depending on acid concentration the adsorption isotherm was fit by models differently at low acid concentrations the data was best matched by the langmuir model at higher concentrations the data was better to fit by the freundlich model deepatana et al 2006 deepatana and valix 2008 as shown in tables 1 and 2 the predominant kinetic model in iminodiacetic resins is the pseudo second order model except for cd ii and zn ii sorption on chelex 100 and lewatit 207 described by alvarez et al where the researchers added complexation agents like nta and cdta the kinetic model was pseudo first order alvarez et al 2004 the predominant kinetic model for aminomethylphosphonic commercial ion scavengers is the pseudo second order model with the exception of mn2 ions removal on lewatit tp 260 which was best fit by the pseudo first order model as it was described by coşkun and co workers coşkun et al 2016 and rare earth elements rre removed on lewatit tp 260 described by hérès and co workers hérès et al 2018 commercial polyampholytic ion scavengers that bear iminodiacetic or aminomethylphosphonic groups in their structure are equally efficient in terms of theoretical capacity in comparison to regular ion exchangers and excel them in terms of selectivity hence they are used in precious metals recovery 2 2 experimental polyampholytes 2 2 1 poly carboxybetaines polyampholytes containing betaine groups are a broad branch of the classification in those polymer s carboxylate group is present in the structure with another group containing a positively charged heteroatom those two groups cannot be directly adjacent mcnaught wilkinson 1997b luca et al 1997 according to the ca database the most popular poly betaines type in terms of ionic exchange are poly carboxybetaines betaine compounds are known for their metal complexing abilities a few recent works were published showing carboxybetaine ligands exceptional ability to assemble into metal organic frameworks he et al 2012 qin et al 2019 liu et al 2019 good examples of poly carboxybetaine used in toxic ion removal can be two step synthesised ethyl 3 alkylaminocrotonate derivatives presented in the paper by noh and co workers noh et al 2005 the monomer was obtained by reacting propylamine or cyclohexylamine with acetoacetic ethyl ester the monomers underwent michael addition followed by radical polymerisation of obtained monomers and acrylic aa or methacrylic maa acid in a molar ratio of 1 1 under nitrogen atmosphere crosslinked polymeric derivatives were also prepared for swelling tests with three different crosslinking agents n n methylenebisacrylamide mbaa poly ethyleneglycol dimetha acrylate pegdma and poly ethyleneglycol diacrylate pegda the monomers obtained were ethyl 3 propylaminocrotonate cropro and ethyl 3 cyclohexylaminocrotonate crocha the polymerisation products were four types of co polymers cropro aa crocha aa and cropro maa crocha maa however the authors focused mostly on the swelling behaviour of obtained materials in the dependence of ph crosslinking agent presence and swelling solution composition the authors also describe sorption and desorption experiments performed with obtained materials towards cu ii ions the adsorption desorption experiments were performed on water swollen materials using a 50 mm cu ii ion solution it was reported these materials are characterised by good regeneration ability up to 10 sorption desorption cycles durability and excellent adsorption capacity towards cu ii of 500 mg g 1 as described by copello et al in their work carboxylate and 2 methyl imidazole group containing polyampholytes are reported as efficient sorbents of pb ii and cd ii ions from water solutions copello et al 2012 one step synthesised material was obtained by mixing methacrylic acid maa 2 methylimidazole 2mi ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether egde and acetonitrile the polymerisation reaction was conducted in the presence of benzoyl peroxide in another publication authors have shown that synthesis of similar materials can be performed even in the absence of peroxide with lesser yield denis et al 2008 batch adsorption experiments were conducted at room temperature to examine pb ii and cd ii ion behaviour at different concentration in the presence of egde maa 2mi polyampholyte the experiments were carried out at ph range from ph 4 to 8 using water of varying purity the authors determined kinetics selectivity recovery and adsorption kinetics of obtained polyampholyte by monitoring the decrease metal ion concentration in solutions the results show that ph has a significant effect on adsorption yield it also differs for pb ii and cd ii as lead ions are removed at 97 in ph 7 cadmium ions can be eliminated to the same extent at ph 6 adsorption performance was proven dependent on the sorbate and solution composition as the presence of cd ii ions amplified adsorption of pb ii ions however the presence of pb ii ions decreased the adsorption of cd ii ions the authors suggest that pb ii and cd ii ion adsorption kinetics on egde maa 2mi polyampholyte is driven by a chemical reaction rather than diffusion due to the relatively short time needed to achieve equilibrium conditions the most probable complexation mechanism suggested by the authors was depicted in fig 5 according to the authors best fit kinetic models were those that took fluctuations of the energy of chemisorption into account those fluctuations are caused by interactions between the species present in the solutions designated isotherms were fitted best by the langmuir model with an adsorption capacity of 182 mg cd ii g 1 and 202 mg pb ii g 1 basing on ftir results langmuir model and mean adsorption energy derived from the dubinin radushkevich equation the predominant reaction type is ion exchange the material obtained by the authors is characterised by good adsorption capacity fast kinetics and chemical stability copello et al 2012 lázaro martínez and co workers report a toxic ion removal method on modified ethylene glycol diglycidyl esther egde polymers lázaro martínez et al 2008 lázaro martínez et al 2012 triazole trz and pyrazole pyr functionalised poly egde maas were obtained in a simple radical polymerisation reaction methacrylic acid purified by vacuum distillation egde and either 1h 1 2 4 triazole imidazole 2 methylimidazole or pyrazole was mixed with acetonitrile the polymerisation reaction was conducted by the addition of benzoyl peroxide sorption experiment was performed the same amount of investigated material was put to the vessels and the same volume of cu ii ion solution with different concentration from range 4 100 mm samples were centrifuged and the residual cu ii ion concentration was determined the experimental data were the best fit by the langmuir model the maximum capacities of obtained materials were in the range of 38 71 mg g 1 best cu ii adsorption capacity was achieved by poly egde 2mi polyampholytic materials presented by authors are characterised by medium sorption capacity towards cu ii ions in comparison to other ionic exchangers water insoluble polyampholytes obtained from polymerisation of ethylene glycol diglycidyl esther edge imidazoles im and methacrylic acid were previously tested as metal ion adsorbents copello et al 2012 lombardo lupano et al presents a way of obtaining water soluble polymeric structures by slightly modifying the synthesis method lombardo lupano et al 2016 the material was obtained by reacting imidazole with egde in acetonitrile the intermediate product is then copolymerised with methacrylic acid by radical polymerisation using benzoyl peroxide authors report that this method leads to obtaining oligomers capable of complexing metal ions by assembling themselves into hollow spheres in certain conditions the authors did not conduct per se removal experiments however they tested obtained materials behaviour in the presence of different metal ions in the presence of egde im oligomers metal ions were removed via precipitation the study reports that in the presence of fe ii and citric acid the material formed hollow spheres lombardo lupano et al also applied egde im to decolourise solutions containing anionic azo dyes db273 they observed a 73 decrease in db273 concentration after only 3 3 minutes of reaction and after 55 minutes about 93 of the dye is removed the authors thus indicated that egde and im based pas could be applied to industrial wastewater treatment in their work mouton et al present results of sorption experiments of water soluble pa that shows excellent selectivity towards cu ii ions in ni ii and co ii containing aqueous solutions mouton et al 2016 the material was obtained from monomer synthesised from glycine water solution and acetoacetic ethyl ester the monomer ethyl 3 glycinatocrotonate egc underwent michael addition with acrylic acid aa followed by radical polymerisation with the use of 2 2 azobisisobutyronitrile aibn as initiator the molar ratio of substrates for polymerisation was 1 1 egc aa didukh et al 2004 noh et al 2005 the sorption experiments were conducted using the batch 10 ml method at 298 k the sorbent concentration was 0 5 g l 1 cu ii ion concentrations in tested solutions ranged from 0 05 5 mmol l 1 at ph range from 3 to 6 and at ionic strength 0 3 m with use of na2so4 the authors determined adsorption isotherms at different ph the selectivity tests towards cu ii ni ii and cu ii were performed the regenerative ability of the pa was tested through 5 cycles with the use of 5 mm cu ii solution at ph 4 5 desorption was carried out by decreasing ph to 2 the results of the experiments were best fitted by the langmuir model the mean energy of adsorption revealed that the predominant reaction type was chemisorption the selectivity tests show that the presence of ni ii and co ii does not influence cu ii adsorption on obtained pcegc sorbent even in repeated sorption desorption cycles the maximum cu ii adsorption capacity of the pcegc material was 264 mg g 1 mouton et al revealed promising properties of water soluble pa which can be synthesised from economically attainable substrates the most remarkable quality of the described material is its selectivity towards cu ii ions excellent sorption properties of betaine groups were presented in a paper by bai et al sorbent described in this work was based on fibre as an environment friendly alternative matrix to the synthetic resin matrix the natural fibre was functionalised with betaine formation to remove uranyl ions from artificial seawater bai et al 2020 the authors obtained their sorbent by grafting imidazole 4 5 dicarboxylic acid h3imdc on hemp fibres by transforming the carboxyl group of h3imdc into acyl chloride group allowing it to form a bond with the hydroxyl group present on the cellulose fibre surface the researchers tested different molar ratios of hemp fibre to h3imdc in the range from 0 25 to 1 25 during adsorption experiments the effects of ph contact time temperature and load were tested the experiments were conducted using 20 mg of modified hemp fibres and 50 ml of uranyl nitrate solution at different concentrations isotherms were designated in 3 different temperatures 298k 308k and 318 k the adsorption kinetics were investigated at 298k it was reported that as ph rises in the range of 3 0 7 0 the amount of adsorbed uranyl ions increases from 49 mg g 1 to 222 mg g 1 this is explained by the authors as the effect of u vi species ability to freely transform into another at different ph the amount of uo2 2 which is most often occurring u vi species at lower ph is lowered in favour of different species with one positive charge as the ph rises krestou panias 2004 the uo2 2 ion transforms into uo2oh uo2 3 oh 5 and uo2 4 oh 7 so the material can uptake more uranium with the use of less active groups simultaneously the number of active groups also rises as the carboxyl groups are deprotonated when the ph reaches 7 the imidazole nitrogen and carboxyl group are also complexing the u vi species however after ph increases further the adsorbent charge is repulsing u vi species therefore ph 7 seems to be the optimal ph for u vi species removal by betaine group containing sorbents the authors presented the adsorption kinetics of hemp fibre modified with h3imdc at ph 7 298k with 20 mg of the modified fibre and 50 ml uranyl nitrate solution 100 mg l 1 the kinetic model best fit to the experimental data seems to be the pseudo second order model which suggests that the process is chemical adsorption the designated isotherms show that the rising temperature of the process increases the u vi uptake with the rise of the temperature the capacity of the material increases the greater initial concentration more u vi is adsorbed however the removal rate decreases slightly at 100 mg l 1 the removal rate of u vi species was over 90 the experimental isotherm data is fitted well by the langmuir model the theoretical calculated capacity is close to the experimental capacity this suggests that u vi adsorption to the modified hemp fibres is monolayer adsorption the authors also presented the regeneration and cycle performance of h3imdc modified hemp fibre the cycle performance was tested with five different eluents nacl naoh hcl nahco3 and hno3 the number of adsorption desorption cycles was 5 the most efficient eluent for desorption was found to be hno3 the adsorption efficiency after five cycles dropped by 12 additionally the authors report that the mass of used adsorbent lowered by 9 after 5 elutions the selectivity tests of the modified hemp fibre were performed in the presence of na k mg2 ca2 ba2 sr2 ni2 and co2 ions the solution was prepared to resemble seawater by its composition the results show that the material has exceptional selectivity towards u vi species with a little affinity towards ca2 and co2 ions another experiment conducted with the use of real seawater was conducted to test the possibility of implementing designed material in uranium removal from seawater according to the authors even at a very low concentration about 3 1 µg g 1 the u vi species are removed at a rate of over 77 from non artificial seawater the simplicity of the production method regenerative ability capacity and selectivity of the material show it can be implemented to extract residual uranium from seawater as primarily assumed the xps analysis confirmed that the adsorption takes place at a site with the nitrogen containing group as well as on carboxyl groups the raw hemp fibre was also tested in this publication to compare its performance with h3imdc modified fibre the raw material has the ability to adsorb some of the u vi ions due to carboxyl groups on its surface however the ability is greatly improved after the modification of the structure with betaine groups as materials surface area and type of groups substituted on it can intensify the ion exchange efficiency wang 2016b chen et al 2018 in the case of modified hemp fibre described by bai and co workers the capacity towards u vi rises from around 120 mg g 1 to around 221 mg g at 298 k 2 2 2 iminodiacetic polyampoholytes as presented in poly carboxybetaine chapter polymers with n donor and carboxylate groups are very useful in complexing metal ions and are used as ligands hou et al 2012 iminodiacetic ida group is one of the polycarboxylic groups widely used in chelating resins over the last two decades sorbents functionalised with the iminodiacetic group used for binding metal ions were investigated thoroughly many papers presenting research on new ida modified scavengers were published the introduction of iminodiacetic resins to the market did not quench the researcher s interest in synthesising new iminodiacetic functionalised chelating materials work published in 2001 by wang et al presents a method for synthesising new chelating polymer for cr iii cu ii cd ii pb ii ion removal wang et al 2002 the researchers aimed to obtain cost effective material for toxic ion removal from wastewater the material was obtained by reacting iminodiacetic acid sodium salt with glycidyl methacrylate gma then the monomer was polymerised by crosslinking it with methylenebisacrylamide mba in the presence of potassium persulfate as initiator the material was then shaped into polymeric beads 100 250 µm diameter the authors performed an adsorption experiment where they removed metal ions from prepared artificial wastewater the same amount of the material 0 1 g was immersed in 50 ml of cr iii cu ii cd ii pb ii nitrate salts during the experiment ph temperature alkaline metal ion content and nitrilotriacetic acid nta concentration impact was tested on sorption efficiency obtained data suggests that obtained material was efficient in cr iii removal in the whole tested ph range 2 6 the removal amount was varying from 2 47 to 2 71 mol g 1 with a maximum at ph 3 4 the cd ii and cu ii ions were removed at similar rates 1 25 1 87 and 1 61 1 87 mmol g 1 with maximums at ph 5 and 2 in the ph range of 2 6 the most significant difference in sorption efficiency could be seen in pb ii sorption where the removal was in the range of 0 99 to 1 98 with a maximum at ph 6 the content of ca ii and mg ii in the solutions did not have any significant effect on toxic metal ions uptake the presence of nta did not change the removal rates significantly the results were best fit to the langmuir model according to the authors the material obtained by wang et al removed toxic metal ions from artificial wastewater and did not show significant affinity towards alkaline metal ions the capacity of the polyampholyte was similar to the capabilities of commercial resins the removal efficiency and was not affected by the use of nta additionally the authors show results that suggest a possible use of chelating polymer with metal ions adsorbed on its surface in phenols removal from water solutions novel resin with iminodiacetic group ability to separate yb iii from y iii la iii and sm iii containing solution was presented in a paper by xiong and co workers xiong et al 2006 the authors performed sorption experiments at different ph and temperature from the ph experiment the results show that the yb iii sorption maximum of the material is at ph 5 1 the temperature experiment was carried out at 288 k 298 k 308 k and 314 k in ph 5 1 with the rise of temperature the sorption rate increases significantly according to the calculated correlation coefficient the isotherm experiment data was best fit by the freundlich model regeneration tests were also performed with five sorption desorption cycles the authors report that the sorption ability does not decrease significantly at most by 0 2 due to separation coefficients being high enough the yb iii separation from other rare earth metals is possible on tested iminodiacetic resin the resin has a sorption capacity of 187 mg g 1 towards yb iii the researched resin had shown good selectivity towards yb iii in another publication by xiong et al from 2008 the authors published results of adsorption experiment of iminodiacetic functionalised resin towards in iii ions in the presence of zn ii ions xiong yao 2008 the paper presents an experiment where the separation ability of the resin was tested at different ph the given data shows that the maximum of in iii sorption is at ph 4 5 further experiments show the dependence of the sorption process on temperature the authors designated kinetics of the process and fitted the isotherm experiment data with the freundlich model with the best result as in the previous paper xiong et al described iminodiacetic functionalised resin that performed well in the separation of ions xiong et al 2006 the experiment shows that it is possible to separate those two ion types with tested resin the sorption capacity of the material reached 235 mg g 1 at 298 k the resin retains its adsorption properties even after 3 cycles of sorption desorption divinylbenzene dvb modified with iminodiacetic groups was used by dinu and the co workers to investigate its affinity towards zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions dinu et al 2009 the polymer sorbent was prepared from technical grade dvb 65 o divinylbenzene m divinylbenzene p divinylbenzene 36 ethylstyrene dvb was copolymerised with acrylonitrile in the presence of benzoyl peroxide as an initiator the obtained copolymer underwent aminolysis hydrolysis reaction to transform nitrile groups into primary amine groups the iminodiacetic groups were attached to primary amine groups by their carboxymethylation two variants of the sorbent cr 10 and cr 15 were obtained containing 10 and 15 of dvb respectively the authors described two sets of sorption experiments the first set was batch sorption experiments firstly with the use of 0 3 g obtained sorbent swollen with water and 25 ml corresponding metal ion solution with a concentration of 0 5 mmol l 1 the experiments were carried out in ph 5 5 at 293k for isotherm designation the concentration stayed at 0 5 mmol l 1 the amount of sorbent varied in the range 0 05 0 4 g the authors tested the selectivity of the polymeric material by immersing the sample in a mixed solution of three studied metal ions the second set of experiment was the column sorption experiment the feed was the solution of zn ii pb ii and cd ii at a concentration of 0 16 mmol l 1 the feed ph was 5 5 the temperature of operation was not specified the column was packed with 4ml of swollen resin and then the working solution was let through the column at 1 33 ml min 1 velocity the desorption experiment was performed with 0 1 m hcl with 0 42 ml min 1 velocity during batch sorption experiments the affinity of the resin towards separate ions was tested from the calculated distribution coefficient in the non competitive environment it was clear that cd ii was more easily adsorbed than pb ii which was more easily adsorbed than zn ii the more crosslinked type of resin adsorbed metal ions more easily the data obtained from the isotherm designation experiment was well fitted by both freundlich and langmuir models the selectivity studies in batch mode suggested that material obtained by the authors could be useful in the selective removal of certain cations the selectivity order was pb ii zn ii cd ii according to the authors of the publication the results obtained can be correlated with the radius of the hydrated cation it is the smallest for pb ii and affects its faster removal compared to zn ii and cd ii the continuous flow experiment was performed to test resins capacity and selectivity in dynamic mode in the constant flow mode experiment selectivity was confirmed and similarly as in the batch selectivity experiment higher affinity of pb ii ions towards resin was observed the breakthrough points were localised at 40 and 75 bed volumes for zn ii and cd ii respectively the desorption experiment has shown that the maximal concentration of recovered pb ii ions occurred at 10 bed volumes the total desorption occurs after about 17 bed volumes according to the authors report the obtained resins have shown better removal efficiency of metal ions than commercial ida resins like amberlite 718 and lewatit tp 207 under competitive conditions according to the results the crosslinked dvb an ida copolymer showed good selectivity towards pb ii in the presence of zn ii and cd ii the adsorption capacities of cr 10 were 0 81 and 0 69 mmol g 1 for cd ii and pb ii respectively when for cr 15 they totalled at 0 99 and 0 51 mmol g 1 in comparison to other ida group bearing materials dvb an ida materials did perform moderately performance of ida modified amberlite xad 2 resin was presented by panahi and co workers the authors showed a detailed scope on different ion interference on pb ii ion sorption panahi et al 2011 the authors modified commercial dvb amberlite resin by firstly nitrating phenyl groups then reducing nitrate groups to amine groups which underwent aza coupling to be reacted with salicylic acid the product was then ethylated to allow chlorination of the carboxyl group the chlorinated intermediate was then reacted with iminodiacetic acid step by step method can be seen in fig 6 below the authors described several sorption experiments the obtained material was used for batch sorption experiments the resin sample was immersed in 100 ml of 0 5 µg ml 1 at optimal ph 5 the used material was then desorbed using 10 ml 0 5 m nitric acid isotherm studies were performed at 293k 303k and 313k with the fixed amount of sorbent 50 mg and 50 ml of solutions with a concentration of pb ii in the range from 10 to 100 µg ml 1 the ph was adjusted with 0 01m acetate buffer the selectivity experiment was conducted by introducing foreign metal ion to the system separately and in a mixture of all the tested ions the selectivity of the resin was tested in the presence of cr ii ni ii co ii fe ii hg ii cd ii zn ii ba ii ag i cu ii k i al iii the results presented by the authors show that the pb ii removal rate at ph 5 is 95 the maximal sorption capacity of the material under optimal conditions ph 5 293k was found to be 67 mg g 1 the reusability of the resin was tested in 20 sorption desorption cycles and the performance efficiency loss was less than 10 after the 20th cycle according to the authors the resin was stable chemically after 6 months in the ambient environment they reported no significant change in resin performance the data from the isotherm experiment is best fit by the langmuir model the authors also tried to fit the data with freundlich temkin and redlich peterson isotherm models the selectivity tests did not show any significant impact of separate foreign ions the difference in pb ii removal was always less than 3 however when all of the ions were introduced at once the removal rate of pb ii dropped by 8 6 the resin described in the paper by panahi et al performed relatively poorly compared with other chelating resins the production method seems to be complicated time and resource consuming however according to the authors the intended application of the material was as an indicator of trace pb ii in water and it was also tested as pb ii indicator in human plasma the affinity of pb ii cd ii mn ii and zn ii ions was tested towards the new chelating resin obtained by shaaban and co workers shaaban et al 2013 the resin was obtained through a series of reactions firstly the synthesis of poly acrylamide co n n methylenebisacrylamide was performed the copolymer was then crosslinked via transamidation and reacted with sodium monochloroacetate the authors conducted the batch experiment to designate isotherm perform kinetic studies test ph and temperature impact on the process the ph experiment was performed with the use of 0 1 g of the resin in 100 ml 5 mm metal ion solution the isotherm experiment was conducted at 298 k with the use of 0 1 g of the resin in 100 ml of metal ion solution of concentration from a range of 1 25 mm in optimal ph the temperature dependence of the process was studied in the range from 298 318 k the kinetic studies were performed in the same conditions and with metal ion concentration at an optimal value the continuous flow adsorption experiment was performed in a column of 1 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height the column was packed with 1 g of resin the initial concentrations of metal ions in working solutions were the optimal values from previous experiment 7 5 5 8 and 6 4 mm of pb ii zn ii mn ii and cd ii respectively the feed flow velocity was set at 1 ml min 1 the continuous flow adsorption experiment was performed at 298 k the resin regeneration experiment was also performed with the use of 0 2 m hno3 the sorption desorption of resin was repeated five times sorption capacity for corresponding ions were 1 7 1 5 1 6 and 1 77 for pb ii zn ii mn ii and cd ii respectively the optimal ph values were 5 6 6 2 6 and 6 the kinetic model fit best to obtained data was the second order kinetic model the isotherm experiment data was the best fit by langmuir isotherm the data were also fitted by freundlich and temkin models with slightly lower accuracy calculated capacities according to the langmuir isotherm model matched experimental capabilities well except for cd ii where the difference was 0 2 mm g 1 the continuous flow adsorption experiment data showed that the solutions start to break through at 70 90 110 and 80 ml for pb ii zn ii mn ii and cd ii respectively the sorbent regeneration experiment demonstrated that after five cycles the resin lost from 9 19 of its original capacity depending on the ions and the best reusability was proven for cadmium in comparison to data presented in other papers published prior to shaaban et al proving their crosslinked polymer was bearing ida groups outperformed other chelating resins of the same type liu et al 2011 li et al 2011 in fact the capacities of materials presented by shaaban et al was comparable to commercial resins the copolymerised n n dimethylacrylamide dmaa and allyl glycidyl ether with iminodiacetic acid was tested to remove cadmium from artificial solutions seawater and freshwater the polymer was obtained through copolymerisation od dmaa with allyl glycidyl ether age bearing ida groups in the presence of the initiator under inert atmosphere panahi et al 2013 the sorption and desorption experiments were conducted in the ph range of 3 6 the 0 1 g sample of the resin was immersed in 100 ml 0 5 g ml 1 solution of cd ii ions the authors also performed an isotherm experiment with the use of 0 1 g of the resin and 100 ml of cd ii solutions at concentrations from range 10 100 µg l 1 the interference of foreign ions was investigated such as pb ii ca ii mg ii zn ii cu ii fe ii na i k i at a concentration of 10 µg l 1 while the concentration of cd ii was 10 mg l 1 the resin performance was also tested in environmental samples such as the caspian sea kosar aqueduct the water samples were spiked with cd ii at a concentration from 0 2 0 6 mg l 1 and then concentrated ten times for experimental purposes the results showed that the optimal ph for cd ii sorption on the resin was ph 4 2 the isotherm experiment data was the best fit by the langmuir model the authors reported only calculated capacity estimated at 69 4 mg g 1 the foreign ion interference experiment showed that sodium and potassium ions do not affect cd ii sorption at all while pb ii ions decrease the cd ii sorption by 0 7 and ca ii mg ii zn ii cu ii fe ii decrease the sorption efficiency of cd ii from 3 7 9 6 with iron and magnesium ions is having the greatest impact the sorption experiment from environmental samples showed that the material can remove around 90 of cd ii from sweet water and about 85 from seawater the obtained resin did show affinity to cd ii ions trace metal ions do not affect the sorption process significantly the resin compared with other ida bearing sorbents did perform decently achieving 0 62 mmol g 1 capacity monri and co workers presented an approach similar to panahi and co workers the authors grafted similar crosslinked polymers with ida groups on inert material an adsorption experiment was conducted with the use of ida grafted silica gel and al iii affinity towards it was reported age ida co dmaa polymer was grafted on the silica gel the adsorption experiments data showed that al iii had an affinity towards the ida composite the capacity of the material was estimated at around 0 94 mmol g 1 monri et al 2014 bio sorbent based on rice bran with ida groups was used in adsorption experiments towards hg ii and cd ii zhou 2016b the sorbent was obtained through a series of reactions firstly the hydroxyl groups were reacted with epichlorohydrin then the intermediate underwent amidation reaction with ethylenediamine the primary amine group was then reacted with sodium chloroacetate obtaining ida modified rice bran the authors performed batch adsorption experiments with 0 1 g of the material in 100 ml of hg ii or cd ii ions with regulated ph temperature and ionic strength the regeneration experiment was also conducted six sorption desorption cycles were performed the authors also measured the surface area and quantity of carboxyl groups for both raw material and ida functionalised biomass the optimal ph for hg ii and cd ii was found to be 5 and 6 respectively at 298 k the temperature dependence experiment showed that for both ions the increase of temperature improves the sorption capacity of the material slightly the isotherm experiment data was the best fit by langmuir isotherm the maximal capacities for both ions were found to be at 0 82 and 0 95 mmol g 1 for hg ii and cd ii respectively the increase of ionic strength has a negative effect on both ion affinity towards ida modified biomass the sorption capacity of the material after 6 cycles of sorption desorption decreased by almost 19 the surface of the modified material was not improved widely however the number of carboxylic groups rose by 0 864 mmol g 1 the modified biomass performed decently in hg ii and cd ii removal in optimal conditions the capacities of described materials were estimated at 1 19 and 1 15 mmol g 1 of hg ii and cd ii ions respectively in another publication describing a similar solution by zhou and co workers where modified alkali lignin was used as a matrix for ida groups zhou et al 2016c cu ii cd ii and pb ii ions removal by synthesised crosslinked poly acrylonitrile material bearing iminodiacetic groups was reported by el bahy and el bahy el bahy el bahy 2016 the material was synthesized from acrylonitrile and n n methylenebisacrylamide via suspension polymerisation in the presence of initiator abin under an inert atmosphere the obtained polymer was hydrolysed simultaneously to amidation reaction with ethylenediamine the intermediate was then reacted with sodium monochloroacetate the obtained resin was then used in batch sorption experiments as well as continuous flow experiment the ph impact was investigated by immersing 0 1 g of the resin in 100 ml 5 mm metal ion solution with ph in a range from 1 to 5 6 at 298 k adsorption isotherm experiment was performed by immersing 0 1 g of resin in 100 ml of metal ion solution with a concentration in the range of 1 to 20 mm the process kinetics were investigated for this purpose 0 1 g of the sorbent was mixed with 100 ml of the solution at optimum ph and maximal initial concentration of metal ions the continuous flow adsorption experiment was performed in a glass column 1 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height the column was packed with 1 g of the ida bearing copolymer the feed solutions containing cu ii cd ii and pb ii with an initial concentration of 5 mm at optimal ph and 298 k were let through the column at 1 ml min 1 velocity the regeneration was tested by performing the sorption desorption cycle five times the optimal ph was found to be 5 4 for cu ii and 5 6 for cd ii and pb ii the maximum capacities of the sorbent were 2 43 1 93 and 1 45 mmol g 1 for cu ii cd ii and pb ii respectively at optimal ph and 298 k the isotherm experiment data was the best fit by the langmuir model the capacity calculated from the langmuir model was close to experimental values the kinetic model that fit the experimental data best was the pseudo second order model the results from the continuous flow experiment show that the breakthrough for the investigated ions happens at 180 150 and 110 ml for cu ii cd ii and pb ii respectively the regeneration experiment showed that after 5 cycles the resin lost around 10 capacity during cu ii and pb ii sorption but 15 capacity during cd ii sorption the material described by el bahy el bahy was placed in a group of most effective chelating sorbents towards cu ii cd ii and pb ii ions it is characterised by good regeneration properties and a large quantity of ida groups compared to most ida resins commercially available styrene divinylbenzene resin d301 was modified with iminodiacetic groups was described by an and co workers an et al 2017 the resin used for modification by the authors was a type of basic macroporous resin that previously shown potential as metal ion removing material zhang et al 2014 due to the moderate content of active binding groups d301 is as efficient as other commercially available ion exchangers therefore the authors proposed functionalisation method where ida groups are bound to resin by poly glycidyl methacrylate linker this modification increased active binding group quantity from 4 8 meq g 1 up to 8 96 meq g 1 as of cu ii for the first step of transformation 1 g of dry d301 resin was added to 94 8 g 100 ml 1 3 mol of dimethylformamide with 10 7 g 75 mmol 10 ml of glycidyl methacrylate gma the polymerisation reaction was initiated by the addition of 0 16 g 0 7 mmol ammonium persulfate aps under nitrogen atmosphere at 323 k for 18 h the product was extracted with acetone in the soxhlet apparatus to remove by products poly glycidyl methacrylate pgma modified d301 was then dried under vacuum in the second step 1 g of pgma modified resin with 5 g 37 6 mmol ida acid was added to 100 ml of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at ph 12 the mixture was stirred for 8 h at 353 k the product was then rinsed with water to neutral ph batch 1000 ml adsorption experiments were carried out with the use of 10 mg of modified resin and aqueous solutions of cd ii cu ii pb ii ions at different concentrations 0 0 0 5 mmol l 1 for isotherm designation kinetics capacity and efficiency of adsorption were designated in various conditions of ph in the range of 0 to 6 and temperature from 293 to 313 k column experiments to test the selectivity of obtained material were also described in this paper solution 3500 ml containing cd ii 10 mg l 1 and ca ii ion 10 mg l 1 was pumped through a column filled with 0 1 g of ida modified d301 resin regeneration experiments were performed up to 10 cycles with the use of 10 ml of 1 m nitric acid per 1 g of modified resin water purity dependence was tested with a solution containing k i na i ca ii and mg ii ions at different concentrations 0 5 10 mmol l 1 the results have shown that the adsorption efficiency of modified d301 resin increased with its rising dosage langmuir and sips models are well fitted to experimental data moreover the calculated m value from the sips equation indicates that this process is the langmuir monolayer adsorption process the adsorption capacity of the obtained material is dependent on ph rising proportionally in the range of ph 1 to 5 for each of investigated ions with maximum capabilities of 286 mg cu ii g 1 621 mg pb ii g 1 and 259 mg cd ii g 1 the temperature dependence test has shown that the adsorption of pb ii cd ii and cu ii ions on ida modified d301 resin is endothermic the batch experiments of k i na i ca ii and mg ii presence dependency of the adsorption shown no change in the adsorption capacity of the new material the column experiments have shown excellent selectivity of obtained material towards cd ii in the presence of ca ii conducted experiments suggest that the described polyampholyte is capable of efficient adsorption of cd ii pb ii and cu ii ions the obtained material is highly selective towards investigated ions in the presence of k i na i ca ii and mg ii ions in comparison to other experimental and commercial scavengers ida modified d301 resin performed very well in toxic ion removal the material did retain its good sorption properties through 10 regeneration cycles nanocomposites with ida groups for uranium sorption were synthesized and tested by galhoum galhoum 2019 the sorbents were based on magnetite nanoparticles to possibly expand the surface area the author performed several sorption experiments and compared his results with the values found in the literature the sorbent was obtained by coating magnetite nanoparticles mnps with ida functionalised pgma firstly the precursors were prepared mnps were prepared by simple precipitation of fe2 and fe3 ions by naoh at 313 k with a molar ratio of fe ii to fe iii around 1 2 polyglycidyl methacrylate bearing ida groups were synthesised by suspension polymerisation of gma with abin as initiator under an inert atmosphere the polymer was then reacted with ammonia to attach the primary amine group which underwent carboxylation reaction with monochloroacetic acid the mnps and ida pgma were then milled together in a planetary milling system leading to obtaining magnetic nanocomposite the sorption experiments conducted by the author consisted of investigation of the ph effect designating adsorption isotherms and kinetics and reusability of the material for the ph effect the sorbent dose was 0 5 g l 1 the ph range of the scope was 1 6 at the not specified temperature the adsorption isotherm experiment was conducted by immersing the sample in u vi ion solutions of concentration in the range 25 300 mg l 1 at ph 4 sorbent dosage for kinetics investigation was fixed at 0 5 g l 1 the number of sorption desorption experiments for the regeneration experiment was five the eluent used for u vi recovery was 0 25 m nahco3 solution the optimal ph for u vi sorption was around ph 5 the sorption capacity of ida pgma mnps was found to be 0 44 mmol g 1 towards u vi the adsorption isotherm experiment data was the best fit by the langmuir model the calculated value of capacity was lower than the experimental value the kinetic model that fit the kinetic experiment data was the pseudo second order model the reusability experiment showed that the sorption capacity does not decrease more than 12 after 5 cycles from the data cited by the author ida pgma mnps were rather in the middle of sorbents that were investigated for u vi recovery over the years where the best sorbent tetraethylenepentamine modified mnps had sorption capacity reaching 1 93 mmol g 1 2 2 3 aminomethylphosphonic polyampholytes in the case of new materials bearing the aminomethylphosphonic groups there were a few reports in the recent decade concerning their use as metal ion scavengers aminomethylphosphonate functionalised dvb material for copper removal was described by ciopec and co workers the authors present isotherm and kinetic studies to describe their material s properties ciopec et al 2012 the sorbent was synthesised by functionalising commercial dvb and one prepared by the authors the polymers underwent amidation to a different extent and were then grafted with aminomethykphosphonic acid the different degree of amidation was set to obtain sorbents with the various phosphorus content the adsorption performance of obtained materials was tested in a series of batch experiments the adsorption isotherms were designated with the cu ii concentration in the range 5 40 mg l 1 the temperature influence was tested with 10 mg l 1 cu ii solution the adsorption kinetics was investigated the isotherm data obtained in the experiments was the best fit by the langmuir model calculated capacities were significantly higher than experimental ones it was revealed that the higher aminomethylphosphonate group quantity improves the sorption properties of the material the best result was obtained for material with 1 39 mmol g 1 aminomethylphosphonate groups where capacity reached 0 8 mg g 1 the kinetic model that fit experimental data well was the pseudo second order model the aminomethylphosphonate group bearing dvb material did not perform well the molar capacity of the material was lower than 0 02 mmol g 1 which is exceptionally low for a resin having 1 39 mmol g 1 aminophosphonic groups performance of aminomethylphosphonated polymer grafted on silica gel was reported by tsosie the batch and column performances of the obtained material towards u vi were descrived tsosie 2015 firstly amorphous silica was silanized with methyltrichlorosilane and chloropropyltrichlorosilane mixture then amidated composite was obtained by adding poly allylamine paa the intermediate underwent mannich reaction with formaldehyde and phosphorus acid leading to obtaining aminomethylphosphonate grafted composites sorption experiments were performed including ph influence test sorbent capacity estimation and column experiment the ph influence was investigated through immersing 0 2 g of composite in uranium solution with a concentration of 1 g l 1 with ph in the range from 2 8 the sorbent capacity was investigated through a batch sorption experiment where 0 2 g of sorbent was immersed in 20 ml of u vi solution 1g l 1 in ph 3 4 and ph 7 8 the column experiment was performed by packing a column with 5 ml 2 1 g of the material and then pumping feed solution through the bed at 1 ml min 1 velocity 0 1 column volume min 1 in ph 6 6 the desorption was also performed with the use of 2m na2co3 solution the capacity of the material towards u vi was 0 41 mmol g 1 for and additionally towards europium ions being 0 43 mmol g 1 the column experiment showed that the breakthrough started at around 80 ml of effluent in ph 7 and after 200 ml in ph 3 3 the u vi bound to the sorbent was stripped almost completely with 30 ml of na2co3 eluent the material did not perform well compared to other u vi sorbents another example of aminophosphonate adsorbent can be a silica based composite described by artiushenko and co workers in their publication on rare earth elements ree recovery the authors described the adsorption properties of the material towards 14 rre including la ce pr nd sm eu gd tb dy ho er tm yb and lu artiushenko et al 2020 the composite was obtained by subjecting silica gel with primary amine groups to mannich reaction with formaldehyde and phosphonic acid batch sorption experiments were conducted using a solution containing 100 µg l 1 each of investigated ree ions at ph 3 at ambient temperature the desorption experiment was conducted to estimate ree recovery by stripping the sorbent with different eluents including hcl hno3 and edta the adsorption of rees on aminophosphonated material was achieved at a ph range of 2 6 the adsorption experiments show that composite allows good recovery of the investigated elements up to 100 at low concentrations the best eluent for rees recovery from aminophosphonated silica gel was 2m hno3 and 0 01 edta ph 8 the material seems to perform well in trace ree recovery however the lack of information about adsorption properties like kinetics and isotherms does not allow to confirm whether the adsorbent is characterised by good sorption capacity or not 2 2 4 other types in previous chapters polyampholytes bearing specific groups were presented this chapter includes all other types of polyampholytes that did not fit into presented groups such as soluble carboxyethylated chitosans polyamine graphene oxide composite and more method for obtaining metal ion removing agents that were deviated from chitosan was presented by bratskaya et al polyampholytes obtained by the authors differed in substitution degrees of carboxyethylation reactions soluble polymers were tested as flocculants complexing agents of ni ii cu ii and zn ii ions bratskaya et al 2009 investigated polymers were obtained by the experimental procedure described by pestov and co workers for the potassium form of chitosan derivatives pestov et al 2007 chitosan was mixed with acrylic acid and water the mixture was set aside until the gel was formed the gel was heated at different temperatures to obtain the required substitution degrees the authors researched three n 2 carboxyethyl chitosan derivatives with 0 77 1 04 1 64 substitution degrees of carboxyethyl groups sorption experiments were performed to investigate the effect of ph and the impact of the substitution degree of the pa on ions removal efficiency for the experiments cecs solution was prepared by dissolving samples with deionised water at 288 k solution of mixed hydroxides was also prepared for the purpose of sorption experiments by addition of 0 1 m koh to a solution containing ni ii cu ii and zn ii at concentrations of 70 mg l 1 1 2 mmol l 1 84 mg l 1 1 3 mmol l 1 and 46 mg l 1 0 7 mmol l 1 respectively the experiments were performed with zeta potential measurements to establish whether the removal is caused by coagulation flocculation or chelation according to the electrokinetic properties of investigated pas optimal ph range for hydroxide flocculation is ph 7 5 9 the authors suggest that due to the deprotonation of amine groups and ionisation of carboxylic groups in this ph range negative charge of pa structures increases therefore a lower flocculant dose is required for efficient performance the cac derivatives as proposed by the authors basing on the correlation of electrokinetic properties of the colloids and the efficiency of metal ion removal seem to perform mainly as flocculants the efficiency is dependent on substitution degree as expected with an increasing number of carboxyethyl groups the efficiency rises the authors shown method of metal ion removal the cac polyampholytes worked better than standard flocculant the chitosan derivatives seem to be more selective towards zn ii and cu ii rather than ni ii described pas shown promising properties as flocculation precipitation promoters adsorptive properties of polyampholytes obtained by inoculative polymerisation of glycidyl methacrylate gma on the wood matrix and further modification by addition of poly ethyleneimine pei poly ethylenepolyamine pepa or 2 vinyl pyridine 2vp were reported by chopabaeva and co workers obtained materials were successfully tested towards cr2o7 2 affinity chopabaeva et al 2010 the synthesis method for the materials was not provided however the authors show data that suggests a dramatic change of sorption capacity compared to raw unmodified wood the maximum of sorption capacity is reached below ph 2 for pepa and pei sorbents from 110 60 mg g 1 and 150 100 mg g 1 in ph range from 2 2 to 5 to 270 300 mg g 1 and 250 270 mg g 1 in ph range from 2 to 1 respectively the maximum sorption capacities for pei pepa 2vp derivatives are 343 2 426 4 and 260 mg g of cr2o7 2 ions per gram of material the authors explain the change of sorption capacity for anionic exchange materials by protonation of amide groups due to the activity of carboxylic groups is suppressed in a strongly acidic environment therefore the material having those two group types close to each other in the structure becomes polycation and allows chromium ions binding if the material is placed in different ph ranges where such phenomenon does not occur amine and carboxylic groups bond together creating an intermolecular ionic bond making the chromium ion adsorption inefficient the authors compared their results with different commercially available highly basic ionic exchangers that reach 130 116 mg g 1 maximum capacity for chromium ions obtained materials could be very efficient in extreme ph conditions crosslinked gelatine and chitosan co polymers capable of cu ii adsorption were reported by wang and co workers the paper presents the effect of ph on the cu ii adsorption towards chitosan gelatine co polymer regenerative properties of the obtained material adsorption kinetics of the studied case and the isotherm is also presented by the authors wang et al 2013 the synthesis proceeded as follows chitosan powder cts and different amounts of gelatine ge are dissolved in acrylic acid water solution the reaction was carried out at 343 k under an inert atmosphere acrylic acid n n methylene bis acrylamide mba and ammonium persulfate aps was added the polymerisation reaction proceeded at 343 k in a nitrogen atmosphere batch adsorption experiments 25 ml to determine isotherms were conducted with the use of 50 mg of adsorbent in solution with cu ii concentrations in the range of 190 1588 mg l 1 at 303 k in ph 5 75 to study adsorption kinetics of the process series of the same samples were prepared 50 mg of the adsorbent was introduced to 25 ml of solution with cu ii ion concentration at 635 mg l 1 the samples were then filtered at different times 1 to 60 min and the residual cu ii concentrations were tested the regenerative properties for obtained materials were tested by adding 70 mg of obtained material to 25 ml of 635 mg l 1 cu ii solution at ph 5 75 after reaching adsorption equilibrium the material was desorbed with 25 ml of 0 05 m hcl solution under magnetic stirring for 1 h the material was then regenerated with a 0 1 m naoh solution washed with distilled water and dried in the oven for future use the sorption desorption cycles were performed five times the ph had a significant effect on the adsorption capacity of obtained material where the capacity reaches its maximum at ph 5 75 in the case of all types of obtained co polymers the sorbate dependency test adsorption capacities increased drastically until the concentration of cu ii reached 635 mg l 1 the experimental isotherm data were the best fitted by the langmuir model the adsorption capacities calculated from the langmuir model are close to those obtained from experiments the kinetic model that matched the experimental data was the pseudo second order model higher content of gelatine seems to improve the adsorption rate of the materials but lowers the adsorption capacity slightly the regeneration experiments have shown that the material loses its adsorption capacity over 5 cycles by about 25 in comparison to its original capacity about 230 mg l 1 the optimal concentration of gelatine in the material seems to be 2 w w the materials obtained by wang et al present interesting adsorption properties incorporating gelatin into the material structure seems to boost its adsorption capacity towards cu ii ions the material had an adsorption capacity at 261 mg l 1 of cu ii in optimal conditions the regenerative properties of these polyampholytes are its disadvantage however as it is biopolymer based it could still reduce excess use of crude oil derivatives graphene oxide go and triethylene tetramine teta polyampholyte hydrogel it s adsorptive properties were descrived by zhou and co workers zhou et al 2016a firstly the radical polymerisation of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid was conducted by adding ammonium persulfate as a polymerisation initiator and a go aqueous solution with n n methylenebisacrylamide mba as the crosslinking agent n n n n tetramethylethylenediamine as crosslinking accelerator and sodium dodecylsulfonate as an emulsifier the reaction was carried out at 333k in the second step the product underwent methyl ester aminolysis in the presence of teta at 363 k the obtained polyampholyte was then rinsed with deionised water to remove by products and residual substrates adsorptive properties of the obtained pa were tested in batch experiments towards pb ii and cd ii ions at a concentration of 40 mg l 1 at a ph range of 2 to 7 and ionic strength range from 0 01m to 0 1m regulated by either naclo4 or liclo4 the temperature dependence was also investigated in a range of 293 to 313 k regeneration ability of novel pa was tested in the sorption desorption experiment column experiments were performed with two different feed solutions the first solution was composed artificially and contained pb ii cd ii ca ii mg ii na i and k i ions at a concentration of 40 mg l 1 the second solution was industrial effluent containing 2 23 mg l 1 pb ii 4 18 mg l 1 cd ii 203 7 mg l 1 zn ii 14 75 mg l 1 mn ii 4 67 mg l 1 ni ii 9 78 mg l 1 cu ii 0 042 mg l 1 cr ii and 10 02 mg l 1 fe ii the effluent was sampled from the shuikoushan smelting plant located in hengyang hunan province china the batch tests results were used to determine isotherms go teta pa hydrogel towards pb ii and cd ii at equilibrium concentrations of ions ranged between 0 to 27 5 mg l 1 the adsorption process kinetics were investigated obtained experimental data were the best fitted by the pseudo second order model for both adsorbed ion species the ph influenced the adsorption process greatly especially at greater ionic strengths the isotherms determined for both investigated ions prove that the adsorption process of investigated ion species on go teta pa hydrogel is endothermic the obtained isotherms for pb ii ions are best fitted to the langmuir isotherm model when the freundlich model did not give a good representation of experimental data on the contrary the freundlich model was best fitted for cd ii ions with the langmuir model giving poor results the authors suggest that based on ftir and xps studies the predominant adsorption mechanism was an ionic exchange with complexation the maximum adsorption capacity of go teta pa was 216 mg g 1 and 154 mg g 1 towards pb ii and cd ii respectively the column experiments results show that breakthrough curves for both investigated ions for artificially created feed are only displaced by a whit after 3 cycles this proves that the obtained material could perform well even in repetitive sorption desorption cycles even when feed is rich in metal ions at almost no loss of adsorption capacity the desorption process of bound ions was performed with the use of a low amount 34 ml of 0 1 m hcl as eluent the material prepared and described by zhou et al showed promising properties either in artificial and actual industrial wastewater treatment the sorption capacities of those materials seem to be moderate polyampholyte nanocomposites synthesized with the use of gamma radiation and their co ii removal properties were described by elsharma and co workers elsharma et al 2019 firstly to carboxymethylcellulose cmc sodium salt acrylamide sodium acrylate aam sa solution was added followed by diallyldimethylammonium chloride dadmac and n n methylenebisacrylamide nmba as a crosslinker following the iron iii oxide magnetic nanoparticles were added the mixture was then flushed with nitrogen and sonicated the mixture after sonication was irradiated in glass vials at room temperature using the cobalt 60 gamma cell of mc 20 type the molar ratios of substrates varied and the dose rate of the radiation source was 0 98 kgy h 1 the sorption experiments were conducted using the batch method to study the adsorptive properties of obtained p dadmacaam cmc fe2o3 and p dadmac sa cmc fe2o3 towards co ii ions the effect of ph was tested using co ii solution of known concentration spiked with co60 isotope in range of ph from 1 to 6 below the ph of precipitation of co oh 2 with a constant concentration of sorbents at 100 mg l 1 the kinetics were tested by measuring the concentration of residual co ii in solution overtime of 3 hours the initial concentration of the solution was 100 mg l 1 in determining the isotherms a certain amount of the dry material was immersed in 10 ml of prepared co ii solution at 298 k for 24 h after that time the concentration of residual co ii was measured the temperature dependence was also tested at a range from 298 k to 333 k additionally the authors provided a lot of information on swelling properties of newly obtained materials in the dependence to ph and copolymer concentrations accordingly to the ph dependence test further experiments were conducted at ph 5 the sorption kinetics experiment revealed that the experimental data are the best fitted by the pseudo first order model because it provides a higher determination coefficient and provides a calculated qe that is very close to the experimental value the adsorption isotherms and capacities were determined the capacities of p dadmacaam cmc fe2o3 and p dadmac sa cmc fe2o3 towards co ii ions were 69 7 mg g 1 and 75 2 mg g 1 respectively isotherm data was fitted with two models langmuir and freundlich langmuir model appears to fit experimental data better than freundlich also the capacities calculated with the use of the langmuir model are very close to experimental values the sorption process was temperature dependent sorption yield was higher in higher temperatures therefore the process is endothermic the capacities of final products were about 25 higher than the capacities of intermediate polyampholytes and about 440 higher than the capacity of raw cmc higher capacities could be explained by the greater surface of the nanocomposite and the larger number of groups capable of binding co ii ions the capacities of synthesized materials were moderate compared to commercial and other experimental resins a simple method for obtaining high removal efficiency and low cost material is presented by he and co workers their paper reveals that the addition of kaolin can boost the sorption properties of carboxymethyl chitosan cmcs he et al 2019 the authors conducted adsorption experiments to test the properties of polyampholyte hydrogels obtained with different cmcs kaolin ratios series of batch tests were performed to test ph cmcs kaolin ratio adsorbent dose dependency of cu ii adsorption towards cmcs kaolinite material the kinetics selectivity and recyclability were also tested by the authors the preparation of the material was obtained through a schiff base reaction vaghani et al 2012 the cmcs was dissolved in water at 298 k and mixed with different amounts of kaolin then glutaraldehyde was added into the mixture as a crosslinker at 333 k the effect of ph on the adsorption was tested by adding the adsorbent at 1g l 1 concentration to cu ii solutions at different ph values and by shaking the samples for 24h the dependency of the adsorption process on crosslinker content in the adsorbent was tested by adding obtained hydrogels with different crosslinker content to cu ii solution with an initial concentration of 200 mg l 1 the dependency of the adsorbent dose was investigated by a series of the test the different adsorbent amounts from 0 2 g l 1 to 1 8 g l 1 were added to a solution at a concentration of 200 mg l 1 the kinetics were tested in the experiment where the adsorbent was placed in the ph 4 stabilised cu ii solution with an initial concentration of 200 mg l 1 the investigation to determine adsorption isotherm was conducted using concentrations in the range of 50 to 1000 mg l 1 at 308 k the selectivity experiments were performed with the use of solutions containing zn ii and cu ii ions at 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 concentrations possible recovery of adsorbents was tested by firstly eluting used material with a 0 1 m hcl solution then with a 0 1 m naoh solution and washed by deionised water three regeneration cycles were performed the results show that the kaolin content in the hydrogel has an impact on the adsorption capacity of the material the 9 1 cmcs kaolin ratio being the most optimal rising qe by 17 in comparison to hydrogel containing no kaolin however rising the scope further lowers the adsorption capacity the authors suggest that increasing the content of kaolin could be cost effective as expected rising the dose of the crosslinking agent lowers the adsorption capacity since the agent itself contains no groups that take part in the adsorption process so the number of groups per unit of weight is decreased the effect of the dose of the adsorbent shows that increasing the amount increases the removal however the adsorption yield per g of adsorbent was lowered the adsorption kinetics experiment revealed that the adsorption process of cu ii towards cmcs kaolinite hydrogel could be fitted by the pseudo second order kinetic model the isotherm was determined with the langmuir model being the best fitted to the experimental data the calculated adsorption capacity of obtained cmcs kaolinite hydrogel was 244 mg g 1 while the experimental capacity was 204 mg g 1 the ph dependence experiment shows that the optimal ph for adsorption of cu ii on cmcs kaolinite sorbent is ph 4 the material sustains its capacity in a ph range from 4 to 6 without significant loss the selectivity test revealed that zn ii ions affect cu ii sorption on cmcs kaolinite sorbent the difference between cu ii only and zn ii cu ii sorption is lower than 1 in case of concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l 1 and in the case of 200 mg g 1 does not exceed 5 the regeneration test revealed that the material loses its adsorption capacity through regeneration cycles after four cycles the capacity was lowered to 76 of the original capacity compared to commercial adsorbents cmcs kaolinite adsorption capacity is significantly greater polyampholyte hydrogel obtained by he and co workers is an example of a well performing adsorbent produced at a low cost however it has to be noted that the material loses its adsorption capacity over the regeneration which could lead to higher cost in the end compared to other adsorbents the material is also biopolymer based so it can also be advantageous as it could reduce excess use of crude oil 3 discussion and outlooks basing upon collected data the molar sorption capacity of selected ions differs mainly depending on functional groups quantity in the case of commercial ampholytic resins maximum molar capacity for divalent ions varies withing 1 2 5 mmol me2 g 1 with certain deviations like in the case of purolite s930 and amberlite irc 718 which had a molar capacity greater than 4 mmol fe2 g 1 of resin noureddine et al 2008 popa et al 2011 in experimental materials maximum molar capacities generally varied within the same range as commercial resins with a few deviations exceeding that range as shown in table 3 those deviations except functional group quantity can be caused by many factors like ph ionic strength chelating agents present in the solution as well as by ionic radius the difference in ionic radius can also be the driving force of materials selectivity dinu et al 2009 the optimal ph for conducting successful metal ion adsorption depends on the type of ion removed metal cations are removed most efficiently in ph 4 8 opposed to anions that can be removed even in very low ph like chromium oxyanions removed in ph 2 chopabaeva et al 2010 in the case of metal cations the general tendency is that with the rise of ph the removal rate rises however this tendency is limited by the point where metal hydroxides precipitate the low cation adsorption capacities at lower ph are probably caused by the protonation of functional groups wang et al 2013 the temperature dependency of metal ion removal processes with polyampholytic materials was researched and described in several papers ciopec et al 2012 shabaan et al 2013 zhou et al 2016a this phenomenon is mostly accounted for water transport in the material temperature is a parameter considered for enhancing removal rates on ion exchangers independently of the rate controlling step as the elevated temperature can extend the quantity of interactions between the active group and removed ion zagorodni 2007 however the cost effectiveness of such practice has to be taken into account during process design collected data shows that most of the described processes are well explained by langmuir monolayer adsorption this can be deduced by analysing table 3 as most of the experimental isotherm data was well fitted by the langmuir isotherm model most of the kinetic experiments data were well fit by the pseudo second order model and that could mean that adsorption is in those cases limited by the reaction which confirms that the type of sorption in most cited cases is chemisorption polyampholytic materials can be regenerated the regeneration ability depends on the material some of the materials have rather excellent regeneration ability as in the case of ida modified d301 resin that retained its sorption capacity almost unchanged through 10 regeneration cycles as for recycling and disposal of the used materials the authors did not provide any information there are three main types of pa scavengers in terms of structure the pas that are synthesized by grafting betaine groups or other groups on a resin matrix such as poly dvb or polystyrene this is the basic and most popular approach implemented in most commercial pa scavengers another type of pas structural classification is crosslinked products of polycondensation where the active groups are present not only on the side of the polymeric chain but also are a part of the chain an example of this type could be cropro aa crocha aa and cropro maa crocha maa described by noh and co workers noh et al 2005 the third type are bio based matrix pas which are similar to the first type however instead of using synthetic polymer matrix a bio polymer matrix is used as in modified hemp fiber scavenger described by bai and co workers bai et al 2020 another category would include composites with inert core such as silica gel or magnetic nanoparticles grafted with crosslinked polymer functionalised with active groups this approach bases on the magnification of the surface area of the material an example of pa composite would be silica gel grafted with crosslinked polymers functionalised by ida groups monri et al 2014 most commercial pas are included in the first type group i e conventional dvb or ps resins are grafted with ida or aminomethylphosphonate groups however many recent studies are looking into the possibilities of third type pas that is functionalising biomass with highly efficient betaine groups chitosan lignin and other bio polymers are promising substitutes of poly divinylbenzene and polystyrene containing a large quantity of groups that can be modified further to attach betaine groups these bio matrix substitutes are cheap safe for the environment and biodegradable hence they are worth attention investigation of bio based pas should be encouraged as waste management of conventional resins is mainly landfill storage or disposal by incineration after the material was worn out as there are no other methods of disposing of modified poly dvb and ps to be commercialised pa ion scavenging material should be economically viable and possess new traits that distinguish it from already available materials such features include a safer production method of the material superior ion removal properties and new waste management methods after it s life cycle ends in terms of safer methods of production few approaches can be considered as current commercial products are crude oil derivative based the implementation of new biopolymer based matrixes could be a significant improvement by itself as biopolymers tend to be less harmful to the environment in case of improvement of removal efficiency of toxic metal ions not much can be done except for maximization of group quantity per unit of ion scavenger producing more potent scavengers could lower their usage and by this lower the negative impact of manufacture processes on the environment the approach focusing on environmentally conscious waste management of the product at the end of its life cycle should be considered as current commercial ion scavengers can only be disposed of through incineration or stored on landfills polyampholytes depending on the type of the material and method of production can be classified as environmentally friendly the subject is very complicated as some production methods can be considered safe for the environment or in some cases green however the material after it s life cycle ends can be not degradable as mentioned the matrix of the material is a very important variable in this discussion if the matrix is bio based for example hemp fibre in h3imdc imidazole 4 5 dicarboxylic acid modified hemp fibre it is possible to assume that at the end of its life cycle it will not be a problem to dispose of it in an environmentally friendly way on the other hand pas obtained by modification of dvb resins can be efficient and durable as proven by dinu and co workers however the dvb matrix is not considered sustainable environmentally friendly material which could pose a problem at the end of the life cycle dinu et al 2009 in rare cases as in chitosan co gelatine material described by wang and co workers in the material production method the material itself is safe for the environment wang et al 2013 in this case the metal ion scavenger is sourced from the waste material itself so it can be considered as a complex solution of two problems repurposing of biowastes like gelatine or chitosan to remove toxic substances from the water summing up there are polyampholyte types that can be environmentally friendly in both cases of manufacture and waste disposal and should be thoroughly investigated 4 conclusions the need to remove toxic metal ions from aqueous systems is one of the most essential tasks for sustaining our health and environment this review showed one group of ion scavengers capable of removing toxic metal ions from aqueous solutions polyampholytic materials there is a constant need to pursue better purification techniques as shown in table 3 there is still room for improvement as some experimental adsorbents have better sorption properties than commercial pas tables 1 and 2 polyampholytic metal ion scavengers can successfully remove metal ions from aqueous solutions most of the described materials can be regenerated commercial polyampholytes are mostly iminodiacetic or aminomethylphosphonic group bearing ion exchange or chelating resins a significant number of publications on experimental ion scavenging polyampholytes is describing poly carboxybetaines including iminodiacetic group functionalised resins even though commercial polyampholytes seem to have similar removal properties researchers are mostly focused on iminodiacetic adsorbents selected publications showed that some polyampholytic scavengers are capable of selective removal of toxic metal ions from aqueous solution as polyampholytes often bear chelating functional groups that allow selective separation of ionic species there are still unexplored types of potential adsorbents that were not investigated in depth as aminomethylsulfonic aminomethylphosphonic or hypophosphorous acid group containing materials in pursuit of good polyampholytic scavengers researchers should consider looking for solutions that focus besides the efficiency of the scavengers on the environmental effects that directly influence the exploitation cost of used technology the introduction of a material with good ion removal properties that could be in some way biodegradable but also durable in process conditions would be a very promising innovation increasing the efficiency of the scavenger by itself lowers the volume of waste that must be disposed of the approach that would base on biopolymer based scavengers would also be possibly cost effective as the production of those materials does not base on crude oil derivatives as substrates and opens the possibility of creating biodegradable scavenger that can be reduced to non problematic waste biopolymer based scavengers production methods can potentially be safer for the environment than crude oil based scavengers there is still room for improvement in the field of pa scavengers in terms of efficiency as minor changes in materials structure can cause a rapid shift in its sorption properties there are still unexplored functional groups that could possibly be worth investigating another important improvement that is basically a must to advance current scavenger based technologies in water treatment is finding a more environmentally safe matrix for functional groups reviewed papers showed that exploring and developing new adsorbents that are safer more efficient cheaper and more durable is possible and should be encouraged declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16682,pollution by heavy metal ions in aqueous systems gained researchers attention gradually toxic metal ions were always present in the environment and the living organisms could get used to specific concentrations of contaminants with given time however sudden concentration rise we are observing can make it impossible for the living organisms to adapt many ion removal technologies were developed and optimised over the years to cope with this problem including chemical precipitation adsorption membrane filtration and ion exchange adsorption and ion exchange are processes that employ certain materials that can be collectively named ion scavengers to remove ions from aqueous solutions some of the scavenger materials are still barely studied in particular polyampholytes polymeric zwitterionic materials this review showcases papers published on toxic metal ion removal by polyampholytes both commercial and experimental over last two decades many recent publications show promising properties of experimental materials that match or even outperform commercial scavengers this review was prepared to encourage other researchers to investigate this broad and still not well studied class of materials especially in context of their ion scavenging properties polyamphytes which may be especially worth the attention and further research have been highlighted as literature studies show that the most unexplored materials in the class of polyamphytes are those containing aminomethylphosphonate aminomethylsulfonate or hypophosphorous acid group graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords toxic metal ions adsorption ion scavengers ion exchange polyampholytes metal ion removal 1 introduction toxic ion removal from water systems is in high demand alike for industrial effluent treatment and water purification for drinking technological or production purposes the need for toxic metal ions removal in these cases may differ superficially however it is always crucial for protecting the environment which leads to the conservation of human health ireland 1991 vernet 1992 fӧrstner wittmann 1981 the requirement of regulating toxic substances content in water was proven boldly many times in history like in minamata japan in 1956 where water contamination by methylmercury caused many citizens to suffer from neurological disease there are countless records on lead poisoning cases worldwide through the xx century or even recent years needleman 1991 ayraulta et al 2012 eades et al 2002 hanna attisha et al 2016 to date many removal technologies were developed to stop such tragedies some of which became the best available techniques as reference methods for the new concepts best available techniques bat 2010 mosby and co workers distinguished 23 heavy metals harmful to human health mosby et al 1996 some of those metals e g lead mercury and arsenic can be detrimental to human health or the environment even though they do not bear any significant function in the physiological processes of organisms some of these metals have biological functions but exposure to higher doses can cause poisoning in humans e g iron zinc and chromium jaishankar et al 2014 in general toxic metal contamination mostly has its source in anthropogenic activities including mining metal processing and agriculture morais et al 2012 another significant source of metal ion contamination is the incineration of fossil fuels in the energy industry chen et al 2012 however according to morais and co workers some toxic metal contamination can also have natural sources like natural weathering of the earth crust or soil erosion morais et al 2012 fig 1 presents a summary of toxic metal ion sources in the environment many toxic ion removal technologies have already been developed and optimised to comply with safety regulations and effectively eliminate hazardous metal ions these methods include chemical precipitation adsorption membrane filtration precipitation flotation coagulation flotation ion exchange and electrochemical processes each method has specific advantages and downsides and found different use in water treatment technologies adsorption and ion exchange which can be considered as a particular variant of adsorption are methods that utilise materials that can be collectively named ion scavengers mcnaught wilkinson 1997a through years different ion scavengers were used or tested for toxic ions removal purposes activated carbon kluczka et al 2007 chelating agents wasay et al 1990 ion exchange resins jermakowicz bartkowiak et al 2005 kabay et al 2007 modified and unmodified biomass or biopolymers macchi et al 1986 melchor et al 1990 zhao et al 2020 modified silica mendonca 2008 iron hydroxides or oxides music 1986 polowczyk et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 xi et al 2020 fly ash ulatowska et al 2020 bituminous coal karthikeyan chaudhari 1986 nagesh krishnaiah 1989 clay yadava et al 1988 or zinc powder kimura et al 1989 the possibility of accumulative removal by plants or microorganisms was and still is researched ferrara et al 1985 hardy raber 1985 padervand gholami 2013 edokpayi et al 2015 zinicovscaia et al 2019 those materials and corresponding ion removal methods were characterised by different effectiveness therefore some of them were never used in extensive scale processes trends for water treatment and overall water technology as in any other industry sector are regulated by law and influenced by cost effectiveness hence there is a constant pursuit of environmentally safe and economically viable solutions the scavengers in the water processing industry are mostly used to collect precious metals or remove toxic trace ions ahmad 2005 cui zhang 2008 huang et al 2009 jermakowicz bartkowiak et al 2017 some of these materials are very effective in ion removal however due to their production costs they are costly an example could be special chelating resins used for special purposes in such sectors as pharmaceuticals and electronic industries due to their operational costs bunnik 1986 convention on the elaboration of a european pharmacopoeia 2000 the possible usage of scavengers especially ones that show the ability to regenerate and are recyclable or biodegradable at the end of their lifecycle could improve general wastewater treatment techniques and water production practices the ultimate goal for researchers in ion scavenger development studies would be finding a cheap efficient reusable and recyclable material that could be produced by green and cheap methods however this goal has still not been achieved most of the commercially available ion scavengers and those used in water treatment can be regenerated however in some cases the used material such as ion exchange resin is disposed of by incineration douglas 2008 in the case of selectivity of such scavengers some developed technologies show high selectivity towards specific ions these technologies use the molecular recognition technology mrt basing on the material structure that possesses specially arranged functional groups capable of complexation of specific ions mrt products are often designed to remove and recover precious metals or metalloids shinoda et al 2005 polido legaria et al 2017 callura et al 2018 an example of a group of substances used for toxic ion scavenging could be polyelectrolytes the primary mechanism of ion removal by polyelectrolytes is ion exchange or complexation gregor et al 1955 miyajima et al 1992 navarro et al 2005 okesola smith 2016 wang wang 2016 song et al 2019 however some of them can also remove contaminants by precipitation kudaibergenov et al 1983 a special group of polyelectrolytes is assembled of monomers consisting of functional groups of opposite charge or groups capable of ionising such charges kudaibergenov 2002 these materials are called polyampholytes pas and have interesting properties that regular polyelectrolytes do not possess such as the isoelectric effect of polyampholytes the phenomenon is caused by electrostatic attraction between groups of opposite charge being at a close distance to each other in the pa structure at the isoelectric point of the material kudaibergenov et al 1983 koetz et al 1991 kurmaeva et al 1991 koetz et al 1993 kudaibergenov 2002 it can lead previously swollen material to shrink causing the solvent to exit the porous material structure kudaibergenov et al 1983 kudaibergenov 2002 polyampholytes found use in multiple fields like in mining as drilling fluids in pharmacology as drug delivery systems as cryoprotective agents for cell storage and transportation or as biocompatible scaffolds in tissue engineering lin et al 2019 haag bernards 2020 stubbs 2020 however even though they have strong structural predispositions they are rarely used or researched as ion scavengers polyampholytes used in ion removal can be classified by their functional groups or by their solubility in water recovery of metal ions can be achieved using either water soluble or insoluble polyampholytes in different ways water soluble pas metal ions are complexed by functional groups of polymers and are removed from the solution as a precipitate water insoluble pas work mostly by regular ion exchange mechanism or complexation kudaibergenov et al 1983 kudaibergenov 2002 in the chemical abstracts database the first use of the term polyampholyte dates to publication by katchalsky in 1951 describing mechanical properties of co polymers of vinylpyridine and methacrylic acid katchalsky 1951 however the implementation of polyampholytes as ion scavengers got some attention in the seventies starting with work by gold and gregor in 1962 on poly n methyleneglycine complexes with copper ions gold gregor 1962 smirnov et al 1968 smirnov et al 1970 this work reviews publication from the last two decades in using polyampholytes as ion scavengers most of the papers taken into account focus mostly on ion scavenging properties of water insoluble polyampholytes with some exceptions some reviews concerning polyampholytes were published but they treat ion scavenging properties of these materials as marginal focusing mostly on their different implementations or physical properties bernards 2015 dimassi et al 2018 kudaibergenov et al 2018 kudaibergenov nuraje 2018 blackmann et al 2019 strubbs et al 2020 this paper covers recent works published between 2000 and 2020 in the further part of the paper details concerning sorption experiments are featured with corresponding short synthesis method summaries all the presented data were collected into one table containing data on materials described in this review 2 polyampholites as ions scavengers most of the commercially available ion exchangers have either anionic or cationic groups incorporated in their structure because of this only cations or anions can be exchanged by such materials polyampholytes have both group types present in their structure and they could be used as both anionites and cationites depending on ph didukh et al 2003 constantinou et al 2016 ionic strength and ph can also cause polyampholytic structures to swell with the solvent when the intramolecular ionic bonds are not existent on the contrary while the conditions allow the formation of ionic bonds inside of the polymeric structure it shrinks squeezing out the excess solvent swelling properties of polyampholytes are not the scope of this paper and they were discussed widely by kudaibergenov and other researchers didukh et al 2003 kudaibergenov 2008 vaghani et al 2012 constantinou et al 2016 nebhani et al 2016 the zwitterionic properties of polyampholytic resins can be explained on the example of imidazole carboxylate resins which can remove different ions of chromium chopabaeva et al 2010 under acidic conditions with an excess of hydrogen ions the nitrogen atom incorporated into resin is protonated due to this phenomenon the nitrogen can take part in complexing anions like oxyanion of chromium vi cr2o7 2 on the other hand this resin can easily exchange protons from the hydroxyl group for cr3 cations in basic conditions due to these phenomena the same ion exchanger type can remove different chromium species like cr3 or cro4 2 lehto et al 1997 polyampholytes could be classified by two criteria water solubility or functional groups incorporated into the polymeric matrix the first classification could base upon the fact that water soluble and water insoluble polyampholytes function differently in the presence of water soluble pas metal ions are complexed by functional groups of polymers and are removed from the solution as a precipitate in the case of water insoluble polyampholytes the ions are removed mostly by means of regular ion exchange zagorodni 2007 the second classification based on the functional groups present in the polymeric structure of these materials distinguish polyampholytes containing carboxylate and 2 methylimidazole groups aminophosphonic dimethylphosphinic iminodiacetic or other functional groups zagorodni 2007 polyampholytes can be based on polystyrene matrix as in commercially available purolite s940 and chelex 100 resins and biopolymers like lignin or chitosan kono 2014 chopabaeva et al 2010 chen et al 2016 some examples of polyampholytic structures were presented in fig 2 the ion exchange mechanism of cation scavenging by polyampholytes can be seen in fig 3 a if resin containing aminomethylphosphonic groups is introduced to an alkaline environment where metal cations are present the hydroxyl groups will exchange their protons for cation available in the solution zagorodni 2007 this kind of exchange can be efficiently conducted only under basic conditions with a low amount of concurring hydrogen cations present ali et al 2017 if metal cations were to compete with hydrogen cations in the acidic environment the exchange would be possible however the equilibrium would favour hydrogen cations over metal cations fig 3b the other rather unique mechanism of ion scavenging by polyampholytes is removing metal ions by precipitation of their corresponding hydroxides in the resins isoelectric point this phenomenon was firstly described by kudaibergenov and co workers kudaibergenov 2002 kudaibergenov et al 1983a b in fig 4 the proposed mechanism of this phenomenon is presented while the polyampholytic structure is in normal conditions either basic or acidic it can scavenge metal ions into the structure on an equilibrium basis however when the conditions come close enough to the materials isoelectric point the structure starts to shrink and this causes antagonistic functional groups to come close enough to bind together and force out previously attached metal ions from the structure which then are precipitated as hydroxides 2 1 commercial polyampholytes there is a wide range of commercial ion exchangers currently available on the market which can be used for the removal of toxic metal ions especially divalent metal cations but only a few of those materials are polyampholytes commercial polyampholyte ion exchangers are mostly those containing iminodiacetic groups or aminomethylphosphonic groups in the case of commercial iminodiacetic group bearing resins some papers were published about the performance of chelex 100 describe its affinity towards a wide range of toxic metal ions including rare earth metals esma et al 2014 hérès et al 2018 other commercial resins that employ iminodiacetic groups include amberlite irc718 and irc748 diaion cr 11 lewatit tp 207 and tp 208 purolite s930 table 1 shows experimental sorption capacities and information on isotherm and kinetic models if available as for aminomethylphosphonate group bearing ion exchangers their chelating properties were described in the literature hérès et al 2018 gholivand 2016 on the market there are already commercialised aminomethylphosphonic resins under the names amberlite irc 747 lewatit tp260 purolite 930 purolite 940 purolite 950 and unitika ur3300s these commercial resins were characterised in the literature in many publications presenting their performance in toxic metal ion removal experiments the capacities and information on isotherm and kinetic models were provided in table 2 commercial polyampholytes are only distinguishable from standard ion exchange resins by their two type charge groups present in the same structure the matrix for those materials is most commonly poly divinylbenzene or polystyrene according to collected data in tables 1 and 2 the predominant isotherm model for both iminodiacetic and aminomethylphosphonic resins is the langmuir model the first exception was the sorption of la iii on lewatit tp 260 described by esma et al and the difference in langmuir and freundlich coefficients of determination r squared was insignificantly low esma et al 2014 the second exception was the sorption of co ii and ni ii on purolite s950 and purolite s930 where depending on acid concentration the adsorption isotherm was fit by models differently at low acid concentrations the data was best matched by the langmuir model at higher concentrations the data was better to fit by the freundlich model deepatana et al 2006 deepatana and valix 2008 as shown in tables 1 and 2 the predominant kinetic model in iminodiacetic resins is the pseudo second order model except for cd ii and zn ii sorption on chelex 100 and lewatit 207 described by alvarez et al where the researchers added complexation agents like nta and cdta the kinetic model was pseudo first order alvarez et al 2004 the predominant kinetic model for aminomethylphosphonic commercial ion scavengers is the pseudo second order model with the exception of mn2 ions removal on lewatit tp 260 which was best fit by the pseudo first order model as it was described by coşkun and co workers coşkun et al 2016 and rare earth elements rre removed on lewatit tp 260 described by hérès and co workers hérès et al 2018 commercial polyampholytic ion scavengers that bear iminodiacetic or aminomethylphosphonic groups in their structure are equally efficient in terms of theoretical capacity in comparison to regular ion exchangers and excel them in terms of selectivity hence they are used in precious metals recovery 2 2 experimental polyampholytes 2 2 1 poly carboxybetaines polyampholytes containing betaine groups are a broad branch of the classification in those polymer s carboxylate group is present in the structure with another group containing a positively charged heteroatom those two groups cannot be directly adjacent mcnaught wilkinson 1997b luca et al 1997 according to the ca database the most popular poly betaines type in terms of ionic exchange are poly carboxybetaines betaine compounds are known for their metal complexing abilities a few recent works were published showing carboxybetaine ligands exceptional ability to assemble into metal organic frameworks he et al 2012 qin et al 2019 liu et al 2019 good examples of poly carboxybetaine used in toxic ion removal can be two step synthesised ethyl 3 alkylaminocrotonate derivatives presented in the paper by noh and co workers noh et al 2005 the monomer was obtained by reacting propylamine or cyclohexylamine with acetoacetic ethyl ester the monomers underwent michael addition followed by radical polymerisation of obtained monomers and acrylic aa or methacrylic maa acid in a molar ratio of 1 1 under nitrogen atmosphere crosslinked polymeric derivatives were also prepared for swelling tests with three different crosslinking agents n n methylenebisacrylamide mbaa poly ethyleneglycol dimetha acrylate pegdma and poly ethyleneglycol diacrylate pegda the monomers obtained were ethyl 3 propylaminocrotonate cropro and ethyl 3 cyclohexylaminocrotonate crocha the polymerisation products were four types of co polymers cropro aa crocha aa and cropro maa crocha maa however the authors focused mostly on the swelling behaviour of obtained materials in the dependence of ph crosslinking agent presence and swelling solution composition the authors also describe sorption and desorption experiments performed with obtained materials towards cu ii ions the adsorption desorption experiments were performed on water swollen materials using a 50 mm cu ii ion solution it was reported these materials are characterised by good regeneration ability up to 10 sorption desorption cycles durability and excellent adsorption capacity towards cu ii of 500 mg g 1 as described by copello et al in their work carboxylate and 2 methyl imidazole group containing polyampholytes are reported as efficient sorbents of pb ii and cd ii ions from water solutions copello et al 2012 one step synthesised material was obtained by mixing methacrylic acid maa 2 methylimidazole 2mi ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether egde and acetonitrile the polymerisation reaction was conducted in the presence of benzoyl peroxide in another publication authors have shown that synthesis of similar materials can be performed even in the absence of peroxide with lesser yield denis et al 2008 batch adsorption experiments were conducted at room temperature to examine pb ii and cd ii ion behaviour at different concentration in the presence of egde maa 2mi polyampholyte the experiments were carried out at ph range from ph 4 to 8 using water of varying purity the authors determined kinetics selectivity recovery and adsorption kinetics of obtained polyampholyte by monitoring the decrease metal ion concentration in solutions the results show that ph has a significant effect on adsorption yield it also differs for pb ii and cd ii as lead ions are removed at 97 in ph 7 cadmium ions can be eliminated to the same extent at ph 6 adsorption performance was proven dependent on the sorbate and solution composition as the presence of cd ii ions amplified adsorption of pb ii ions however the presence of pb ii ions decreased the adsorption of cd ii ions the authors suggest that pb ii and cd ii ion adsorption kinetics on egde maa 2mi polyampholyte is driven by a chemical reaction rather than diffusion due to the relatively short time needed to achieve equilibrium conditions the most probable complexation mechanism suggested by the authors was depicted in fig 5 according to the authors best fit kinetic models were those that took fluctuations of the energy of chemisorption into account those fluctuations are caused by interactions between the species present in the solutions designated isotherms were fitted best by the langmuir model with an adsorption capacity of 182 mg cd ii g 1 and 202 mg pb ii g 1 basing on ftir results langmuir model and mean adsorption energy derived from the dubinin radushkevich equation the predominant reaction type is ion exchange the material obtained by the authors is characterised by good adsorption capacity fast kinetics and chemical stability copello et al 2012 lázaro martínez and co workers report a toxic ion removal method on modified ethylene glycol diglycidyl esther egde polymers lázaro martínez et al 2008 lázaro martínez et al 2012 triazole trz and pyrazole pyr functionalised poly egde maas were obtained in a simple radical polymerisation reaction methacrylic acid purified by vacuum distillation egde and either 1h 1 2 4 triazole imidazole 2 methylimidazole or pyrazole was mixed with acetonitrile the polymerisation reaction was conducted by the addition of benzoyl peroxide sorption experiment was performed the same amount of investigated material was put to the vessels and the same volume of cu ii ion solution with different concentration from range 4 100 mm samples were centrifuged and the residual cu ii ion concentration was determined the experimental data were the best fit by the langmuir model the maximum capacities of obtained materials were in the range of 38 71 mg g 1 best cu ii adsorption capacity was achieved by poly egde 2mi polyampholytic materials presented by authors are characterised by medium sorption capacity towards cu ii ions in comparison to other ionic exchangers water insoluble polyampholytes obtained from polymerisation of ethylene glycol diglycidyl esther edge imidazoles im and methacrylic acid were previously tested as metal ion adsorbents copello et al 2012 lombardo lupano et al presents a way of obtaining water soluble polymeric structures by slightly modifying the synthesis method lombardo lupano et al 2016 the material was obtained by reacting imidazole with egde in acetonitrile the intermediate product is then copolymerised with methacrylic acid by radical polymerisation using benzoyl peroxide authors report that this method leads to obtaining oligomers capable of complexing metal ions by assembling themselves into hollow spheres in certain conditions the authors did not conduct per se removal experiments however they tested obtained materials behaviour in the presence of different metal ions in the presence of egde im oligomers metal ions were removed via precipitation the study reports that in the presence of fe ii and citric acid the material formed hollow spheres lombardo lupano et al also applied egde im to decolourise solutions containing anionic azo dyes db273 they observed a 73 decrease in db273 concentration after only 3 3 minutes of reaction and after 55 minutes about 93 of the dye is removed the authors thus indicated that egde and im based pas could be applied to industrial wastewater treatment in their work mouton et al present results of sorption experiments of water soluble pa that shows excellent selectivity towards cu ii ions in ni ii and co ii containing aqueous solutions mouton et al 2016 the material was obtained from monomer synthesised from glycine water solution and acetoacetic ethyl ester the monomer ethyl 3 glycinatocrotonate egc underwent michael addition with acrylic acid aa followed by radical polymerisation with the use of 2 2 azobisisobutyronitrile aibn as initiator the molar ratio of substrates for polymerisation was 1 1 egc aa didukh et al 2004 noh et al 2005 the sorption experiments were conducted using the batch 10 ml method at 298 k the sorbent concentration was 0 5 g l 1 cu ii ion concentrations in tested solutions ranged from 0 05 5 mmol l 1 at ph range from 3 to 6 and at ionic strength 0 3 m with use of na2so4 the authors determined adsorption isotherms at different ph the selectivity tests towards cu ii ni ii and cu ii were performed the regenerative ability of the pa was tested through 5 cycles with the use of 5 mm cu ii solution at ph 4 5 desorption was carried out by decreasing ph to 2 the results of the experiments were best fitted by the langmuir model the mean energy of adsorption revealed that the predominant reaction type was chemisorption the selectivity tests show that the presence of ni ii and co ii does not influence cu ii adsorption on obtained pcegc sorbent even in repeated sorption desorption cycles the maximum cu ii adsorption capacity of the pcegc material was 264 mg g 1 mouton et al revealed promising properties of water soluble pa which can be synthesised from economically attainable substrates the most remarkable quality of the described material is its selectivity towards cu ii ions excellent sorption properties of betaine groups were presented in a paper by bai et al sorbent described in this work was based on fibre as an environment friendly alternative matrix to the synthetic resin matrix the natural fibre was functionalised with betaine formation to remove uranyl ions from artificial seawater bai et al 2020 the authors obtained their sorbent by grafting imidazole 4 5 dicarboxylic acid h3imdc on hemp fibres by transforming the carboxyl group of h3imdc into acyl chloride group allowing it to form a bond with the hydroxyl group present on the cellulose fibre surface the researchers tested different molar ratios of hemp fibre to h3imdc in the range from 0 25 to 1 25 during adsorption experiments the effects of ph contact time temperature and load were tested the experiments were conducted using 20 mg of modified hemp fibres and 50 ml of uranyl nitrate solution at different concentrations isotherms were designated in 3 different temperatures 298k 308k and 318 k the adsorption kinetics were investigated at 298k it was reported that as ph rises in the range of 3 0 7 0 the amount of adsorbed uranyl ions increases from 49 mg g 1 to 222 mg g 1 this is explained by the authors as the effect of u vi species ability to freely transform into another at different ph the amount of uo2 2 which is most often occurring u vi species at lower ph is lowered in favour of different species with one positive charge as the ph rises krestou panias 2004 the uo2 2 ion transforms into uo2oh uo2 3 oh 5 and uo2 4 oh 7 so the material can uptake more uranium with the use of less active groups simultaneously the number of active groups also rises as the carboxyl groups are deprotonated when the ph reaches 7 the imidazole nitrogen and carboxyl group are also complexing the u vi species however after ph increases further the adsorbent charge is repulsing u vi species therefore ph 7 seems to be the optimal ph for u vi species removal by betaine group containing sorbents the authors presented the adsorption kinetics of hemp fibre modified with h3imdc at ph 7 298k with 20 mg of the modified fibre and 50 ml uranyl nitrate solution 100 mg l 1 the kinetic model best fit to the experimental data seems to be the pseudo second order model which suggests that the process is chemical adsorption the designated isotherms show that the rising temperature of the process increases the u vi uptake with the rise of the temperature the capacity of the material increases the greater initial concentration more u vi is adsorbed however the removal rate decreases slightly at 100 mg l 1 the removal rate of u vi species was over 90 the experimental isotherm data is fitted well by the langmuir model the theoretical calculated capacity is close to the experimental capacity this suggests that u vi adsorption to the modified hemp fibres is monolayer adsorption the authors also presented the regeneration and cycle performance of h3imdc modified hemp fibre the cycle performance was tested with five different eluents nacl naoh hcl nahco3 and hno3 the number of adsorption desorption cycles was 5 the most efficient eluent for desorption was found to be hno3 the adsorption efficiency after five cycles dropped by 12 additionally the authors report that the mass of used adsorbent lowered by 9 after 5 elutions the selectivity tests of the modified hemp fibre were performed in the presence of na k mg2 ca2 ba2 sr2 ni2 and co2 ions the solution was prepared to resemble seawater by its composition the results show that the material has exceptional selectivity towards u vi species with a little affinity towards ca2 and co2 ions another experiment conducted with the use of real seawater was conducted to test the possibility of implementing designed material in uranium removal from seawater according to the authors even at a very low concentration about 3 1 µg g 1 the u vi species are removed at a rate of over 77 from non artificial seawater the simplicity of the production method regenerative ability capacity and selectivity of the material show it can be implemented to extract residual uranium from seawater as primarily assumed the xps analysis confirmed that the adsorption takes place at a site with the nitrogen containing group as well as on carboxyl groups the raw hemp fibre was also tested in this publication to compare its performance with h3imdc modified fibre the raw material has the ability to adsorb some of the u vi ions due to carboxyl groups on its surface however the ability is greatly improved after the modification of the structure with betaine groups as materials surface area and type of groups substituted on it can intensify the ion exchange efficiency wang 2016b chen et al 2018 in the case of modified hemp fibre described by bai and co workers the capacity towards u vi rises from around 120 mg g 1 to around 221 mg g at 298 k 2 2 2 iminodiacetic polyampoholytes as presented in poly carboxybetaine chapter polymers with n donor and carboxylate groups are very useful in complexing metal ions and are used as ligands hou et al 2012 iminodiacetic ida group is one of the polycarboxylic groups widely used in chelating resins over the last two decades sorbents functionalised with the iminodiacetic group used for binding metal ions were investigated thoroughly many papers presenting research on new ida modified scavengers were published the introduction of iminodiacetic resins to the market did not quench the researcher s interest in synthesising new iminodiacetic functionalised chelating materials work published in 2001 by wang et al presents a method for synthesising new chelating polymer for cr iii cu ii cd ii pb ii ion removal wang et al 2002 the researchers aimed to obtain cost effective material for toxic ion removal from wastewater the material was obtained by reacting iminodiacetic acid sodium salt with glycidyl methacrylate gma then the monomer was polymerised by crosslinking it with methylenebisacrylamide mba in the presence of potassium persulfate as initiator the material was then shaped into polymeric beads 100 250 µm diameter the authors performed an adsorption experiment where they removed metal ions from prepared artificial wastewater the same amount of the material 0 1 g was immersed in 50 ml of cr iii cu ii cd ii pb ii nitrate salts during the experiment ph temperature alkaline metal ion content and nitrilotriacetic acid nta concentration impact was tested on sorption efficiency obtained data suggests that obtained material was efficient in cr iii removal in the whole tested ph range 2 6 the removal amount was varying from 2 47 to 2 71 mol g 1 with a maximum at ph 3 4 the cd ii and cu ii ions were removed at similar rates 1 25 1 87 and 1 61 1 87 mmol g 1 with maximums at ph 5 and 2 in the ph range of 2 6 the most significant difference in sorption efficiency could be seen in pb ii sorption where the removal was in the range of 0 99 to 1 98 with a maximum at ph 6 the content of ca ii and mg ii in the solutions did not have any significant effect on toxic metal ions uptake the presence of nta did not change the removal rates significantly the results were best fit to the langmuir model according to the authors the material obtained by wang et al removed toxic metal ions from artificial wastewater and did not show significant affinity towards alkaline metal ions the capacity of the polyampholyte was similar to the capabilities of commercial resins the removal efficiency and was not affected by the use of nta additionally the authors show results that suggest a possible use of chelating polymer with metal ions adsorbed on its surface in phenols removal from water solutions novel resin with iminodiacetic group ability to separate yb iii from y iii la iii and sm iii containing solution was presented in a paper by xiong and co workers xiong et al 2006 the authors performed sorption experiments at different ph and temperature from the ph experiment the results show that the yb iii sorption maximum of the material is at ph 5 1 the temperature experiment was carried out at 288 k 298 k 308 k and 314 k in ph 5 1 with the rise of temperature the sorption rate increases significantly according to the calculated correlation coefficient the isotherm experiment data was best fit by the freundlich model regeneration tests were also performed with five sorption desorption cycles the authors report that the sorption ability does not decrease significantly at most by 0 2 due to separation coefficients being high enough the yb iii separation from other rare earth metals is possible on tested iminodiacetic resin the resin has a sorption capacity of 187 mg g 1 towards yb iii the researched resin had shown good selectivity towards yb iii in another publication by xiong et al from 2008 the authors published results of adsorption experiment of iminodiacetic functionalised resin towards in iii ions in the presence of zn ii ions xiong yao 2008 the paper presents an experiment where the separation ability of the resin was tested at different ph the given data shows that the maximum of in iii sorption is at ph 4 5 further experiments show the dependence of the sorption process on temperature the authors designated kinetics of the process and fitted the isotherm experiment data with the freundlich model with the best result as in the previous paper xiong et al described iminodiacetic functionalised resin that performed well in the separation of ions xiong et al 2006 the experiment shows that it is possible to separate those two ion types with tested resin the sorption capacity of the material reached 235 mg g 1 at 298 k the resin retains its adsorption properties even after 3 cycles of sorption desorption divinylbenzene dvb modified with iminodiacetic groups was used by dinu and the co workers to investigate its affinity towards zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions dinu et al 2009 the polymer sorbent was prepared from technical grade dvb 65 o divinylbenzene m divinylbenzene p divinylbenzene 36 ethylstyrene dvb was copolymerised with acrylonitrile in the presence of benzoyl peroxide as an initiator the obtained copolymer underwent aminolysis hydrolysis reaction to transform nitrile groups into primary amine groups the iminodiacetic groups were attached to primary amine groups by their carboxymethylation two variants of the sorbent cr 10 and cr 15 were obtained containing 10 and 15 of dvb respectively the authors described two sets of sorption experiments the first set was batch sorption experiments firstly with the use of 0 3 g obtained sorbent swollen with water and 25 ml corresponding metal ion solution with a concentration of 0 5 mmol l 1 the experiments were carried out in ph 5 5 at 293k for isotherm designation the concentration stayed at 0 5 mmol l 1 the amount of sorbent varied in the range 0 05 0 4 g the authors tested the selectivity of the polymeric material by immersing the sample in a mixed solution of three studied metal ions the second set of experiment was the column sorption experiment the feed was the solution of zn ii pb ii and cd ii at a concentration of 0 16 mmol l 1 the feed ph was 5 5 the temperature of operation was not specified the column was packed with 4ml of swollen resin and then the working solution was let through the column at 1 33 ml min 1 velocity the desorption experiment was performed with 0 1 m hcl with 0 42 ml min 1 velocity during batch sorption experiments the affinity of the resin towards separate ions was tested from the calculated distribution coefficient in the non competitive environment it was clear that cd ii was more easily adsorbed than pb ii which was more easily adsorbed than zn ii the more crosslinked type of resin adsorbed metal ions more easily the data obtained from the isotherm designation experiment was well fitted by both freundlich and langmuir models the selectivity studies in batch mode suggested that material obtained by the authors could be useful in the selective removal of certain cations the selectivity order was pb ii zn ii cd ii according to the authors of the publication the results obtained can be correlated with the radius of the hydrated cation it is the smallest for pb ii and affects its faster removal compared to zn ii and cd ii the continuous flow experiment was performed to test resins capacity and selectivity in dynamic mode in the constant flow mode experiment selectivity was confirmed and similarly as in the batch selectivity experiment higher affinity of pb ii ions towards resin was observed the breakthrough points were localised at 40 and 75 bed volumes for zn ii and cd ii respectively the desorption experiment has shown that the maximal concentration of recovered pb ii ions occurred at 10 bed volumes the total desorption occurs after about 17 bed volumes according to the authors report the obtained resins have shown better removal efficiency of metal ions than commercial ida resins like amberlite 718 and lewatit tp 207 under competitive conditions according to the results the crosslinked dvb an ida copolymer showed good selectivity towards pb ii in the presence of zn ii and cd ii the adsorption capacities of cr 10 were 0 81 and 0 69 mmol g 1 for cd ii and pb ii respectively when for cr 15 they totalled at 0 99 and 0 51 mmol g 1 in comparison to other ida group bearing materials dvb an ida materials did perform moderately performance of ida modified amberlite xad 2 resin was presented by panahi and co workers the authors showed a detailed scope on different ion interference on pb ii ion sorption panahi et al 2011 the authors modified commercial dvb amberlite resin by firstly nitrating phenyl groups then reducing nitrate groups to amine groups which underwent aza coupling to be reacted with salicylic acid the product was then ethylated to allow chlorination of the carboxyl group the chlorinated intermediate was then reacted with iminodiacetic acid step by step method can be seen in fig 6 below the authors described several sorption experiments the obtained material was used for batch sorption experiments the resin sample was immersed in 100 ml of 0 5 µg ml 1 at optimal ph 5 the used material was then desorbed using 10 ml 0 5 m nitric acid isotherm studies were performed at 293k 303k and 313k with the fixed amount of sorbent 50 mg and 50 ml of solutions with a concentration of pb ii in the range from 10 to 100 µg ml 1 the ph was adjusted with 0 01m acetate buffer the selectivity experiment was conducted by introducing foreign metal ion to the system separately and in a mixture of all the tested ions the selectivity of the resin was tested in the presence of cr ii ni ii co ii fe ii hg ii cd ii zn ii ba ii ag i cu ii k i al iii the results presented by the authors show that the pb ii removal rate at ph 5 is 95 the maximal sorption capacity of the material under optimal conditions ph 5 293k was found to be 67 mg g 1 the reusability of the resin was tested in 20 sorption desorption cycles and the performance efficiency loss was less than 10 after the 20th cycle according to the authors the resin was stable chemically after 6 months in the ambient environment they reported no significant change in resin performance the data from the isotherm experiment is best fit by the langmuir model the authors also tried to fit the data with freundlich temkin and redlich peterson isotherm models the selectivity tests did not show any significant impact of separate foreign ions the difference in pb ii removal was always less than 3 however when all of the ions were introduced at once the removal rate of pb ii dropped by 8 6 the resin described in the paper by panahi et al performed relatively poorly compared with other chelating resins the production method seems to be complicated time and resource consuming however according to the authors the intended application of the material was as an indicator of trace pb ii in water and it was also tested as pb ii indicator in human plasma the affinity of pb ii cd ii mn ii and zn ii ions was tested towards the new chelating resin obtained by shaaban and co workers shaaban et al 2013 the resin was obtained through a series of reactions firstly the synthesis of poly acrylamide co n n methylenebisacrylamide was performed the copolymer was then crosslinked via transamidation and reacted with sodium monochloroacetate the authors conducted the batch experiment to designate isotherm perform kinetic studies test ph and temperature impact on the process the ph experiment was performed with the use of 0 1 g of the resin in 100 ml 5 mm metal ion solution the isotherm experiment was conducted at 298 k with the use of 0 1 g of the resin in 100 ml of metal ion solution of concentration from a range of 1 25 mm in optimal ph the temperature dependence of the process was studied in the range from 298 318 k the kinetic studies were performed in the same conditions and with metal ion concentration at an optimal value the continuous flow adsorption experiment was performed in a column of 1 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height the column was packed with 1 g of resin the initial concentrations of metal ions in working solutions were the optimal values from previous experiment 7 5 5 8 and 6 4 mm of pb ii zn ii mn ii and cd ii respectively the feed flow velocity was set at 1 ml min 1 the continuous flow adsorption experiment was performed at 298 k the resin regeneration experiment was also performed with the use of 0 2 m hno3 the sorption desorption of resin was repeated five times sorption capacity for corresponding ions were 1 7 1 5 1 6 and 1 77 for pb ii zn ii mn ii and cd ii respectively the optimal ph values were 5 6 6 2 6 and 6 the kinetic model fit best to obtained data was the second order kinetic model the isotherm experiment data was the best fit by langmuir isotherm the data were also fitted by freundlich and temkin models with slightly lower accuracy calculated capacities according to the langmuir isotherm model matched experimental capabilities well except for cd ii where the difference was 0 2 mm g 1 the continuous flow adsorption experiment data showed that the solutions start to break through at 70 90 110 and 80 ml for pb ii zn ii mn ii and cd ii respectively the sorbent regeneration experiment demonstrated that after five cycles the resin lost from 9 19 of its original capacity depending on the ions and the best reusability was proven for cadmium in comparison to data presented in other papers published prior to shaaban et al proving their crosslinked polymer was bearing ida groups outperformed other chelating resins of the same type liu et al 2011 li et al 2011 in fact the capacities of materials presented by shaaban et al was comparable to commercial resins the copolymerised n n dimethylacrylamide dmaa and allyl glycidyl ether with iminodiacetic acid was tested to remove cadmium from artificial solutions seawater and freshwater the polymer was obtained through copolymerisation od dmaa with allyl glycidyl ether age bearing ida groups in the presence of the initiator under inert atmosphere panahi et al 2013 the sorption and desorption experiments were conducted in the ph range of 3 6 the 0 1 g sample of the resin was immersed in 100 ml 0 5 g ml 1 solution of cd ii ions the authors also performed an isotherm experiment with the use of 0 1 g of the resin and 100 ml of cd ii solutions at concentrations from range 10 100 µg l 1 the interference of foreign ions was investigated such as pb ii ca ii mg ii zn ii cu ii fe ii na i k i at a concentration of 10 µg l 1 while the concentration of cd ii was 10 mg l 1 the resin performance was also tested in environmental samples such as the caspian sea kosar aqueduct the water samples were spiked with cd ii at a concentration from 0 2 0 6 mg l 1 and then concentrated ten times for experimental purposes the results showed that the optimal ph for cd ii sorption on the resin was ph 4 2 the isotherm experiment data was the best fit by the langmuir model the authors reported only calculated capacity estimated at 69 4 mg g 1 the foreign ion interference experiment showed that sodium and potassium ions do not affect cd ii sorption at all while pb ii ions decrease the cd ii sorption by 0 7 and ca ii mg ii zn ii cu ii fe ii decrease the sorption efficiency of cd ii from 3 7 9 6 with iron and magnesium ions is having the greatest impact the sorption experiment from environmental samples showed that the material can remove around 90 of cd ii from sweet water and about 85 from seawater the obtained resin did show affinity to cd ii ions trace metal ions do not affect the sorption process significantly the resin compared with other ida bearing sorbents did perform decently achieving 0 62 mmol g 1 capacity monri and co workers presented an approach similar to panahi and co workers the authors grafted similar crosslinked polymers with ida groups on inert material an adsorption experiment was conducted with the use of ida grafted silica gel and al iii affinity towards it was reported age ida co dmaa polymer was grafted on the silica gel the adsorption experiments data showed that al iii had an affinity towards the ida composite the capacity of the material was estimated at around 0 94 mmol g 1 monri et al 2014 bio sorbent based on rice bran with ida groups was used in adsorption experiments towards hg ii and cd ii zhou 2016b the sorbent was obtained through a series of reactions firstly the hydroxyl groups were reacted with epichlorohydrin then the intermediate underwent amidation reaction with ethylenediamine the primary amine group was then reacted with sodium chloroacetate obtaining ida modified rice bran the authors performed batch adsorption experiments with 0 1 g of the material in 100 ml of hg ii or cd ii ions with regulated ph temperature and ionic strength the regeneration experiment was also conducted six sorption desorption cycles were performed the authors also measured the surface area and quantity of carboxyl groups for both raw material and ida functionalised biomass the optimal ph for hg ii and cd ii was found to be 5 and 6 respectively at 298 k the temperature dependence experiment showed that for both ions the increase of temperature improves the sorption capacity of the material slightly the isotherm experiment data was the best fit by langmuir isotherm the maximal capacities for both ions were found to be at 0 82 and 0 95 mmol g 1 for hg ii and cd ii respectively the increase of ionic strength has a negative effect on both ion affinity towards ida modified biomass the sorption capacity of the material after 6 cycles of sorption desorption decreased by almost 19 the surface of the modified material was not improved widely however the number of carboxylic groups rose by 0 864 mmol g 1 the modified biomass performed decently in hg ii and cd ii removal in optimal conditions the capacities of described materials were estimated at 1 19 and 1 15 mmol g 1 of hg ii and cd ii ions respectively in another publication describing a similar solution by zhou and co workers where modified alkali lignin was used as a matrix for ida groups zhou et al 2016c cu ii cd ii and pb ii ions removal by synthesised crosslinked poly acrylonitrile material bearing iminodiacetic groups was reported by el bahy and el bahy el bahy el bahy 2016 the material was synthesized from acrylonitrile and n n methylenebisacrylamide via suspension polymerisation in the presence of initiator abin under an inert atmosphere the obtained polymer was hydrolysed simultaneously to amidation reaction with ethylenediamine the intermediate was then reacted with sodium monochloroacetate the obtained resin was then used in batch sorption experiments as well as continuous flow experiment the ph impact was investigated by immersing 0 1 g of the resin in 100 ml 5 mm metal ion solution with ph in a range from 1 to 5 6 at 298 k adsorption isotherm experiment was performed by immersing 0 1 g of resin in 100 ml of metal ion solution with a concentration in the range of 1 to 20 mm the process kinetics were investigated for this purpose 0 1 g of the sorbent was mixed with 100 ml of the solution at optimum ph and maximal initial concentration of metal ions the continuous flow adsorption experiment was performed in a glass column 1 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height the column was packed with 1 g of the ida bearing copolymer the feed solutions containing cu ii cd ii and pb ii with an initial concentration of 5 mm at optimal ph and 298 k were let through the column at 1 ml min 1 velocity the regeneration was tested by performing the sorption desorption cycle five times the optimal ph was found to be 5 4 for cu ii and 5 6 for cd ii and pb ii the maximum capacities of the sorbent were 2 43 1 93 and 1 45 mmol g 1 for cu ii cd ii and pb ii respectively at optimal ph and 298 k the isotherm experiment data was the best fit by the langmuir model the capacity calculated from the langmuir model was close to experimental values the kinetic model that fit the experimental data best was the pseudo second order model the results from the continuous flow experiment show that the breakthrough for the investigated ions happens at 180 150 and 110 ml for cu ii cd ii and pb ii respectively the regeneration experiment showed that after 5 cycles the resin lost around 10 capacity during cu ii and pb ii sorption but 15 capacity during cd ii sorption the material described by el bahy el bahy was placed in a group of most effective chelating sorbents towards cu ii cd ii and pb ii ions it is characterised by good regeneration properties and a large quantity of ida groups compared to most ida resins commercially available styrene divinylbenzene resin d301 was modified with iminodiacetic groups was described by an and co workers an et al 2017 the resin used for modification by the authors was a type of basic macroporous resin that previously shown potential as metal ion removing material zhang et al 2014 due to the moderate content of active binding groups d301 is as efficient as other commercially available ion exchangers therefore the authors proposed functionalisation method where ida groups are bound to resin by poly glycidyl methacrylate linker this modification increased active binding group quantity from 4 8 meq g 1 up to 8 96 meq g 1 as of cu ii for the first step of transformation 1 g of dry d301 resin was added to 94 8 g 100 ml 1 3 mol of dimethylformamide with 10 7 g 75 mmol 10 ml of glycidyl methacrylate gma the polymerisation reaction was initiated by the addition of 0 16 g 0 7 mmol ammonium persulfate aps under nitrogen atmosphere at 323 k for 18 h the product was extracted with acetone in the soxhlet apparatus to remove by products poly glycidyl methacrylate pgma modified d301 was then dried under vacuum in the second step 1 g of pgma modified resin with 5 g 37 6 mmol ida acid was added to 100 ml of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at ph 12 the mixture was stirred for 8 h at 353 k the product was then rinsed with water to neutral ph batch 1000 ml adsorption experiments were carried out with the use of 10 mg of modified resin and aqueous solutions of cd ii cu ii pb ii ions at different concentrations 0 0 0 5 mmol l 1 for isotherm designation kinetics capacity and efficiency of adsorption were designated in various conditions of ph in the range of 0 to 6 and temperature from 293 to 313 k column experiments to test the selectivity of obtained material were also described in this paper solution 3500 ml containing cd ii 10 mg l 1 and ca ii ion 10 mg l 1 was pumped through a column filled with 0 1 g of ida modified d301 resin regeneration experiments were performed up to 10 cycles with the use of 10 ml of 1 m nitric acid per 1 g of modified resin water purity dependence was tested with a solution containing k i na i ca ii and mg ii ions at different concentrations 0 5 10 mmol l 1 the results have shown that the adsorption efficiency of modified d301 resin increased with its rising dosage langmuir and sips models are well fitted to experimental data moreover the calculated m value from the sips equation indicates that this process is the langmuir monolayer adsorption process the adsorption capacity of the obtained material is dependent on ph rising proportionally in the range of ph 1 to 5 for each of investigated ions with maximum capabilities of 286 mg cu ii g 1 621 mg pb ii g 1 and 259 mg cd ii g 1 the temperature dependence test has shown that the adsorption of pb ii cd ii and cu ii ions on ida modified d301 resin is endothermic the batch experiments of k i na i ca ii and mg ii presence dependency of the adsorption shown no change in the adsorption capacity of the new material the column experiments have shown excellent selectivity of obtained material towards cd ii in the presence of ca ii conducted experiments suggest that the described polyampholyte is capable of efficient adsorption of cd ii pb ii and cu ii ions the obtained material is highly selective towards investigated ions in the presence of k i na i ca ii and mg ii ions in comparison to other experimental and commercial scavengers ida modified d301 resin performed very well in toxic ion removal the material did retain its good sorption properties through 10 regeneration cycles nanocomposites with ida groups for uranium sorption were synthesized and tested by galhoum galhoum 2019 the sorbents were based on magnetite nanoparticles to possibly expand the surface area the author performed several sorption experiments and compared his results with the values found in the literature the sorbent was obtained by coating magnetite nanoparticles mnps with ida functionalised pgma firstly the precursors were prepared mnps were prepared by simple precipitation of fe2 and fe3 ions by naoh at 313 k with a molar ratio of fe ii to fe iii around 1 2 polyglycidyl methacrylate bearing ida groups were synthesised by suspension polymerisation of gma with abin as initiator under an inert atmosphere the polymer was then reacted with ammonia to attach the primary amine group which underwent carboxylation reaction with monochloroacetic acid the mnps and ida pgma were then milled together in a planetary milling system leading to obtaining magnetic nanocomposite the sorption experiments conducted by the author consisted of investigation of the ph effect designating adsorption isotherms and kinetics and reusability of the material for the ph effect the sorbent dose was 0 5 g l 1 the ph range of the scope was 1 6 at the not specified temperature the adsorption isotherm experiment was conducted by immersing the sample in u vi ion solutions of concentration in the range 25 300 mg l 1 at ph 4 sorbent dosage for kinetics investigation was fixed at 0 5 g l 1 the number of sorption desorption experiments for the regeneration experiment was five the eluent used for u vi recovery was 0 25 m nahco3 solution the optimal ph for u vi sorption was around ph 5 the sorption capacity of ida pgma mnps was found to be 0 44 mmol g 1 towards u vi the adsorption isotherm experiment data was the best fit by the langmuir model the calculated value of capacity was lower than the experimental value the kinetic model that fit the kinetic experiment data was the pseudo second order model the reusability experiment showed that the sorption capacity does not decrease more than 12 after 5 cycles from the data cited by the author ida pgma mnps were rather in the middle of sorbents that were investigated for u vi recovery over the years where the best sorbent tetraethylenepentamine modified mnps had sorption capacity reaching 1 93 mmol g 1 2 2 3 aminomethylphosphonic polyampholytes in the case of new materials bearing the aminomethylphosphonic groups there were a few reports in the recent decade concerning their use as metal ion scavengers aminomethylphosphonate functionalised dvb material for copper removal was described by ciopec and co workers the authors present isotherm and kinetic studies to describe their material s properties ciopec et al 2012 the sorbent was synthesised by functionalising commercial dvb and one prepared by the authors the polymers underwent amidation to a different extent and were then grafted with aminomethykphosphonic acid the different degree of amidation was set to obtain sorbents with the various phosphorus content the adsorption performance of obtained materials was tested in a series of batch experiments the adsorption isotherms were designated with the cu ii concentration in the range 5 40 mg l 1 the temperature influence was tested with 10 mg l 1 cu ii solution the adsorption kinetics was investigated the isotherm data obtained in the experiments was the best fit by the langmuir model calculated capacities were significantly higher than experimental ones it was revealed that the higher aminomethylphosphonate group quantity improves the sorption properties of the material the best result was obtained for material with 1 39 mmol g 1 aminomethylphosphonate groups where capacity reached 0 8 mg g 1 the kinetic model that fit experimental data well was the pseudo second order model the aminomethylphosphonate group bearing dvb material did not perform well the molar capacity of the material was lower than 0 02 mmol g 1 which is exceptionally low for a resin having 1 39 mmol g 1 aminophosphonic groups performance of aminomethylphosphonated polymer grafted on silica gel was reported by tsosie the batch and column performances of the obtained material towards u vi were descrived tsosie 2015 firstly amorphous silica was silanized with methyltrichlorosilane and chloropropyltrichlorosilane mixture then amidated composite was obtained by adding poly allylamine paa the intermediate underwent mannich reaction with formaldehyde and phosphorus acid leading to obtaining aminomethylphosphonate grafted composites sorption experiments were performed including ph influence test sorbent capacity estimation and column experiment the ph influence was investigated through immersing 0 2 g of composite in uranium solution with a concentration of 1 g l 1 with ph in the range from 2 8 the sorbent capacity was investigated through a batch sorption experiment where 0 2 g of sorbent was immersed in 20 ml of u vi solution 1g l 1 in ph 3 4 and ph 7 8 the column experiment was performed by packing a column with 5 ml 2 1 g of the material and then pumping feed solution through the bed at 1 ml min 1 velocity 0 1 column volume min 1 in ph 6 6 the desorption was also performed with the use of 2m na2co3 solution the capacity of the material towards u vi was 0 41 mmol g 1 for and additionally towards europium ions being 0 43 mmol g 1 the column experiment showed that the breakthrough started at around 80 ml of effluent in ph 7 and after 200 ml in ph 3 3 the u vi bound to the sorbent was stripped almost completely with 30 ml of na2co3 eluent the material did not perform well compared to other u vi sorbents another example of aminophosphonate adsorbent can be a silica based composite described by artiushenko and co workers in their publication on rare earth elements ree recovery the authors described the adsorption properties of the material towards 14 rre including la ce pr nd sm eu gd tb dy ho er tm yb and lu artiushenko et al 2020 the composite was obtained by subjecting silica gel with primary amine groups to mannich reaction with formaldehyde and phosphonic acid batch sorption experiments were conducted using a solution containing 100 µg l 1 each of investigated ree ions at ph 3 at ambient temperature the desorption experiment was conducted to estimate ree recovery by stripping the sorbent with different eluents including hcl hno3 and edta the adsorption of rees on aminophosphonated material was achieved at a ph range of 2 6 the adsorption experiments show that composite allows good recovery of the investigated elements up to 100 at low concentrations the best eluent for rees recovery from aminophosphonated silica gel was 2m hno3 and 0 01 edta ph 8 the material seems to perform well in trace ree recovery however the lack of information about adsorption properties like kinetics and isotherms does not allow to confirm whether the adsorbent is characterised by good sorption capacity or not 2 2 4 other types in previous chapters polyampholytes bearing specific groups were presented this chapter includes all other types of polyampholytes that did not fit into presented groups such as soluble carboxyethylated chitosans polyamine graphene oxide composite and more method for obtaining metal ion removing agents that were deviated from chitosan was presented by bratskaya et al polyampholytes obtained by the authors differed in substitution degrees of carboxyethylation reactions soluble polymers were tested as flocculants complexing agents of ni ii cu ii and zn ii ions bratskaya et al 2009 investigated polymers were obtained by the experimental procedure described by pestov and co workers for the potassium form of chitosan derivatives pestov et al 2007 chitosan was mixed with acrylic acid and water the mixture was set aside until the gel was formed the gel was heated at different temperatures to obtain the required substitution degrees the authors researched three n 2 carboxyethyl chitosan derivatives with 0 77 1 04 1 64 substitution degrees of carboxyethyl groups sorption experiments were performed to investigate the effect of ph and the impact of the substitution degree of the pa on ions removal efficiency for the experiments cecs solution was prepared by dissolving samples with deionised water at 288 k solution of mixed hydroxides was also prepared for the purpose of sorption experiments by addition of 0 1 m koh to a solution containing ni ii cu ii and zn ii at concentrations of 70 mg l 1 1 2 mmol l 1 84 mg l 1 1 3 mmol l 1 and 46 mg l 1 0 7 mmol l 1 respectively the experiments were performed with zeta potential measurements to establish whether the removal is caused by coagulation flocculation or chelation according to the electrokinetic properties of investigated pas optimal ph range for hydroxide flocculation is ph 7 5 9 the authors suggest that due to the deprotonation of amine groups and ionisation of carboxylic groups in this ph range negative charge of pa structures increases therefore a lower flocculant dose is required for efficient performance the cac derivatives as proposed by the authors basing on the correlation of electrokinetic properties of the colloids and the efficiency of metal ion removal seem to perform mainly as flocculants the efficiency is dependent on substitution degree as expected with an increasing number of carboxyethyl groups the efficiency rises the authors shown method of metal ion removal the cac polyampholytes worked better than standard flocculant the chitosan derivatives seem to be more selective towards zn ii and cu ii rather than ni ii described pas shown promising properties as flocculation precipitation promoters adsorptive properties of polyampholytes obtained by inoculative polymerisation of glycidyl methacrylate gma on the wood matrix and further modification by addition of poly ethyleneimine pei poly ethylenepolyamine pepa or 2 vinyl pyridine 2vp were reported by chopabaeva and co workers obtained materials were successfully tested towards cr2o7 2 affinity chopabaeva et al 2010 the synthesis method for the materials was not provided however the authors show data that suggests a dramatic change of sorption capacity compared to raw unmodified wood the maximum of sorption capacity is reached below ph 2 for pepa and pei sorbents from 110 60 mg g 1 and 150 100 mg g 1 in ph range from 2 2 to 5 to 270 300 mg g 1 and 250 270 mg g 1 in ph range from 2 to 1 respectively the maximum sorption capacities for pei pepa 2vp derivatives are 343 2 426 4 and 260 mg g of cr2o7 2 ions per gram of material the authors explain the change of sorption capacity for anionic exchange materials by protonation of amide groups due to the activity of carboxylic groups is suppressed in a strongly acidic environment therefore the material having those two group types close to each other in the structure becomes polycation and allows chromium ions binding if the material is placed in different ph ranges where such phenomenon does not occur amine and carboxylic groups bond together creating an intermolecular ionic bond making the chromium ion adsorption inefficient the authors compared their results with different commercially available highly basic ionic exchangers that reach 130 116 mg g 1 maximum capacity for chromium ions obtained materials could be very efficient in extreme ph conditions crosslinked gelatine and chitosan co polymers capable of cu ii adsorption were reported by wang and co workers the paper presents the effect of ph on the cu ii adsorption towards chitosan gelatine co polymer regenerative properties of the obtained material adsorption kinetics of the studied case and the isotherm is also presented by the authors wang et al 2013 the synthesis proceeded as follows chitosan powder cts and different amounts of gelatine ge are dissolved in acrylic acid water solution the reaction was carried out at 343 k under an inert atmosphere acrylic acid n n methylene bis acrylamide mba and ammonium persulfate aps was added the polymerisation reaction proceeded at 343 k in a nitrogen atmosphere batch adsorption experiments 25 ml to determine isotherms were conducted with the use of 50 mg of adsorbent in solution with cu ii concentrations in the range of 190 1588 mg l 1 at 303 k in ph 5 75 to study adsorption kinetics of the process series of the same samples were prepared 50 mg of the adsorbent was introduced to 25 ml of solution with cu ii ion concentration at 635 mg l 1 the samples were then filtered at different times 1 to 60 min and the residual cu ii concentrations were tested the regenerative properties for obtained materials were tested by adding 70 mg of obtained material to 25 ml of 635 mg l 1 cu ii solution at ph 5 75 after reaching adsorption equilibrium the material was desorbed with 25 ml of 0 05 m hcl solution under magnetic stirring for 1 h the material was then regenerated with a 0 1 m naoh solution washed with distilled water and dried in the oven for future use the sorption desorption cycles were performed five times the ph had a significant effect on the adsorption capacity of obtained material where the capacity reaches its maximum at ph 5 75 in the case of all types of obtained co polymers the sorbate dependency test adsorption capacities increased drastically until the concentration of cu ii reached 635 mg l 1 the experimental isotherm data were the best fitted by the langmuir model the adsorption capacities calculated from the langmuir model are close to those obtained from experiments the kinetic model that matched the experimental data was the pseudo second order model higher content of gelatine seems to improve the adsorption rate of the materials but lowers the adsorption capacity slightly the regeneration experiments have shown that the material loses its adsorption capacity over 5 cycles by about 25 in comparison to its original capacity about 230 mg l 1 the optimal concentration of gelatine in the material seems to be 2 w w the materials obtained by wang et al present interesting adsorption properties incorporating gelatin into the material structure seems to boost its adsorption capacity towards cu ii ions the material had an adsorption capacity at 261 mg l 1 of cu ii in optimal conditions the regenerative properties of these polyampholytes are its disadvantage however as it is biopolymer based it could still reduce excess use of crude oil derivatives graphene oxide go and triethylene tetramine teta polyampholyte hydrogel it s adsorptive properties were descrived by zhou and co workers zhou et al 2016a firstly the radical polymerisation of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid was conducted by adding ammonium persulfate as a polymerisation initiator and a go aqueous solution with n n methylenebisacrylamide mba as the crosslinking agent n n n n tetramethylethylenediamine as crosslinking accelerator and sodium dodecylsulfonate as an emulsifier the reaction was carried out at 333k in the second step the product underwent methyl ester aminolysis in the presence of teta at 363 k the obtained polyampholyte was then rinsed with deionised water to remove by products and residual substrates adsorptive properties of the obtained pa were tested in batch experiments towards pb ii and cd ii ions at a concentration of 40 mg l 1 at a ph range of 2 to 7 and ionic strength range from 0 01m to 0 1m regulated by either naclo4 or liclo4 the temperature dependence was also investigated in a range of 293 to 313 k regeneration ability of novel pa was tested in the sorption desorption experiment column experiments were performed with two different feed solutions the first solution was composed artificially and contained pb ii cd ii ca ii mg ii na i and k i ions at a concentration of 40 mg l 1 the second solution was industrial effluent containing 2 23 mg l 1 pb ii 4 18 mg l 1 cd ii 203 7 mg l 1 zn ii 14 75 mg l 1 mn ii 4 67 mg l 1 ni ii 9 78 mg l 1 cu ii 0 042 mg l 1 cr ii and 10 02 mg l 1 fe ii the effluent was sampled from the shuikoushan smelting plant located in hengyang hunan province china the batch tests results were used to determine isotherms go teta pa hydrogel towards pb ii and cd ii at equilibrium concentrations of ions ranged between 0 to 27 5 mg l 1 the adsorption process kinetics were investigated obtained experimental data were the best fitted by the pseudo second order model for both adsorbed ion species the ph influenced the adsorption process greatly especially at greater ionic strengths the isotherms determined for both investigated ions prove that the adsorption process of investigated ion species on go teta pa hydrogel is endothermic the obtained isotherms for pb ii ions are best fitted to the langmuir isotherm model when the freundlich model did not give a good representation of experimental data on the contrary the freundlich model was best fitted for cd ii ions with the langmuir model giving poor results the authors suggest that based on ftir and xps studies the predominant adsorption mechanism was an ionic exchange with complexation the maximum adsorption capacity of go teta pa was 216 mg g 1 and 154 mg g 1 towards pb ii and cd ii respectively the column experiments results show that breakthrough curves for both investigated ions for artificially created feed are only displaced by a whit after 3 cycles this proves that the obtained material could perform well even in repetitive sorption desorption cycles even when feed is rich in metal ions at almost no loss of adsorption capacity the desorption process of bound ions was performed with the use of a low amount 34 ml of 0 1 m hcl as eluent the material prepared and described by zhou et al showed promising properties either in artificial and actual industrial wastewater treatment the sorption capacities of those materials seem to be moderate polyampholyte nanocomposites synthesized with the use of gamma radiation and their co ii removal properties were described by elsharma and co workers elsharma et al 2019 firstly to carboxymethylcellulose cmc sodium salt acrylamide sodium acrylate aam sa solution was added followed by diallyldimethylammonium chloride dadmac and n n methylenebisacrylamide nmba as a crosslinker following the iron iii oxide magnetic nanoparticles were added the mixture was then flushed with nitrogen and sonicated the mixture after sonication was irradiated in glass vials at room temperature using the cobalt 60 gamma cell of mc 20 type the molar ratios of substrates varied and the dose rate of the radiation source was 0 98 kgy h 1 the sorption experiments were conducted using the batch method to study the adsorptive properties of obtained p dadmacaam cmc fe2o3 and p dadmac sa cmc fe2o3 towards co ii ions the effect of ph was tested using co ii solution of known concentration spiked with co60 isotope in range of ph from 1 to 6 below the ph of precipitation of co oh 2 with a constant concentration of sorbents at 100 mg l 1 the kinetics were tested by measuring the concentration of residual co ii in solution overtime of 3 hours the initial concentration of the solution was 100 mg l 1 in determining the isotherms a certain amount of the dry material was immersed in 10 ml of prepared co ii solution at 298 k for 24 h after that time the concentration of residual co ii was measured the temperature dependence was also tested at a range from 298 k to 333 k additionally the authors provided a lot of information on swelling properties of newly obtained materials in the dependence to ph and copolymer concentrations accordingly to the ph dependence test further experiments were conducted at ph 5 the sorption kinetics experiment revealed that the experimental data are the best fitted by the pseudo first order model because it provides a higher determination coefficient and provides a calculated qe that is very close to the experimental value the adsorption isotherms and capacities were determined the capacities of p dadmacaam cmc fe2o3 and p dadmac sa cmc fe2o3 towards co ii ions were 69 7 mg g 1 and 75 2 mg g 1 respectively isotherm data was fitted with two models langmuir and freundlich langmuir model appears to fit experimental data better than freundlich also the capacities calculated with the use of the langmuir model are very close to experimental values the sorption process was temperature dependent sorption yield was higher in higher temperatures therefore the process is endothermic the capacities of final products were about 25 higher than the capacities of intermediate polyampholytes and about 440 higher than the capacity of raw cmc higher capacities could be explained by the greater surface of the nanocomposite and the larger number of groups capable of binding co ii ions the capacities of synthesized materials were moderate compared to commercial and other experimental resins a simple method for obtaining high removal efficiency and low cost material is presented by he and co workers their paper reveals that the addition of kaolin can boost the sorption properties of carboxymethyl chitosan cmcs he et al 2019 the authors conducted adsorption experiments to test the properties of polyampholyte hydrogels obtained with different cmcs kaolin ratios series of batch tests were performed to test ph cmcs kaolin ratio adsorbent dose dependency of cu ii adsorption towards cmcs kaolinite material the kinetics selectivity and recyclability were also tested by the authors the preparation of the material was obtained through a schiff base reaction vaghani et al 2012 the cmcs was dissolved in water at 298 k and mixed with different amounts of kaolin then glutaraldehyde was added into the mixture as a crosslinker at 333 k the effect of ph on the adsorption was tested by adding the adsorbent at 1g l 1 concentration to cu ii solutions at different ph values and by shaking the samples for 24h the dependency of the adsorption process on crosslinker content in the adsorbent was tested by adding obtained hydrogels with different crosslinker content to cu ii solution with an initial concentration of 200 mg l 1 the dependency of the adsorbent dose was investigated by a series of the test the different adsorbent amounts from 0 2 g l 1 to 1 8 g l 1 were added to a solution at a concentration of 200 mg l 1 the kinetics were tested in the experiment where the adsorbent was placed in the ph 4 stabilised cu ii solution with an initial concentration of 200 mg l 1 the investigation to determine adsorption isotherm was conducted using concentrations in the range of 50 to 1000 mg l 1 at 308 k the selectivity experiments were performed with the use of solutions containing zn ii and cu ii ions at 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 concentrations possible recovery of adsorbents was tested by firstly eluting used material with a 0 1 m hcl solution then with a 0 1 m naoh solution and washed by deionised water three regeneration cycles were performed the results show that the kaolin content in the hydrogel has an impact on the adsorption capacity of the material the 9 1 cmcs kaolin ratio being the most optimal rising qe by 17 in comparison to hydrogel containing no kaolin however rising the scope further lowers the adsorption capacity the authors suggest that increasing the content of kaolin could be cost effective as expected rising the dose of the crosslinking agent lowers the adsorption capacity since the agent itself contains no groups that take part in the adsorption process so the number of groups per unit of weight is decreased the effect of the dose of the adsorbent shows that increasing the amount increases the removal however the adsorption yield per g of adsorbent was lowered the adsorption kinetics experiment revealed that the adsorption process of cu ii towards cmcs kaolinite hydrogel could be fitted by the pseudo second order kinetic model the isotherm was determined with the langmuir model being the best fitted to the experimental data the calculated adsorption capacity of obtained cmcs kaolinite hydrogel was 244 mg g 1 while the experimental capacity was 204 mg g 1 the ph dependence experiment shows that the optimal ph for adsorption of cu ii on cmcs kaolinite sorbent is ph 4 the material sustains its capacity in a ph range from 4 to 6 without significant loss the selectivity test revealed that zn ii ions affect cu ii sorption on cmcs kaolinite sorbent the difference between cu ii only and zn ii cu ii sorption is lower than 1 in case of concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l 1 and in the case of 200 mg g 1 does not exceed 5 the regeneration test revealed that the material loses its adsorption capacity through regeneration cycles after four cycles the capacity was lowered to 76 of the original capacity compared to commercial adsorbents cmcs kaolinite adsorption capacity is significantly greater polyampholyte hydrogel obtained by he and co workers is an example of a well performing adsorbent produced at a low cost however it has to be noted that the material loses its adsorption capacity over the regeneration which could lead to higher cost in the end compared to other adsorbents the material is also biopolymer based so it can also be advantageous as it could reduce excess use of crude oil 3 discussion and outlooks basing upon collected data the molar sorption capacity of selected ions differs mainly depending on functional groups quantity in the case of commercial ampholytic resins maximum molar capacity for divalent ions varies withing 1 2 5 mmol me2 g 1 with certain deviations like in the case of purolite s930 and amberlite irc 718 which had a molar capacity greater than 4 mmol fe2 g 1 of resin noureddine et al 2008 popa et al 2011 in experimental materials maximum molar capacities generally varied within the same range as commercial resins with a few deviations exceeding that range as shown in table 3 those deviations except functional group quantity can be caused by many factors like ph ionic strength chelating agents present in the solution as well as by ionic radius the difference in ionic radius can also be the driving force of materials selectivity dinu et al 2009 the optimal ph for conducting successful metal ion adsorption depends on the type of ion removed metal cations are removed most efficiently in ph 4 8 opposed to anions that can be removed even in very low ph like chromium oxyanions removed in ph 2 chopabaeva et al 2010 in the case of metal cations the general tendency is that with the rise of ph the removal rate rises however this tendency is limited by the point where metal hydroxides precipitate the low cation adsorption capacities at lower ph are probably caused by the protonation of functional groups wang et al 2013 the temperature dependency of metal ion removal processes with polyampholytic materials was researched and described in several papers ciopec et al 2012 shabaan et al 2013 zhou et al 2016a this phenomenon is mostly accounted for water transport in the material temperature is a parameter considered for enhancing removal rates on ion exchangers independently of the rate controlling step as the elevated temperature can extend the quantity of interactions between the active group and removed ion zagorodni 2007 however the cost effectiveness of such practice has to be taken into account during process design collected data shows that most of the described processes are well explained by langmuir monolayer adsorption this can be deduced by analysing table 3 as most of the experimental isotherm data was well fitted by the langmuir isotherm model most of the kinetic experiments data were well fit by the pseudo second order model and that could mean that adsorption is in those cases limited by the reaction which confirms that the type of sorption in most cited cases is chemisorption polyampholytic materials can be regenerated the regeneration ability depends on the material some of the materials have rather excellent regeneration ability as in the case of ida modified d301 resin that retained its sorption capacity almost unchanged through 10 regeneration cycles as for recycling and disposal of the used materials the authors did not provide any information there are three main types of pa scavengers in terms of structure the pas that are synthesized by grafting betaine groups or other groups on a resin matrix such as poly dvb or polystyrene this is the basic and most popular approach implemented in most commercial pa scavengers another type of pas structural classification is crosslinked products of polycondensation where the active groups are present not only on the side of the polymeric chain but also are a part of the chain an example of this type could be cropro aa crocha aa and cropro maa crocha maa described by noh and co workers noh et al 2005 the third type are bio based matrix pas which are similar to the first type however instead of using synthetic polymer matrix a bio polymer matrix is used as in modified hemp fiber scavenger described by bai and co workers bai et al 2020 another category would include composites with inert core such as silica gel or magnetic nanoparticles grafted with crosslinked polymer functionalised with active groups this approach bases on the magnification of the surface area of the material an example of pa composite would be silica gel grafted with crosslinked polymers functionalised by ida groups monri et al 2014 most commercial pas are included in the first type group i e conventional dvb or ps resins are grafted with ida or aminomethylphosphonate groups however many recent studies are looking into the possibilities of third type pas that is functionalising biomass with highly efficient betaine groups chitosan lignin and other bio polymers are promising substitutes of poly divinylbenzene and polystyrene containing a large quantity of groups that can be modified further to attach betaine groups these bio matrix substitutes are cheap safe for the environment and biodegradable hence they are worth attention investigation of bio based pas should be encouraged as waste management of conventional resins is mainly landfill storage or disposal by incineration after the material was worn out as there are no other methods of disposing of modified poly dvb and ps to be commercialised pa ion scavenging material should be economically viable and possess new traits that distinguish it from already available materials such features include a safer production method of the material superior ion removal properties and new waste management methods after it s life cycle ends in terms of safer methods of production few approaches can be considered as current commercial products are crude oil derivative based the implementation of new biopolymer based matrixes could be a significant improvement by itself as biopolymers tend to be less harmful to the environment in case of improvement of removal efficiency of toxic metal ions not much can be done except for maximization of group quantity per unit of ion scavenger producing more potent scavengers could lower their usage and by this lower the negative impact of manufacture processes on the environment the approach focusing on environmentally conscious waste management of the product at the end of its life cycle should be considered as current commercial ion scavengers can only be disposed of through incineration or stored on landfills polyampholytes depending on the type of the material and method of production can be classified as environmentally friendly the subject is very complicated as some production methods can be considered safe for the environment or in some cases green however the material after it s life cycle ends can be not degradable as mentioned the matrix of the material is a very important variable in this discussion if the matrix is bio based for example hemp fibre in h3imdc imidazole 4 5 dicarboxylic acid modified hemp fibre it is possible to assume that at the end of its life cycle it will not be a problem to dispose of it in an environmentally friendly way on the other hand pas obtained by modification of dvb resins can be efficient and durable as proven by dinu and co workers however the dvb matrix is not considered sustainable environmentally friendly material which could pose a problem at the end of the life cycle dinu et al 2009 in rare cases as in chitosan co gelatine material described by wang and co workers in the material production method the material itself is safe for the environment wang et al 2013 in this case the metal ion scavenger is sourced from the waste material itself so it can be considered as a complex solution of two problems repurposing of biowastes like gelatine or chitosan to remove toxic substances from the water summing up there are polyampholyte types that can be environmentally friendly in both cases of manufacture and waste disposal and should be thoroughly investigated 4 conclusions the need to remove toxic metal ions from aqueous systems is one of the most essential tasks for sustaining our health and environment this review showed one group of ion scavengers capable of removing toxic metal ions from aqueous solutions polyampholytic materials there is a constant need to pursue better purification techniques as shown in table 3 there is still room for improvement as some experimental adsorbents have better sorption properties than commercial pas tables 1 and 2 polyampholytic metal ion scavengers can successfully remove metal ions from aqueous solutions most of the described materials can be regenerated commercial polyampholytes are mostly iminodiacetic or aminomethylphosphonic group bearing ion exchange or chelating resins a significant number of publications on experimental ion scavenging polyampholytes is describing poly carboxybetaines including iminodiacetic group functionalised resins even though commercial polyampholytes seem to have similar removal properties researchers are mostly focused on iminodiacetic adsorbents selected publications showed that some polyampholytic scavengers are capable of selective removal of toxic metal ions from aqueous solution as polyampholytes often bear chelating functional groups that allow selective separation of ionic species there are still unexplored types of potential adsorbents that were not investigated in depth as aminomethylsulfonic aminomethylphosphonic or hypophosphorous acid group containing materials in pursuit of good polyampholytic scavengers researchers should consider looking for solutions that focus besides the efficiency of the scavengers on the environmental effects that directly influence the exploitation cost of used technology the introduction of a material with good ion removal properties that could be in some way biodegradable but also durable in process conditions would be a very promising innovation increasing the efficiency of the scavenger by itself lowers the volume of waste that must be disposed of the approach that would base on biopolymer based scavengers would also be possibly cost effective as the production of those materials does not base on crude oil derivatives as substrates and opens the possibility of creating biodegradable scavenger that can be reduced to non problematic waste biopolymer based scavengers production methods can potentially be safer for the environment than crude oil based scavengers there is still room for improvement in the field of pa scavengers in terms of efficiency as minor changes in materials structure can cause a rapid shift in its sorption properties there are still unexplored functional groups that could possibly be worth investigating another important improvement that is basically a must to advance current scavenger based technologies in water treatment is finding a more environmentally safe matrix for functional groups reviewed papers showed that exploring and developing new adsorbents that are safer

16683,due to the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic wastewater surveillance has become an important tool for monitoring the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2

qpcr is rapid and sensitive there is no standard method yet there are no certified quantification standards and experiments are conducted using different assays reagents instruments and data analysis

rt qpcr and data interpretation ahmed et al 2021b unless validated and optimized these steps can produce erroneous results that may cause inaccurate evaluations of covid 19 status within communities this is particularly important when reporting quantitative data while recent reviews have highlighted the limitations and bottlenecks of wastewater surveillance medema et al 2020b michael kordatou et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021b zhu et al 2021 the reliability accuracy and relevance of quantitative data generated by rt qpcr based wastewater testing have not been examined rt qpcr quantification is based on the quantification cycle cq this value is usually obtained by defining a baseline cycle range below which amplification is not recorded to establish a threshold line that upon crossing the amplification curves generates cq values the cq is inversely proportional to the initial template concentration samples are quantified by comparing their cq values relative to assay specific standard curves standard curves are constructed using a dilution series of standard control materials typically four to six 10 fold dilution points with at least three replicates per point and a defined number of target molecules the standard curve is created by plotting the resultant cq values against log transformed gene copy gc quantities from control materials by fitting a linear trend line to the data y mx b the precision of the quantitative data is strongly influenced by the quality of the standard curve as reflected by its slope m pcr efficiency linearity r2 value and y intercept b pcr efficiency can be calculated from the slope m of the trendline with 100 efficiency doubling of the pcr product after each cycle characterized by a slope of 3 32 although amplification efficiencies between 90 and 110 are considered acceptable a small change in pcr efficiency from 100 to 97 over 30 cycles causes a 57 difference in the estimated input dna while a change from 100 to 90 results in a 365 difference boulter et al 2016 the r 2 and the standard error of the estimated amplification efficiency can be used to evaluate the quality of the efficiency determination while the intercept of the standard curve on the y axis gives a theoretical sensitivity of the assay which denotes the number of cycles required for detecting a single unit of measurement the quantities of target sequence in all samples can be calculated by comparing the respective cq measurement to the established log linear relationship between gc and cq as indicated by the standard curve a standard

certified reference or information values bustin et al 2009 hou et al 2010 adding to the variability within the standard curve parameters rt qpcr assays are characterized by a dynamic range which is the log concentration range of the control material over which the standard curve is confirmed to be linear finally rt qpcr assays are also characterized by a limit of detection lod and a limit of quantification loq while the definitions of these terms may vary they are generally used to describe the smallest concentration of target molecules that can be reliably detected and quantified via the assay bustin et al 2009 described the lod as the gene copy quantity that yields a 95 probability of detection in a single reaction but did not provide a precise quantitative definition of the loq

of 208 reporting at least one standard curve parameter i e 30 33 35 and 40 of studies detailing y intercept slope r 2 values and efficiency data respectively among the 208 rt qpcr assays 130 targeted the n gene 25 targeted orf1 23 targeted the e gene 19 targeted rdrp and 10 targeted the s gene while one did not report any assay target for assays targeting the n gene of sars cov 2 the us cdc n1 assay was applied most frequently 39 followed by the us cdc n2 assay 32 collectively these two assays accounted for 45 of the rt qpcr assays reportedly used to quantify sars cov 2 rna in wastewater rt qpcr assays are performed using two approaches a separate rt reaction i e cdna synthesis followed by qpcr two step or a combined rt and qpcr reaction in the same tube one step the two step approach often uses random hexamer primers during rt followed by target specific primers with the qpcr step offering more flexibility to optimize amplification conditions bustin and nolan 2017 however the two step approach requires additional sample handling potentially inducing greater measurement variability and risk of contamination a potential advantage of the two step protocol is its ability to reverse transcribe rna to cdna immediately after extraction to avoid rna degradation during freezing and storage the one step approach utilizes gene specific primers and minimizes sample handling by carrying out the rt and qpcr steps in the same microtube reducing bench time and the risk of contamination at the expense of less flexibility for assay optimization however the one step protocol may also lead to rna degradation during storage or freezing and thawing if extracts are stored before further analysis the majority 83 of the reported rt qpcr assays utilized the one step protocol and 13 of rt qpcr assays were performed as two step assays the remaining 4 did not report whether a one step or two step protocol was used the performances of one step and two step rt qpcr assays were compared in a previous study and the results indicated significant variation in quantification of the targets between the two protocols bustin and nolan 2017 however in an earlier study wackerd and godard 2005 both one step and two step protocols produced similar standard curves with rt qpcr efficiencies close to 100 suggesting that discrepancies may be protocol and assay specific 4 the us cdc n1 and n2 standard curves to assess the impact of heterogeneity in the reported rt qpcr standard curves used for sars cov 2 rna quantification in wastewater the reported y intercepts slopes r 2 values and efficiencies for the two most frequently used rt qpcr assays the us cdc n1 and n2 were analyzed fig 1 quantitative analysis of other rt qpcr assays was precluded by the low number of studies reporting standard curve metrics for example orf1ab n 4 rdrp n 4 s gene n 1 n gene n 3 and e gene n 3 for this review the copy numbers of unknown samples were calculated by using the y intercept and the slope of the standard curve as shown in equation 1 1 c o p y n u m b e r c q y i n t e r c e p t s l o p e 4 1 y intercept values the reported y intercepts for cdc n1 n 21 and n2 n 18 standard curves figure 1a ranged from 36 1 to 42 5 and 37 8 to 53 5 respectively with 30 and 24 publications not reporting this value these intercepts indicate that anywhere from 36 to 43 rt qpcr thermal cycles would be required to detect a single gc by the cdc n1 assay and 38 to 54 for the cdc n2 assay however these values were obtained using various reference materials from different vendors and the y intercept value depended on the concentration or copy number associated with that reference material therefore starting with a nominally high copy number of a standard could result in a lower y intercept value compared with the same reference material that has been ascribed a lower copy number value the most common source for standard material was plasmid from idt n 13 and 11 for n1 and n2 respectively and reported y intercepts for this control material ranged from 36 1 to 42 5 n1 and 37 8 to 53 5 n2 the wide range of reported intercepts derived from the same standard material which was presumably quality controlled prior to shipment draws scrutiny to the handling of this reference material during rt qpcr 4 2 slope values and rt qpcr efficiencies the qpcr efficiency is derived from the slope of a standard curve as shown in equation 2 2 e 10 1 s l o p e 1 while efficiency values e often vary between templates they are typically highly reproducible for the same template a z of quantitative pcr 2004 the ideal slope of a standard curve is 3 32 which indicates 100 rt qpcr efficiency although a range from 3 1 110 to 3 58 90 is typical for an optimized probe based assay a z of quantitative pcr 2004 slope is also typically more reproducible between laboratories and instruments than the y intercept a z of quantitative pcr 2004 fig 1b shows the reported rt qpcr slopes for the us cdc n1 and n2 assays for the us cdc n1 assay the mean standard curve slope was 3 29 which is within the typical interval however the reported slopes ranged from 3 60 90 to 2 40 161 outside the acceptable range of 3 1 110 to 3 58 90 a similar pattern was observed for the us cdc n2 with a mean slope of 3 46 95 and a range from 4 48 67 to 2 72 133 fig 1d shows the reported and calculated rt qpcr efficiencies calculated with the reported slope if not explicitly described in the publication for the cdc n1 and n2 assays for the reported cdc n1 standard curves the mean reported efficiency was 101 median 95 8 and ranged from 89 6 to 161 for cdc n2 assays the reported range was from 65 to 129 with a mean reported efficiency of 95 8 median 95 4 3 r2 values standard curves should demonstrate strong linear fits with r2 values ranging from 0 980 to 1 00 a z of quantitative pcr 2004 the r2 value of a standard curve is influenced by the precision of replicate standard material cq measurements lower r2 values indicate contributions to variations from sources other than the control material copy number e g pipetting error variable reaction conditions standard dilution preparation error or instrument variation for cdc n1 and n2 assays as shown in fig 1c r2 values ranged from 0 70 to 1 00 and 0 90 to 1 00 respectively while means were comparable n1 0 973 n2 0 989 the cdc n1 assay exhibited a much wider range of reported r2 values the lowest reported r2 values across all sars cov 2 rt qpcr assays were 0 70 for the cdc n1 standard curve this value is well below 0 980 and strongly suggests variation attributable to sources other than the standard material gc number 4 4 within study variation of standard curve parameters miqe guidelines recommend reporting the confidence interval or standard error of the rt qpcr efficiency but do not deem this practice essential bustin et al 2009 standard deviations were reported for all standard curve parameters for only seven rt qpcr assays in three publications of sars cov 2 quantification in wastewater ranges for at least one standard curve parameter were reported for another 12 assays bringing the total to 9 of rt qpcr assays with some reporting of variation while there is no standard for allowable variation the ideal quantification platform should minimize such variation none of the studies specified whether the reported variation was a measure of repeatability within run variation or reproducibility between run variation additionally variation in standard curves can be dependent on the type of standard curve used for quantification single curves master calibration curves or more sophisticated pooled and mixed models sivaganesan et al 2010 however standard curve methodologies were seldom reported in the included publications 5 standard curve control materials performance of rt qpcr depends on the standard materials used to produce the standard curve and good laboratory practices a z of quantitative pcr 2004 careful application specific optimization is required to maximize the performance of the standard materials and the subsequent quantification of genetic targets in samples in many cases commercially available control materials were employed often these materials are provided at a vendor specified titer which is assumed to increase the likelihood of producing reliable standard curves however it is clear from the variability described above that the dilutions or pipetting steps are highly variable and operator dependent as reported previously bustin 2002 5 1 control material reporting a description of the control material was reported for 78 of the sars cov 2 rt qpcr assays in the wastewater surveillance literature the description was sometimes ambiguous including terms such as genes encoding nucleocapsid protein synthetic oligonucleotide and cdna standards such ambiguous descriptions can be especially problematic if the vendor is not specified which was the case for 28 of the reported assays screened for this review using broad classifications control materials included plasmids for 59 assays synthetic cdna for 29 synthetic rna for 36 various forms of transcripts for 19 ambiguous or unclear for 19 and not reported for 46 rt qpcr assays plasmids and synthetic oligonucleotides single stranded cdna or rna accounted for the majority of reported control materials with a nearly even split between the two 28 and 31 respectively few published studies have mentioned adjusting estimated quantities to account for the difference in double stranded dna control materials e g plasmids or gene fragments and the single stranded sars cov 2 rna genome importantly unlike rna control materials dna controls would not be subjected to the rt step therefore quantifications produced using dna as control material would not account for rt variability pre treatment of control materials was reported for 7 rt qpcr assays heat inactivation of isolated strain in two and linearization of plasmid in the remaining five instances independent quantification of control materials was only reported for 6 12 of 208 of the rt qpcr assays 5 2 effects of control material type on standard curve parameters previous studies have reported significant variations in cq of standard curves produced using non linearized plasmids compared to linear control materials synthetic cdna or rna hou et al 2010 lin et al 2011 werling et al 2015 beinhauerova et al 2020 although these are not universal findings oldham and duncan 2012 chik et al 2021 reported up to one order of magnitude of difference between laboratories using linear vs plasmid standards with an 8 4 cq difference observed in one instance between linearized vs non linearized plasmids gerrity et al 2020 reported a droplet digital pcr ddpcr measured copy number 5 fold lower than the vendor specified titer for a circular plasmid control and noted heteroscedasticity in the variance caused by the non linearized plasmid control material with a 9 4 fold bias at 40 cq and a 5 5 fold bias at 25 cq others noted that circular dna plasmids may require linearization to avoid impacts on pcr efficiency leading to subsequent bias in qpcr measurements hou et al 2010 among the publications included in this review linearization was only reported for 8 of the rt qpcr assays where a plasmid was used as the control material for standard curves we considered the effects of control material type linear materials cdna or rna versus plasmid materials mostly circular on reported rt qpcr standard curves for the cdc n1 and n2 assays across the wastewater surveillance literature through the screening of publications we were able to extract standard curve parameters for 21 cdc n1 assays 7 linear control materials and 14 plasmids and 18 cdc n2 assays six linear control materials and 12 plasmid fig 2 shows the scatter plots of each standard curve parameter for cdc n1 and cdc n2 assays stratified by the control material type standard curve parameters based on synthetic rna or cdna and plasmid materials were evaluated using a mann whitney u test mann and whitney 1947 a significant difference was observed only between the standard curve slopes p 0 0402 fig 2b and efficiencies p 0 0181 fig 2d for the cdc n1 assays indicating a potential source of bias although most of the statistical tests imply no significant differences the scatter plots in fig 2 suggest that plasmid control materials consistently exhibit a broader range of variation across all standard curve parameters for both the cdc n1 and n2 assays a coefficient of variation cv standard deviation divided by mean was calculated for each standard curve parameter and standard material group combination for both cdc n1 and n2 assays cv values were greater for curves produced using plasmid materials slope cvs 11 15 efficiency cvs 17 19 compared to linearized materials slope cvs 2 7 efficiency cvs 5 8 further supporting this observation differences were particularly pronounced for standard curve slopes r 2 values and rt qpcr efficiencies for the cdc n2 assay the use of plasmid control materials resulted in a roughly 2 fold increase in the cv of the standard curve slope r 2 value and efficiency whereas for the cdc n1 assay the plasmid control materials resulted in a 5 9 and 4 fold increase in cv for the slope r 2 and efficiency respectively these observations suggest increased variability and lower reproducibility among cdc n1 and n2 standard curves produced using non linearized plasmid control materials compared to linear rna or cdna materials with the effect being particularly pronounced for the cdc n1 rt qpcr assay from fig 3 we further visualized the effect of this variation by fitting log linear regressions to reported rt qpcr standard curves for the cdc n1 and n2 assays stratified by the control material treating each curve as a replicate while the mean slopes m and y intercepts b are comparable the increased width of the shaded area illustrates the increased 99th percentile prediction interval for the standard curves produced from plasmids compared to synthetic rna or cdna the r 2 values for both cdc n1 and n2 plasmid based standard curves 0 943 and 0 897 respectively were lower than the r 2 values for rna cdna curves and are well below the recommended 0 980 lower bound these decreased r 2 values suggest an increased proportion of the variation in experiments performed with plasmids is attributable to a source other than the variability in standard dilution gc quantities our observations corroborate with those of chik et al 2021 and gerrity et al 2020 and further suggest a systematic deficiency in the protocols and procedures used for plasmid control materials in rt qpcr quantification of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater 6 reported lods and loqs the miqe guidelines list evidence for lod and cq variation at lower limit i e loq as of essential importance for reporting rt qpcr experiments operational definitions of lod and loq varied among the studies we reviewed and were frequently unspecified the lod values were reported for only 34 of rt qpcr assays ranging between one and 500 gc per reaction the most frequently used unit lod values were also reported in volumetric units i e µl ml etc but the source of this volume e g sewage extract eluate and reaction mixture was often unspecified a method definition for the lod determination was rarely provided and in several cases the reported lod values were below the 95 lod theoretical limit of 3 gc reaction derived from the poisson distribution bustin et al 2009 an loq value was reported for only 19 of the rt qpcr assays about half as frequently as an lod loq values were also most frequently reported in gc per reaction with values ranging from 5 to more than 10 000 similar to lod when volumetric units were used to report loq the source of the relevant volume was often ambiguous furthermore when multiple rt qpcr assays were used in a single publication the reported lod and loq values were often not attributed to a specific assay 7 discussion the quantitative potential of rt qpcr assays has resulted in the broadening of its use from the qualitative detection of sars cov 2 to the quantification of viral load in patients or environmental samples while a binary result demands reliability specificity and sensitivity quantitative analysis sets a much higher bar regarding assay quality as conveyed by reproducibility accuracy precision and comparability these parameters were established using optimized assay specific standard curves generated using appropriate and validated control materials a z of quantitative pcr 2004 as mentioned above some variability both within and between laboratories is expected during rt qpcr experiments due to variations in protocols reagents sample quality instruments operators data analysis and interpretation the miqe guidelines published 11 years ago were intended to guide investigators and reviewers in their generation of reliable and reproducible rt qpcr data bustin et al 2009 such reliability is even more critical when the data produced are used to guide responses to an outbreak or pandemic in response to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic many laboratories some with limited or no environmental microbiology experience quickly pivoted and adopted various assays protocols materials and techniques including rt qpcr to detect and quantify sars cov 2 rna in wastewater while such efforts are commendable and shortcomings under the duress of standing up entire surveillance programs on short notice are understandable this review suggests a neglect of best practices concerning to rt qpcr experiments in the sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance literature consequently there is significant potential for inaccurate and misleading reporting of sars cov 2 with wide ranging implications for developing policies and guidelines furthermore the departure from best practice in this important process has serious implications for environmental monitoring of high priority biothreat agents in general basic and essential information for rt qpcr assays including the standard curve parameters of y intercept slope and or efficiency and r2 value were reported for only 26 of the rt qpcr assays used for wastewater surveillance variation in these parameters is even more rarely reported being published for only 9 of assays the reported standard curve data exhibit broad heterogeneity that in turn limit the reproducibility and reliability of rt qpcr data for sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance for example y intercepts ranged from 36 1 to 53 5 slopes ranged from 2 4 to 4 5 and r2 values were as low as 0 700 with reported efficiencies ranging from 65 to 161 many of these are well outside of the expected range for optimized rt qpcr assays variation in rt qpcr performance seems further exacerbated by the prevalent use of plasmid control material without linearization this practice is likely to produce increased variation across all standard curve parameters with a particularly pronounced increase in the widely used cdc n1 rt qpcr assay the published sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance literature also contains other scenarios that reinforce the need for higher standards in practice and reporting in some publications standard curves were generated using one to three standard dilutions while others made gc concentration estimates in samples falling well outside the confirmed dynamic range many publications provided no standard curve information at all while one publication stated that the quantitative data were generated by a commercial laboratory without providing any pertinent rt qpcr information not even the assay used to generate the data in a few cases sophisticated epidemiological models such as susceptible exposed infectious recovered seir vector auto regression and monte carlo simulations were applied to quantitative data from rt qpcr experiments without reporting any of the standard curve parameters making it essentially impossible to validate the utility of these approaches conversely at least two sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance studies explicitly followed the miqe guidelines although they are studies using digital pcr graham et al 2021 wolfe et al 2021 this review has several limitations first and foremost this is not a formal systematic review instead relevant publications were identified from a curated collection of sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance publications from april 2020 to may 2021 although this review did not consider every sars cov 2 rt qpcr publication the inclusion of 125 studies provided sufficient information to identify multiple deficiencies in standard curve performance assays and reporting practices second this review relied on self reported data from pre print and published scientific literature which could be subject to bias additionally there are sources of variation that have not been explicitly analyzed in this review such as time between extraction and rt or rt qpcr frequently unreported and differences between instruments and master mixes importantly variation between rt qpcr replicates experimental runs instruments and laboratories is expected to a degree and is well documented for various sars cov 2 rt qpcr assays bustin et al 2021 while it is not possible to independently account for this expected variation the variability observed in this review often exceeded the recommend best practices strongly suggesting that the wastewater surveillance community must make a concerted effort to improve both the reporting of rt qpcr parameters and the optimization of sars cov 2 rt qpcr assays 8 conclusions and recommendations this brief literature review describing the use of rt qpcr assays for wastewater surveillance has revealed significant variation in the standards of the reported results although the paucity of quality control data makes it difficult to ascertain which reports are likely to be the most credible therefore there is an urgent need to improve the transparency of reporting and disclose more information about the characteristics of the assays being used we propose the following measures a starting point for improvement would be the adoption of the miqe guidelines for reporting rt qpcr and digital pcr experiments performed for wastewater surveillance purposes bustin et al 2009 huggett et al 2013 comprehensive reporting of all experimental details including rt qpcr formats one step vs two step instrument and reagent manufacturers and protocols is critical to account for all potential sources of variation in quantitative results therefore it is critical that journal editors and reviewers should consider requiring the submission of the pertinent miqe checklist https rdml org miqe html not only for sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance publications but also for others to produce reliable data especially for public health decision making the wastewater surveillance community should at a minimum aspire to achieve 100 reporting of all standard curve performance parameters y intercept slope efficiency and r2 value if the standard curve parameters do not fall within general data acceptance ranges additional actions must be undertaken such as optimization calibration of pipets and or thermal cycle optimization among others until the appropriate performance is achieved for the intended application because the reproducibility of rt qpcr data relies in part on the standard curves produced by the control materials the type and vendor for such materials should be transparently and unambiguously reported any pre treatment or manipulation of these control materials prior to quantification should also be documented especially for plasmid controls appropriate adjustments for the use of double stranded control materials to quantify single stranded rna should also be reported caveat emptor must be the motto when relying upon commercially available control materials it would also be useful to independently confirm vendor reported titers to ensure that materials were not degraded during shipment or due to mishandling in the laboratory in summary to maximize the utility of wastewater surveillance for public health it is time for wastewater surveillance practitioners to hold themselves to the highest quality control standards and walk the walk bustin and nolan 2017 disclaimer information has been subjected to u s epa peer and

16683,due to the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic wastewater surveillance has become an important tool for monitoring the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 within communities in particular reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr has been used to generate large datasets aimed at detecting and quantifying sars cov 2 rna in wastewater although rt qpcr is rapid and sensitive there is no standard method yet there are no certified quantification standards and experiments are conducted using different assays reagents instruments and data analysis protocols these variations can induce errors in quantitative data reports thereby potentially misleading interpretations and conclusions we review the sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance literature focusing on variability of rt qpcr data as revealed by inconsistent standard curves and associated parameters we find that variation in these parameters and deviations from best practices as described in the minimum information for publication of quantitative real time pcr experiments miqe guidelines suggest a frequent lack of reproducibility and reliability in quantitative measurements of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rt qpcr assay validity standard curve quality assurance quality control wastewater surveillance 1 introduction the screening of

population level ahmed et al 2021a medema et al 2020a peccia et al 2020 d aoust et al 2021 li et al 2021 sars cov 2 rna wastewater surveillance is used as a tool to monitor covid 19 alongside traditional clinical monitoring in over 50 countries across hundreds of organizations and sites https arcg is 1aummw bivins et al 2020 naughton et al 2021 however sars cov 2 rna surveillance in wastewater is a complex process that involves a sequence of steps including wastewater sampling transport virus concentration if required rna extraction reverse transcription quantitative pcr assays rt qpcr and data interpretation ahmed et al 2021b unless validated and optimized these steps can produce erroneous results that may cause inaccurate evaluations of covid 19 status within communities this is particularly important when reporting quantitative data while recent reviews have highlighted the limitations and bottlenecks of wastewater surveillance medema et al 2020b michael kordatou et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021b zhu et al 2021 the reliability accuracy and relevance of quantitative data generated by rt qpcr based wastewater testing have not been examined rt qpcr quantification is based on the quantification cycle cq this value is usually obtained by defining a baseline cycle range below which amplification is not recorded to establish a threshold line that upon crossing the amplification curves generates cq values the cq is inversely proportional to the initial template concentration samples are quantified by comparing their cq values relative to assay specific standard curves standard curves are constructed using a dilution series of standard control materials typically four to six 10 fold dilution points with at least three replicates per point and a defined number of target molecules the standard curve is created by plotting the resultant cq values against log transformed gene copy gc quantities from control materials by fitting a linear trend line to the data y mx b the precision of the quantitative data is strongly influenced by the quality of the standard curve as reflected by its slope m pcr efficiency linearity r2 value and y intercept b pcr efficiency can be calculated from the slope m of the trendline with 100 efficiency doubling of the pcr product after each cycle characterized by a slope of 3 32 although amplification efficiencies between 90 and 110 are considered acceptable a small change in pcr efficiency from 100 to 97 over 30 cycles causes a 57 difference in the estimated input dna while a change from 100 to 90 results in a 365 difference boulter et al 2016 the r 2 and the standard error of the estimated amplification efficiency can be used to evaluate the quality of the efficiency determination while the intercept of the standard curve on the y axis gives a theoretical sensitivity of the assay which denotes the number of cycles required for detecting a single unit of measurement the quantities of target sequence in all samples can be calculated by comparing the respective cq measurement to the established log linear relationship between gc and cq as indicated by the standard curve a standard curve can be constructed using various control materials produced in the laboratory or purchased from commercial vendors including plasmid dna constructs pcr amplicons synthetic rna or dna genomic dna cdna and rna or dna from biological samples such templates may be single stranded synthetic oligonucleotides or double stranded plasmids gene fragments quantities of such materials may comprise certified reference or information values bustin et al 2009 hou et al 2010 adding to the variability within the standard curve parameters rt qpcr assays are characterized by a dynamic range which is the log concentration range of the control material over which the standard curve is confirmed to be linear finally rt qpcr assays are also characterized by a limit of detection lod and a limit of quantification loq while the definitions of these terms may vary they are generally used to describe the smallest concentration of target molecules that can be reliably detected and quantified via the assay bustin et al 2009 described the lod as the gene copy quantity that yields a 95 probability of detection in a single reaction but did not provide a precise quantitative definition of the loq although rt qpcr is a sensitive and specific technique for the quantification of nucleic acid targets the data reproducibility and reliability are critical parameters and must be established for each assay variations in protocols reagents sample quality instruments operators analysts data analysis and interpretation within and the across laboratories can lead to the production of inaccurate and unreliable quantitative data to circumvent these issues bustin and colleagues 2009 recommended a set of protocols and guidelines the minimum information for publication of quantitative real time pcr

quantitative data within and between laboratories and been applied in the field of environmental microbiology de bruin et al 2011 hughes et al 2017 nevertheless there remain concerns regarding the quality of rt qpcr results in the published literature bustin and nolan 2017 taylor et al 2019 particularly in the emerging wastewater surveillance literature ahmed et al 2020 herein we review the sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance literature to assess the appropriate use of rt qpcr calibrators and associated performance parameters all publications included in the analysis are compiled in an open access database as detailed below 2 screening the sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance literature we screened 125 preprint and peer reviewed publications concerning wastewater surveillance for sars cov 2 rna as listed on the covid 19 wastewater based epidemiology collaborative wbec publication map https www covid19wbec org publication map these publications were compiled through alerts via google scholar using the keyword string sars cov 2 and wastewater or sewage from april 2020 to 15 may 2021 of those publications 44 were excluded from further analysis due to the use of platforms other than rt qpcr for sars cov 2 rna quantification e g digital pcr reporting qualitative results e g positive negative or cq values or genomic rather than quantitative results the remaining 81 publications 46 peer reviewed and 35 pre prints reported quantitative gc results as measured by rt qpcr where available we extracted the following information for each rt qpcr assay reported sars cov

dna gblock pcr amplicon etc the vendor of the control material pre treatment of the control material if applied and if any independent quantification was performed prior to use the studies were evenly screened by three co authors relevant data were extracted with a duplicated review of 5 to 10 randomly selected entries by each author the resulting database was independently reviewed by each author and discrepancies were remedied via discussion to form a consensus the consensus database was then independently reviewed and audited by a fourth author the compiled database used for the analysis can be found at https osf io q7dnp doi 10 17605 osf io q7dnp the purpose in conducting this review is not to identify individual laboratories with questionable practices but to highlight the importance of reporting standard curve parameters and to assess the performance of the entire wastewater surveillance community hence citations were not provided when discussing practices within individual publications 3 rt qpcr and standard curve reporting from the 81 selected publications we extracted details pertinent to the assays used standard curve parameters and positive control materials for 208 separate quantitative assays i e an average of 2 6 assays per publication only 26 of the total 208 rt qpcr assays reported in the literature included all essential standard curve parameters with 41 86 of 208 reporting at least one standard curve parameter i e 30 33 35 and 40 of studies detailing y intercept slope r 2 values and efficiency data respectively among the 208 rt qpcr assays 130 targeted the n gene 25 targeted orf1 23 targeted the e gene 19 targeted rdrp and 10 targeted the s gene while one did not report any assay target for assays targeting the n gene of sars cov 2 the us cdc n1 assay was applied most frequently 39 followed by the us cdc n2 assay 32 collectively these two assays accounted for 45 of the rt qpcr assays reportedly used to quantify sars cov 2 rna in wastewater rt qpcr assays are performed using two approaches a separate rt reaction i e cdna synthesis followed by qpcr two step or a combined rt and qpcr reaction in the same tube one step the two step approach often uses random hexamer primers during rt followed by target specific primers with the qpcr step offering more flexibility to optimize amplification conditions bustin and nolan 2017 however the two step approach requires additional sample handling potentially inducing greater measurement variability and risk of contamination a potential advantage of the two step protocol is its ability to reverse transcribe rna to cdna immediately after extraction to avoid rna degradation during freezing and storage the one step approach utilizes gene specific primers and minimizes sample handling by carrying out the rt and qpcr steps in the same microtube reducing bench time and the risk of contamination at the expense of less flexibility for assay optimization however the one step protocol may also lead to rna degradation during storage or freezing and thawing if extracts are stored before further analysis the majority 83 of the reported rt qpcr assays utilized the one step protocol and 13 of rt qpcr assays were performed as two step assays the remaining 4 did not report whether a one step or two step protocol was used the performances of one step and two step rt qpcr assays were compared in a previous study and the results indicated significant variation in quantification of the targets between the two protocols bustin and nolan 2017 however in an earlier study wackerd and godard 2005 both one step and two step protocols produced similar standard curves with rt qpcr efficiencies close to 100 suggesting that discrepancies may be protocol and assay specific 4 the us cdc n1 and n2 standard curves to assess the impact of heterogeneity in the reported rt qpcr standard curves used for sars cov 2 rna quantification in wastewater the reported y intercepts slopes r 2 values and efficiencies for the two most frequently used rt qpcr assays the us cdc n1 and n2 were analyzed fig 1 quantitative analysis of other rt qpcr assays was precluded by the low number of studies reporting standard curve metrics for example orf1ab n 4 rdrp n 4 s gene n 1 n gene n 3 and e gene n 3 for this review the copy numbers of unknown samples were calculated by using the y intercept and the slope of the standard curve as shown in equation 1 1 c o p y n u m b e r c q y i n t e r c e p t s l o p e 4 1 y intercept values the reported y intercepts for cdc n1 n 21 and n2 n 18 standard curves figure 1a ranged from 36 1 to 42 5 and 37 8 to 53 5 respectively with 30 and 24 publications not reporting this value these intercepts indicate that anywhere from 36 to 43 rt qpcr thermal cycles would be required to detect a single gc by the cdc n1 assay and 38 to 54 for the cdc n2 assay however these values were obtained using various reference materials from different vendors and the y intercept value depended on the concentration or copy number associated with that reference material therefore starting with a nominally high copy number of a standard could result in a lower y intercept value compared with the same reference material that has been ascribed a lower copy number value the most common source for standard material was plasmid from idt n 13 and 11 for n1 and n2 respectively and reported y intercepts for this control material ranged from 36 1 to 42 5 n1 and 37 8 to 53 5 n2 the wide range of reported intercepts derived from the same standard material which was presumably quality controlled prior to shipment draws scrutiny to the handling of this reference material during rt qpcr 4 2 slope values and rt qpcr efficiencies the qpcr efficiency is derived from the slope of a standard curve as shown in equation 2 2 e 10 1 s l o p e 1 while efficiency values e often vary between templates they are typically highly reproducible for the same template a z of quantitative pcr 2004 the ideal slope of a standard curve is 3 32 which indicates 100 rt qpcr efficiency although a range from 3 1 110 to 3 58 90 is typical for an optimized probe based assay a z of quantitative pcr 2004 slope is also typically more reproducible between laboratories and instruments than the y intercept a z of quantitative pcr 2004 fig 1b shows the reported rt qpcr slopes for the us cdc n1 and n2 assays for the us cdc n1 assay the mean standard curve slope was 3 29 which is within the typical interval however the reported slopes ranged from 3 60 90 to 2 40 161 outside the acceptable range of 3 1 110 to 3 58 90 a similar pattern was observed for the us cdc n2 with a mean slope of 3 46 95 and a range from 4 48 67 to 2 72 133 fig 1d shows the reported and calculated rt qpcr efficiencies calculated with the reported slope if not explicitly described in the publication for the cdc n1 and n2 assays for the reported cdc n1 standard curves the mean reported efficiency was 101 median 95 8 and ranged from 89 6 to 161 for cdc n2 assays the reported range was from 65 to 129 with a mean reported efficiency of 95 8 median 95 4 3 r2 values standard curves should demonstrate strong linear fits with r2 values ranging from 0 980 to 1 00 a z of quantitative pcr 2004 the r2 value of a standard curve is influenced by the precision of replicate standard material cq measurements lower r2 values indicate contributions to variations from sources other than the control material copy number e g pipetting error variable reaction conditions standard dilution preparation error or instrument variation for cdc n1 and n2 assays as shown in fig 1c r2 values ranged from 0 70 to 1 00 and 0 90 to 1 00 respectively while means were comparable n1 0 973 n2 0 989 the cdc n1 assay exhibited a much wider range of reported r2 values the lowest reported r2 values across all sars cov 2 rt qpcr assays were 0 70 for the cdc n1 standard curve this value is well below 0 980 and strongly suggests variation attributable to sources other than the standard material gc number 4 4 within study variation of standard curve parameters miqe guidelines recommend reporting the confidence interval or standard error of the rt qpcr efficiency but do not deem this practice essential bustin et al 2009 standard deviations were reported for all standard curve parameters for only seven rt qpcr assays in three publications of sars cov 2 quantification in wastewater ranges for at least one standard curve parameter were reported for another 12 assays bringing the total to 9 of rt qpcr assays with some reporting of variation while there is no standard for allowable variation the ideal quantification platform should minimize such variation none of the studies specified whether the reported variation was a measure of repeatability within run variation or reproducibility between run variation additionally variation in standard curves can be dependent on the type of standard curve used for quantification single curves master calibration curves or more sophisticated pooled and mixed models sivaganesan et al 2010 however standard curve methodologies were seldom reported in the included publications 5 standard curve control materials performance of rt qpcr depends on the standard materials used to produce the standard curve and good laboratory practices a z of quantitative pcr 2004 careful application specific optimization is required to maximize the performance of the standard materials and the subsequent quantification of genetic targets in samples in many cases commercially available control materials were employed often these materials are provided at a vendor specified titer which is assumed to increase the likelihood of producing reliable standard curves however it is clear from the variability described above that the dilutions or pipetting steps are highly variable and operator dependent as reported previously bustin 2002 5 1 control material reporting a description of the control material was reported for 78 of the sars cov 2 rt qpcr assays in the wastewater surveillance literature the description was sometimes ambiguous including terms such as genes encoding nucleocapsid protein synthetic oligonucleotide and cdna standards such ambiguous descriptions can be especially problematic if the vendor is not specified which was the case for 28 of the reported assays screened for this review using broad classifications control materials included plasmids for 59 assays synthetic cdna for 29 synthetic rna for 36 various forms of transcripts for 19 ambiguous or unclear for 19 and not reported for 46 rt qpcr assays plasmids and synthetic oligonucleotides single stranded cdna or rna accounted for the majority of reported control materials with a nearly even split between the two 28 and 31 respectively few published studies have mentioned adjusting estimated quantities to account for the difference in double stranded dna control materials e g plasmids or gene fragments and the single stranded sars cov 2 rna genome importantly unlike rna control materials dna controls would not be subjected to the rt step therefore quantifications produced using dna as control material would not account for rt variability pre treatment of control materials was reported for 7 rt qpcr assays heat inactivation of isolated strain in two and linearization of plasmid in the remaining five instances independent quantification of control materials was only reported for 6 12 of 208 of the rt qpcr assays 5 2 effects of control material type on standard curve parameters previous studies have reported significant variations in cq of standard curves produced using non linearized plasmids compared to linear control materials synthetic cdna or rna hou et al 2010 lin et al 2011 werling et al 2015 beinhauerova et al 2020 although these are not universal findings oldham and duncan 2012 chik et al 2021 reported up to one order of magnitude of difference between laboratories using linear vs plasmid standards with an 8 4 cq difference observed in one instance between linearized vs non linearized plasmids gerrity et al 2020 reported a droplet digital pcr ddpcr measured copy number 5 fold lower than the vendor specified titer for a circular plasmid control and noted heteroscedasticity in the variance caused by the non linearized plasmid control material with a 9 4 fold bias at 40 cq and a 5 5 fold bias at 25 cq others noted that circular dna plasmids may require linearization to avoid impacts on pcr efficiency leading to subsequent bias in qpcr measurements hou et al 2010 among the publications included in this review linearization was only reported for 8 of the rt qpcr assays where a plasmid was used as the control material for standard curves we considered the effects of control material type linear materials cdna or rna versus plasmid materials mostly circular on reported rt qpcr standard curves for the cdc n1 and n2 assays across the wastewater surveillance literature through the screening of publications we were able to extract standard curve parameters for 21 cdc n1 assays 7 linear control materials and 14 plasmids and 18 cdc n2 assays six linear control materials and 12 plasmid fig 2 shows the scatter plots of each standard curve parameter for cdc n1 and cdc n2 assays stratified by the control material type standard curve parameters based on synthetic rna or cdna and plasmid materials were evaluated using a mann whitney u test mann and whitney 1947 a significant difference was observed only between the standard curve slopes p 0 0402 fig 2b and efficiencies p 0 0181 fig 2d for the cdc n1 assays indicating a potential source of bias although most of the statistical tests imply no significant differences the scatter plots in fig 2 suggest that plasmid control materials consistently exhibit a broader range of variation across all standard curve parameters for both the cdc n1 and n2 assays a coefficient of variation cv standard deviation divided by mean was calculated for each standard curve parameter and standard material group combination for both cdc n1 and n2 assays cv values were greater for curves produced using plasmid materials slope cvs 11 15 efficiency cvs 17 19 compared to linearized materials slope cvs 2 7 efficiency cvs 5 8 further supporting this observation differences were particularly pronounced for standard curve slopes r 2 values and rt qpcr efficiencies for the cdc n2 assay the use of plasmid control materials resulted in a roughly 2 fold increase in the cv of the standard curve slope r 2 value and efficiency whereas for the cdc n1 assay the plasmid control materials resulted in a 5 9 and 4 fold increase in cv for the slope r 2 and efficiency respectively these observations suggest increased variability and lower reproducibility among cdc n1 and n2 standard curves produced using non linearized plasmid control materials compared to linear rna or cdna materials with the effect being particularly pronounced for the cdc n1 rt qpcr assay from fig 3 we further visualized the effect of this variation by fitting log linear regressions to reported rt qpcr standard curves for the cdc n1 and n2 assays stratified by the control material treating each curve as a replicate while the mean slopes m and y intercepts b are comparable the increased width of the shaded area illustrates the increased 99th percentile prediction interval for the standard curves produced from plasmids compared to synthetic rna or cdna the r 2 values for both cdc n1 and n2 plasmid based standard curves 0 943 and 0 897 respectively were lower than the r 2 values for rna cdna curves and are well below the recommended 0 980 lower bound these decreased r 2 values suggest an increased proportion of the variation in experiments performed with plasmids is attributable to a source other than the variability in standard dilution gc quantities our observations corroborate with those of chik et al 2021 and gerrity et al 2020 and further suggest a systematic deficiency in the protocols and procedures used for plasmid control materials in rt qpcr quantification of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater 6 reported lods and loqs the miqe guidelines list evidence for lod and cq variation at lower limit i e loq as of essential importance for reporting rt qpcr experiments operational definitions of lod and loq varied among the studies we reviewed and were frequently unspecified the lod values were reported for only 34 of rt qpcr assays ranging between one and 500 gc per reaction the most frequently used unit lod values were also reported in volumetric units i e µl ml etc but the source of this volume e g sewage extract eluate and reaction mixture was often unspecified a method definition for the lod determination was rarely provided and in several cases the reported lod values were below the 95 lod theoretical limit of 3 gc reaction derived from the poisson distribution bustin et al 2009 an loq value was reported for only 19 of the rt qpcr assays about half as frequently as an lod loq values were also most frequently reported in gc per reaction with values ranging from 5 to more than 10 000 similar to lod when volumetric units were used to report loq the source of the relevant volume was often ambiguous furthermore when multiple rt qpcr assays were used in a single publication the reported lod and loq values were often not attributed to a specific assay 7 discussion the quantitative potential of rt qpcr assays has resulted in the broadening of its use from the qualitative detection of sars cov 2 to the quantification of viral load in patients or environmental samples while a binary result demands reliability specificity and sensitivity quantitative analysis sets a much higher bar regarding assay quality as conveyed by reproducibility accuracy precision and comparability these parameters were established using optimized assay specific standard curves generated using appropriate and validated control materials a z of quantitative pcr 2004 as mentioned above some variability both within and between laboratories is expected during rt qpcr experiments due to variations in protocols reagents sample quality instruments operators data analysis and interpretation the miqe guidelines published 11 years ago were intended to guide investigators and reviewers in their generation of reliable and reproducible rt qpcr data bustin et al 2009 such reliability is even more critical when the data produced are used to guide responses to an outbreak or pandemic in response to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic many laboratories some with limited or no environmental microbiology experience quickly pivoted and adopted various assays protocols materials and techniques including rt qpcr to detect and quantify sars cov 2 rna in wastewater while such efforts are commendable and shortcomings under the duress of standing up entire surveillance programs on short notice are understandable this review suggests a neglect of best practices concerning to rt qpcr experiments in the sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance literature consequently there is significant potential for inaccurate and misleading reporting of sars cov 2 with wide ranging implications for developing policies and guidelines furthermore the departure from best practice in this important process has serious implications for environmental monitoring of high priority biothreat agents in general basic and essential information for rt qpcr assays including the standard curve parameters of y intercept slope and or efficiency and r2 value were reported for only 26 of the rt qpcr assays used for wastewater surveillance variation in these parameters is even more rarely reported being published for only 9 of assays the reported standard curve data exhibit broad heterogeneity that in turn limit the reproducibility and reliability of rt qpcr data for sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance for example y intercepts ranged from 36 1 to 53 5 slopes ranged from 2 4 to 4 5 and r2 values were as low as 0 700 with reported efficiencies ranging from 65 to 161 many of these are well outside of the expected range for optimized rt qpcr assays variation in rt qpcr performance seems further exacerbated by the prevalent use of plasmid control material without linearization this practice is likely to produce increased variation across all standard curve parameters with a particularly pronounced increase in the widely used cdc n1 rt qpcr assay the published sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance literature also contains other scenarios that reinforce the need for higher standards in practice and reporting in some publications standard curves were generated using one to three standard dilutions while others made gc concentration estimates in samples falling well outside the confirmed dynamic range many publications provided no standard curve information at all while one publication stated that the quantitative data were generated by a commercial laboratory without providing any pertinent rt qpcr information not even the assay used to generate the data in a few cases sophisticated epidemiological models such as susceptible exposed infectious recovered seir vector auto regression and monte carlo simulations were applied to quantitative data from rt qpcr experiments without reporting any of the standard curve parameters making it essentially impossible to validate the utility of these approaches conversely at least two sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance studies explicitly followed the miqe guidelines although they are studies using digital pcr graham et al 2021 wolfe et al 2021 this review has several limitations first and foremost this is not a formal systematic review instead relevant publications were identified from a curated collection of sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance publications from april 2020 to may 2021 although this review did not consider every sars cov 2 rt qpcr publication the inclusion of 125 studies provided sufficient information to identify multiple deficiencies in standard curve performance assays and reporting practices second this review relied on self reported data from pre print and published scientific literature which could be subject to bias additionally there are sources of variation that have not been explicitly analyzed in this review such as time between extraction and rt or rt qpcr frequently unreported and differences between instruments and master mixes importantly variation between rt qpcr replicates experimental runs instruments and laboratories is expected to a degree and is well documented for various sars cov 2 rt qpcr assays bustin et al 2021 while it is not possible to independently account for this expected variation the variability observed in this review often exceeded the recommend best practices strongly suggesting that the wastewater surveillance community must make a concerted effort to improve both the reporting of rt qpcr parameters and the optimization of sars cov 2 rt qpcr assays 8 conclusions and recommendations this brief literature review describing the use of rt qpcr assays for wastewater surveillance has revealed significant variation in the standards of the reported results although the paucity of quality control data makes it difficult to ascertain which reports are likely to be the most credible therefore there is an urgent need to improve the transparency of reporting and disclose more information about the characteristics of the assays being used we propose the following measures a starting point for improvement would be the adoption of the miqe guidelines for reporting rt qpcr and digital pcr experiments performed for wastewater surveillance purposes bustin et al 2009 huggett et al 2013 comprehensive reporting of all experimental details including rt qpcr formats one step vs two step instrument and reagent manufacturers and protocols is critical to account for all potential sources of variation in quantitative results therefore it is critical that journal editors and reviewers should consider requiring the submission of the pertinent miqe checklist https rdml org miqe html not only for sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance publications but also for others to produce reliable data especially for public health decision making the wastewater surveillance community should at a minimum aspire to achieve 100 reporting of all standard curve performance parameters y intercept slope efficiency and r2 value if the standard curve parameters do not fall within general data acceptance ranges additional actions must be undertaken such as optimization calibration of pipets and or thermal cycle optimization among others until the appropriate performance is achieved for the intended application because the reproducibility of rt qpcr data relies in part on the standard curves produced by the control materials the type and vendor for such materials should be transparently and unambiguously reported any pre treatment or manipulation of these control materials prior to quantification should also be documented especially for plasmid controls appropriate adjustments for the use of double stranded control materials to quantify single stranded rna should also be reported caveat emptor must be the motto when relying upon commercially available control materials it would also be useful to independently confirm vendor reported titers to ensure that materials were not degraded during shipment or due to mishandling in the laboratory in summary to maximize the utility of wastewater surveillance for public health it is time for wastewater surveillance practitioners to hold themselves to the highest quality control standards and walk the walk bustin and nolan 2017 disclaimer information has been subjected to u s epa peer and

16684,odors and tastes have become universal problems related to drinking water quality in addition to the typical odor problems caused by algae or microorganisms the occurrence of odors derived from drinking water disinfection have attracted attention the chlor am ination derived odor substances have certain toxicity and odor causing characteristics and would enter the tap water through water distribution systems directly affecting drinking water safety and customer experience this study provided a comprehensive overview of the occurrence detection and control of odor substances derived from drinking water chlor am ination disinfection the occurrence and formation mechanisms of several typical types of disinfection derived odor substances were summarized including haloanisoles n chloroaldimines iodotrihalomethanes and halophenoles they are mainly derived from specific precursors such as halophenols anisoles and amino acids species during the disinfection or distribution networks in addition the change of disinfectant during chlor am ination was also one of the causes of disinfection odors due to the extremely low odor threshold concentrations otcs of these odor substances the effective sample pre enrichment for instrument identification and quantification are essential the control strategies of odor problems mainly include adsorption chemical oxidation and combined processes such as ozonation and biological activated carbon processes o3 bac and ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops finally the challenges and possible future research directions in this research field were discussed and proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection derived odors odor threshold concentration analytical methods control strategies future directions 1 introduction drinking water quality is directly related to human health mcguire 1995 among various water quality influencing factors odors and tastes are two important indicators that people use to evaluate the quality of drinking water wang et al 2017 bruchet 1999 olsen et al 2016 the occurrence of odor problem could reflect the deterioration of water quality and weaken public confidence in water safety dietrich et al 2014 vaughn and james 1967 a comprehensive investigation of the major cities in china has shown that approximately 80 of source water and 45 of finished water have odor problems sun et al 2014 wang et al 2019a investigated the odor characteristics of 31 cities in china and found a variety of complex odor characteristics such as musty earthy fishy and septic odors in source waters table 1 meanwhile odor problems caused by various odor compounds have also reported in some countries for example geosmin and β cyclocitral were confirmed to be the odor compounds for causing earthy and woody odors in lake winnebago young et al 1999 and dimethyl disulfide dmds and dimethyl trisulfide dmts were detected and accounted for the septic odors in the river dee campbell et al 1994 in fact there are many kinds of odor compounds and the causes for their formation are complicated the sources of odor in water could be roughly divided into several aspects 1 factors such as chemical leakage and environmental pollution causing source water pollution 2 odor substances released from algae in the water source such as geosmin gsm and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib glaze et al 1990 3 disinfection by products dbps formed during chlor am ination disinfection oestman et al 2004 and 4 biofilm or pipe materials in the water distribution networks heim and dietrich 2007 chlor am ination treatment has been widely used in drinking water disinfection which can greatly reduce the occurrence of water borne diseases bond et al 2011 considering the health risk of the formed dbps during the disinfection process many countries have established guidelines and regulations for dbps in drinking water table s1 moreover some strong odor substances were derived during the disinfection process which would directly affect the quality of drinking water recently the occurrence and control of odor problems in drinking water have become hotspots in research and drinking water supply especially the off flavor of drinking water during the disinfection process has became a general concern of consumers wang et al 2018 many studies have reported that chlor am ine disinfection is one of the key factors that cause the odor problems in drinking water piriou et al 2004 wiesenthal et al 2007 a study reported that more than 50 of the consumers in japan were not satisfied with the quality of tap water mainly because of the odor problems casused by disinfection zaitlin and watson 2006 another study of four years investigation indicated that more than 40 of the odor events in drinking water are caused by chlorine disinfection piriou et al 2004 at present chlor am ination is still the most commonly used disinfection method in drinking water treatment plants dwtps pichel et al 2018 there has been a lot of research focusing on the formation of dbps caused by chlor am ination gao et al 2019 mian et al 2018 however there are few studies exploring the odor problems of drinking water caused by disinfection in fact the odor problem of drinking water has always been one of the hot spots in the field of drinking water safety control kitazawa 2006 lin et al 2002 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2008 there are two main sources of odor problem caused by disinfection on the one hand free chlorine and combined chlorine in the water have an unpleasant odor on the other hand the reaction of disinfectant and organic matter in water can generate odor derivatives lee and westerhoff 2009 shen et al 2003 in addition during the treatment of micro polluted raw water the organic odor substances that may be derived from chlor am ination disinfection have a lower otcs such as triiodomethane chi3 0 03 μg l trihaloanisole 0 03 ng l and 2 chlorophenol 0 36 μg l albaladejo et al 2012 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a even if the residual chlorine concentration is low in drinking water therefore there has been an increasing number of studies focusing on the water odors scince 2000 shown in fig 1 although the publication regarding water disinfection odors have a small proportion in water treatment aspect the number has been increased in the past decade reflecting the importance of this research field dietrich and burlingame 2019 the odor substances derived from disinfection and their further evolution and transformation in the pipe networks cannot be controlled by water treatment processes which is likely to cause odor problems in the tap water to the authors best knowledge there has not been a comprehensive and systematic study on chlor am ination derived odor problems therefore understanding and control the occurrence of chlor am ination derived odor substances during drinking water disinfection was the focus of this study the objectives of this review were 1 to overview the occurrence and analytical methods of chlor am ination derived odor substances 2 to comprehensively evaluate the control methods of chlor am ination derived odor substances and 3 to explore the future research directions of chlor am ination derived odor substances 2 characteristics and occurrence of chlor am ination derived odor substances drinking water odors include two main types inorganic odors and organic odors most research focused on the odors caused by algae such as gsm and 2 mib while the research on the sources of odors during drinking water disinfection are often ignored the reported occurrences of the typical chlor am ination derived odor substances in water are summarized in table 2 2 1 inorganic odor substances at present consumers often complain about the drinking water odor problems caused by chlorine disinfection in dwtps parinet et al 2010 suffet et al 1996 it is commonly known that disinfectants such as the most commonly used chlorine and chloramines have severe odor problems suffet et al 2004 1996 some regulations call for a residual chlorine concentration in drinking water for example according to world health organization who the residual chlorine levels should be not less than 0 5 mg l after contact time of 30 min at ph 8 0 who 2017 and national standards for drinking water quality of china gb5749 2006 require the residual chlorine was not less than 0 05 mg l at the end of the pipe network to achieve this goal the dosages of hypochlorous acid hocl and monochloramine nh2cl are usually in the ranges of 0 2 2 0 and 1 0 4 0 mg cl2 l respectively in drinking water treatment process wang et al 2018 which often exceed the otcs of hocl 0 28 mg cl2 l and nh2cl 0 65 mg cl2 l resulting in the odor problems of drinking water suffet et al 2004 residual disinfectants could cause the odor problems in drinking water leading consumers to complain about the bleaching powder off flavors in tap water wang et al 2018 shen et al 2003 moreover when nh2cl is used for disinfection it will slowly convert to dichloramine nhcl2 with a lower otc 0 15 mg cl2 l and the percentage of nhcl2 can reach 57 after 24 h in addition the natural organic matter nom in raw water would react with disinfectants to generate the organic chloramine oc with a strong chloramine smell off flavors during the chlor am ination process brosillon et al 2009 zaitlin and watson 2006 zhang et al 2016d therefore from the perspective of drinking water safety and pleasantness the odor problems caused by chlor am ination in dwtps are worthy of attention 2 2 typical chlor am ination derived odor substances 2 2 1 haloanisoles as a group of emerging dbps haloanisoles have a strong musty odor luo et al 2016 typically the formation pathways of haloanisoles in drinking water mainly include 1 biomethylation of halophenoles precursors during drinking water treatment processes such as the microbial o methylation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp to 2 4 6 trichloroanisole 2 4 6 tca displayed in fig 2 a zhang et al 2018 2 the anisole precursors in raw water during chlorination to derive a variety of haloanisoles fig 2 b koch and sures 2018 in addition biological treatment of wastewater containing halophenoles could also lead to the occurrence of haloanisoles in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants and release into the aqueous environment the types of haloanisoles frequently detected in water mainly include 2 chloroanisole 4 chloroanisole 2 4 dichloroanisole 2 4 dca 2 6 dichloroanisole 2 6 dca 2 4 6 trichloroanisole 2 4 6 tca and 2 4 6 tribromoanisole 2 4 6 tba urase and sasaki 2013 zhang et al 2016a studies have reported that the otcs of haloanisoles are extremely low 0 05 10 ng l zhang et al 2018 2016b the otcs of 2 4 6 tca vary from 0 03 to 10 ng l and the otc of 2 4 6 tba is only 0 03 ng l zhang et al 2016b peter and von gunten 2007 which make them to be detected easily by consumers of drinking water with the improvement of analytical methods researchers can analyze trace levels of haloanisoles in water which provides the foundation for related research on the formation and distribution of haloanisoles in drinking water yin et al 2003 study has investigated 11 surface water samples in sweden and the 2 4 6 tca concentration in one of the waters from lillsjön a small forest lake near linköping was above 0 5 ng l on five sampling occasions further detection of this lake water found that the concentration of 2 4 6 tcp reached 1 2 ng l therefore 2 4 6 tca was formed in source water due to the microbial o methylation of 2 4 6 tcp nyström et al 1992 díaz et al 2005 reported that haloanisoles with the total concentration of 8 13 ng l were detected in the finished water of a dwtp of abrera in spain while no haloanisoles were detected in the source water indicating that they were formed during the water treatment processes in addition a study investigating haloanisole concentrations in the tap water in 22 cities in china reported that the detected concentrations of 2 4 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba in winter and summer exceed their otcs and the odor problem of haloanisoles in beijing is the seriousest among the cities zhang et al 2016c 2 2 2 n chloroaldimines the concentrations of amino acids in the eutrophicraw water were at the levels of 1 0 150 μg l which account for approximately 75 of the dissolved organic nitrogen don westerhoff and mash 2002 because it is difficult to effectively remove some small molecular weight amino acids in traditional dwtps such as isoleucine leucine and phenylalanine their residues can react with chloine freuze et al 2004 chu et al 2015 to generate odorous n chloroaldimines and other odor substances cai et al 2020 n chloroaldimines are one of the main dbps during chlorination of waste water containing amino acid and their fortmation pathways are shown in fig 3 how et al 2018 conyers and scully 1993 froese et al 1999 how et al 2017a n chloroaldimines mainly includ n chloroisobutylimine otc 0 2 μg l n chloro 2 methylbutylimine otc 0 25 μg l and n chloride 3 methylbutylimidine otc 0 25 μg l conyers and scully 1993 conyers et al 1993 mccormick et al 2002 nweke and scully 1989 it has been reported that the otcs of n chloroaldimines are less than 1 0 μg l which have a bleaching powder flavour stronger than that of aldehydes 5 0 μg l and nitriles 300 μg l in water brosillon et al 2009 such by products can stable in water for a long time with half lives of approximately 50 h at 20 c freuze et al 2004 therefore n chloroaldimines are considered to be one group of the odor substances in drinking water in addition n chloroaldimines are a group of ocs with no sterilization ability wolfe et al 1985 and cannot be distinguished from inorganic chloramines and free chlorine using conventional n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd analytical method resulting in the over estimation of drinking water disinfection capacity freuze et al 2006 fox et al 1997 2005 therefore the occurrence and concentration of n chloroaldimines in drinking water are particularly worthy of attention studies have shown that common amino acids such as isoleucine and leucine in water are the main source of n chloroaldimines how et al 2017b nweke and scully 1989 reported that when the molar ratio of cl n 2 0 n chloroaldimines are the main chlorination by products of isoleucine and can exist in water stably the c n bond in the structure of n chloroaldimines structure is polar and unsaturated freuze et al 2004 the unstable imines would firstly be generated during amino acid chlorination and quickly hydrolyzed to aldehydes which then can react with inorganic chloramines to form n chloroaldimines freuze et al 2006 the formation of chloroimines required certain conditions during the drinking water treatment processes first the size of amino acids in raw water are too small to be removed by conventional water treatment processes and thus remain in water under the condition that the ratio of cl n 2 0 n chloroaldimines can easily be generated during the chlorination of the residual amino acids freuze et al 2005 because the concentration of amino acids can reach the level of higher than 10 0 μg l n chloroaldimines derived from the chlorination of their precursors amino acids can cause odor problems in drinking water freuze et al 2005 detected low concentrations of n chloroaldimines at 0 25 3 0 μg l with alanine identified as the precursor in dwtps brosillon et al 2009 detected n chloroaldimines with concentrations ranging from 6 to 10 nm in three dwtps in different seasons in paris the concentrations of n chloroaldimines in many studies exceed their otcs 2 2 3 iodotrihalomethanes i thms iodinated dbps i dbps are emerging dbps in dwtps with toxicity much higher than that of the regulated dbps richardson et al 2007 in addition i dbps especially i thms are olfactory substances and have received widespread attention hansson et al 1987 cancho et al 2000 naturally occurred iodide ions i iodate io3 and iodinated organic matter are the main iodine sources for the formation of i dbps the formation pathways of i dbps are shown in fig 4 the presence of i in water can be oxidized to hypoiodic acid hoi during pre oxidation or chlor am ine disinfection processes bichsel and von gunten 1999 ye et al 2012 subsequently hoi can react with nom to generate i dbps ye et al 2012 or further be oxidized to io3 and iodite io2 bichsel and von gunten 2000 in addition i dbps can also be formed in the distribution systems the residual i from the raw water and disinfectants can undergo a series of chemical reactions with the transition metal oxides such as cuo mno2 and pbo2 formed in the pipes contributing to the formation of i dbps in drinking water allard et al 2009 liu et al 2014 a previous study has indicated that coagulation of iodide enriched water with ferric salts may lead to an increase in iodinated organic compounds ding et al 2019 because iodide can be oxidized to iodine by fe3 eq 1 which can be further hydrolyzed to form hoi eq 2 therefore the reaction between iron salts and iodide could lead of the generation of reactive iodine which could further react with nom to generate i thms i thms have a medicinal odor and the intensity of the odor increases with the number of iodine atoms in the structures cancho et al 2001 detected six i thms chi3 chbri2 chcli2 chcl2i chbri2 and chbrcli with the otcs of 0 03 5 8 μg l among which iodoform chi3 has the strongest medicinal odor otc 0 03 μg l it is reported that chi3 with concentration less than μg l has been detected in some dwtps richardson 2003 and the formation of chi3 in chloramine disinfection is higher than that in chlorine disinfection bichsel and von gunten 2000 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 1 2fe3 2i 2fe2 i2 2 i2 h2o hoi h i the presence of iodine source in raw water would cause the formation of i thms iodine concentrations in surface waters in united states canada and europe range from 0 5 to 20 μg l richardson et al 2008 in addition water sources affected by tidal seawater intrusion and or wastewater discharge may result in increasing iodine concentrations it is reported that the median concentration of i thms in the chloraminated and chlorinated drinking waters in 23 cities in the united states and canada are approximately 1 4 μg l dong et al 2019 while the median concentration of i thms detected from some dwtps in the united states is approximately 2 0 μg l krasner et al 2006 although the detected concentrations of i thms in aqueous environment are low they usually exceed their otcs i thms may be generated during the pre oxidation process dong et al 2019 iron coagulation of iodide enriched water ding et al 2019 and the post chlor am ine disinfection in dwtps wang et al 2017 and they are difficult to be effectively removed through conventional treatment processes resulting in odor problems 2 2 4 halophenols precursors conventional drinking water treatment processes have unsatisfactory removal efficiency of nom and phenolic organic pollutants in water resulting in the formation of halophenoles after chlorination ge et al 2008 rodil et al 2012 halophenoles have biological toxicity for example chlorophenols such as 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol have been listed as priority pollutants by usepa bruchet et al 2008 halophenoles are also one of the odor pollutants with phenolic and medicinal odor lau et al 2016 a study has indicated that they can produce unsatisfactory taste and odor at concentrations less than 0 1 μg l suffet et al 1995 in addition to chlorophenols and bromophenols chlorobromo phenols with much lower otcs 0 5 30 ng l can also be generated during chlorination of bromide containing waters acero et al 2005 rook 1974 moreover halophenoles are one type of important precursors of haloanisole odor substances which can significantly contibute to the formation of haloanisoles in the pipe networks corbi et al 2007 halophenoles are initially generated through the halogenation reaction of phenols in the para or ortho position of the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring the continuous chain reactions can lead to the formation of 2 4 dihalophenols 2 4 dcp 2 6 dihalophenols 2 6 dcp and 2 4 6 trihalophenols 2 4 6 tcp subsequent chlorination can further transform these substances as precursors to the production of acyclic by products such as haloacetonitriles hans haloacetic acids haas and thms gallard and von gunten 2002 the main halophenole by products during a drinking water disinfection process include 2 chlorophenol 2 cp 2 chlorophenol 4 cp 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 tcp czaplicka 2004 lee and morris 1962 due to the biological toxicity of halogenated phenols thier control methods are more worthy of follow up research 3 analytical methods of chlor am ination derived odor substances 3 1 olfactometry method although the concentrations of odor substances in drinking water are at low levels people with low odour thresholds can detect the off flavour in water schweitzer and suffet 1999 the olfactometry methods mainly include four types threshold odor number ton flavor rating assessment fra flavor profile analysis fpa and odor activity value oav analysis krasner 1988 oav method can be used to evaluate the odor contribution of different odorants in the sample sivret et al 2016 fpa method mainly describes the odor characteristics and intensity based on the odor type and odor intensity of samples which can be used to evaluate the type and intensity of odors in water objectively and accurately many water supply companies in europe and the united states adopt the fpa method to evaluate the odor of drinking water this method has been included in the water quality analysis standard method 2170b by the american public health association apha 2005 although the fpa method is simple and easy to be implemented it still has certain shortcomings in qualitative and quantitative analyses therefore the combination of fpa and instrumental analysis is the most comprehensive method to analyze the odor of drinking water yan et al 2011 3 2 identification and quantification of odor substances due to the complex matrix and low concentration of odor substances in water the identification and quantification methods of odor substances are difficult to established moreover the odor substances are volatile and should avoid their losses during the analysis process ochiai et al 2001 review has been conducted on the identification of odor substances including 2 mib gsm and musty odour compounds bristow et al 2019 analytical methods for the determination of odor substances require highly selective and sensitive techniques at trace levels in terms of chromatographic technology gas chromatograph mass spectrometry gc ms is an effective method for the analysis of trace volatile organic matter peng et al 2014 gc ms can achieve high separation efficiency for the identification and quantification of odor substances such as haloanisoles chloroimines gsm and 2 mib ochiai et al 2001 in addition using gc ms mass spectrometry gc ms ms can achieve limits of detection lods within 1 0 ng l for some musty odor substances zhang et al 2005 yu et al 2014 gas chromatography olfactometry gco and comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography with time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tofms are also informative for the identification of complex odor compounds a previous study has determined septic and musty odorants in the huangpu river by combing the data of gco with mass spectrometry gco ms and gc gc tofms guo et al 2016a the key to the analysis of odor substances in water is sample preparation with pre enrichment or extraction in advance at present a variety of techniques such as liquid liquid extraction lle purge and trap method p t solid phase microextraction method spme and stir bar sorptive extraction method sbse have been developed for sample enrichment or extraction before the detection of chlor am ination derived odor substances whcih will be further illustrated in the following 3 2 1 liquid liquid extraction lle lle is one of the most classic pretreatment methods and has been widely used in the analysis of drinking water quality parameters farajzadeh et al 2015 the application of suitable extractants can determine the extract after a short contact time the usepa method adopts lle to analyze dbps in drinking water munch and hautman 1995 serrano et al 2011 reported a modified epa551 1 method using ethyl acetate as the extractant for lle to analyze the concentrations of seven halogenated aldehydes in water using gc ms in order to improve the detection sensitivity a large volume injection 30 μl was used and the ph of the samples was adjusted to 3 2 before analysis in addition the dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme has been developed since 2006 which has the characteristics of simple operation high enrichment factor and low organic solvent consumption campillo et al 2010 dllme method has been proven to extract haloanisoles and halophenols in water with the desirable lods below their otcs ma et al 2012 although lle is a reliable analytical method its application in the analysis of chlor am ination derived odor with low otcs is still limited in water it is necessary to find a suitable extractant or derivatizing agent to solve the problem 3 2 2 purge and trap method p t p t is a commonly used pretreatment method that can be combined with gc or gc ms to detect odor substances through using inert gas to purge out the volatile components in the sample and then useing the trap containing the adsorbent to adsorbe the purged organic substances ueta et al 2015 the method has high extraction efficiency of the analyte so as to improve the sensitivity of detection a previous study has shown that the combination of p t and gc ms can determine volatile organic compounds in water with lod at ng l ueta et al 2015 at present there are a few studies using the p t method to directly extracte disinfection derived odor substances from water samples 3 2 3 solid phase microextraction spme spme is the most frequently reported sample extraction or pre enrichment technique reported methods for the detection of typical odor substances based on spme combined with different instruments are summarized in table 3 the spme method uses a fiber membrane coated with an extraction phase a liquid polymer or solid adsorbent to extract different types of analytes volatile or non volatile substances from a variety of media liquid or gas phases callejón et al 2016 after reaching the adsorption equilibrium the analyte concentration in the sample is proportional to the concentration extracted on the fiber membrane convection and stirring are commonly used to shorten the equilibrium time for sample extraction the spme method is easy to handle and can considerably reduce environmental pollution from the use of organic solvents with lods as low as ng l alpendurada 2000 the spme method can be performed by direct immersion di spme into the liquid sample or by the headspace method hs spme that is more frequently used portillo castillo et al 2018 díaz et al 2005 used hs spme and gc ms to detect trihaloanisole in water with optimized spme extraction conditions results showed that the polydimethylsiloxane pdms extraction membrane could detect haloanisoles with the lods at 0 03 0 25 ng l below the otcs chen et al 2013 established the hs spme gc ms analytical method for the detection of ten odor substances and reported that the divinylbenzene carbon pdms dvb car pdms extraction membrane could achieve the best enrichment of odor substance with lods at 0 1 73 0 ng l it is limited in the extraction of halophenols which could be sovled by adding derivatization agents such as acetic anhydride pizarro et al 2007 meanwhile the operation steps to adapt to different situations such as different solvent types also need to be further developed and optimized to improve the extraction efficiency and accuracy of the results 3 2 4 stir bar sorptive extraction sbse sbse is a new sample pretreatment method baltussen et al 1999 using a stir bar with a specific fiber coating to stir and contact the sample solution after the target substances in the sample are adsorbed on the fiber coating the fiber is sent to gc ms for analysis and determination sbse can be used to extract a large volume of solution and the extracted target substance can be fixed by the adsorption material in the stir bar for sufficient time 45 min bringing convenience to field sampling and transportation nakamura et al 2001 the coating adsorption material on the surface of the stir bar is the key of applying the sbse method application at presently pdms is the widely used material in sbse method but it has limitations for the extraction of polar components callejón et al 2016 the application of sbse mehtod to detect musty odor substances in water has been reported with good performance table 3 4 control strategies of chlor am ination derived odor substances the removal methods of odor substances generated in drinking water treatment processes are one of the research hotspots in the field of drinking water safety ensurance chestnutt et al 2007 studies have shown that the traditional processes in dwtps have unsatisfactory removal efficiency of odor substances in drinking water meunier et al 2006 with the development of analysis technology and control method research on the removal of drinking water odor substances has gradually developed according to the source and type of odor substances the control methods include 1 prevention of the intrusion or formation of odor substances 2 removal of odor substances qian et al 2018 the main prevention method is to control the source of odors on the other hand it is necessary to adopt corresponding treatment methods to remove the odor substances that are present a few treatment methods have been applied to effectively remove water odor substances such as adsorption chemical oxidation and various combined technologies which will be futher illustrated in the following 4 1 adsorption method activated carbon ac is a kind of porous adsorption material with large specific surface area and satisfactory removal rate for most odor substances matsui et al 2014 commonly used ac adsorbents include powder ac pac granular ac gac and ac fiber acf among them pac adsorption method is widely used to remove odor substances in drinking water kim and bae 2007 previous studies have reported the usage of pac and gac for the adsorption of gsm 2 mib halophenols 2 4 6 tca and other odor substances in water and the residual odor substances after adsorption are all below their otcs hamdaoui and naffrechoux 2007 huang et al 2019 matsui et al 2015 the micropores of pac are considered to be an important indicator for the adsorption of odor compounds pelekani and snoeyink 1999 their study has shown that when the average pore size is larger than 8 å better adsorption performance for atrazine and nom can be achieved however the presence of dissolved organic carbon doc in water can compete with some odor substances for pac adsorption and the residual chlorine in the water would also reduce the adsorption capacity of pac kim and bae 2007 moreover qian et al 2018 used five different gacs for the adsorption of chi3 and found that fibrous carbon exhibited the best adsorption efficiency the adsorption isotherm fitted well to the freundlich model however the adsorption capacity is affected by water matrix and the characteristics of nom moreover additional regeneration of the adsorbents are required to maintain satisfactory adsorption capacity 4 2 chemical oxidation adding oxidants or using advanced oxidation processes aops can destroy the structure of odor substances to achieve efficient removal guo et al 2016b jung et al 2004 kim et al 1997 a study has reported effectively remove of chlorine derived odor substances such as 2 4 dcp using potassium permanganate kmno4 he et al 2010 peter and von gunten 2007 studied ozone oxidation to remove odor substances in drinking water including 2 4 6 tca 2 4 6 tba etc and found that haloanisoles have poor reactivity with o3 compared with ozonation alone ozone catalysis with aluminumoxides can significantly enhance the removal of tca through the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh qi et al 2009 because pre ozonation can reduce the concentration of monomers of amino acids in water it can be a feasible method to control the formation of n chloroaldimines from amino acids during chlorine disinfection bond et al 2011 it has been reported that the combination of ozonation and biological ac processes o3 bac can significantly improve the degradation efficiency of odor dbp precursors yang et al 2017 this method mainly based on the rapid decomposition of o3 to produce free radicals combining with bac to achieve oxidation and adsorption of odor substances wang et al 2014 although the o3 bac process showed satisfactory results for the removal of odor substances it also increased the cost of water purification process ultraviolet uv or ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops have been proven to be effective processes to remove odor substances and to control the formation of dbps luo et al 2016 chang et al 2011 a study reported that iodoform can be completely degraded within 20 min at ph 7 0 in the uv chlorine process wang et al 2017 moreover there are also several studies reporting the removal of haloanisoles using uv aops zhang et al 2020 because the free radicals generated in uv aops possess strong oxidizing ability these processes exhibit excellent degradation efficiency on odor substances derived from drinking water disinfection with the development of analysis technologies and control methods research on the removal of drinking water odor substances has gradually developed according to the types and sources of odor compounds the control strategies of chlor am ination derived odor compounds mainly include prevention of source water pollution and optimization of water purification processes control strategies such as adsorption method chemical oxidation method and combination of different processes have their own advantages and disadvantages for the removal of odor future study could consider the coordinated treatment of water sources water plants and pipe networks to achieve effective control of the chlor am ination derived odor problems in drinking water and provide safe and high quality drinking water to the consumers 5 conclusions and the way forward this study is the first review of odors derived from drinking water disinfection water supply is a systematic project and disinfection processes involve multiple steps such as chlor am ination in dwtps secondary chlorine replenishment in the pipe network and the maintenance of residual chlorine at the end of pipe lines both the disinfectants and the odor derived from disinfection would affect the quality of drinking water free chlorine monochloramine dichloramine and trichloramine have chlorine odor and the odor intensity would change during the conversion of different species of residual chlorine the most commonly reported disinfection derived organic odor substances include haloanisole n chloroaldimines iodotrihalomethane and halophenols because disinfectant derived odor substances have extremely low otcs but high volatilization and they are present in water at low concentrations it is difficult to accurately identify and quantify them in order to have deeper perceptions of chlor am ination derived odor several important topics related to chlor am ination derived odors are suggested to be further studied in future work first the strong chlorine odor in tap water may be the caused by the combination of monochloramine and dichloramine or even trichloramine disinfectants reacting with nom in water can easily produce halogenated derivatives with odor such as haloanisole n chloroaldimines etc however with the mixed chlorine species in the actual water supply systems there is still a lack of research focusing on the odor caused by the conversion of different forms of residual disinfectants moreover the contributions of disinfectants and their derivatives to the odor of water can also be further studied processes second the relationship between water quality parameters such as ph and nom and the chlor am ination derived odor substances could be predicted and the seasonal changes of different odor substances haloanisole n chloroaldimines i thms etc are also worth attention therefore it is meaningful to explore the relationship between various water quality parameters and disinfection derived odor problems using data driven analysis to evaluate the formation potential and health risks related to drinking water odors can be useful to establish theoretical models to evaluate the effectiveness of future water treatment processes most of the research regarding the removal of odor substances focused on algae derived odors gsm and 2 mib among various control strategies aops have high reaction performance and kinetics however there are rare studies focused on the reduction of chlor am ination derived odor substances and their related toxicity assessment a few studies have mentioned that the intermediates formed in the degradation processes might also affect the quality of drinking water and even certain intermediates may cause off flavour in water it is worth exploring in depth to reduce the chlor am ination derived odor substances through the regulation of disinfection methods and the improvement of control strategies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this study was supported in part by the national natural science foundation of china nos 51778444

16684,odors and tastes have become universal problems related to drinking water quality in addition to the typical odor problems caused by algae or microorganisms the occurrence of odors derived from drinking water disinfection have attracted attention the chlor am ination derived odor substances have certain toxicity and odor causing characteristics and would enter the tap water through water distribution systems directly affecting drinking water safety and customer experience this study provided a comprehensive overview of the occurrence detection and control of odor substances derived from drinking water chlor am ination disinfection the occurrence and formation mechanisms of several typical types of disinfection derived odor substances were summarized including haloanisoles n chloroaldimines iodotrihalomethanes and halophenoles they are mainly derived from specific precursors such as halophenols anisoles and amino acids species during the disinfection or distribution networks in addition the change of disinfectant during chlor am ination was also one of the causes of disinfection odors due to the extremely low odor threshold concentrations otcs of these odor substances the effective sample pre enrichment for instrument identification and quantification are essential the control strategies of odor problems mainly include adsorption chemical oxidation and combined processes such as ozonation and biological activated carbon processes o3 bac and ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops finally the challenges and possible future research directions in this research field were discussed and proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection derived odors odor threshold concentration analytical methods control strategies future directions 1 introduction drinking water quality is directly related to human health mcguire 1995 among various water quality influencing factors odors and tastes are two important indicators that people use to evaluate the quality of drinking water wang et al 2017 bruchet 1999 olsen et al 2016 the occurrence of odor problem could reflect the deterioration of water quality and weaken public confidence in water safety dietrich et al 2014 vaughn and james 1967 a comprehensive investigation of the major cities in china has shown that approximately 80 of source water and 45 of finished water have odor problems sun et al 2014 wang et al 2019a investigated the odor characteristics of 31 cities in china and found a variety of complex odor characteristics such as musty earthy fishy and septic odors in source waters table 1 meanwhile odor problems caused by various odor compounds have also reported in some countries for example geosmin and β cyclocitral were confirmed to be the odor compounds for causing earthy and woody odors in lake winnebago young et al 1999 and dimethyl disulfide dmds and dimethyl trisulfide dmts were detected and accounted for the septic odors in the river dee campbell et al 1994 in fact there are many kinds of odor compounds and the causes for their formation are complicated the sources of odor in water could be roughly divided into several aspects 1 factors such as chemical leakage and environmental pollution causing source water pollution 2 odor substances released from algae in the water source such as geosmin gsm and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib glaze et al 1990 3 disinfection by products dbps formed during chlor am ination disinfection oestman et al 2004 and 4 biofilm or pipe materials in the water distribution networks heim and dietrich 2007 chlor am ination treatment has been widely used in drinking water disinfection which can greatly reduce the occurrence of water borne diseases bond et al 2011 considering the health risk of the formed dbps during the disinfection process many countries have established guidelines and regulations for dbps in drinking water table s1 moreover some strong odor substances were derived during the disinfection process which would directly affect the quality of drinking water recently the occurrence and control of odor problems in drinking water have become hotspots in research and drinking water supply especially the off flavor of drinking water during the disinfection process has became a general concern of consumers wang et al 2018 many studies have reported that chlor am ine disinfection is one of the key factors that cause the odor problems in drinking water piriou et al 2004 wiesenthal et al 2007 a study reported that more than 50 of the consumers in japan were not satisfied with the quality of tap water mainly because of the odor problems casused by disinfection zaitlin and watson 2006 another study of four years investigation indicated that more than 40 of the odor events in drinking water are caused by chlorine disinfection piriou et al 2004 at present chlor am ination is still the most commonly used disinfection method in drinking water treatment plants dwtps pichel et al 2018 there has been a lot of research focusing on the formation of dbps caused by chlor am ination gao et al 2019 mian et al 2018 however there are few studies exploring the odor problems of drinking water caused by disinfection in fact the odor problem of drinking water has always been one of the hot spots in the field of drinking water safety control kitazawa 2006 lin et al 2002 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2008 there are two main sources of odor problem caused by disinfection on the one hand free chlorine and combined chlorine in the water have an unpleasant odor on the other hand the reaction of disinfectant and organic matter in water can generate odor derivatives lee and westerhoff 2009 shen et al 2003 in addition during the treatment of micro polluted raw water the organic odor substances that may be derived from chlor am ination disinfection have a lower otcs such as triiodomethane chi3 0 03 μg l trihaloanisole 0 03 ng l and 2 chlorophenol 0 36 μg l albaladejo et al 2012 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a even if the residual chlorine concentration is low in drinking water therefore there has been an increasing number of studies focusing on the water odors scince 2000 shown in fig 1 although the publication regarding water disinfection odors have a small proportion in water treatment aspect the number has been increased in the past decade reflecting the importance of this research field dietrich and burlingame 2019 the odor substances derived from disinfection and their further evolution and transformation in the pipe networks cannot be controlled by water treatment processes which is likely to cause odor problems in the tap water to the authors best knowledge there has not been a comprehensive and systematic study on chlor am ination derived odor problems therefore understanding and control the occurrence of chlor am ination derived odor substances during drinking water disinfection was the focus of this study the objectives of this review were 1 to overview the occurrence and analytical methods of chlor am ination derived odor substances 2 to comprehensively evaluate the control methods of chlor am ination derived odor substances and 3 to explore the future research directions of chlor am ination derived odor substances 2 characteristics and occurrence of chlor am ination derived odor substances drinking water odors include two main types inorganic odors and organic odors most research focused on the odors caused by algae such as gsm and 2 mib while the research on the sources of odors during drinking water disinfection are often ignored the reported occurrences of the typical chlor am ination derived odor substances in water are summarized in table 2 2 1 inorganic odor substances at present consumers often complain about the drinking water odor problems caused by chlorine disinfection in dwtps parinet et al 2010 suffet et al 1996 it is commonly known that disinfectants such as the most commonly used chlorine and chloramines have severe odor problems suffet et al 2004 1996 some regulations call for a residual chlorine concentration in drinking water for example according to world health organization who the residual chlorine levels should be not less than 0 5 mg l after contact time of 30 min at ph 8 0 who 2017 and national standards for drinking water quality of china gb5749 2006 require the residual chlorine was not less than 0 05 mg l at the end of the pipe network to achieve this goal the dosages of hypochlorous acid hocl and monochloramine nh2cl are usually in the ranges of 0 2 2 0 and 1 0 4 0 mg cl2 l respectively in drinking water treatment process wang et al 2018 which often exceed the otcs of hocl 0 28 mg cl2 l and nh2cl 0 65 mg cl2 l resulting in the odor problems of drinking water suffet et al 2004 residual disinfectants could cause the odor problems in drinking water leading consumers to complain about the bleaching powder off flavors in tap water wang et al 2018 shen et al 2003 moreover when nh2cl is used for disinfection it will slowly convert to dichloramine nhcl2 with a lower otc 0 15 mg cl2 l and the percentage of nhcl2 can reach 57 after 24 h in addition the natural organic matter nom in raw water would react with disinfectants to generate the organic chloramine oc with a strong chloramine smell off flavors during the chlor am ination process brosillon et al 2009 zaitlin and watson 2006 zhang et al 2016d therefore from the perspective of drinking water safety and pleasantness the odor problems caused by chlor am ination in dwtps are worthy of attention 2 2 typical chlor am ination derived odor substances 2 2 1 haloanisoles as a group of emerging dbps haloanisoles have a strong musty odor luo et al 2016 typically the formation pathways of haloanisoles in drinking water mainly include 1 biomethylation of halophenoles precursors during drinking water treatment processes such as the microbial o methylation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp to 2 4 6 trichloroanisole 2 4 6 tca displayed in fig 2 a zhang et al 2018 2 the anisole precursors in raw water during chlorination to derive a variety of haloanisoles fig 2 b koch and sures 2018 in addition biological treatment of wastewater containing halophenoles could also lead to the occurrence of haloanisoles in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants and release into the aqueous environment the types of haloanisoles frequently detected in water mainly include 2 chloroanisole 4 chloroanisole 2 4 dichloroanisole 2 4 dca 2 6 dichloroanisole 2 6 dca 2 4 6 trichloroanisole 2 4 6 tca and 2 4 6 tribromoanisole 2 4 6 tba urase and sasaki 2013 zhang et al 2016a studies have reported that the otcs of haloanisoles are extremely low 0 05 10 ng l zhang et al 2018 2016b the otcs of 2 4 6 tca vary from 0 03 to 10 ng l and the otc of 2 4 6 tba is only 0 03 ng l zhang et al 2016b peter and von gunten 2007 which make them to be detected easily by consumers of drinking water with the improvement of analytical methods researchers can analyze trace levels of haloanisoles in water which provides the foundation for related research on the formation and distribution of haloanisoles in drinking water yin et al 2003 study has investigated 11 surface water samples in sweden and the 2 4 6 tca concentration in one of the waters from lillsjön a small forest lake near linköping was above 0 5 ng l on five sampling occasions further detection of this lake water found that the concentration of 2 4 6 tcp reached 1 2 ng l therefore 2 4 6 tca was formed in source water due to the microbial o methylation of 2 4 6 tcp nyström et al 1992 díaz et al 2005 reported that haloanisoles with the total concentration of 8 13 ng l were detected in the finished water of a dwtp of abrera in spain while no haloanisoles were detected in the source water indicating that they were formed during the water treatment processes in addition a study investigating haloanisole concentrations in the tap water in 22 cities in china reported that the detected concentrations of 2 4 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba in winter and summer exceed their otcs and the odor problem of haloanisoles in beijing is the seriousest among the cities zhang et al 2016c 2 2 2 n chloroaldimines the concentrations of amino acids in the eutrophicraw water were at the levels of 1 0 150 μg l which account for approximately 75 of the dissolved organic nitrogen don westerhoff and mash 2002 because it is difficult to effectively remove some small molecular weight amino acids in traditional dwtps such as isoleucine leucine and phenylalanine their residues can react with chloine freuze et al 2004 chu et al 2015 to generate odorous n chloroaldimines and other odor substances cai et al 2020 n chloroaldimines are one of the main dbps during chlorination of waste water containing amino acid and their fortmation pathways are shown in fig 3 how et al 2018 conyers and scully 1993 froese et al 1999 how et al 2017a n chloroaldimines mainly includ n chloroisobutylimine otc 0 2 μg l n chloro 2 methylbutylimine otc 0 25 μg l and n chloride 3 methylbutylimidine otc 0 25 μg l conyers and scully 1993 conyers et al 1993 mccormick et al 2002 nweke and scully 1989 it has been reported that the otcs of n chloroaldimines are less than 1 0 μg l which have a bleaching powder flavour stronger than that of aldehydes 5 0 μg l and nitriles 300 μg l in water brosillon et al 2009 such by products can stable in water for a long time with half lives of approximately 50 h at 20 c freuze et al 2004 therefore n chloroaldimines are considered to be one group of the odor substances in drinking water in addition n chloroaldimines are a group of ocs with no sterilization ability wolfe et al 1985 and cannot be distinguished from inorganic chloramines and free chlorine using conventional n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd analytical method resulting in the over estimation of drinking water disinfection capacity freuze et al 2006 fox et al 1997 2005 therefore the occurrence and concentration of n chloroaldimines in drinking water are particularly worthy of attention studies have shown that common amino acids such as isoleucine and leucine in water are the main source of n chloroaldimines how et al 2017b nweke and scully 1989 reported that when the molar ratio of cl n 2 0 n chloroaldimines are the main chlorination by products of isoleucine and can exist in water stably the c n bond in the structure of n chloroaldimines structure is polar and unsaturated freuze et al 2004 the unstable imines would firstly be generated during amino acid chlorination and quickly hydrolyzed to aldehydes which then can react with inorganic chloramines to form n chloroaldimines freuze et al 2006 the formation of chloroimines required certain conditions during the drinking water treatment processes first the size of amino acids in raw water are too small to be removed by conventional water treatment processes and thus remain in water under the condition that the ratio of cl n 2 0 n chloroaldimines can easily be generated during the chlorination of the residual amino acids freuze et al 2005 because the concentration of amino acids can reach the level of higher than 10 0 μg l n chloroaldimines derived from the chlorination of their precursors amino acids can cause odor problems in drinking water freuze et al 2005 detected low concentrations of n chloroaldimines at 0 25 3 0 μg l with alanine identified as the precursor in dwtps brosillon et al 2009 detected n chloroaldimines with concentrations ranging from 6 to 10 nm in three dwtps in different seasons in paris the concentrations of n chloroaldimines in many studies exceed their otcs 2 2 3 iodotrihalomethanes i thms iodinated dbps i dbps are emerging dbps in dwtps with toxicity much higher than that of the regulated dbps richardson et al 2007 in addition i dbps especially i thms are olfactory substances and have received widespread attention hansson et al 1987 cancho et al 2000 naturally occurred iodide ions i iodate io3 and iodinated organic matter are the main iodine sources for the formation of i dbps the formation pathways of i dbps are shown in fig 4 the presence of i in water can be oxidized to hypoiodic acid hoi during pre oxidation or chlor am ine disinfection processes bichsel and von gunten 1999 ye et al 2012 subsequently hoi can react with nom to generate i dbps ye et al 2012 or further be oxidized to io3 and iodite io2 bichsel and von gunten 2000 in addition i dbps can also be formed in the distribution systems the residual i from the raw water and disinfectants can undergo a series of chemical reactions with the transition metal oxides such as cuo mno2 and pbo2 formed in the pipes contributing to the formation of i dbps in drinking water allard et al 2009 liu et al 2014 a previous study has indicated that coagulation of iodide enriched water with ferric salts may lead to an increase in iodinated organic compounds ding et al 2019 because iodide can be oxidized to iodine by fe3 eq 1 which can be further hydrolyzed to form hoi eq 2 therefore the reaction between iron salts and iodide could lead of the generation of reactive iodine which could further react with nom to generate i thms i thms have a medicinal odor and the intensity of the odor increases with the number of iodine atoms in the structures cancho et al 2001 detected six i thms chi3 chbri2 chcli2 chcl2i chbri2 and chbrcli with the otcs of 0 03 5 8 μg l among which iodoform chi3 has the strongest medicinal odor otc 0 03 μg l it is reported that chi3 with concentration less than μg l has been detected in some dwtps richardson 2003 and the formation of chi3 in chloramine disinfection is higher than that in chlorine disinfection bichsel and von gunten 2000 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 1 2fe3 2i 2fe2 i2 2 i2 h2o hoi h i the presence of iodine source in raw water would cause the formation of i thms iodine concentrations in surface waters in united states canada and europe range from 0 5 to 20 μg l richardson et al 2008 in addition water sources affected by tidal seawater intrusion and or wastewater discharge may result in increasing iodine concentrations it is reported that the median concentration of i thms in the chloraminated and chlorinated drinking waters in 23 cities in the united states and canada are approximately 1 4 μg l dong et al 2019 while the median concentration of i thms detected from some dwtps in the united states is approximately 2 0 μg l krasner et al 2006 although the detected concentrations of i thms in aqueous environment are low they usually exceed their otcs i thms may be generated during the pre oxidation process dong et al 2019 iron coagulation of iodide enriched water ding et al 2019 and the post chlor am ine disinfection in dwtps wang et al 2017 and they are difficult to be effectively removed through conventional treatment processes resulting in odor problems 2 2 4 halophenols precursors conventional drinking water treatment processes have unsatisfactory removal efficiency of nom and phenolic organic pollutants in water resulting in the formation of halophenoles after chlorination ge et al 2008 rodil et al 2012 halophenoles have biological toxicity for example chlorophenols such as 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol have been listed as priority pollutants by usepa bruchet et al 2008 halophenoles are also one of the odor pollutants with phenolic and medicinal odor lau et al 2016 a study has indicated that they can produce unsatisfactory taste and odor at concentrations less than 0 1 μg l suffet et al 1995 in addition to chlorophenols and bromophenols chlorobromo phenols with much lower otcs 0 5 30 ng l can also be generated during chlorination of bromide containing waters acero et al 2005 rook 1974 moreover halophenoles are one type of important precursors of haloanisole odor substances which can significantly contibute to the formation of haloanisoles in the pipe networks corbi et al 2007 halophenoles are initially generated through the halogenation reaction of phenols in the para or ortho position of the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring the continuous chain reactions can lead to the formation of 2 4 dihalophenols 2 4 dcp 2 6 dihalophenols 2 6 dcp and 2 4 6 trihalophenols 2 4 6 tcp subsequent chlorination can further transform these substances as precursors to the production of acyclic by products such as haloacetonitriles hans haloacetic acids haas and thms gallard and von gunten 2002 the main halophenole by products during a drinking water disinfection process include 2 chlorophenol 2 cp 2 chlorophenol 4 cp 2 4 dcp and 2 4 6 tcp czaplicka 2004 lee and morris 1962 due to the biological toxicity of halogenated phenols thier control methods are more worthy of follow up research 3 analytical methods of chlor am ination derived odor substances 3 1 olfactometry method although the concentrations of odor substances in drinking water are at low levels people with low odour thresholds can detect the off flavour in water schweitzer and suffet 1999 the olfactometry methods mainly include four types threshold odor number ton flavor rating assessment fra flavor profile analysis fpa and odor activity value oav analysis krasner 1988 oav method can be used to evaluate the odor contribution of different odorants in the sample sivret et al 2016 fpa method mainly describes the odor characteristics and intensity based on the odor type and odor intensity of samples which can be used to evaluate the type and intensity of odors in water objectively and accurately many water supply companies in europe and the united states adopt the fpa method to evaluate the odor of drinking water this method has been included in the water quality analysis standard method 2170b by the american public health association apha 2005 although the fpa method is simple and easy to be implemented it still has certain shortcomings in qualitative and quantitative analyses therefore the combination of fpa and instrumental analysis is the most comprehensive method to analyze the odor of drinking water yan et al 2011 3 2 identification and quantification of odor substances due to the complex matrix and low concentration of odor substances in water the identification and quantification methods of odor substances are difficult to established moreover the odor substances are volatile and should avoid their losses during the analysis process ochiai et al 2001 review has been conducted on the identification of odor substances including 2 mib gsm and musty odour compounds bristow et al 2019 analytical methods for the determination of odor substances require highly selective and sensitive techniques at trace levels in terms of chromatographic technology gas chromatograph mass spectrometry gc ms is an effective method for the analysis of trace volatile organic matter peng et al 2014 gc ms can achieve high separation efficiency for the identification and quantification of odor substances such as haloanisoles chloroimines gsm and 2 mib ochiai et al 2001 in addition using gc ms mass spectrometry gc ms ms can achieve limits of detection lods within 1 0 ng l for some musty odor substances zhang et al 2005 yu et al 2014 gas chromatography olfactometry gco and comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography with time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tofms are also informative for the identification of complex odor compounds a previous study has determined septic and musty odorants in the huangpu river by combing the data of gco with mass spectrometry gco ms and gc gc tofms guo et al 2016a the key to the analysis of odor substances in water is sample preparation with pre enrichment or extraction in advance at present a variety of techniques such as liquid liquid extraction lle purge and trap method p t solid phase microextraction method spme and stir bar sorptive extraction method sbse have been developed for sample enrichment or extraction before the detection of chlor am ination derived odor substances whcih will be further illustrated in the following 3 2 1 liquid liquid extraction lle lle is one of the most classic pretreatment methods and has been widely used in the analysis of drinking water quality parameters farajzadeh et al 2015 the application of suitable extractants can determine the extract after a short contact time the usepa method adopts lle to analyze dbps in drinking water munch and hautman 1995 serrano et al 2011 reported a modified epa551 1 method using ethyl acetate as the extractant for lle to analyze the concentrations of seven halogenated aldehydes in water using gc ms in order to improve the detection sensitivity a large volume injection 30 μl was used and the ph of the samples was adjusted to 3 2 before analysis in addition the dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme has been developed since 2006 which has the characteristics of simple operation high enrichment factor and low organic solvent consumption campillo et al 2010 dllme method has been proven to extract haloanisoles and halophenols in water with the desirable lods below their otcs ma et al 2012 although lle is a reliable analytical method its application in the analysis of chlor am ination derived odor with low otcs is still limited in water it is necessary to find a suitable extractant or derivatizing agent to solve the problem 3 2 2 purge and trap method p t p t is a commonly used pretreatment method that can be combined with gc or gc ms to detect odor substances through using inert gas to purge out the volatile components in the sample and then useing the trap containing the adsorbent to adsorbe the purged organic substances ueta et al 2015 the method has high extraction efficiency of the analyte so as to improve the sensitivity of detection a previous study has shown that the combination of p t and gc ms can determine volatile organic compounds in water with lod at ng l ueta et al 2015 at present there are a few studies using the p t method to directly extracte disinfection derived odor substances from water samples 3 2 3 solid phase microextraction spme spme is the most frequently reported sample extraction or pre enrichment technique reported methods for the detection of typical odor substances based on spme combined with different instruments are summarized in table 3 the spme method uses a fiber membrane coated with an extraction phase a liquid polymer or solid adsorbent to extract different types of analytes volatile or non volatile substances from a variety of media liquid or gas phases callejón et al 2016 after reaching the adsorption equilibrium the analyte concentration in the sample is proportional to the concentration extracted on the fiber membrane convection and stirring are commonly used to shorten the equilibrium time for sample extraction the spme method is easy to handle and can considerably reduce environmental pollution from the use of organic solvents with lods as low as ng l alpendurada 2000 the spme method can be performed by direct immersion di spme into the liquid sample or by the headspace method hs spme that is more frequently used portillo castillo et al 2018 díaz et al 2005 used hs spme and gc ms to detect trihaloanisole in water with optimized spme extraction conditions results showed that the polydimethylsiloxane pdms extraction membrane could detect haloanisoles with the lods at 0 03 0 25 ng l below the otcs chen et al 2013 established the hs spme gc ms analytical method for the detection of ten odor substances and reported that the divinylbenzene carbon pdms dvb car pdms extraction membrane could achieve the best enrichment of odor substance with lods at 0 1 73 0 ng l it is limited in the extraction of halophenols which could be sovled by adding derivatization agents such as acetic anhydride pizarro et al 2007 meanwhile the operation steps to adapt to different situations such as different solvent types also need to be further developed and optimized to improve the extraction efficiency and accuracy of the results 3 2 4 stir bar sorptive extraction sbse sbse is a new sample pretreatment method baltussen et al 1999 using a stir bar with a specific fiber coating to stir and contact the sample solution after the target substances in the sample are adsorbed on the fiber coating the fiber is sent to gc ms for analysis and determination sbse can be used to extract a large volume of solution and the extracted target substance can be fixed by the adsorption material in the stir bar for sufficient time 45 min bringing convenience to field sampling and transportation nakamura et al 2001 the coating adsorption material on the surface of the stir bar is the key of applying the sbse method application at presently pdms is the widely used material in sbse method but it has limitations for the extraction of polar components callejón et al 2016 the application of sbse mehtod to detect musty odor substances in water has been reported with good performance table 3 4 control strategies of chlor am ination derived odor substances the removal methods of odor substances generated in drinking water treatment processes are one of the research hotspots in the field of drinking water safety ensurance chestnutt et al 2007 studies have shown that the traditional processes in dwtps have unsatisfactory removal efficiency of odor substances in drinking water meunier et al 2006 with the development of analysis technology and control method research on the removal of drinking water odor substances has gradually developed according to the source and type of odor substances the control methods include 1 prevention of the intrusion or formation of odor substances 2 removal of odor substances qian et al 2018 the main prevention method is to control the source of odors on the other hand it is necessary to adopt corresponding treatment methods to remove the odor substances that are present a few treatment methods have been applied to effectively remove water odor substances such as adsorption chemical oxidation and various combined technologies which will be futher illustrated in the following 4 1 adsorption method activated carbon ac is a kind of porous adsorption material with large specific surface area and satisfactory removal rate for most odor substances matsui et al 2014 commonly used ac adsorbents include powder ac pac granular ac gac and ac fiber acf among them pac adsorption method is widely used to remove odor substances in drinking water kim and bae 2007 previous studies have reported the usage of pac and gac for the adsorption of gsm 2 mib halophenols 2 4 6 tca and other odor substances in water and the residual odor substances after adsorption are all below their otcs hamdaoui and naffrechoux 2007 huang et al 2019 matsui et al 2015 the micropores of pac are considered to be an important indicator for the adsorption of odor compounds pelekani and snoeyink 1999 their study has shown that when the average pore size is larger than 8 å better adsorption performance for atrazine and nom can be achieved however the presence of dissolved organic carbon doc in water can compete with some odor substances for pac adsorption and the residual chlorine in the water would also reduce the adsorption capacity of pac kim and bae 2007 moreover qian et al 2018 used five different gacs for the adsorption of chi3 and found that fibrous carbon exhibited the best adsorption efficiency the adsorption isotherm fitted well to the freundlich model however the adsorption capacity is affected by water matrix and the characteristics of nom moreover additional regeneration of the adsorbents are required to maintain satisfactory adsorption capacity 4 2 chemical oxidation adding oxidants or using advanced oxidation processes aops can destroy the structure of odor substances to achieve efficient removal guo et al 2016b jung et al 2004 kim et al 1997 a study has reported effectively remove of chlorine derived odor substances such as 2 4 dcp using potassium permanganate kmno4 he et al 2010 peter and von gunten 2007 studied ozone oxidation to remove odor substances in drinking water including 2 4 6 tca 2 4 6 tba etc and found that haloanisoles have poor reactivity with o3 compared with ozonation alone ozone catalysis with aluminumoxides can significantly enhance the removal of tca through the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh qi et al 2009 because pre ozonation can reduce the concentration of monomers of amino acids in water it can be a feasible method to control the formation of n chloroaldimines from amino acids during chlorine disinfection bond et al 2011 it has been reported that the combination of ozonation and biological ac processes o3 bac can significantly improve the degradation efficiency of odor dbp precursors yang et al 2017 this method mainly based on the rapid decomposition of o3 to produce free radicals combining with bac to achieve oxidation and adsorption of odor substances wang et al 2014 although the o3 bac process showed satisfactory results for the removal of odor substances it also increased the cost of water purification process ultraviolet uv or ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops have been proven to be effective processes to remove odor substances and to control the formation of dbps luo et al 2016 chang et al 2011 a study reported that iodoform can be completely degraded within 20 min at ph 7 0 in the uv chlorine process wang et al 2017 moreover there are also several studies reporting the removal of haloanisoles using uv aops zhang et al 2020 because the free radicals generated in uv aops possess strong oxidizing ability these processes exhibit excellent degradation efficiency on odor substances derived from drinking water disinfection with the development of analysis technologies and control methods research on the removal of drinking water odor substances has gradually developed according to the types and sources of odor compounds the control strategies of chlor am ination derived odor compounds mainly include prevention of source water pollution and optimization of water purification processes control strategies such as adsorption method chemical oxidation method and combination of different processes have their own advantages and disadvantages for the removal of odor future study could consider the coordinated treatment of water sources water plants and pipe networks to achieve effective control of the chlor am ination derived odor problems in drinking water and provide safe and high quality drinking water to the consumers 5 conclusions and the way forward this study is the first review of odors derived from drinking water disinfection water supply is a systematic project and disinfection processes involve multiple steps such as chlor am ination in dwtps secondary chlorine replenishment in the pipe network and the maintenance of residual chlorine at the end of pipe lines both the disinfectants and the odor derived from disinfection would affect the quality of drinking water free chlorine monochloramine dichloramine and trichloramine have chlorine odor and the odor intensity would change during the conversion of different species of residual chlorine the most commonly reported disinfection derived organic odor substances include haloanisole n chloroaldimines iodotrihalomethane and halophenols because disinfectant derived odor substances have extremely low otcs but high volatilization and they are present in water at low concentrations it is difficult to accurately identify and quantify them in order to have deeper perceptions of chlor am ination derived odor several important topics related to chlor am ination derived odors are suggested to be further studied in future work first the strong chlorine odor in tap water may be the caused by the combination of monochloramine and dichloramine or even trichloramine disinfectants reacting with nom in water can easily produce halogenated derivatives with odor such as haloanisole n chloroaldimines etc however with the mixed chlorine species in the actual water supply systems there is still a lack of research focusing on the odor caused by the conversion of different forms of residual disinfectants moreover the contributions of disinfectants and their derivatives to the odor of water can also be further studied processes second the relationship between water quality parameters such as ph and nom and the chlor am ination derived odor substances could be predicted and the seasonal changes of different odor substances haloanisole n chloroaldimines i thms etc are also worth attention therefore it is meaningful to explore the relationship between various water quality parameters and disinfection derived odor problems using data driven analysis to evaluate the formation potential and health risks related to drinking water odors can be useful to establish theoretical models to evaluate the effectiveness of future water treatment processes most of the research regarding the removal of odor substances focused on algae derived odors gsm and 2 mib among various control strategies aops have high reaction performance and kinetics however there are rare studies focused on the reduction of chlor am ination derived odor substances and their related toxicity assessment a few studies have mentioned that the intermediates formed in the degradation processes might also affect the quality of drinking water and even certain intermediates may cause off flavour in water it is worth exploring in depth to reduce the chlor am ination derived odor substances through the regulation of disinfection methods and the improvement of control strategies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this study was supported in part by the national natural science foundation of china nos 51778444
