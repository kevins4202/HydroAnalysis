to the diverse oxidation states different arsenic species are known i e as 3 as 5 as 0 and as 3 1 the major arsenic concentration can be found in the sulfide deposits igneous and sedimentary rocks soil and water 2 inorganic arsenic is known as a highly toxic and the longtime exposure to it is harmful that may results in chronic arsenic poisoning 3 5 the breakdown of rocks and the leaching of arsenic from solid to the aqueous media are major contributors of arsenic distribution in the environment 6 7 the use of contaminated water for drinking cooking and the irrigation of edible crops increases the hazardous effects on communal health and environment 8 12 according to who report over 200 people in the world are exposed to the high level of arsenic in drinking water than prescribed

coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms thermo scientific c jt jar tester chang shin scientific co korea was used for the batch experiments analytical thermometer was used to record the temperature sevencompact ph meter mettler toledo china was used to measure the solution ph followed by adsorption experiments the collected samples were filtered with 47 mm gf c filter what man 1 2 μm pore size and then analyzed with icp ms the morphology of synthesized particles was studied with hitachi su 70 field emission scanning electron micrograph sem and the elemental composition was analyzed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds 2 3 batch experiments the adsorption efficiency of the magnetite particles was assessed by batch equilibrium method 1 g of magnetite particles was introduced into the arsenate solutions of different concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 60 mg l the adsorption samples were kept on stirring for consecutive 24 h the temperature ph and the shaking speed were maintained constant at 22 2 c 6 5 0 1 and 250 rpm respectively the ph of the arsenate solution was adjusted by adding either 0 1 n naoh or 0 1 n hcl the amount of arsenate adsorbed q and arsenate removal efficiency of magnetite particles were determined from the following equations 1 q c i c e m v 2 r e m o v a l c i c e c i 100 where q ci ce v and m represents the amount of arsenate adsorbed on magnetite particles mg g the initial arsenate concentration mg l the final arsenate concentration mg l volume of the arsenate solution l and amount of the magnetite particles g respectively the adsorption data of magnetite particles was fitted into the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models to determine the adsorption behavior the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are given below a langmuir model 3 c e q e 1 q m a x k l c e q m a x freundlich model 4 ln q e 1 n l n c e l n k f where qmax denotes the maximum adsorption capacity mg g kl is the langmuir constant l mg 1 n and kf are the freundlich constants the effect of contact time on the adsorption was examined by adding 1 g of magnetite into 10 mg l initial concentration of arsenate solution followed by startup samples were collected 24 times at different time intervals ranging from 1 min to 3 h the role of ph and the ionic strength of the solution during adsorption is also studied adsorption experiments were performed by varying the ph of the solution between 2 and 11 and keeping the initial arsenate concentration and magnetite quantity constant at 10 mg l and 1 g respectively the ph drift method was applied to determine the point of zero charge pzc and the ionic strength of the solution was varied by adding nacl into the arsenate solution the adsorption efficiency of magnetite particles used in batch experiments was reinstated with regeneration of used particles for 4 h with 0 2 n naoh solution 2 4 reactors operation two column reactors having 40 cm height and 2 cm inner diameter were operated with upward and downward influent flow direction respectively for the column operated with upward influent flow glass beads having 1 5 mm diameter were filled up to 10 cm height from the column base then the column was filled with the magnetite particles up to 30 cm height the remaining upper part of column 10 cm in height was also packed with glass beads the magnetite bed height packing volume and filled weight of magnetite were 20 cm 62 83 cm3 and 144 51 g respectively the influent flowrate and empty bed contact time ebct were adjusted at 2 09 ml min and 0 5 h respectively for the column reactor fed from top to bottom glass beads were filled in only lower section of column and the height of magnetite bed was reduced to 15 cm the packing volume and filled weight of magnetite were 47 12 cm3 and 108 38 g respectively the remaining upper part of column 15 cm in height was kept empty to provide a settling time for the influent the sensors were installed in upper section of column to maintain the flowrate the influent flow rate and the empty bed contact time ebct were adjusted at 1 60 0 15 ml min and 0 5 h respectively the plug flow reactor is one of the simplest configuration among the continuous reactors where the adsorbent is dispersed in the reactor and the influent is pumped with a specific flowrate the reactor used in this study was composed of eight elongated rectangular tubes arranged in horizontal order the area determined for single tube is 56 cm2 making total area of reactor 448 cm2 the magnetite particles were dispersed inside the tubes to control the movement of fine magnetite particles meshes 1 μm were installed inside the tubes influent was introduced into the reactor from the left side of topmost tube and allowed to pass through all the tubes the effluent was dropped from the right side of lowermost tube the total weight of magnetite particles and influent flowrate were maintained 144 51 g and 2 09 ml min respectively the arsenate concentration in an influent of column and plug flow reactors was 100 μg l based on reactor operations entire operation was divided in two phases the columns with upward feed direction downward feed direction and plug flow reactor were initially operated for 49 days later only the column with upward feed direction and plug flow reactor were operated for extended period of 47 days due to the malfunctioning of sensors the column operated with downward feed direction was stopped after phase 1 the schematic design of operated reactors is shown in fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized magnetite particles fig 2 a shows the diffraction peaks for the magnetite particles synthesized with co precipitation method the diffraction peaks observed at the 2θ degree of 29 92 35 36 43 22 53 53 57 10 and 62 69 represented the crystalline planes of magnetite 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 respectively the obtained spectra was appeared in fine agreement with the standard xrd pattern for magnetite jcpds 19 0629 moreover previous studies also confirmed the same xrd pattern 28 29 the sharp peaks shows the high crystallinity of magnetite the crystalline size of the magnetite particles is estimated with scherrer equation that is 5 dp k λ b c o s θ where λ b θ and k are the x ray wavelength 1 5406 full width at half maximum fwhm corresponding bragg angle and scherrer constant respectively considering the highest intensity peak at 35 36 the estimated particle size was found 7 4 nm the particle size can also be controlled by varying ph during co precipitation another study reported 11 nm size for magnetite particles synthesized at higher ph conditions 30 the ftir pattern for the magnetite particles is given in fig 2b the adsorption band at 3140 cm 1 and 1630 cm 1 indicates stretching mode of vibrations and symmetric bending mode of vibrations for oh group respectively 31 the specific characteristic of magnetite is appeared at 552 cm 1 representing feo band 32 morphological examination and the elemental analysis also confirmed the formation of magnetite fig 3 oxygen and the iron the main constituents of magnetite were identified in eds analysis furthermore sem images confirm the structure of the magnetite which was found in consistent with previous study 24 3 2 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherm describes the adsorption capacity and the relationship between adsorbate and the adsorbent the equilibrium data is evaluated by langmuir and freundlich isotherm models and the parameters of both models are presented in table 1 fig 4 a and b show the adsorption isotherm plots based on experimental data both models were found well fit for arsenate adsorption on the surface of magnetite particles however the comparison of regression coefficient r2 criterion for langmuir and freundlich isotherm models suggests that the adsorption is mainly followed by earlier one it is an indication of monolayer adsorption of adsorbate on the surface of adsorbent 33 practically about 9 4 mg of arsenate was adsorbed on the surface of 1 g magnetite that is very close to theoretical value of 9 34 mg g as determine by langmuir isotherm model the initial concentration of arsenate solution has noticeable effect on adsorption capacity and arsenate removal efficiency of magnetite particles the adsorption capacity of magnetite particles was enhanced for the solutions with higher initial concentration of arsenate as compared with the solutions with low initial concentration of arsenate however at higher initial concertation the arsenate removal efficiency of magnetite particles remains at low side at the initial stage of interaction between adsorbent and adsorbate the potential adsorption sites on adsorbent were swiftly covered by adsorbate and later the adsorbate molecules started to diffuse into the interior apertures of the adsorbent the arsenate concentration in the solution and the diffusion rates are interdependent the falling arsenate concentration in the solution causes fall in diffusion rate therefore the system holds an equilibrium state it is noteworthy that the solutions contains higher adsorbate concentration reaches equilibrium state slowly as compared with those having low concentration of adsorbate 34 3 3 adsorption kinetic the adsorption kinetic indicates the necessary time required for adsorption the adsorption kinetic for arsenate is presented in fig 4c it was observed that the adsorption kinetic for arsenate initiates with a rapid escalation in the first 3 4 h followed by a slow adsorption until the system achieved an equilibrium state the adsorption equilibrium was accomplished in 22 h the maximum concentration of arsenate was removed during one tenth of the experiment time the fast adsorption of arsenate by magnetite is possibly credited to the exterior surface adsorption as most of the adsorption vicinities exist on the external surface of the magnetite particles arsenate molecules can easily approach these positions arsenate binds through the formation of monodentate and bidentate complexes at low surface coverage and high surface coverage conditions respectively 34 35 3 4 effect of solution ph and regeneration efficiency the effect of solution ph on adsorption was examined in the range of 2 10 beside the change in solution ph specific concentrations of nacl were also introduced into the solution to determine the effect of ionic strength of the solution on adsorption fig 4d the acidic conditions ph 2 6 were found favorable for reasonable arsenate removal efficiency however at higher ph major decline in arsenate removal efficiency was observed the surface of magnetite remains positive at acidic ph and hence the arsenate molecules have high binding affinity however at higher ph the net surface charge of magnetite remained negative because of higher number of hydroxyl groups on the surface which may results in electrostatic repulsion between adsorbent and adsorbate 29 36 by increasing the ionic strength of the arsenate solution no specific change in arsenate removal efficiency of magnetite was determined as presented in fig 5 a the phpzc for magnetite is determined at 6 35 and found better in agreement with other studies 37 38 followed by the adsorption experiment used particles were regenerated with 0 2 n naoh solution the adsorbed amount of arsenate on magnetite particles was finely leached out with 4 h regeneration time during the regeneration hydroxyl group replaces the arsenate on the magnetite surface and hence the concentration of alkali solution and the contact time play significant role in desorption fig 5b shows the results obtained from five continuous cycles of adsorption desorption for same particles the arsenate removal efficiency of magnetite particles was finely reinstated at the time of first regeneration whereas in following adsorption desorption rounds the adsorption capacity of magnetite particles started to decrease 3 5 reactors operation the adsorption behavior of columns operated with upward and downward influent flow direction respectively and plug flow reactor is presented in fig 6 all the systems were operated at ph 6 5 and the feed water arsenate concentration is maintained at 100 μg l the column operated with upward influent direction was found efficacious to remove almost 100 of arsenate concentration from the influent for the entire period of operation at phase 1 and 2 the arsenate removal efficiency of the column operated with downward influent flow direction phase 1 was appeared 95 5 the plug flow reactor indicated 94 4 arsenate removal efficiency throughout the operation at both phases still the column and plug flow reactors are in operation without any breakthrough the flow rate estimation is a major critical control point in continuous reactors because it is directly related with the contact time any fluctuation in flowrate will have serious effect on adsorption behavior if the flowrate increases the contact time between magnetite and arsenate solution will be short and adsorption will be inadequate as the column reactor fed from top to bottom has low packed bed height and a little fluctuation in flowrate exists due to the uncontrolled gravitational force its arsenate removal efficiency was slightly low as compared with the column reactor fed from bottom to top the most consistent flowrate of column operated with upward flow results in uniform arsenate removal efficiency during the entire operation an estimated duration of reactor operations and the productivity is highlighted in table 2 3 6 adsorption mechanism the possible reaction mechanism for arsenate adsorption onto magnetite surface is presented in fig 7 the adsorption proceeds by an inner sphere ligand exchange between the arsenate and the hydroxyl groups attached with structural fe3 of magnetite generally arsenate ion coordinates with two contiguous structural ferric ions of magnetite it is noteworthy that the exposure of magnetite to the oxygen results in the oxidation of octahedral center of magnetite i e fe ii to the fe iii hence the cation vacancies generates at the octahedral sites therefore according to pauling s principle of the electroneutrality the structure should be stabilized by either electron shift from core of magnetite to oxidized surface or the diffusion of ferrous 39 40 under these conditions the electron transfer happens between iron and arsenic through ligand binding 41 the arsenate adsorption on magnetite caused the discharge of hydroxyl ions the net discharge of hydroxyl ion depends on the surface hydroxylation and the individual net charge of arsenate protonation 42 fig 8 shows the ftir spectra of the reactor particles after the adsorption of arsenate the noticeable reduction in the intensity of hydroxyl bond was appeared at 3140 and 1630 cm 1 the arsenate adsorption on magnetite particles can be a possible reason behind the band shift from higher intensity to low intensity moreover a new bond is also appeared at 632 cm 1 which indicates the asymmetric stretching vibration mode of as oh functional group and is found in fine agreement with an earlier study 43 in conclusion it can be stated that mill scale derived magnetite particles can effectually adsorb arsenate concentration from contaminated water in long term operation and have practical applicability 4 conclusion in this study magnetite particles were synthesized from mill scale and evaluated for the arsenate adsorption the particles were characterized with sem eds xrd and ftir about 7 4 nm crystalline size of magnetite particle was determined by scherrer equation the arsenate removal efficiency of magnetite particles is evaluated on the basis of results obtained from batch adsorption experiments and three types of continuous reactors i e column reactor fed from bottom to top column reactor fed from top to bottom and plug flow reactor the point of zero charge and maximum adsorption capacity were determined 6 35 and 9 34 mg g respectively the adsorption equilibrium was well illustrated by langmuir isotherm model as compared with freundlich isotherm model which shows the monomolecular layer adsorption on the surface of the adsorbent the column reactor fed with bottom to top indicated almost 100 arsenate removal efficiency during entire operation while the arsenate removal efficiency for the column reactor fed from top to bottom and plug flow reactor was 95 and 94 respectively the particles used in batch experiments were finely regenerated with 0 2 n naoh for 4 h this study proposed mill scale derived magnetite particles as an effective and economical arsenate adsorbent that

capacity of magnetite particles started to decrease 3 5 reactors operation the adsorption behavior of columns operated with upward and downward influent flow direction respectively and plug flow reactor is presented in fig 6 all the systems were operated at ph 6 5 and the feed water arsenate concentration is maintained at 100 μg l the column operated with upward influent direction was found efficacious to remove almost 100 of arsenate concentration from the influent for the entire period of operation at phase 1 and 2 the arsenate removal efficiency of the column operated with downward influent flow direction phase 1 was appeared 95 5 the plug flow reactor indicated 94 4 arsenate removal efficiency throughout the operation at both phases still the column and plug flow reactors are in operation without any breakthrough the flow rate estimation is a major critical control point in continuous reactors because it is directly related with the contact time any fluctuation in flowrate will have serious effect on adsorption behavior if the flowrate increases the contact time between magnetite and arsenate solution will be short and adsorption will be inadequate as the column reactor fed from top to bottom has low packed bed height and a little fluctuation in flowrate exists due to the uncontrolled gravitational force its arsenate removal efficiency was slightly low as compared with the column reactor fed from bottom to top the most consistent flowrate of column operated with upward flow results in uniform arsenate removal efficiency during the entire operation an estimated duration of reactor operations and the productivity is highlighted in table 2 3 6 adsorption mechanism the possible reaction mechanism for arsenate adsorption onto magnetite surface is presented in fig 7 the adsorption proceeds by an inner sphere ligand exchange between the arsenate and the hydroxyl groups attached with structural fe3 of magnetite generally arsenate ion coordinates with two contiguous structural ferric ions of magnetite it is noteworthy that the exposure of magnetite to the oxygen results in the oxidation of octahedral center of magnetite i e fe ii to the fe iii hence the cation vacancies generates at the octahedral sites therefore according to pauling s principle of the electroneutrality the structure should be stabilized by either electron shift from core of magnetite to oxidized surface or the diffusion of ferrous 39 40 under these conditions the electron transfer happens between iron and arsenic through ligand binding 41 the arsenate adsorption on magnetite caused the discharge of hydroxyl ions the net discharge of hydroxyl ion depends on the surface hydroxylation and the individual net charge of arsenate protonation 42 fig 8 shows the ftir spectra of the reactor particles after the adsorption of arsenate the noticeable reduction in the intensity of hydroxyl bond was appeared at 3140 and 1630 cm 1 the arsenate adsorption on magnetite particles can be a possible reason behind the band shift from higher intensity to low intensity moreover a new bond is also appeared at 632 cm 1 which indicates the asymmetric stretching vibration mode of as oh functional group and is found in fine agreement with an earlier study 43 in conclusion it can be stated that mill scale derived magnetite particles can effectually adsorb arsenate concentration from contaminated water in long term operation and have practical applicability 4 conclusion in this study magnetite particles were synthesized from mill scale and evaluated for the arsenate adsorption the particles were characterized with sem eds xrd and ftir about 7 4 nm crystalline size of magnetite particle was determined by scherrer equation the arsenate removal efficiency of magnetite particles is evaluated on the basis of results obtained from batch adsorption experiments and three types of continuous reactors i e column reactor fed from bottom to top column reactor fed from top to bottom and plug flow reactor the point of zero charge and maximum adsorption capacity were determined 6 35 and 9 34 mg g respectively the adsorption equilibrium was well illustrated by langmuir isotherm model as compared with freundlich isotherm model which shows the monomolecular layer adsorption on the surface of the adsorbent the column reactor fed with bottom to top indicated almost 100 arsenate removal efficiency during entire operation while the arsenate removal efficiency for the column reactor fed from top to bottom and plug flow reactor was 95 and 94 respectively the particles used in batch experiments were finely regenerated with 0 2 n naoh for 4 h this study proposed mill scale derived magnetite particles as an effective and economical arsenate adsorbent that can be applied in the regions having high arsenate concentration in groundwater acknowledgements this work was supported by development of eco smart waterworks system program by the ministry of

14451,the aerobic treatment technologies such as membrane bioreactor mbr and sequential batch reactor sbr fail to address the techno economic challenges of a small scale household greywater gw

among the commonly available aerobic treatment technologies membrane bioreactor mbr is a viable option for gw treatment mbr has overcome the key challenges faced by conventional aerobic systems such as activated sludge acs and the sequential batch reactor sbr in the following manner i sludge bulking and foaming has no negative impact on the operation of mbr and effluent quality ii the micropores

cognizance that the treated water will most probably be used for secondary purposes such as toilet flushing gardening car washing etc such enduses defeats the purpose of treatment to such a high level as in mbr for a very low priority use and thus tilts the economic balance of the treatment towards lower cost complexity based options an alternative to mbr is the macroporous membrane bioreactor mmbr with membrane pore sizes ranging from 5 to 200 μm manufactured from commonly available materials such as nylon dacron polypropylene etc 12 13 the macroporous membrane also called as mesh carries out the dual roles of acting as a filter to screen particulates larger than its pore sizes and yet supports the growth of biofilm that can simultaneously degrade the chemical compounds present in gw unlike an mbr that mainly acts as a physical barrier to the suspended and dissolved solids 14 the bioreactors operating on mmbr concepts have been referred to in the literature as self forming dynamic membrane dynamic membrane bioreactor submerged non woven bioreactor mesh filter activated sludge mesh filter membrane bioreactor etc and have been primarily used in the treatment of municipal sewage and low strength wastewater 12 13 15 17 these research have established a proof of mmbr concept however these need establishing a taxonomic microbiological and physical bases to broaden the potential of mmbr technology to other types of wastewater such as gw the optimum performance of mmbr is driven by several inadequately established bio physical factors that need further exploration such as the nature of mf biofilm formation and sloughing on the effluent flux frequency of mesh cleaning required for optimum functioning orientation and position of mf within the reactor and its simultaneous impact on the biofouling effluent quality and flux contribution of mesh biofilm in the degradation of compounds endurance of mf biofilm to withstand recalcitrant and anti microbial components in gw syntrophic interactions between the microbial communities in the sludge and mf biofilm etc this research addresses many of the above said challenges that are as follows i design and optimize the performance of mmbr fed with gw containing high concentrations of hcps and compare its performance with a conventional sbr the mmbr constitutes a macroporous mf submerged in aerobic bioreactor ii elucidate the impact of mf pore sizes 50 μm and 100 μm depth of submergence and its orientation vertical and horizontal on the effluent quality and flux iii study the microbial communities proliferating in the gw fed reactors divergence in microbial community structure between the suspended sludge and mf biofilm and their subsequent role on the operation of mmbr 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup the bioreactors mmbrs and sbr with a working volume of 50 litres were fabricated in commercial polyethylene drums the operation of sbr was modified to combine the fill and withdraw steps both the steps happen simultaneously wherein wastewater is fed through the bottom of the reactor leading to the spill over of treated water from the outlet present at the top of the reactor e g outflow is combined with inflow the bioreactors were operated in 6 cycles per day each cycle of 4 h containing 60 min feeding 30 min idle 120 min react 30 min idle fed in an up flow mode at a feed rate of 138 2 ml min for 60 min the bioreactors were fed with a synthetically prepared feed resembling a typical household gw containing edible starch 0 3 g l laundry detergent 0 3 g l liquid handwash 0 15 g l urea 0 05 g l kh2po4 0 01 g l diluted with tap water the bioreactors were operated at hrt of 1 day average organic loading rate olr of 550 mgcod l day the mf was composed of commercial grade nylon mesh with two different pore sizes 50 μm and 100 μm mounted on a perforated cylindrical pvc pipe acting as a saddle fig 1 4 and bundled together to form an mf module supplementary data 1 the 50 and 100 μm mesh modules were submerged in the bioreactors in two different orientations namely vertical and horizontal the bioreactor was made up of commercially available cylindrical plastic barrels 60 cm length 42 cm diameter of 85 litres holding capacity effective working volume of 50 litres overall four different mmbr configuration were fabricated namely 50 μm mf in a vertical orientation 50 vmr 50 μm mf in a horizontal orientation 50 hmr 100 μm mf in a vertical orientation 100 vmr 100 μm mf in a horizontal orientation 100 hmr fig 1 3 the 50 vmr 50 hmr and 100 vmr mesh modules contained six mf each of 22 cm length 7 5 cm diameter whereas 100 hmr mesh module contained four mf each of 15 5 cm length 11 cm diameter fig 1 and 2 the effective total filtration surface area of the mf modules in all the mmbrs was maintained at 0 2 m2 the discharge of permeate through the mf was driven by gravity controlled by shut off on off pneumatic solenoid valve placed outside the bioreactor the pneumatic solenoid valve opened 6 times within 2 h of the react phase at equal intervals the flux m3 m2 h was determined manually by measuring the volume of effluent discharged within the time period of valve opening the duration of the valve opening was adjusted daily based on the flux measurement in one complete cycle 6 times within 2 h of react phase to maintain the hrt at 1 day in a general perspective an increase in biofouling of the mf would simultaneously lead to the reduction in flux hence the duration of valve opening was simultaneously adjusted e g increased decreased to ensure an hrt of 1 day in each reactor an air pump placed outside the bioreactor supplied air underneath the mf modules through a ceramic diffuser at an airflow rate of 2 2 2 5 lpm the diffuser was placed underneath the mf to ensure air scouring of the mf to reduce the biofilm thickness each mf was fitted with an air injection pipe aip through which 10 lpm air was injected for a duration of 2 min to dislodge the inhabited biofilm layer on the mfs 2 2 water analysis the water analysis was conducted as per the apha awwa wef 18 the following tests were conducted namely chemical oxygen demand cod titrimetrically by closed reflux micro digestion ph total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss anionic surfactants expressed as methylene blue active substances mbas the turbidity of untreated and treated water samples was analyzed in hach 2100q turbidity meter the dissolved oxygen concentration in the reactors was maintained between 1 5 2 mg l and periodically monitored using galvanic do sensor ysi pro plus the influent and effluent samples of mmbr s were monitored throughout the study period e g 4 5 days week for the change in cod ph turbidity and flux 2 3 microbial analysis the microbial samples were collected from 50 vmr and 50 hmr operating at their steady state the biofilm samples were scraped from the top 50 vt middle 50 vm and bottom 50 vb region of 50 vmr mf along with a grab sample of the suspended sludge v ss from the reactor in the case of 50 hmr biofilm samples were scraped from the mid region of the 6 different mf namely 50 hmr 1 to 50 hmr 6 respectively in addition to the grab sample of suspended sludge h ss the samples were immediately packaged in dry ice and shipped to the university of nebraska unl lincoln usa for molecular analysis the dna was extracted from the samples using mo bio powersoil dna isolation kit followed by purification using onestep pcr inhibitor removal kit zymo research as per the prescribed protocols the quantity and quality of dna were estimated in a nanodrop 2000c spectrometer prior to the pcr amplification of 16srrna sequences with the forward primer 27 f and reverse primer 1492r 19 the amplified dna samples were verified in 0 8 agarose gel electrophoresis prior to the sequencing in an illumina miseq platform at the environmental sample preparation and sequencing facility espsf at argonne national laboratory il usa the forward primer 515 f reverse primer 806r along with the sequencer adapter were used to amplify the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene in the domains bacteria and archaea 20 the v4 region sequences were processed using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime software package installed on the linux platform of the supercomputing facilities at the holland computing centre unl the data were analyzed using the default bioinformatics software package included within qiime 21 the 16srrna gene copies were estimated using qpcr techniques in a mastercycler thermocycler eppendorf international germany the 16srrna gene primer was procured from invitrogen the usa as per the sequence described in suzuki et al 22 the kicqstart sybr green qpcr ready mix sigma aldrich accompanying the primers were subjected to three step template amplification followed by melting curve analysis steps as per the prescribed protocol an internally prepared stock qpcr standard of 16srrna gene ranging from 10 108 copies 20 μl was used to generate a standard curve the linear range of the standard curve determined the lower and higher detection limit of the 16srrna gene 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor studies the treatment of gw in mmbr is a low cost less complex alternative to the mbr and is suited for small scale decentralized treatment it combines biodegradation of compounds with the simultaneous separation of particulates from the treated water using mf the mmbrs such as 100 vmr 100 hmr 50 vmr 50 hmr achieved an average cod removal of 91 90 88 83 respectively throughout the study period table 1 on the other hand the sbr required 40 days to attain a steady state thereafter it was able to mineralize 87 of the total cod at similar loading rates the marginally higher cod removal achieved by mmbrs may be attributed to the biofilms formed on the mfs the cod removal was and marginally higher in 100 μm mmbrs over 50 μm mmbrs irrespective of the filter orientations indicating that 50 μm pore mesh does not offer any significant advantages in cod removal over the larger 100 μm pore mesh table 1 on a long term operational perspective sbr can achieve nearly similar cod reductions in comparison to the mf albeit with higher effluent turbidity without any complications related to filter clogging and filter cleaning the removal of 470 490 mg l d cod required a retention time of 1 day which was significantly lower with respect to sbr fed with sewage that can generally achieve cod removal 1000 mg l d 23 the lower rates of cod removal 2 3 times in comparison to the aerobic reactors sbr and activated sludge reported in various literatures is attributed to the relatively higher concentration of anionic surfactants e g 45 mg l in the gw feed 2 times higher than the reported inhibitory levels 24 25 higher concentration of surfactants especially originating from laundry have been reported to create mass transfer limitations of nutrients in the sludge and biofilm simultaneously reducing the rates of our and nitrification 26 27 the treated water discharged by 100 hmr had the lowest average turbidity of 29 ntu with a reduction of 56 fig 6 the effluent turbidity of 100 vmr and 50 vmr was significantly higher and did not reduce below 30 ntu with an average reduction by 14 and 11 respectively figs 6 and 7 the sbr discharged an effluent with an average turbidity of 30 60 ntu and in comparison to the mmbrs it was higher than 100 hmr and lower than 100 vmr 50 hmr 50 vmr fig 5 the vertical orientation of mfs 100 vmr 50 vmr showed around 40 higher flux relative to the horizontally placed mfs 100 hmr especially during the start of operation e g day 0 a gradual reduction in flux was an indicator of a simultaneous increase in biofilm thickness on the mfs the reduction in flux was more severe in 100 hmr hence it was air flushed on 5 different occasions to dislodge the biofilm layer whereas in 100 vmr air flushing was evaded due to insignificant clogging fig 6 marked in red arrows in fig 6 and 8 the sharp drop in flux is attributed to the proliferation of biofilm layer on the mf that could be easily dislodged by air flushing resulting in an immediate increase in flux whereas a relative increase in effluent turbidity after a certain period of reactor operation is attributed to the erosion of biofilm from the mfs the 50 vmr was air flushed on 27th day due to reduction in flux fig 8 however air flushing was deliberately avoided on 60th day despite showing a reduction in flux to study the long term effect of biofouling on the effluent cod turbidity and simultaneously estimate the time required to attain a 0 flux due to complete blockage of the mesh surface the results showed a comparatively slower reduction in flux from 0 4 in the 60th day to 0 m3 m 2 d 1 90th day during these periods days 60 90 the effluent cod and ph values were insignificant with respect to the days days 10 59 however it exhibited an increase in turbidity leading to 5 turbidity reduction a common feature observed in all the mf was a spike in effluent turbidity with a simultaneous reduction in flux mainly attributed to the erosion of biofilm from the mesh surfaces beyond a threshold level of thickness notably the days before air flushing shows this typical behavior of high effluent turbidity with the lowest flux marked in red arrows in fig 6 and 8 however continuous erosion of biofilm from the 100 vmr mf exhibited a relatively higher and no significant change in effluent flux and turbidity throughout its operation the above results show that horizontal mfs were more amenable to a reduction in flux due to biofouling with respect to the vertical mf it can be hypothesized that the permeate flow happens in the direction of gravity therefore accumulates comparatively higher suspended microbes and biofilm in a horizontal mf setup whereas in vertical mf the movement of permeate is perpendicular to both the mf and gravity therefore attracting comparatively lesser suspended bacteria on its surface fig 4 according to the basic physical law the pressure is constant across the horizontal cross section and increases with the depth of water therefore the water column pressure in horizontal mf would remain nearly constant across its cross sectional surface whereas in vertical mf the pressure would gradually increase along the depth of the mf these pressure differences in both horizontal and vertical orientation mf in mmbr may be attributed to simultaneously affect the flux biofouling and turbidity it can also be argued that 100 vmr would be ideal as it does not clog rapidly in comparison to 100 hmr however its relatively higher turbidity e g averaged 54 ntu outweighs the lower maintenance advantages of using vertically mounted submerged mf to understand the effect of water column height on the mf six mf were placed at different submerged depth in horizontal alignment inside the reactor 50 hmr each mf would therefore experience different levels of water head pressure with an increase toward the bottom the bottommost placed mf 50 hmr 1 and 50 hmr 2 had the lowest fluxes in comparison to the above ones indicating that an increase in pressure enhances the rates of biofouling the mf 50 hmr 1 to 50 hmr 6 discharged effluents with comparatively lower turbidity i e 56 62 ntu in the initial 20 days and thereafter an increase in turbidity i e 106 113 ntu was synchronous with the reduction in flux showing a distinctive characteristic of biofilm washout from the mf figs 9 and 10 after 50th day the effluent turbidity remained significantly higher irrespective of the submerged depth of the mf without any significant impacts on cod removal and ph continual erosion of biofilm from the surfaces of 50 hmr filters 50 hmr 1 to 6 led to an increase in effluent turbidity 31 35 with respect to the influent overall the horizontal placement of 50 μm mf was least effective in reducing the effluent turbidity hence results were contrary to the known hypothesis of reduction in effluent turbidity due to a simultaneous reduction in mesh pore sizes 28 3 2 microbial phylogenetics the proximate analysis of the effluent samples provide a skewed understanding of the mmbr behavior and fail to advance the syntrophic and metabolic interactions driving the reactor performances the above said shortcomings were addressed through metagenomic analysis of the microbiota inhabiting the 50 hmr and 50 vmr reactors respectively the phylogenetic analysis shows significant differences in microbial abundance and diversity within i e intra the reactor biofilm and suspended sludge and also between i e inter the 50 hmr and 50 vmr fig 11 the species under the phylum proteobacteria was prominent across the reactors and mf the 50 hmr reactor was dominated by phylum proteobacteria followed by synergistetes verrumicrobia actinobacteria chloroflexi etc whereas in 50 vmr the phylum proteobacteria was followed by bacteroidetes acidobacteria spirochetes verrumicrobia etc the acidobacteria phylum had a relatively lower presence in 50 hmr fig 11 the genera pleomorphomonas was the dominating species in all the samples except for 50 vm 50 vb 50 hmr 1 dominated by unclassified uc family of order bacteroidales and 50 hmr 3 dominated by genera vadinca02 the 50 vss has the highest gene copies otus si and fpd fig 12 and supplementary data 2 moreover the vertical mf contained higher gene copies otus si and fpd diversities with respect to horizontal mf indicating that the vertical positioning of the filters would be a better suited over horizontal position due to higher microbial population and diversity fig 12 and supplementary data 2 these results contrasted with the proximate analysis that showed relatively higher rates of biofouling and cod removal in horizontal mf over vertical mf fig 6 and 7 therefore higher rates of biofouling do not necessarily indicate high species population and diversity the continuous erosion of biofilm from the surface of vertical mfs resulting in higher effluent turbidity is analogous to biofilms subjected to high hydrodynamic shear stress a frequent erosion of the top biofilm layer due to hydrodynamic shear enhances the accessibility of nutrients and oxygen to the underneath layers resulting in higher species population and diversity 29 31 a similar phenomenon is attributed to prevail in vertical mfs notably the 50 hss and 50 vss possess higher gene copies otus d fpd than their respective mf biofilms indicating a comparatively higher microbial population and diversity in the ss over the biofilms whereas the microbes inhabiting the mf biofilms are selective and evenly distributed these results substantiate the above findings table 1 that mf biofilm has a relatively minor contribution in cod removal with respect to the ss the middle region of mf both in 50 hmr 50 hmr 4 and 50 vmr 50 vm had a comparatively higher microbial population and diversity when compared to the remaining parts of their mf respectively this shows that mounting the mf in the mid region of the reactors would be beneficial to enhance the microbial population that could simultaneously enhance the biodegradation of compounds the pcoa of the microbial communities supplementary data 3 showed significantly distinct clusters of microbial diversity between the 50 hmr and 50 vmr the samples from 50 hmr excluding 50 hmr 2 were clustered closer showing similarities between the microbial communities the communities in 50 hmr 2 were distantly placed from the cluster that can be attributed to the phylum proteobacteria and verrumicrobia representing 32 and 30 population respectively whereas in other mf proteobacteria represented 60 of the phylum along with verrumicrobia populations 5 moreover 50 hmr 2 mf exhibited the lowest flux and turbidity among the 50 hmr mfs indicating the formation of a rigid biofilm layer comparatively less amenable to erosion as evident in the rest of 50 hmr mfs though operated under similar conditions these ambiguities in the behavior of mfs cannot be ignored however will be the subject for future studies these changes were however not reflected in 50 hmr 1 considering that 50 hmr 1 was positioned below 50 hmr 2 this phenomenon would therefore need further research the microbial communities present in the 50 vmr were similar and clustered closer whereas communities in the 50 vss were different from the others the differences in microbial population and communities inhabiting the suspended sludge and the mf biofilms can be attributed to the mass transfer limitations of substrates nutrients and oxygen through the mf biofilm moreover higher otu 16srrna and sp in the 50 vss over the mfs biofilms can be discerned from the differences observed in the pcoa plots the dominating species across the reactors non chronologically belonged to the genera pleomorphomonas vadin ca02 leucobacter xanthobacter agrobacterium desulfovibrio phenylobacterium limnohabitans sja 88 heteroc45 4w uc genera of family enterobacteriaceae rhodobacteraceae aeromonadaceae anaerolinaceae veillonellaceae holophagaceae rhodospirillaceae aeromonadaceae caulobacteraceae wchb1 25 uc family of order bacteroidales rhizobiales sja 36 ld1 pb3 many of the above said species have been reported to degrade and metabolize the recalcitrant hcps commonly found in gw albeit partially or completely at different rates such as tetrachloroethene surfactants endocrine disrupting chemicals such as di n butyl phthalate phenolic compounds long and short chain fatty acids synthetic dyes aliphatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons 1 2 dichloroethane methoxylated aromatic compounds phenylpropionate perchlorate etc 32 37 moreover the presence of phb and polyphosphate accumulating species belonging to the family of rhodobacteriaceae and uc family acidobacteria indicate the bioreactor process behavior synonymous to the conventional sbr 38 39 4 conclusion the mmbrs achieved the steady state operation at a comparatively shorter time with respect to sbr however on long term operation sbrs were able to achieve a similar cod removal without any added complications as evidenced in mmbrs the high concentration of anionic surfactants in the gw reduced the rates of cod removal in all the reactors by 2 times the smaller pore size 50 μm mf exhibited a comparatively lower cod removal with higher effluent turbidity with respect to 100 μm mf irrespective of the filter orientations and position the horizontal mf fouled at relatively faster rates than the vertical mf however the later consisted higher microbial population and diversity the consistent erosion of microbes from the surfaces of mf leading to higher effluent turbidity was more prominent in 50 μm mf over 100 μm mf the 100 hmr reactor yielded effluents with a comparatively lowest cod and turbidity however displayed the highest rates of biofouling and frequency of air flushing an increase in water head above the mf resulted in the reduction in flux moreover mounting the mf in the middle region of the reactor generated the highest flux microbial population and diversity respectively the phylum proteobacteria was the most dominant across the reactors with the highest diversity and populations present in the

membrane dynamic membrane bioreactor submerged non woven bioreactor mesh filter activated sludge mesh filter membrane bioreactor etc and have been primarily used in the treatment of municipal sewage and low strength wastewater 12 13 15 17 these research have established a proof of mmbr concept however these need establishing a taxonomic microbiological and physical bases to broaden the potential of mmbr technology to other types of wastewater such as gw the optimum performance of mmbr is driven by several inadequately established bio physical factors that need further exploration such as the nature of mf biofilm formation and sloughing on the effluent flux frequency of mesh cleaning required for optimum functioning orientation and position of mf within the reactor and its simultaneous impact on the biofouling effluent quality and flux contribution of mesh biofilm in the degradation of compounds endurance of mf biofilm to withstand recalcitrant and anti microbial components in gw syntrophic interactions between the microbial communities in the sludge and mf biofilm etc this research addresses many of the above said challenges that are as follows i design and optimize the performance of mmbr fed with gw containing high concentrations of hcps and compare its performance with a conventional sbr the mmbr constitutes a macroporous mf submerged in aerobic bioreactor ii elucidate the impact of mf pore sizes 50 μm and 100 μm depth of submergence and its orientation vertical and horizontal on the effluent quality and flux iii study the microbial communities proliferating in the gw fed reactors divergence in microbial community structure between the suspended sludge and mf biofilm and their subsequent role on the operation of mmbr 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup the bioreactors mmbrs and sbr with a working volume of 50 litres were fabricated in commercial polyethylene drums the operation of sbr was modified to combine the fill and withdraw steps both the steps happen simultaneously wherein wastewater is fed through the bottom of the reactor leading to the spill over of treated water from the outlet present at the top of the reactor e g outflow is combined with inflow the bioreactors were operated in 6 cycles per day each cycle of 4 h containing 60 min feeding 30 min idle 120 min react 30 min idle fed in an up flow mode at a feed rate of 138 2 ml min for 60 min the bioreactors were fed with a synthetically prepared feed resembling a typical household gw containing edible starch 0 3 g l laundry detergent 0 3 g l liquid handwash 0 15 g l urea 0 05 g l kh2po4 0 01 g l diluted with tap water the bioreactors were operated at hrt of 1 day average organic loading rate olr of 550 mgcod l day the mf was composed of commercial grade nylon mesh with two different pore sizes 50 μm and 100 μm mounted on a perforated cylindrical pvc pipe acting as a saddle fig 1 4 and bundled together to form an mf module supplementary data 1 the 50 and 100 μm mesh modules were submerged in the bioreactors in two different orientations namely vertical and horizontal the bioreactor was made up of commercially available cylindrical plastic barrels 60 cm length 42 cm diameter of 85 litres holding capacity effective working volume of 50 litres overall four different mmbr configuration were fabricated namely 50 μm mf in a vertical orientation 50 vmr 50 μm mf in a horizontal orientation 50 hmr 100 μm mf in a vertical orientation 100 vmr 100 μm mf in a horizontal orientation 100 hmr fig 1 3 the 50 vmr 50 hmr and 100 vmr mesh modules contained six mf each of 22 cm length 7 5 cm diameter whereas 100 hmr mesh module contained four mf each of 15 5 cm length 11 cm diameter fig 1 and 2 the effective total filtration surface area of the mf modules in all the mmbrs was maintained at 0 2 m2 the discharge of permeate through the mf was driven by gravity controlled by shut off on off pneumatic solenoid valve placed outside the bioreactor the pneumatic solenoid valve opened 6 times within 2 h of the react phase at equal intervals the flux m3 m2 h was determined manually by measuring the volume of effluent discharged within the time period of valve opening the duration of the valve opening was adjusted daily based on the flux measurement in one complete cycle 6 times within 2 h of react phase to maintain the hrt at 1 day in a general perspective an increase in biofouling of the mf would simultaneously lead to the reduction in flux hence the duration of valve opening was simultaneously adjusted e g increased decreased to ensure an hrt of 1 day in each reactor an air pump placed outside the bioreactor supplied air underneath the mf modules through a ceramic diffuser at an airflow rate of 2 2 2 5 lpm the diffuser was placed underneath the mf to ensure air scouring of the mf to reduce the biofilm thickness each mf was fitted with an air injection pipe aip through which 10 lpm air was injected for a duration of 2 min to dislodge the inhabited biofilm layer on the mfs 2 2 water analysis the water analysis was conducted as per the apha awwa wef 18 the following tests were conducted namely chemical oxygen demand cod titrimetrically by closed reflux micro digestion ph total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss anionic surfactants expressed as methylene blue active substances mbas the turbidity of untreated and treated water samples was analyzed in hach 2100q turbidity meter the dissolved oxygen concentration in the reactors was maintained between 1 5 2 mg l and periodically monitored using galvanic do sensor ysi pro plus the influent and effluent samples of mmbr s were monitored throughout the study period e g 4 5 days week for the change in cod ph turbidity and flux 2 3 microbial analysis the microbial samples were collected from 50 vmr and 50 hmr operating at their steady state the biofilm samples were scraped from the top 50 vt middle 50 vm and bottom 50 vb region of 50 vmr mf along with a grab sample of the suspended sludge v ss from the reactor in the case of 50 hmr biofilm samples were scraped from the mid region of the 6 different mf namely 50 hmr 1 to 50 hmr 6 respectively in addition to the grab sample of suspended sludge h ss the samples were immediately packaged in dry ice and shipped to the university of nebraska unl lincoln usa for molecular analysis the dna was extracted from the samples using mo bio powersoil dna isolation kit followed by purification using onestep pcr inhibitor removal kit zymo research as per the prescribed protocols the quantity and quality of dna were estimated in a nanodrop 2000c spectrometer prior to the pcr amplification of 16srrna sequences with the forward primer 27 f and reverse primer 1492r 19 the amplified dna samples were verified in 0 8 agarose gel electrophoresis prior to the sequencing in an illumina miseq platform at the environmental sample preparation and sequencing facility espsf at argonne national laboratory il usa the forward primer 515 f reverse primer 806r along with the sequencer adapter were used to amplify the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene in the domains bacteria and archaea 20 the v4 region sequences were processed using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime software package installed on the linux platform of the supercomputing facilities at the holland computing centre unl the data were analyzed using the default bioinformatics software package included within qiime 21 the 16srrna gene copies were estimated using qpcr techniques in a mastercycler thermocycler eppendorf international germany the 16srrna gene primer was procured from invitrogen the usa as per the sequence described in suzuki et al 22 the kicqstart sybr green qpcr ready mix sigma aldrich accompanying the primers were subjected to three step template amplification followed by melting curve analysis steps as per the prescribed protocol an internally prepared stock qpcr standard of 16srrna gene ranging from 10 108 copies 20 μl was used to generate a standard curve the linear range of the standard curve determined the lower and higher detection limit of the 16srrna gene 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor studies the treatment of gw in mmbr is a low cost less complex alternative to the mbr and is suited for small scale decentralized treatment it combines biodegradation of compounds with the simultaneous separation of particulates from the treated water using mf the mmbrs such as 100 vmr 100 hmr 50 vmr 50 hmr achieved an average cod removal of 91 90 88 83 respectively throughout the study period table 1 on the other hand the sbr required 40 days to attain a steady state thereafter it was able to mineralize 87 of the total cod at similar loading rates the marginally higher cod removal achieved by mmbrs may be attributed to the biofilms formed on the mfs the cod removal was and marginally higher in 100 μm mmbrs over 50 μm mmbrs irrespective of the filter orientations indicating that 50 μm pore mesh does not offer any significant advantages in cod removal over the larger 100 μm pore mesh table 1 on a long term operational perspective sbr can achieve nearly similar cod reductions in comparison to the mf albeit with higher effluent turbidity without any complications related to filter clogging and filter cleaning the removal of 470 490 mg l d cod required a retention time of 1 day which was significantly lower with respect to sbr fed with sewage that can generally achieve cod removal 1000 mg l d 23 the lower rates of cod removal 2 3 times in comparison to the aerobic reactors sbr and activated sludge reported in various literatures is attributed to the relatively higher concentration of anionic surfactants e g 45 mg l in the gw feed 2 times higher than the reported inhibitory levels 24 25 higher concentration of surfactants especially originating from laundry have been reported to create mass transfer limitations of nutrients in the sludge and biofilm simultaneously reducing the rates of our and nitrification 26 27 the treated water discharged by 100 hmr had the lowest average turbidity of 29 ntu with a reduction of 56 fig 6 the effluent turbidity of 100 vmr and 50 vmr was significantly higher and did not reduce below 30 ntu with an average reduction by 14 and 11 respectively figs 6 and 7 the sbr discharged an effluent with an average turbidity of 30 60 ntu and in comparison to the mmbrs it was higher than 100 hmr and lower than 100 vmr 50 hmr 50 vmr fig 5 the vertical orientation of mfs 100 vmr 50 vmr showed around 40 higher flux relative to the horizontally placed mfs 100 hmr especially during the start of operation e g day 0 a gradual reduction in flux was an indicator of a simultaneous increase in biofilm thickness on the mfs the reduction in flux was more severe in 100 hmr hence it was air flushed on 5 different occasions to dislodge the biofilm layer whereas in 100 vmr air flushing was evaded due to insignificant clogging fig 6 marked in red arrows in fig 6 and 8 the sharp drop in flux is attributed to the proliferation of biofilm layer on the mf that could be easily dislodged by air flushing resulting in an immediate increase in flux whereas a relative increase in effluent turbidity after a certain period of reactor operation is attributed to the erosion of biofilm from the mfs the 50 vmr was air flushed on 27th day due to reduction in flux fig 8 however air flushing was deliberately avoided on 60th day despite showing a reduction in flux to study the long term effect of biofouling on the effluent cod turbidity and simultaneously estimate the time required to attain a 0 flux due to complete blockage of the mesh surface the results showed a comparatively slower reduction in flux from 0 4 in the 60th day to 0 m3 m 2 d 1 90th day during these periods days 60 90 the effluent cod and ph values were insignificant with respect to the days days 10 59 however it exhibited an increase in turbidity leading to 5 turbidity reduction a common feature observed in all the mf was a spike in effluent turbidity with a simultaneous reduction in flux mainly attributed to the erosion of biofilm from the mesh surfaces beyond a threshold level of thickness notably the days before air flushing shows this typical behavior of high effluent turbidity with the lowest flux marked in red arrows in fig 6 and 8 however continuous erosion of biofilm from the 100 vmr mf exhibited a relatively higher and no significant change in effluent flux and turbidity throughout its operation the above results show that horizontal mfs were more amenable to a reduction in flux due to biofouling with respect to the vertical mf it can be hypothesized that the permeate flow happens in the direction of gravity therefore accumulates comparatively higher suspended microbes and biofilm in a horizontal mf setup whereas in vertical mf the movement of permeate is perpendicular to both the mf and gravity therefore attracting comparatively lesser suspended bacteria on its surface fig 4 according to the basic physical law the pressure is constant across the horizontal cross section and increases with the depth of water therefore the water column pressure in horizontal mf would remain nearly constant across its cross sectional surface whereas in vertical mf the pressure would gradually increase along the depth of the mf these pressure differences in both horizontal and vertical orientation mf in mmbr may be attributed to simultaneously affect the flux biofouling and turbidity it can also be argued that 100 vmr would be ideal as it does not clog rapidly in comparison to 100 hmr however its relatively higher turbidity e g averaged 54 ntu outweighs the lower maintenance advantages of using vertically mounted submerged mf to understand the effect of water column height on the mf six mf were placed at different submerged depth in horizontal alignment inside the reactor 50 hmr each mf would therefore experience different levels of water head pressure with an increase toward the bottom the bottommost placed mf 50 hmr 1 and 50 hmr 2 had the lowest fluxes in comparison to the above ones indicating that an increase in pressure enhances the rates of biofouling the mf 50 hmr 1 to 50 hmr 6 discharged effluents with comparatively lower turbidity i e 56 62 ntu in the initial 20 days and thereafter an increase in turbidity i e 106 113 ntu was synchronous with the reduction in flux showing a distinctive characteristic of biofilm washout from the mf figs 9 and 10 after 50th day the effluent turbidity remained significantly higher irrespective of the submerged depth of the mf without any significant impacts on cod removal and ph continual erosion of biofilm from the surfaces of 50 hmr filters 50 hmr 1 to 6 led to an increase in effluent turbidity 31 35 with respect to the influent overall the horizontal placement of 50 μm mf was least effective in reducing the effluent turbidity hence results were contrary to the known hypothesis of reduction in effluent turbidity due to a simultaneous reduction in mesh pore sizes 28 3 2 microbial phylogenetics the proximate analysis of the effluent samples provide a skewed understanding of the mmbr behavior and fail to advance the syntrophic and metabolic interactions driving the reactor performances the above said shortcomings were addressed through metagenomic analysis of the microbiota inhabiting the 50 hmr and 50 vmr reactors respectively the phylogenetic analysis shows significant differences in microbial abundance and diversity within i e intra the reactor biofilm and suspended sludge and also between i e inter the 50 hmr and 50 vmr fig 11 the species under the phylum proteobacteria was prominent across the reactors and mf the 50 hmr reactor was dominated by phylum proteobacteria followed by synergistetes verrumicrobia actinobacteria chloroflexi etc whereas in 50 vmr the phylum proteobacteria was followed by bacteroidetes acidobacteria spirochetes verrumicrobia etc the acidobacteria phylum had a relatively lower presence in 50 hmr fig 11 the genera pleomorphomonas was the dominating species in all the samples except for 50 vm 50 vb 50 hmr 1 dominated by unclassified uc family of order bacteroidales and 50 hmr 3 dominated by genera vadinca02 the 50 vss has the highest gene copies otus si and fpd fig 12 and supplementary data 2 moreover the vertical mf contained higher gene copies otus si and fpd diversities with respect to horizontal mf indicating that the vertical positioning of the filters would be a better suited over horizontal position due to higher microbial population and diversity fig 12 and supplementary data 2 these results contrasted with the proximate analysis that showed relatively higher rates of biofouling and cod removal in horizontal mf over vertical mf fig 6 and 7 therefore higher rates of biofouling do not necessarily indicate high species population and diversity the continuous erosion of biofilm from the surface of vertical mfs resulting in higher effluent turbidity is analogous to biofilms subjected to high hydrodynamic shear stress a frequent erosion of the top biofilm layer due to hydrodynamic shear enhances the accessibility of nutrients and oxygen to the underneath layers resulting in higher species population and diversity 29 31 a similar phenomenon is attributed to prevail in vertical mfs notably the 50 hss and 50 vss possess higher gene copies otus d fpd than their respective mf biofilms indicating a comparatively higher microbial population and diversity in the ss over the biofilms whereas the microbes inhabiting the mf biofilms are selective and evenly distributed these results substantiate the above findings table 1 that mf biofilm has a relatively minor contribution in cod removal with respect to the ss the middle region of mf both in 50 hmr 50 hmr 4 and 50 vmr 50 vm had a comparatively higher microbial population and diversity when compared to the remaining parts of their mf respectively this shows that mounting the mf in the mid region of the reactors would be beneficial to enhance the microbial population that could simultaneously enhance the biodegradation of compounds the pcoa of the microbial communities supplementary data 3 showed significantly distinct clusters of microbial diversity between the 50 hmr and 50 vmr the samples from 50 hmr excluding 50 hmr 2 were clustered closer showing similarities between the microbial communities the communities in 50 hmr 2 were distantly placed from the cluster that can be attributed to the phylum proteobacteria and verrumicrobia representing 32 and 30 population respectively whereas in other mf proteobacteria represented 60 of the phylum along with verrumicrobia populations 5 moreover 50 hmr 2 mf exhibited the lowest flux and turbidity among the 50 hmr mfs indicating the formation of a rigid biofilm layer comparatively less amenable to erosion as evident in the rest of 50 hmr mfs though operated under similar conditions these ambiguities in the behavior of mfs cannot be ignored however will be the subject for future studies these changes were however not reflected in 50 hmr 1 considering that 50 hmr 1 was positioned below 50 hmr 2 this phenomenon would therefore need further research the microbial communities present in the 50 vmr were similar and clustered closer whereas communities in the 50 vss were different from the others the differences in microbial population and communities inhabiting the suspended sludge and the mf biofilms can be attributed to the mass transfer limitations of substrates nutrients and oxygen through the mf biofilm moreover higher otu 16srrna and sp in the 50 vss over the mfs biofilms can be discerned from the differences observed in the pcoa plots the dominating species across the reactors non chronologically belonged to the genera pleomorphomonas vadin ca02 leucobacter xanthobacter agrobacterium desulfovibrio phenylobacterium limnohabitans sja 88 heteroc45 4w uc genera of family enterobacteriaceae rhodobacteraceae aeromonadaceae anaerolinaceae veillonellaceae holophagaceae rhodospirillaceae aeromonadaceae caulobacteraceae wchb1 25 uc family of order bacteroidales rhizobiales sja 36 ld1 pb3 many of the above said species have been reported to degrade and metabolize the recalcitrant hcps commonly found in gw albeit partially or completely at different rates such as tetrachloroethene surfactants endocrine disrupting chemicals such as di n butyl phthalate phenolic compounds long and short chain fatty acids synthetic dyes aliphatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons 1 2 dichloroethane methoxylated aromatic compounds phenylpropionate perchlorate etc 32 37 moreover the presence of phb and polyphosphate accumulating species belonging to the family of rhodobacteriaceae and uc family acidobacteria indicate the bioreactor process behavior synonymous to the conventional sbr 38 39 4 conclusion the mmbrs achieved the steady state operation at a comparatively shorter time with respect to sbr however on long term operation sbrs were able to achieve a similar cod removal without any added complications as evidenced in mmbrs the high concentration of anionic surfactants in the gw reduced the rates of cod removal in all the reactors by 2 times the smaller pore size 50 μm mf exhibited a comparatively lower cod removal with higher effluent turbidity with respect to 100 μm mf irrespective of the filter orientations and position the horizontal mf fouled at relatively faster rates than the vertical mf however the later consisted higher microbial population and diversity the consistent erosion of microbes from the surfaces of mf leading to higher effluent turbidity was more prominent in 50 μm mf over 100 μm mf the 100 hmr reactor yielded effluents with a comparatively lowest cod and turbidity however displayed the highest rates of biofouling and frequency of air flushing an increase in water head above the mf resulted in the reduction in flux moreover mounting the mf in the middle region of the reactor generated the highest flux microbial population and diversity respectively the phylum proteobacteria was the most dominant across the reactors with the highest diversity and populations present in the

produced only in the kitchen bath and laundry laundry greywater contains different kinds of chemicals such as detergents and surfactants the greywater from commercial laundries should be in conformity with specific standards prior to discharge into the municipal sewage networks therefore specific treatment processes are recommended to satisfy such a regulation 1 moreover the recycling of laundry water as toilet water irrigation water and also in the first wash cycle of the laundry makes it possible to limit drinking water consumption in the buildings reducing the environmental impacts related to the pollution generated by the discharge of liquid effluents can be managed more efficiently by reuse of treated water for specific purposes by decreasing water consumption in the industry the global required industrial water was recorded as 8 1011 m3 in 2009 and is predicted to 15 1011 m3 by 2030 closed water cycle is considered as one of the chief research issues in sustainable water field throughout various industries due to increasing water demand water depletion resources environmental considerations socio economic aspects and public health security 2 given the large quantities of produced wastewater the diversity of their origins and the complexity of their compositions the limits of conventional treatments are increasingly being pushed to meet both technical and legislative requirements to meet this requisite to explore new dynamic proactive efficient and less costly solutions becomes an imperative the textile and clothing sector usually generates wastewater that is moderately loaded with organic matters npeo3 17 and pathogens compared to the other polluting industrial activities 3 4 the commercial laundries are not only consuming large volumes of water but also producing waste effluents that are moderately loaded with pollutants 5 the detergents used by the laundries are unquestionably a source of pollutants considered endocrine disruptors including surfactants and npeo3 17 6 for instance some studies have shown that the presence of such pollutants at certain concentrations can cause genetic mutations of sex in fish 7 npeo3 17 c9h19c6h4 och2ch2 noh n 3 17 are nonionic surfactants that are used in a wide variety of industrial applications and consumer products this chemical is restricted because it can be degraded into nonylphenol np in the environment which is so toxic to aquatic systems and cause detrimental impacts in the aquatic environment 8 thus the laundries wastewater requires specific treatment to remove the contaminants in terms of npeo3 17 chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solid tss that are hazardous to aquatic ecosystems 9 despite the existence of several types of conventional treatments that allow this industry to more or less complies with its wastewater discharge standards current processes remain ineffective in reducing or eliminating refractory compounds considering the nature and behavior of refractory pollutants combined membrane and electrochemical treatment technology presents a real opportunity for this sector of activity since these technologies have proved efficient in terms of elimination of wide range of organic pollutants 10 in addition these technologies are readily available for automation enable in situ production of oxidizing and or coagulating agents and facilitate the rational management of natural resources membrane technology is a favorable candidate for a simple and efficient treatment of greywater for all purpose unrestricted reuse 11 the coupled processes can be applied to laundry wastewater by limiting the use of chemicals the space and cost of the project 12 13 the main advantage of the pressure driven membrane processes for surfactant removal from water solutions is their high selectivity without involving phase changes or chemical additives and their greater efficiency in concentrated stream recycling the quality of ultrafiltration permeate is generally not satisfactory due to the permeation of surfactant monomers to reach a satisfied low concentration of surfactants in the permeate a nanofiltration should be applied 14 for instance by applying the flux of 50 lm 2 h 1 retentions of 95 for chemical oxygen demand and anionic surfactants were observed and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of direct nanofiltration to recycle and reuse the greywater 15 on the other hand a combined system filtration adsorption allows the reduction of the cod and tss of greywater in recent years the research for low cost adsorbents has been intensified the adsorption process has also been widely used for treatment of industrial wastewater from organic and inorganic pollutants and has gained much attention from researchers 16 the incorporations intend to treat an average of 100 150 m3 per day of wastewater from laundries laundry industries therefore would like to improve its treatment line without the addition of chemicals in order to achieve the environmental discharge targets 200 μg l for npeox 10 mg l for ss and cod 100 mg l 17 the objective of this work is the development of a coupled treatment system uf ec ad uf ec nf eo and uf ec eo by applying the ad nf eo processes to the filtrate from uf that may contain cod and soluble npeo3 17 contaminants while the ec and eo processes are applied to the concentrate from the uf loaded with ss npeo3 17 and cod and nf concentrate loaded mainly by dissolved organics the mentioned coupling system is developed to treat lw in this proposed method we improved its purification process by integrating an efficient environmentally friendly and chemical free processing unit with minimal chemicals into its membrane filtration module the proposed technological approach will make it possible to treat wastewater from laundries in order to meet the environmental discharge objectives and to reuse the wastewater in the first laundry washing cycle without addition of external chemicals 1 1 background information chih ta wang et al 18 developed the technique of cod removal in the treatment of simulated laundry wastewater using electrocoagulation electroflotation technology jiantuan ge et al 19 proposed a new bipolar electrocoagulation and electroflotation for the effective removal of turbidity cod phosphate and surfactant mbas in a wide ph range 5 9 at a short hrt 5 10

surfactants by 85 96 were achieved sylwia mozia et al 21 developed the possibilities of application of a three step system combining hybrid biological treatment followed by advanced uv o3 oxidation with in situ generated o3 and membrane separation ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf to treat and reuse the wastewater from an industrial laundry xia shang et al 22 demonstrated coagulation to contaminant removal in microfiltration of laundry wastewater they suggested that additional purification methods such as reverse osmosis ro are required in order to further reduce the concentrations of cod and total phosphorus tp s šostar turk et al 23 developed the laundry wastewater treatment using conventional methods namely precipitation coagulation and the flocculation process with adsorption on granular activated carbon gac and an alternative method membrane filtrations namely ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro sumisha et al 24 developed uf process for lw treatment cod and turbidity reduction up to 88 and 98 was achieved using modified membranes this indicated that modified pes membranes are suitable for the treatment of surfactant detergent and oil from laundry wastewater in another study physico chemical pre treatment coagulation flocculation sand filtration ozonation granular activated carbon gac filtration and cross flow ultrafiltration uf were used to treat lw 25 the summary of the previous works are describe in table 1 in most of the literature the treatment of laundry wastewater lw were investigated but the reusing of this grey water was not studied deeply in this study we focused on the reusing of water by the novel sequential approach and practical combined process with no addition of extra chemicals in the process also we compared the treated water with the standards like nfs for reusing laundry wastewater 2 materials two barrels each 200 liters of wastewater have been received from veoswater quebec then they were divided into 20 buckets each 20 l and they were kept in the cold room for further experiments the following experiments were conducted at room temperature for ec 8 electrodes are placed in a plexiglas reactor 12 cm width 12 cm depth and 20 cm height the electrodes were iron anodes and graphite or stainless steel cathodes placed vertically the inter electrode distance was 1 5 cm the graphite electrodes were 10 cm in width 11 cm in length and a thickness of 0 5 cm surface area 110 cm2 the electrodes of iron aluminum and stainless steel had the same dimensions as the graphite cathode but with a thickness of 0 1 cm in order to impose a dc electric current triggering the electrochemical phenomena a generator of the extech r1 8 power supply mode type has been used this generator is capable of imposing a maximum current of 21 5 a and a maximum voltage of 32 3 v eo tests were carried out in two different electrolytic cells with distinct characteristics stirring was affected by recirculation between the two compartments recirculation was carried out using a cole parmer master flex type pump model no 7528 10 set at a speed of 250 rpm flow rate 0 4 l min the electrolytic cell used in this study for the electro oxidation treatment had 14 3 5 12 5 cm dimensions the cell could hold 0 5 l with a 0 3 l recirculation tank this plexiglas cell was designed for only two electrodes where each of the electrodes was connected to the generator grid electrode 73 cm2 made of bdd ti pt and ti iro2 were used at the anode while we tested several possible types of cathodes graphite vitreous carbon and stainless steel these cathodes were all of equal dimensions 110 cm2 uf was supplied from inge gmbh dizzerr p 2514 0 5 with mwco of 100 150 kda made by polyether sulfone pes type with a porosity of 0

purchased from synder filtration it consisted of a spiral type polyamide composite membrane module for working with a membrane surface of 3 16 m2 and having a cutoff threshold of between 150 and 300 daltons granular activated carbon gac supplied from aquamerik bc 830 a virgin activated carbon granular form 0 7 to 1 0 mm mn200 resin was a gift from the purolite company which its characteristics are shown in table 2 two plexiglas columns were used as filtration units with a dimension of 14 cm height 3 cm inside diameter each column was filled with filtering material to a height of 12 cm perforated plexiglas disks hole diameter 1 0 1 5 mm were placed at the inlet and outlet of the columns and allowed uniform distribution of the influent into the filter bed these perforated disks were horizontally installed and allowed the delimiting of the inlet and outlet zones 3 methods 3 1 electrocoagulation ec the electrocoagulation process appears to be effective for the removal of colloids suspended solids dyes humic substances and other high molecular compounds 26 28 the main reactions taking place in an electrocoagulation cell include three successive stages formation of coagulants by oxidation of the sacrificial electrode generally iron or aluminum destabilization of contaminant charges and aggregation of the destabilized compounds to form flocs for liquid solid sludge separation by decanting and or floating the main reactions occurring in an electrocoagulation cell can be described in the following three equations 1 m s m a q n n e 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 3 m a q n n o h m o

which only the two electrodes were connected to the two poles of the generator thus the two bonded electrodes were monopolar in terms of charges however the electrodes in the middle were charged bipolar in monopolar mp configuration all the electrodes were connected successively then therefore the two faces of each electrode were identically polarized fig 1 for each ec or eceo in case of using graphite as cathode test a volume of 2 45 l was processed in batch mode after adding the na2so4 electrolyte the treatment time was 120 min for the study of the effect of current intensity the

cyanides and aniline it is often used to reduce the load of cod and ammonia nitrogen or as a tertiary treatment for degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants two types of reactions are recognized in this process the direct oxidation reaction and the indirect oxidation reaction in a direct oxidation reaction the oxidation is carried out either by electrochemical conversion or by electrochemical combustion during electrochemical conversion non biodegradable organic compounds are partially oxidized to more biodegradable compounds whereas during electrochemical combustion organic pollutants are completely degraded into co2 and h2o the direct reaction is carried out in two steps at first step the anodic oxidation of the molecule of water leading to the formation of the reactive species oho which is adsorbed on an active site as m oho and in a second step the hydroxyl radical oxidizes the organic pollutant the reaction between the oxidized organic compounds and the hydroxyl radicals can lead to complete oxidation 27 29 4 h 2 o m m o h h e 5 r m o h m r o h e 6 r m o h m m c o 2 n h 2 o h e competition can occur during oxidation and thus reduce the effectiveness of pollutant

electrodes that have a high oxygen overvoltage the most commonly used anode is boron doped diamond bdd the use of these electrodes with high oxygen overvoltage implies the generation of reactive oxygen species such as the hydroxyl radical responsible for the degradation of organic matter these materials also exhibit chemical stability with respect to acidic and alkaline media to do the experiments a concentration of 3 g l na2so4 was added in order to increase the conductivity of the solution and decrease the applied voltage energy consumption in addition the recirculation flow rate was fixed at 0 4 l min thus allowing a good homogenization of the solution to be treated during the treatment an inter electrode distance is 1 5 cm operated in dynamic batch mode the recirculation was fixed at a speed of 200 rpm for that of eo flow 0 3 l min the treatment time of the filtrate with eo lasted 120 min for the study of the effect of the anode and the cathode the intensity of the current and the ph on the efficiency of the eo process quite frequent sampling every 15 min was carried out to evaluate the cod abatement as a function of time in the context of optimization of

filtration of raw water was carried out using an ultrafiltration membrane the raw wastewater to be treated feed tank is conveyed by means of a variable flow pump in the membrane system the dc motor speed control pump kbpc 240d was used to supply and recirculate the water installed on the skid as depicted in fig 3 crossflow filtration ended once the percentage of the concentrate reached 20 of the initial volume filtered 80 recovery between two ultrafiltration tests the membrane was washed by recirculating acidic hcl and basic naoh solutions of 0 1 wt for 10 15 min for each washing step recirculation of distilled water into the system for 10 min was required after washing steps performance of uf of raw laundry wastewater was investigated in terms of transmembrane pressure tmp influent flowrate and cleaning and backwash effects in order to determine the rejection rate of cod turbidity tss and npeo the characteristics of uf has been shown by table 2 3 4 nanofiltration nf the material of membrane has hydrophilic charge which can promote run times between cleaning and reduce clogging rates an experimental unit of the pilot type was used it was a tangential filtration unit operating in batch mode with permeate recirculation in the feed tank the experimental unit comprised a recirculation pump hydro cell with a speed regulator capable of delivering a flow rate of a maximum hydrostatic pressure 1000 psi the system was equipped with a 50 l feed tank a continuous flow meter on the concentrate rotameter type a manometer and a concentrate outlet needle valve for securing the transmembrane pressure table 2 shows the characteristics of nf filtration module 3 5 adsorption ad adsorbents like gac and pr can be applied for the liquid phase including the filtration

different filter beds the columns were respectively filled with gac and polymeric resin pr a superficial hydraulic retention times hrt calculated according to total volume of the bed of 6 10 15 and 30 min were imposed by master flex type pump in each column adjusted for continuous flow rate 30 3 6 analysis 3 6 1 ph and conductivity analyzes we monitored ph and conductivity by measuring these two parameters for the raw water and for the treated water initial and final the ph was measured using a fisher scientific type ph meter model xl25 previously calibrated with ph 4 7 and 10 standard solutions conductivity was measured by an oakton type 510 conductivity meter 3 6 2 analysis of chemical oxygen demand cod to determine the concentration of cod samples were immediately stored at 4 c until they were analyzed using a uv type spectrophotometer 0811 m136 varian brand canada inc according to the analytical method ma 315 dco 1 0 of the center of expertise in environmental analysis with a calibration curve including standards of 100 300 500 800 and 1000 mg l 3 6 3 analyses of turbidity suspended solids tss and total solids ts the turbidity was measured by an optical test which determines the light reflection capability using a hach 2100 turbidimeter calibrated between 1 and 4000 ntu the determination of total suspended solids tss according to the analytical method ma 115 s

completed the residue was dried at 103 105 c overnight or at least 3 h the weight of suspended solids is obtained by calculating the difference of the filter weights before and after drying using the method of analysis ma 100 s t 1 1 for the determination of the total solids concentration ts we took an aluminum cup the weight of which was measured beforehand we added a volume of the sample and the whole was put for drying at 105 c overnight the difference between the weight of the cup before and after drying makes it possible to calculate the concentration of ts 3 6 4 analysis of nonylphenol ethoxylates npeo3 17 dichloromethane formic acid and methanol were supplied from fischer scientific and pk30 supelclean envi carb 500 mg 6 ml from sigma aldrich for npeo3 17 analysis in order to evaluate the concentration of surfactants we used the method of ma 400 npeo 1 0 this method allowed us to determine the concentrations of ethoxylated nonylphenols which include 3 to 17 ethoxylate units npeo3 17 the standard used was a mixture of igepal 630 surfactants the internal standard used for the assay was np3eo 13c6 and the overlay standard was np2eo 13c6 the detection limit for this method was 50 ng l for all npeo3 17 the assay was performed using the calibration curve standardized between 20 and 1000 μg l after rinsing the carbon cartridge with dichromethane 12 ml the solution of methanol dichloromethane and formic acid 12 ml dichromethane 12 ml and conditioning with 1 6 ml methanol and 20 ml hcl 2 n the samples 50 ml were acidified by the addition of 20 μl of hcl 37 to ph

wastewater from commercial laundries wastewater from commercial laundries constitutes a source of pollution to be taken into consideration table 3 shows the physicochemical characteristics of laundry wastewater lw from some studies worldwide 25 19 5 33 as well as those provided by a commercial laundry sample analysis in this work a comparison between the two analyses would allow us to draw up a rather specific picture of the physicochemical quality of a commercial laundry water in general the lws are characterized by colloidal pollutions in the fluid surfactants detergents form so called micellar colloidal suspensions whose dimensions are in a range from nanometer to micrometer a micelle is a spheroidal group from 0 001 to 0 300 μm of molecules possessing a hydrophilic polar head and a hydrophobic chain 34 micelle formation occurs at a certain temperature kraft temperature and at a certain concentration called critical micellar concentration cmc 35 the npeo3 17 then form agglomerates of a few hundred molecules which constitute the turbidity of the lw whether in suspension or in solution the presence of organic matters in laundry effluents constitutes the major part of the polluting load with chemical oxygen demands of up to 1000 mg l suspended solids concentrations of up to 200 mg l and npeo3 17 concentrations of up to 2200 μg l mainly related to detergent additions it is by integrating the volume of these waters that one could appreciate their true ecological impact indeed the discharge of 250 m³ of lw into the sewer each day means that loads of 250 kg cod and 50 kg of tss are transported to the municipal wastewater treatment plant this input is considered as a surplus for the treatment plant that will receive the laundry effluent from the sanitary sewers their direct rejection in a receptor medium can cause severe environmental damage 18 36 38 commercial lws also include nitrogen 32 4 26 2 sulfur 21 1 19 1 and phosphate 94 6 75 4 compounds volatile fatty acids and heavy metals 39 table 4 shows the standards of rejection and reuse of lw as well according to environmental quality standards eqs the annual average concentration for np in water surface were recommended at 0 3 μg l the us environmental protection agencies epa developed a criterion recommendations whereby np concentration should not exceed 6 6 μg l and 1 7 μg l in freshwater and saltwater respectively 40 these waters are generally compatible with the operating requirements of a biological treatment however the bod5 cod ratio may vary from 2 to 10 and the bod5 concentration is relatively low in most effluents although biological processes aerobic and anaerobic are efficient and economical for the treatment of certain effluents they often require high retention time and large ponds which sometimes limit the implementation of these technologies in large scale moreover biological processes are in most cases unable to completely eliminate refractory soluble pollutants 27 41 42 due to their low biodegradability the bod5 cod ratio is often low the treatment of this type of wastewater is particularly difficult also the high surfactant content would cause abnormalities for biological treatment processes 25 dysfunctions could then be expected at the treatment plant stations followed by release of pollutants into the receiving environment it may even be that the treatment station is partially acting on the degradation of some refractory pollutants notably the npeo3 17 annual production of np reaches 154 200 tons in the united states 73 500 tons in europe 16 500 tons in japan and 16 000 tons in china 43 with the development of the textile sector all over the world production of np was estimated at 600 000 tons in 2003 np is used as a raw material in the synthesis of npeo3 17 and as a monomer in the production of polymers npeo3 17 are made by reacting np with ethylene oxide such reaction yields npeo3 17 with a mixture of ethylene chain lengths in addition an estimated of 4 million tons of alkylphenol ethoxylates are used annually worldwide 85 are sold as npeo3 17 these large quantities are generally found in the environment and especially in the aquatic environment 95 of the quantity produced 44 indeed they are persistent organic molecules in the aquatic environment moderately bioaccumulative and extremely toxic to aquatic organisms 34 these facts explain their omnipresence in nature and in living organisms 4 1 1 npeo3 17 presence in laundry detergents and cloths analyses of 6 commercial types of lunacy detergents at quebec results not shown showed that 50 of them contains high amounts of npeo3 17 1600 6700 μg l and 50 of them does not contain this kind of surfactant moreover three different cloths have been washed in three steps to see the npeo3 17 come from the textile industries sources the results demonstrated 7240 7690 μg kg of npeo3 17 per kg of cloths 4 2 preliminary test electrocoagulation of raw water ec of lw preliminary electrocoagulation experiments on raw wastewater were performed to evaluate whether electrochemical treatment such as electrocoagulation would be able to treat this greywater to meet the rejection standards to do this two configurations were tested bipolar and monopolar at current densities of 20 40 and 80 ma cm2 in order to study the effect of different parameters on cod tss and npeo3 17 abatement current density configuration type and treatment time were studied these conditions have a close relationship with the process efficiency by analyzing the effect of intensity on total cod abatement we can see that the rate of elimination improves by increasing the intensity of the imposed current it is observed that between 0 5 and 1 a the removal of cod increases by 18 2 while the reduction of cod does not increase significantly from 1 a to 2 a thus by imposing greater intensity the power consumption of the system would be greater and would therefore increase treatment costs the production of sludge from electrocoagulation is an important parameter for the optimization of electrocoagulation process in fact a large production of sludge means that there has been a strong anodic dissolution of the metal used as anode 29 41 this dissolution is proportional to the current intensity and the treatment time the relationship between current density and the amount of dissolved metals can be expressed by faraday s law 11 m q m n f i t v f m n where q is charge dosage m is the amount of electrode material dissolved i is the current intensity t is the operation time in s m is the molar mass of the electrode material n represents the number of electrons in redox reaction valence and f is faraday s constant 96 500 c mol moreover charge dosage rate can be defined as following equation which is proportional to the rate of metal dissolution into a unit volume of solution 12 d q d t i v j a v where j is current density a is surface area od electrode and v is the volume of the solution 45 it turns out that if the amount of produced sludge is higher the cost related to the management of sludge also increases undeniably the majority of the costs about 60 related to the operation of a treatment station are invested in sludge management 46 it is therefore relevant to try to minimize the amount of sludge in order to limit the costs associated with the management of sludge in terms of cod abatement we noted that the yields achieved by imposing 1 and 2 a are almost similar and allow to meet the standards of discharges to the sewer less than 500 mg l however the power consumption and quantity of sludge give the advantage for an intensity of 1 a vs the ones of 2 a finally the preliminary tests revealed that by using the iron and stainless steel ss electrodes in bipolar configuration i 1 a t 60 min 65 elimination of the cod could be obtained the principle of coagulation 26 makes it possible to eliminate colloids and suspended solids by adsorption on settling flocs it turns out that these flocs by decanting trap parts of the cod furthermore ec tests with iron stainless steel in monopolar configuration under the same operating conditions were carried out yields are slightly similar in terms of cod removal 5 10 improvement over the full range of intensities tested the applied current densities are identical however the volume of sludge is much higher in monopolar 16 5 22 5 51 5 compared to bipolar 12 5 17 30 in addition the power consumption is higher in monopolar the following section compares electrocoagulation iron ss and electrocoagulation electrooxidation iron graphite the difference between ec and ec eo is related to the type of cathode actually the use of cathode graphite allows the in situ production of oxidizing agents 47 in such a system the dissolved oxygen present in the solution is reduced to form hydrogen peroxide oxidant with a redox potential 1 77 v 13 o 2 2 h e h 2 o 2 in bipolar non branched graphite electrodes are doubly polarized a reducing face allows the production of h2o2 and an oxidizing face allows the production of active chlorine oxidant by oxidizing the chloride ions if exists in the water the ss electrode usually placed as a cathode characterized by its production of hydrogen bubbles the rise of these bubbles on the surface of the solution towards the air is a phenomenon which is accompanied with a solid liquid separation the fact of studying the effect of the cathode allows us to highlight the intervention of oxidizing agents compared to h2 bubbles the study of the ec eo iron graphite cell was done following the same procedure as that for the optimization of the electrocoagulation fig 4 compares the ec and the ec eo operated at the same current densities 20 40 and 80 ma cm2 with a treatment time of 60 min in bipolar configuration the results of preliminary ec and ec eo tests on raw lw showed that the yields in terms of cod and tss reductions did not vary significantly without a doubt for current densities between 10 20 and 40 ma cm2 the ec allows the removal of 46 65 and 67 6 of the cod while the ec eo yielded 53 68 and 72 slightly higher for cod therefore the use of the graphite cathode instead of stainless steel has been favored given the relatively low conductivity of the lws the current density of 80 ma cm2 could not be tested in the case of the monopolar configuration the monopolar configuration generated on average twice as much metal sludge 18 and 25 v v but the bipolar configuration produced less sludge 8 and 11 v v for a current density of between 20 and 40 ma cm2 the energy consumption recorded for the monopolar configuration 10 25 kw h m3 is higher than that measured in the case of the bipolar configuration 4 22 kw h m3 for identical current densities the applied current intensities in the case of the monopolar configuration are much higher than those imposed for the bipolar configuration as known the production of metal sludge and the quantity of electricity depend on the imposed current intensity the results of ec by use of aluminum electrode instead of fe led to 2 7 lower efficiency in cod removal data not shown the ph adjustment did not highly affect the overall performance of the process 4 3 ultrafiltration treatment of lw the uf test was carried out with a filter surface area of 0 5 m2 the pes base polymer promotes the hydrophilicity of the membrane this property increases the capacity of the membrane surface to adsorb organics thereby improving operating performance with less membrane fouling the manufacturer produces a defined ultra thin filtration surface interface on the inside of the several capillaries with extremely low resistance to permeation and with inner pores measuring approximately 20 nm to protect the membranes from damaging particles an screen filter with a cut off of 80 μm was installed in the circulation system and at the point where the cleaning solution is fed into the system the recommended volume flow rate for cleaning uf modules is at least 20 lmh and for normal operation is 60 lmh and the maximum hydraulic pressure loss is 1 bar 14 5 psi the solution to be treated feed tank is conveyed by means of a variable flow pump in the membrane system under the effect of the applied pressure to the concentrate side by means of the valve located on the concentrate flow part of the solution passes into the permeate and is accumulated in the permeate reservoir the recovery level is determined from the volumes of the initial feed solution the permeate and the concentrate during the process the pressure of the membrane increases due to gradual clogging however in order to have the constant pressure the outlet valve of the membrane on concentrate line is opened gradually the average pressure drop of membrane was 5 0 psi the system operated between 10 60 minutes with and without backwash to collect a volume of filtrate of 80 recovery of the total volume while the concentrate was recirculated in the feed tank the transmembrane pressure tmp and the filtrate and concentrate flow rates are affected by the membrane clogging especially when the concentrate is recirculated indeed the recirculation of the concentrate forces the particles with diameters close to the micrometers to be adsorbed by electrostatic forces onto the pores of the membrane these particles cause clogging at the pores particles with diameters around 0 02 μm the concentrate is characterized by a high cod and tss loads the filtrate contains only dissolved organic matter codt codd however the 4 3 mg l of tss found in the filtrate which does not represent the suspended matters but rather refer to the presence of colloids of less than 0 02 μm in diameter fig 5 a shows the concentration of npeo3 17 in raw and treated lw by different methods it can be noted that the concentrate is more loaded with npeo3 17 than the filtrate there are several reasons for the distribution of npeo3 17 during ultrafiltration first the npeo3 17 form micelles with diameters greater than 0 02 μm and thus end up in the concentrate instead of the filtrate also the npeo3 17 could be adsorbed on the surface of tss and colloids due to their log kow of 4 48 43 and could interact with the uf membrane which is organic surfactants as amphiphilic compounds have a hydrophilic or polar moiety part head and hydrophobic or nonpolar moiety tail the hydrophilic part can be anionic cationic dipolar or nonionic the hydrophobic part composed of hydrocarbon chain the surfactants can be partly dissolved in the water however if the concentration is higher than critical micelle concentration cmc they aggregate and produce micelles thus the tails flock to the interior due to avoid contact with water as a hydrophobic property and the heads stay in the outer of surface du to increase the contact with water depending on the condition such as temperature ph etc they can be in spherical cylindrical lamellar or two dimensionally into bilayers or discoidal micelles their radii vary in a range from 10 nm to over 100 nm 48 49 fig 6 a b show the data for ultrafiltration at different pressures and feed flowrates the inlet flowrate of membrane is increased by rising the tmp while the reverse has been observed for concentrate flow moreover at lower inlet flowrate lower permeate flow is observed and by increasing the feed flowrate 0 4 2 l min the permeate flow enhanced dramatically however at the threshold of 2 l m increasing in flowrate to 2 5 l min just resulted in slightly increase in permeate flow the results also demonstrate that by increasing both pressure and flowrate the operating time for treatment of certain volume of raw lw is decreased slightly due to increase in permeate flowrate also in the first 10 min of operation the highest reduction in flowrate takes place for instance for treatment of 20 ls of raw lw between 25 30 minutes is required to operate which demonstrate the requirement of backwash or chemical cleaning the maximum permeate flux was recorded as 120 l m2 h and the minimum one was recorded as 36 l m2 h which is lower than the recommended value 60 l m2 h which leads to waste of energy according to the results around 50 of tss more than 50 of cod and about 98 of turbidity have been removed by uf table 3 however unremarkable changes in conductivity and ph were observed which shows that uf is not able to remove ions in the solution despite low turbidity and relatively moderate cod content but not enough low cod value the uf permeate still contained high amounts of inorganic salts conductivity 700 μs cm which are not desired to reuse water in the laundry process therefore nf is required as the final treatment step before a possible reuse of this water in the laundry system as the uf was not able to remove efficiently the cod and npeo3 17 in the raw feed the mechanism of the separation is considered as mostly through sorption to membrane surface rather than size exclusion hydrophobic adsorption mostly influenced by the hydrophobicity of the pollutants is a main removal mechanism which aided organics removal as sorption is major mechanism with uf membranes for organic pollutants removal novel approaches to enhance surface morphology improve sorption site and surface modification could boost the performance of uf membranes in this case 50 4 3 1 effect of backwash and chemical cleaning on membrane performance fig 7 a b show the one step filtration to understand the backwash effect on membrane performance backwash was performed for around 60 s by applying the pressures of 30 psi as input and 20 psi as output to be sufficiently effective the backwash must be conducted at a flux rate of at least 230 lmh 135 gfd 115 l h 1 9 l min effective backwash duration varies between 30 and 60 s depending on the quality of the feed water and the type of operating cycle as can be seen permeate flux starts from 1 2 l min and reaches to about half of initial flux in 10 min this experiment shows that the ideal backwash is required every 10 min besides by using the flowrate of 2 5 l min the retentate flux is much higher than permeate flowrate not shown to reduce the ratio of concentrate flowrate over permeate flowrate the experiments were done by choosing 2 l min fig 7a shows the longtime of uf operation using 100 l of raw wastewater feed flowrate of 2 l min each 10 min the backwash was performed using permeate water every time between 85 100 increase in permeate flowrate was recorded according to these results after 1 h of operation each 10 min back wash the membrane needs chemical washing the permeability of membrane were decreased in a range of 64 78 during the 30 min of operation without any backwash however after a backwash with demi water potable or uf permeate water as well during 60 s the enhancement of permeability was recorded at 67 fig 7b between each run or when the membrane is clogged chemical washing is required it was carried out by the procedure mentioned in materials and methods section alkaline followed by acid to clean off organic deposits and to clean off inorganic deposits and or remove precipitation respectively depending on the quality of the source water and the flux rate the filtration time backwash and chemical cleaning vary furthermore the chemically enhanced backwash ceb process was performed with typical parameters for an intake flux rate of 120 lmh 1 l min the operating parameters were permissible tmp filtration pressure max 1 5 bar backwash pressure max 3 0 bar permissible ph during operation between 3 10 and permissible ph for cleaning between 1 13 it is reported that there is an alternative approach to reduce the membrane clogging such as the coupling of advance oxidation processes aops with membrane processes which results in decomposition or mineralization of organic contaminants responsible for the gel layer filtration cake formation 4 4 treatment of uf concentrate electrocoagulation of uf concentrate the concentrate from the uf was treated by use of electrocoagulation process with iron anode and graphite cathode electrodes fe gr in a paralleled cell of 2 5 l capacity comprising rectangular electrodes with recirculation in order to remove mostly ss and cod since it contains high amount of collides and suspended solids these parameters and their ranges were chosen on the basis of preliminary studies and then adjusted on the basis of the preliminary results the operating parameters were the current intensity 0 to 1 5 a the electrolysis time 20 min to 90 min and settling time 30 min to 90 min the ec eo of the concentrate was done for each of the two possible electrode configurations by varying the current intensity first the optimal current density was determined for each of the both configurations 10 20 and 40 ma cm2 the results showed that with an iron or aluminum anode the best configuration is the bipolar for the removal of the cod in addition it is less expensive as the energy point of view with 0 90 m3 of concentrate moreover the experiments were carried out for the two types of anodes namely iron and aluminum in order to study the effect of the electrode material in the determined optimal configuration bipolar 1 a the iron anode showed the higher performance for cod removal fig 8 displays the percentages of reduction of the cod at the different current densities during 60 min of operation furthermore fig 5 shows the npeo3 17 was removed successfully from uf concentrate in fact the ec involves the anodic dissolution of electrode materials to generate monomeric and polymeric species and hydroxide floc with high adsorption capacity performing as coagulants the processes in the bulk by the mechanism of bridging of coagulants species and adsorption of surfactants were predominant over the involvement of npeo3 17 in the ec processes which are just in charge of the electro generation of coagulants by increasing the number of ethoxylate chains which represents the more hydrophilicity of the surfactant the tendency to adsorb on the flocs is decreased and they remained in solution in a higher proportion 51 4 5 treatment of uf filtrate 4 5 1 electro oxidation of the uf filtrate the raw effluent from the commercial laundry was filtered as it passed through the ultrafiltration membrane after collecting the filtrate in a separate tank eo tests were carried out in an electrolytic reactor with a volume of 0 5 l various tests were carried out to determine the best operating conditions for the treatment of the filtrate originating from the lw the effects of various parameters such as the type of electrodes anodic and cathodic ph current intensity and electrolysis time were studied fig 9 a shows the efficiency of the eo process for different anodes ti iro2 ti pt and bdd a current intensity of 12 a a recirculation flow rate of 0 4 l min and a graphite cathode were imposed during this experiment an electrolyte 3 g l of na2so4 solution was added to the filtrate during the electrolysis an electrolysis operated during 120 min the use of the bdd as anode allowed a rapid elimination of the cod 77 reduction in 30 min and a total reduction of 99 after 120 min of treatment while by use of ti iro2 and ti pt electrodes elimination rates after 120 min of treatment were approximately 50 in the case of using these two electrodes ti iro2 and ti pt the oxidation kinetics of the cod was relatively slow these two electrodes did not allow to obtain the required residual concentration of cod 100 mg l for a possible reuse of treated lw the differences observed during this study can be explained by the fact that the bdd electrodes are much more efficient for the production of oxidizing agents such as hydroxyl radicals that attack the organic matters on the surface of the anodes direct oxidation on the other hand the bdd electrodes are also known for the production of persulphates h2s2o8 which can also react effectively with organic matters indirect oxidation indeed the bdd is known for its strong oxygen surge this helps to minimize the formation of oxygen parasitic reaction and it is in favor of the formation of hydroxyl radicals main desired reaction moreover fig 9b illustrates the effect of intensity of cod removal which resulted in higher cod removal at higher current as expected fig 5 presents the results of npeo3 17 oxidation in light of the results it can be seen that at 30 min of treatment the npeo3 17 removal reaches to 75 indicating a significant degradation of npeo3 17 by electrooxidation the oxidation process can decompose both the npeo3 17 and the polyethylene glycols formed as by products from npeo3 17 degradation 40 however since the concentration is relatively low relative to the total chemical oxygen demand the percentage degradation of cod are much lower 64 thus the treatment time must be increased in order to meet the recommendations for the reuse of greywater in the washing cycle of the laundry for a treatment time of 60 min the removal of cod and total organic carbon toc obtained 84 and 87 respectively the reduction of the npeo3 17 is also significant 92 6 therefore a treatment time of 60 min was chosen as optimum level because after 60 min the elimination of the cod remains stable and reaches a plateau a treatment time shorter than 60 min does not allow a significant reduction of the parameters to meet the reuse recommendations however the conductivity of the treated lw is higher than recommended values for reusing tables 3 and 4 4 5 2 adsorption processes 4 5 2 1 adsorption isotherm activated carbon ac and polymeric resins are of the most favorable materials for application of liquid phase treatment including the organic matters the batch or static experiments have been done in order to determine the equilibrium isotherm maximum adsorption capacity of contaminants to do that 100 ml of uf filtrate was added to different amount of adsorbent and was shaken up to 3 h at room temperature 20 1 c under 100 rpm equilibrium loading of cod are computed as follows 14 q e c 0 c e v m where q e is the equilibrium adsorbed cod c 0 is the initial concentration c e is the equilibrium concentration v is the volume of solution and m is the mass of adsorbent the results are presented in fig 10 generally the results of cod adsorptions were close for both adsorbents and gac showed slightly higher performance the langmuir adsorption generally can be expressed as follows 52 53 15 q e q m k a c e 1 k a c e and according to this equation there are 4 different types of linear forms as follows 16 t y p e 1 p l o t t i n g c e q e v s c e c e q e 1 q m c e 1 k a q m 17 t y p e 2 p l o t t i n g 1 q e v s 1 c e 1 q e 1 q m k l 1 c e 1 q m 18 t y p e 3 p l o t t i n g q e v s q e c e q e q m 1 k a q e c e 19 t y p e 4 p l o t t i n g q e c e v s q e q e c e k a q m k a q e the equilibrium isotherm of cod in this study obeys the langmuir ii isotherm formula 54 where kl 0 0013 qm 21 51 for resin and kl 0 0004 qm 69 93 for activated carbon which kl and qm are constants related to adsorption capacity and energy or net enthalpy of adsorption respectively so the mentioned equation in the manuscript is langmuir type 2 which represents unrestricted monolayer multilayer adsorption 4 5 2 2 dynamic adsorption in a column the uf filtrate was processed using polymeric resin pr and granular activated carbon gac adsorption system in order to investigate the performance of removal mostly npeo3 17 and cod adsorbents are classified into natural adsorbents and synthetic adsorbents hydrophobic mesoporous resins and polystyrene based hyper crosslinked polymer adsorbents are suitable options for removal of organic substances from wastewater because of the variations in surface area porosity and functionality of polymeric adsorbents they have been progressively more viewed as a resin for selective removal of specific organic compounds from wastewater 55 57 the optimum operating time and influent adsorbent ratio are the most important parameters in such a process two sets of experiments were carried out using gac and pr in different htr the sampled water of uf effluent was injected into the two identical columns as described earlier experiments were carried out in a tank containing 20 l of uf filtrate water which was well mixed the influent was clear and had an initial turbidity of around 1 ntu and a ph of 8 10 superficial contact time was chosen in the range of 6 30 min the flowrate was fixed using masterflex pump model 77201 62 as illustrated in fig 11 the conductivity of the effluent treated by resin was remarkably lower than effluent treated by gac but after a while 2 h for hrt 6 3 h for hrt 10 and 5 h for hrt 15 conductivities of effluents of both systems reached to the same level and stayed approximately constant simultaneously slight increase in ph was recorded at the outlet of column containing gac ph 10 vs 9 whereas at the outlet of column containing resin a considerable decrease in ph was measured ph 4 vs 9 the residual concentrations of cod recorded at the outlet of columns fig 11 slightly increased during first 2 h of operation and then remained constant as time passed the lowest residual concentration of cod was observed at the outlet of column at the beginning of operation and at higher hrt both resin and gac materials were equally effective in removing cod however resin was more efficient for removing npeo3 17 fig 5 because of its capability of hydrophobic organic species separation and its non ionic form this study showed the possibility of using granular gac and resin pr as adsorbent materials to remove npeo3 17 from contaminated water nevertheless for cod removal gac has slightly higher efficiency on the other hand the drawback of the gac is its effect for marginally increasing in turbidity of the treated water 1 turbidity 2 also the experiment by applying hrt 30 min was performed and the improvement of the water quality was obtained but its performance was not significant compared to hrt 15 table 3 the turbidity of effluent of ac was so high during first 10 min of operation which could not be collected as treated water which means that the activated carbon should be prewashed with demi water prewashing of the activated carbon has been performed in 15 min velocity 10 m s by demi water until the turbidity of the effluent reached to 0 3 ntu regarding the cod values of treated water with adsorption process it seemed that it was relatively high to be reused but it is surely meet the recommended values for rejection tss ph and turbidity were also very close to recommended values the adsorption of npeo3 17 from aqueous solutions mostly depends on the specific surface area and the pore size of the adsorbent apart from the ionic form as known the surface area of a pore greater than 1 5 nm is a critical aspect for the adsorption capacity of npeo3 17 and the average pore diameter of the resins are in a range of 1 6 71 nm the adsorption mechanism can be explained by hydrophobic effects π π bonds hydrogen bonding steric effects and electrostatic interactions however for npeo3 17 the adsorption method is functioned by an interaction of the hydrophobic section of the npeo3 17 with the surface of the polymer and also by the micelles formation pore size and molecular morphology in some studies it was found that the structure and functional groups of the polymer had not an important impact on the adsorption process also the adsorption of npeo3 17 with shorter eo chains is higher than adsorption of npeo3 17 with longer eo chains the studies showed that the adsorption is affected by adsorbent surface surfactant and surfactant surfactant lateral interactions but lateral interactions are contributed more to the aminated resins than on hypercrosslinked resins and the surface interactions are mostly caused by bonding between the hydrophobic moiety of the surfactant and hydrophobic surfaces of the resins by ignoring the electrical interactions or hydrogen bonding 40 4 5 2 3 regeneration of adsorbents in view of industrial developments of the various kinds of sorbents the stability of the materials and the reproducibility of the sorption properties are of utmost importance the desorption side of the process the material should be restored close to the original condition for effective reuse with undiminished pollutant uptake and no physical change or damage since the interactions between the pollutant and adsorbent are driven mainly by hydrophobic interactions organic solvents such as ethanol are suitable candidates for the regeneration of these material 58 59 chemical regeneration method regenerating solution can comprise an aqueous solution of about 20 to about 30 v v ethanol about 1 to about 4 m m sodium hydroxide and about 0 05 to about 0 5 m m hydrogen peroxide is preferred compared to thermal regeneration which requires special handling equipment and high energy in the present investigation the regeneration method and time were examined to reuse the adsorbents by chemical regeneration thus used gac resin is regenerated by washing with roughly one to three bed volumes of an aqueous solution of about 25 v v ethanol 2 m m naoh and 0 1 m m hydrogen peroxide h2o2 59 after 48 h of adsorption the regeneration step was performed after regeneration elution step must be done with lower hrt or higher flowrate the results showed that 7 min rinsing by using hrt of 1 min is suitable for final washing regenerated adsorbent showed the performance much less than fresh adsorbent during the first one hour of operation 140 vs 50 of outlet cod however for the rest of operation e g 2 h both regenerated and fresh adsorbents showed approximately the same behaviors 148 vs 143 of cod 4 5 3 nanofiltration nf of uf filtrate membrane technology is emerging as one of the leading contenders in the recovery of water in the batch production of surfactants and detergents and concentrated products from the rinsing waters in this study the uf filtrate was processed by nano filtration nf system the pore size of nf is generally between 1 5 nm and the required pressure is in the range of 7 30 bar and the typical pure flux of the effluent is between 20 200 l m2h 60 the aim of using nf in this project is separating npeo3 17 and cod from the filtrate of uf system the optimum operating conditions such as influent pressure transmembrane pressure filtration rate and operating time were investigated according to the preliminary tests pressure vs permeate flow at various total flow rate of influent it was found that the crossflow rate velocity is not an effective factor in permeate flow however the pressure is highly effective on the permeate flowrate nevertheless for obtaining the optimum pressure we need to examine the clogging of the membrane permeate concentrate flowrate rejection rate and the energy consumption versus the volume of treated water the water flux permeating through the membrane can be directly determined from the total volume of the permeate collected at a specific period over the effective membrane area 61 permeate flow rate stayed approximately constant during the operation at constant pressure and fouling was not observed during the test normally the membrane element has to be cleaned when the normal permeate flow dropped by 10 and or the rejection passage increased by 5 10 and or the pressure drop increase around 10 15 table 3 reveals the characteristics of nf filtrate and concentrate for 85 of recovery more than 50 of conductivity and more than 80 of cod were removed by nfx and nfs and also cod rejection did not change significantly by applying different pressure range from 100 to 200 psi fig 12 a fig 12b shows the ratio of permeate over the feed flowrate at different pressure this ratio increased by increasing the tmp and by decrease in feed flowrate the feed flowrate can be decreased in order to reduce the operating cost depending on the supplied pressure by the feed pump the pressure flow curve the permeate of nf see also table 3 could meet the recommendations of reusing values of lw in terms of tss cod turbidity ph conductivity and npeo3 17 fig 5 also fig 5 b shows the npeo3 17 distribution in raw lw and in the effluent of each process including adsorption uf and nf as a result almost the main group of eo are in the range of 7 10 for different treatment although the nf by the mwco 150 300 da was able to remarkably reduce the cod however testing the nf with higher mwco of 500 da dow filmtec nf270 could not meet the reusability standards by reaching to just 35 cod rejection the rejection of inorganic contaminants by the nf membrane was relatively high as can be observed on the basis of conductivity removal conductivity 120 μs cm the nf is more appropriate for removal of organic pollutants considering the size exclusion mechanism but larger pores can be employed if electrostatic repulsion or adsorption are the main mechanisms involved in the process 62 also the previous studies showed that the adsorption was mainly controlled by the hydrophobic interaction for removal of alkyl phenol by nf method 40 4 5 3 1 electrocoagulation for nf concentrate ec of concentrate from nanofiltration has been performed in order to evaluate the possibility of treatment in this case the operating conditions were as follows volume of solution 2200 ml recirculation rate 600 ml min reactor configuration biopolar involving 4 graphite plus 4 iron current and voltage i 1 a and v 27 23 v respectively na2so4 3 6 g l for enhanced conductivity and polymer addition 10 mg l for acceleration of flocculation according to the results fig 13 ec was not able to remove the cod significantly just around 20 as expected thus the electrooxidation test was applied instead see next section this result can be explained by this fact that in the case of soluble or miscible compounds they cannot react with iron ions and thus they will not be removed by ec just a small amount of contaminant was adsorbed on the flocs and removed incidentally in another case some species only react with fe ii and form insoluble compounds while the others act vice versa so these groups can be just partially removed 63 4 5 3 2 electro oxidation of the nf concentrate as nf concentrate contains high amounts of cod which involves mostly dissolved non biodegradable matters eo is favored for treatment of this waste operating conditions were as follows anode bdd cathode graphite total volume 1 lit reactor volume 500 ml recirculation flowrate 400 cc min applied constant current i 12 a varying voltage v 23 14 v salt concentration na2so4 3 g l and duration of operation 60 min eo could successfully remove the cod of nf concentrate 80 as shown in fig 13 however the higher conductivity was observed during the test 1 55 to 7 22 ms cm moreover ph increased from 9 8 to 10 7 and the turbidity decreased from 19 to 16 ntu to reject the treated water into the surface water with cod lower than 500 mg l 20 min of operation was sufficient in this scenario 5 conclusion the present study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed pathway for the treatment of lw 1 ultrafiltration uf of raw laundry water 2 electrocoagulation electrooxidation ec eo of the concentrate from uf 3 electrooxidation eo of the filtrate from uf 4 adsorption process of uf filtrate 4 nanofiltration of uf filtrate and 5 electrooxidation of nf concentrate optimum conditions of uf process were determined as 18 psi for pressure and feed flowrate of 2 l min for 80 recovery to achieve typical cod tss turbidity and npeo3 17 rejection of 50 95 97 75 respectively under optimum operating condition for eo of uf filtrate by applying anode type of bdd and cathode type of graphite cathode a current intensity of 12 a treatment time of 45 min potentially reusable treated water could be obtained with cod value lower than of 80 treatment of the uf concentrate with ec resulted in treated water for discharge into the sewage network by the following characterization cod 500 mg l tss 200 mg l npeo3 17 200 μg l the optimum operating conditions of the ec cell were provided as bipolar configuration of fe anode and gr cathode electrode current density of 40 ma cm2 and treatment time of 45 min nf under optimum conditions p 150 psi recovery 85 permeate feed flow 15 in one pass could efficiently remove the cod and npeo3 17 and turbidity by around 80 which is certainly reusable for commercial laundry influent treatment of nf concentrate by ec illustrated inefficient process while eo showed high cod removal to reject into the environment adsorption treatment of uf filtrate revealed that under superficial hrt of 30 average cod removal was around 40 45 and it was not able to remove turbidity however npeo3 17 removal efficiency was quite high 95 and 80 for resin and gac respectively the effect of temperature on the treatment processes must be also investigated as the output lw temperature is not at the ambient temperature in case of direct treatment of effluent declarations of interest none acknowledgement this work was supported by mitacs through the mitacs accelerate program and veos water inc

produced only in the kitchen bath and laundry laundry greywater contains different kinds of chemicals such as detergents and surfactants the greywater from commercial laundries should be in conformity with specific standards prior to discharge into the municipal sewage networks therefore specific treatment processes are recommended to satisfy such a regulation 1 moreover the recycling of laundry water as toilet water irrigation water and also in the first wash cycle of the laundry makes it possible to limit drinking water consumption in the buildings reducing the environmental impacts related to the pollution generated by the discharge of liquid effluents can be managed more efficiently by reuse of treated water for specific purposes by decreasing water consumption in the industry the global required industrial water was recorded as 8 1011 m3 in 2009 and is predicted to 15 1011 m3 by 2030 closed water cycle is considered as one of the chief research issues in sustainable water field throughout various industries due to increasing water demand water depletion resources environmental considerations socio economic aspects and public health security 2 given the large quantities of produced wastewater the diversity of their origins and the complexity of their compositions the limits of conventional treatments are increasingly being pushed to meet both technical and legislative requirements to meet this requisite to explore new dynamic proactive efficient and less costly solutions becomes an imperative the textile and clothing sector usually generates wastewater that is moderately loaded with organic matters npeo3 17 and pathogens compared to the other polluting industrial activities 3 4 the commercial laundries are not only consuming large volumes of water but also producing waste effluents that are moderately loaded with pollutants 5 the detergents used by the laundries are unquestionably a source of pollutants considered endocrine disruptors including surfactants and npeo3 17 6 for instance some studies have shown that the presence of such pollutants at certain concentrations can cause genetic mutations of sex in fish 7 npeo3 17 c9h19c6h4 och2ch2 noh n 3 17 are nonionic surfactants that are used in a wide variety of industrial applications and consumer products this chemical is restricted because it can be degraded into nonylphenol np in the environment which is so toxic to aquatic systems and cause detrimental impacts in the aquatic environment 8 thus the laundries wastewater requires specific treatment to remove the contaminants in terms of npeo3 17 chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solid tss that are hazardous to aquatic ecosystems 9 despite the existence of several types of conventional treatments that allow this industry to more or less complies with its wastewater discharge standards current processes remain ineffective in reducing or eliminating refractory compounds considering the nature and behavior of refractory pollutants combined membrane and electrochemical treatment technology presents a real opportunity for this sector of activity since these technologies have proved efficient in terms of elimination of wide range of organic pollutants 10 in addition these technologies are readily available for automation enable in situ production of oxidizing and or coagulating agents and facilitate the rational management of natural resources membrane technology is a favorable candidate for a simple and efficient treatment of greywater for all purpose unrestricted reuse 11 the coupled processes can be applied to laundry wastewater by limiting the use of chemicals the space and cost of the project 12 13 the main advantage of the pressure driven membrane processes for surfactant removal from water solutions is their high selectivity without involving phase changes or chemical additives and their greater efficiency in concentrated stream recycling the quality of ultrafiltration permeate is generally not satisfactory due to the permeation of surfactant monomers to reach a satisfied low concentration of surfactants in the permeate a nanofiltration should be applied 14 for instance by applying the flux of 50 lm 2 h 1 retentions of 95 for chemical oxygen demand and anionic surfactants were observed and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of direct nanofiltration to recycle and reuse the greywater 15 on the other hand a combined system filtration adsorption allows the reduction of the cod and tss of greywater in recent years the research for low cost adsorbents has been intensified the adsorption process has also been widely used for treatment of industrial wastewater from organic and inorganic pollutants and has gained much attention from researchers 16 the incorporations intend to treat an average of 100 150 m3 per day of wastewater from laundries laundry industries therefore would like to improve its treatment line without the addition of chemicals in order to achieve the environmental discharge targets 200 μg l for npeox 10 mg l for ss and cod 100 mg l 17 the objective of this work is the development of a coupled treatment system uf ec ad uf ec nf eo and uf ec eo by applying the ad nf eo processes to the filtrate from uf that may contain cod and soluble npeo3 17 contaminants while the ec and eo processes are applied to the concentrate from the uf loaded with ss npeo3 17 and cod and nf concentrate loaded mainly by dissolved organics the mentioned coupling system is developed to treat lw in this proposed method we improved its purification process by integrating an efficient environmentally friendly and chemical free processing unit with minimal chemicals into its membrane filtration module the proposed technological approach will make it possible to treat wastewater from laundries in order to meet the environmental discharge objectives and to reuse the wastewater in the first laundry washing cycle without addition of external chemicals 1 1 background information chih ta wang et al 18 developed the technique of cod removal in the treatment of simulated laundry wastewater using electrocoagulation electroflotation technology jiantuan ge et al 19 proposed a new bipolar electrocoagulation and electroflotation for the effective removal of turbidity cod phosphate and surfactant mbas in a wide ph range 5 9 at a short hrt 5 10

surfactants by 85 96 were achieved sylwia mozia et al 21 developed the possibilities of application of a three step system combining hybrid biological treatment followed by advanced uv o3 oxidation with in situ generated o3 and membrane separation ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf to treat and reuse the wastewater from an industrial laundry xia shang et al 22 demonstrated coagulation to contaminant removal in microfiltration of laundry wastewater they suggested that additional purification methods such as reverse osmosis ro are required in order to further reduce the concentrations of cod and total phosphorus tp s šostar turk et al 23 developed the laundry wastewater treatment using conventional methods namely precipitation coagulation and the flocculation process with adsorption on granular activated carbon gac and an alternative method membrane filtrations namely ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro sumisha et al 24 developed uf process for lw treatment cod and turbidity reduction up to 88 and 98 was achieved using modified membranes this indicated that modified pes membranes are suitable for the treatment of surfactant detergent and oil from laundry wastewater in another study physico chemical pre treatment coagulation flocculation sand filtration ozonation granular activated carbon gac filtration and cross flow ultrafiltration uf were used to treat lw 25 the summary of the previous works are describe in table 1 in most of the literature the treatment of laundry wastewater lw were investigated but the reusing of this grey water was not studied deeply in this study we focused on the reusing of water by the novel sequential approach and practical combined process with no addition of extra chemicals in the process also we compared the treated water with the standards like nfs for reusing laundry wastewater 2 materials two barrels each 200 liters of wastewater have been received from veoswater quebec then they were divided into 20 buckets each 20 l and they were kept in the cold room for further experiments the following experiments were conducted at room temperature for ec 8 electrodes are placed in a plexiglas reactor 12 cm width 12 cm depth and 20 cm height the electrodes were iron anodes and graphite or stainless steel cathodes placed vertically the inter electrode distance was 1 5 cm the graphite electrodes were 10 cm in width 11 cm in length and a thickness of 0 5 cm surface area 110 cm2 the electrodes of iron aluminum and stainless steel had the same dimensions as the graphite cathode but with a thickness of 0 1 cm in order to impose a dc electric current triggering the electrochemical phenomena a generator of the extech r1 8 power supply mode type has been used this generator is capable of imposing a maximum current of 21 5 a and a maximum voltage of 32 3 v eo tests were carried out in two different electrolytic cells with distinct characteristics stirring was affected by recirculation between the two compartments recirculation was carried out using a cole parmer master flex type pump model no 7528 10 set at a speed of 250 rpm flow rate 0 4 l min the electrolytic cell used in this study for the electro oxidation treatment had 14 3 5 12 5 cm dimensions the cell could hold 0 5 l with a 0 3 l recirculation tank this plexiglas cell was designed for only two electrodes where each of the electrodes was connected to the generator grid electrode 73 cm2 made of bdd ti pt and ti iro2 were used at the anode while we tested several possible types of cathodes graphite vitreous carbon and stainless steel these cathodes were all of equal dimensions 110 cm2 uf was supplied from inge gmbh dizzerr p 2514 0 5 with mwco of 100 150 kda made by polyether sulfone pes type with a porosity of 0 02 μm 20 nm the multibore membrane developed by inge gmbh combines several capillaries of the same diameter 0 9 mm each into a single fiber nfx and nfs nanofiltration tfc spiral wound elements were purchased from synder filtration it consisted of a spiral type polyamide composite membrane module for working with a membrane surface of 3 16 m2 and having a cutoff threshold of between 150 and 300 daltons granular activated carbon gac supplied from aquamerik bc 830 a virgin activated carbon granular form 0 7 to 1 0 mm mn200 resin was a gift from the purolite company which its characteristics are shown in table 2 two plexiglas columns were used as filtration units with a dimension of 14 cm height 3 cm inside diameter each column was filled with filtering material to a height of 12 cm perforated plexiglas disks hole diameter 1 0 1 5 mm were placed at the inlet and outlet of the columns and allowed uniform distribution of the influent into the filter bed these perforated disks were horizontally installed and allowed the delimiting of the inlet and outlet zones 3 methods 3 1 electrocoagulation ec the electrocoagulation process appears to be effective for the removal of colloids suspended solids dyes humic substances and other high molecular compounds 26 28 the main reactions taking place in an electrocoagulation cell include three successive stages formation of coagulants by oxidation of the sacrificial electrode generally iron or aluminum destabilization of contaminant charges and aggregation of the destabilized compounds to form flocs for liquid solid sludge separation by decanting and or floating the main reactions occurring in an electrocoagulation cell can be described in the following three equations 1 m s m a q n n e 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 3 m a q n n o h m o h n s where m s is solid metal m a q n metal is ion such as fe2 3 al3 and m o h n s is metal hydroxide in the framework of this work two configurations were tested as follows bipolar configuration bp which only the two electrodes were connected to the two poles of the generator thus the two bonded electrodes were monopolar in terms of charges however the electrodes in the middle were charged bipolar in monopolar mp configuration all the electrodes were connected successively then therefore the two faces of each electrode were identically polarized fig 1 for each ec or eceo in case of using graphite as cathode test a volume of 2 45 l was processed in batch mode after adding the na2so4 electrolyte the treatment time was 120 min for the study of the effect of current intensity the effect of ph and configurations the electrocoagulated water was then placed in a 2 5 l glass column for the decantation step assisted by the addition of cationic polymer zetag 7563 polyelectrolyte water solution basf corporation at 10 mg l for a settling time of 60 min subsequently the supernatant was recovered for performance evaluation of cod tss and npeo3 17 by comparing the initial and final values the following procedure were performed in this study evaluating the current intensity effect 20 40 80 ma cm2 reactor configuration bipolar monopolar treatment time 15 30 45 60 90 120 min and ph 6 8 9 10 without adjustment 3 2 electro oxidation eo the anodic oxidation process has been used for a few decades for the treatment of color and certain organic pollutants such as phenol cyanides and aniline it is often used to reduce the load of cod and ammonia nitrogen or as a tertiary treatment for degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants two types of reactions are recognized in this process the direct oxidation reaction and the indirect oxidation reaction in a direct oxidation reaction the oxidation is carried out either by electrochemical conversion or by electrochemical combustion during electrochemical conversion non biodegradable organic compounds are partially oxidized to more biodegradable compounds whereas during electrochemical combustion organic pollutants are completely degraded into co2 and h2o the direct reaction is carried out in two steps at first step the anodic oxidation of the molecule of water leading to the formation of the reactive species oho which is adsorbed on an active site as m oho and in a second step the hydroxyl radical oxidizes the organic pollutant the reaction between the oxidized organic compounds and the hydroxyl radicals can lead to complete oxidation 27 29 4 h 2 o m m o h h e 5 r m o h m r o h e 6 r m o h m m c o 2 n h 2 o h e competition can occur during oxidation and thus reduce the effectiveness of pollutant

electrodes that have a high oxygen overvoltage the most commonly used anode is boron doped diamond bdd the use of these electrodes with high oxygen overvoltage implies the generation of reactive oxygen species such as the hydroxyl radical responsible for the degradation of organic matter these materials also exhibit chemical stability with respect to acidic and alkaline media to do the experiments a concentration of 3 g l na2so4 was added in order to increase the conductivity of the solution and decrease the applied voltage energy consumption in addition the recirculation flow rate was fixed at 0 4 l min thus allowing a good homogenization of the solution to be treated during the treatment an inter electrode distance is 1 5 cm operated in dynamic batch mode the recirculation was fixed at a speed of 200 rpm for that of eo flow 0 3 l min the treatment time of the filtrate with eo lasted 120 min for the study of the effect of the anode and the cathode the intensity of the current and the ph on the efficiency of the eo process quite frequent sampling every 15 min was carried out to evaluate the cod abatement as a function of time in the context of optimization of electrolytic processes several tests were carried out to determine the optimum operating conditions for electro oxidation of the filtrate type of anode cathode type current intensity treatment time

filtration of raw water was carried out using an ultrafiltration membrane the raw wastewater to be treated feed tank is conveyed by means of a variable flow pump in the membrane system the dc motor speed control pump kbpc 240d was used to supply and recirculate the water installed on the skid as depicted in fig 3 crossflow filtration ended once the percentage of the concentrate reached 20 of the initial volume filtered 80 recovery between two ultrafiltration tests the membrane was washed by recirculating acidic hcl and basic naoh solutions of 0 1 wt for 10 15 min for each washing step recirculation of distilled water into the system for 10 min was required after washing steps performance of uf of raw laundry wastewater was investigated in terms of transmembrane pressure tmp influent flowrate and cleaning and backwash effects in order to determine the rejection rate of cod turbidity tss and npeo the characteristics of uf has been shown by table 2 3 4 nanofiltration nf the material of membrane has hydrophilic charge which can promote run times between cleaning and reduce clogging rates an experimental unit of the pilot type was used it was a tangential filtration unit operating in batch mode with permeate recirculation in the feed tank the experimental unit comprised a recirculation pump hydro cell with a speed regulator capable of delivering a flow rate of a maximum hydrostatic pressure 1000 psi the system was equipped with a 50 l feed tank a continuous flow meter on the concentrate rotameter type a manometer and a concentrate outlet needle valve for securing the transmembrane pressure table 2 shows the characteristics of nf filtration module 3 5 adsorption ad adsorbents like gac and pr can be applied for the liquid phase including the filtration of the organic particles color chlorine chloramines taste heavy metals etc in water the use of different filter materials allowed us to study the effectiveness of the filtration unit as a function of different filter beds the columns were respectively filled with gac and polymeric resin pr a superficial hydraulic retention times hrt calculated according to total volume of the bed of 6 10 15 and 30 min were imposed by master flex type pump in each column adjusted for continuous flow rate 30 3 6 analysis 3 6 1 ph and conductivity analyzes we monitored ph and conductivity by measuring these two

whole was put for drying at 105 c overnight the difference between the weight of the cup before and after drying makes it possible to calculate the concentration of ts 3 6 4 analysis of nonylphenol ethoxylates npeo3 17 dichloromethane formic acid and methanol were supplied from fischer scientific and pk30 supelclean envi carb 500 mg 6 ml from sigma aldrich for npeo3 17 analysis in order to evaluate the concentration of surfactants we used the method of ma 400 npeo 1 0 this method allowed us to determine the concentrations of ethoxylated nonylphenols which include 3 to 17 ethoxylate

wastewater from commercial laundries wastewater from commercial laundries constitutes a source of pollution to be taken into consideration table 3 shows the physicochemical characteristics of laundry wastewater lw from some studies worldwide 25 19 5 33 as well as those provided by a commercial laundry sample analysis in this work a comparison between the two analyses would allow us to draw up a rather specific picture of the physicochemical quality of a commercial laundry water in general the lws are characterized by colloidal pollutions in the fluid surfactants detergents form so called micellar colloidal suspensions whose dimensions are in a range from nanometer to micrometer a micelle is a spheroidal group from 0 001 to 0 300 μm of molecules possessing a hydrophilic polar head and a hydrophobic chain 34 micelle formation occurs at a certain temperature kraft temperature and at a certain concentration called critical micellar concentration cmc 35 the npeo3 17 then form agglomerates of a few hundred molecules which constitute the turbidity of the lw whether in suspension or in solution the presence of organic matters in laundry effluents constitutes the major part of the polluting load with chemical oxygen demands of up to 1000 mg l suspended solids concentrations of up to 200 mg l and npeo3 17 concentrations of up to 2200 μg l mainly related to detergent additions it is by integrating the volume of these waters that one could appreciate their true ecological impact indeed the discharge of 250 m³ of lw into the sewer each day means that loads of 250 kg cod and 50 kg of tss are transported to the municipal wastewater treatment plant this input is considered as a surplus for the treatment plant that will receive the laundry effluent from the sanitary sewers their direct rejection in a receptor medium can cause severe environmental damage 18 36 38 commercial lws also include nitrogen 32 4 26 2 sulfur 21 1 19 1 and phosphate 94 6 75 4 compounds volatile fatty acids and heavy metals 39 table 4 shows the standards of rejection and reuse of lw as well according to environmental quality standards eqs the annual average concentration for np in water surface were recommended at 0 3 μg l the us environmental protection agencies epa developed a criterion recommendations whereby np concentration should not exceed 6 6 μg l and 1 7 μg l in freshwater and saltwater respectively 40 these waters are generally compatible with the operating requirements of a biological treatment however the bod5 cod ratio may vary from 2 to 10 and the bod5 concentration is relatively low in most effluents although biological processes aerobic and anaerobic are efficient and economical for the treatment of certain effluents they often require high retention time and large ponds which sometimes limit the implementation of these technologies in large scale moreover biological processes are in most cases unable to completely eliminate refractory soluble pollutants 27 41 42 due to their low biodegradability the bod5 cod ratio is often low the treatment of this type of wastewater is particularly difficult also the high surfactant content would cause abnormalities for biological treatment processes 25 dysfunctions could then be expected at the treatment plant stations followed by release of pollutants into the receiving environment it may even be that the treatment station is partially acting on the degradation of some refractory pollutants notably the npeo3 17 annual production of np reaches 154 200 tons in the united states 73 500 tons in europe 16 500 tons in japan and 16 000 tons in china 43 with the development of the textile sector all over the world production of np was estimated at 600 000 tons in 2003 np is used as a raw material in the synthesis of npeo3 17 and as a monomer in the production of polymers npeo3 17 are made by reacting np with ethylene oxide such reaction yields npeo3 17 with a mixture of ethylene chain lengths in addition an estimated of 4 million tons of alkylphenol ethoxylates are used annually worldwide 85 are sold as npeo3 17 these large quantities are generally found in the environment and especially in the aquatic environment 95 of the quantity produced 44 indeed they are persistent organic molecules in the aquatic environment moderately bioaccumulative and extremely toxic to aquatic organisms 34 these facts explain their omnipresence in nature and in living organisms 4 1 1 npeo3 17 presence in laundry detergents and cloths analyses of 6 commercial types of lunacy detergents at quebec results not shown showed that 50 of them contains high amounts of npeo3 17 1600 6700 μg l and 50 of them does not contain this kind of surfactant moreover three different cloths have been washed in three steps to see the npeo3 17 come from the textile industries sources the results demonstrated 7240 7690 μg kg of npeo3 17 per kg of cloths 4 2 preliminary test electrocoagulation of raw water ec of lw preliminary electrocoagulation experiments on raw wastewater were performed to evaluate whether electrochemical treatment such as electrocoagulation would be able to treat this greywater to meet the rejection standards to do this two configurations were tested bipolar and monopolar at current densities of 20 40 and 80 ma cm2 in order to study the effect of different parameters on cod tss and npeo3 17 abatement current density configuration type and treatment time were studied these conditions have a close relationship with the process efficiency by analyzing the effect of intensity on total cod abatement we can see that the rate of elimination improves by increasing the intensity of the imposed current it is observed that between 0 5 and 1 a the removal of cod increases by 18 2 while the reduction of cod does not increase significantly from 1 a to 2 a thus by imposing greater intensity the power consumption of the system would be greater and would therefore increase treatment costs the production of sludge from electrocoagulation is an important parameter for the optimization of electrocoagulation process in fact a large production of sludge means that there has been a strong anodic dissolution of the metal used as anode 29 41 this dissolution is proportional to the current intensity and the treatment time the relationship between current density and the amount of dissolved metals can be expressed by faraday s law 11 m q m n f i t v f m n where q is charge dosage m is the amount of electrode material dissolved i is the current intensity t is the operation time in s m is the molar mass of the electrode material n represents the number of electrons in redox reaction valence and f is faraday s constant 96 500 c mol moreover charge dosage rate can be defined as following equation which is proportional to the rate of metal dissolution into a unit volume of solution 12 d q d t i v j a v where j is current density a is surface area od electrode and v is the volume of the solution 45 it turns out that if the amount of produced sludge is higher the cost related to the management of sludge also increases undeniably the majority of the costs about 60 related to the operation of a treatment station are invested in sludge management 46 it is therefore relevant to try to minimize the amount of sludge in order to limit the costs associated with the management of sludge in terms of cod abatement we noted that the yields achieved by imposing 1 and 2 a are almost similar and allow to meet the standards of discharges to the sewer less than 500 mg l however the power consumption and quantity of sludge give the advantage for an intensity of 1 a vs the ones of 2 a finally the preliminary tests revealed that by using the iron and stainless steel ss electrodes in bipolar configuration i 1 a t 60 min 65 elimination of the cod could be obtained the principle of coagulation 26 makes it possible to eliminate colloids and suspended solids by adsorption on settling flocs it turns out that these flocs by decanting trap parts of the cod furthermore ec tests with iron stainless steel in monopolar configuration under the same operating conditions were carried out yields are slightly similar in terms of cod removal 5 10 improvement over the full range of intensities tested the applied current densities are identical however the volume of sludge is much higher in monopolar 16 5 22 5 51 5 compared to bipolar 12 5 17 30 in addition the power consumption is higher in monopolar the following section compares electrocoagulation iron ss and electrocoagulation electrooxidation iron graphite the difference between ec and ec eo is related to the type of cathode actually the use of cathode graphite allows the in situ production of oxidizing agents 47 in such a system the dissolved oxygen present in the solution is reduced to form hydrogen peroxide oxidant with a redox potential 1 77 v 13 o 2 2 h e h 2 o 2 in bipolar non branched graphite electrodes are doubly polarized a reducing face allows the production of h2o2 and an oxidizing face allows the production of active chlorine oxidant by oxidizing the chloride ions if exists in the water the ss electrode usually placed as a cathode characterized by its production of hydrogen bubbles the rise of these bubbles on the surface of the solution towards the air is a phenomenon which is accompanied with a solid liquid separation the fact of studying the effect of the cathode allows us to highlight the intervention of oxidizing agents compared to h2 bubbles the study of the ec eo iron graphite cell was done following the same procedure as that for the optimization of the electrocoagulation fig 4 compares the ec and the ec eo operated at the same current densities 20 40 and 80 ma cm2 with a treatment time of 60 min in bipolar configuration the results of preliminary ec and ec eo tests on raw lw showed that the yields in terms of cod and tss reductions did not vary significantly without a doubt for current densities between 10 20 and 40 ma cm2 the ec allows the removal of 46 65 and 67 6 of the cod while the ec eo yielded 53 68 and 72 slightly higher for cod therefore the use of the graphite cathode instead of stainless steel has been favored given the relatively low conductivity of the lws the current density of 80 ma cm2 could not be tested in the case of the monopolar configuration the monopolar configuration generated on average twice as much metal sludge 18 and 25 v v but the bipolar configuration produced less sludge 8 and 11 v v for a current density of between 20 and 40 ma cm2 the energy consumption recorded for the monopolar configuration 10 25 kw h m3 is higher than that measured in the case of the bipolar configuration 4 22 kw h m3 for identical current densities the applied current intensities in the case of the monopolar configuration are much higher than those imposed for the bipolar configuration as known the production of metal sludge and the quantity of electricity depend on the imposed current intensity the results of ec by use of aluminum electrode instead of fe led to 2 7 lower efficiency in cod removal data not shown the ph adjustment did not highly affect the overall performance of the process 4 3 ultrafiltration treatment of lw the uf test was carried out with a filter surface area of 0 5 m2 the pes base polymer promotes the hydrophilicity of the membrane this property increases the capacity of the membrane surface to adsorb organics thereby improving operating performance with less membrane fouling the manufacturer produces a defined ultra thin filtration surface interface on the inside of the several capillaries with extremely low resistance to permeation and with inner pores measuring approximately 20 nm to protect the membranes from damaging particles an screen filter with a cut off of 80 μm was installed in the circulation system and at the point where the cleaning solution is fed into the system the recommended volume flow rate for cleaning uf modules is at least 20 lmh and for normal operation is 60 lmh and the maximum hydraulic pressure loss is 1 bar 14 5 psi the solution to be treated feed tank is conveyed by means of a variable flow pump in the membrane system under the effect of the applied pressure to the concentrate side by means of the valve located on the concentrate flow part of the solution passes into the permeate and is accumulated in the permeate reservoir the recovery level is determined from the volumes of the initial feed solution the permeate and the concentrate during the process the pressure of the membrane increases due to gradual clogging however in order to have the constant pressure the outlet valve of the membrane on concentrate line is opened gradually the average pressure drop of membrane was 5 0 psi the system operated between 10 60 minutes with and without backwash to collect a volume of filtrate of 80 recovery of the total volume while the concentrate was recirculated in the feed tank the transmembrane pressure tmp and the filtrate and concentrate flow rates are affected by the membrane clogging especially when the concentrate is recirculated indeed the recirculation of the concentrate forces the particles with diameters close to the micrometers to be adsorbed by electrostatic forces onto the pores of the membrane these particles cause clogging at the pores particles with diameters around 0 02 μm the concentrate is characterized by a high cod and tss loads the filtrate contains only dissolved organic matter codt codd however the 4 3 mg l of tss found in the filtrate which does not represent the suspended matters but rather refer to the presence of colloids of less than 0 02 μm in diameter fig 5 a shows the concentration of npeo3 17 in raw and treated lw by different methods it can be noted that the concentrate is more loaded with npeo3 17 than the filtrate there are several reasons for the distribution of npeo3 17 during ultrafiltration first the npeo3 17 form micelles with diameters greater than 0 02 μm and thus end up in the concentrate instead of the filtrate also the npeo3 17 could be adsorbed on the surface of tss and colloids due to their log kow of 4 48 43 and could interact with the uf membrane which is organic surfactants as amphiphilic compounds have a hydrophilic or polar moiety part head and hydrophobic or nonpolar moiety tail the hydrophilic part can be anionic cationic dipolar or nonionic the hydrophobic part composed of hydrocarbon chain the surfactants can be partly dissolved in the water however if the concentration is higher than critical micelle concentration cmc they aggregate and produce micelles thus the tails flock to the interior due to avoid contact with water as a hydrophobic property and the heads stay in the outer of surface du to increase the contact with water depending on the condition such as temperature ph etc they can be in spherical cylindrical lamellar or two dimensionally into bilayers or discoidal micelles their radii vary in a range from 10 nm to over 100 nm 48 49 fig 6 a b show the data for ultrafiltration at different pressures and feed flowrates the inlet flowrate of membrane is increased by rising the tmp while the reverse has been observed for concentrate flow moreover at lower inlet flowrate lower permeate flow is observed and by increasing the feed flowrate 0 4 2 l min the permeate flow enhanced dramatically however at the threshold of 2 l m increasing in flowrate to 2 5 l min just resulted in slightly increase in permeate flow the results also demonstrate that by increasing both pressure and flowrate the operating time for treatment of certain volume of raw lw is decreased slightly due to increase in permeate flowrate also in the first 10 min of operation the highest reduction in flowrate takes place for instance for treatment of 20 ls of raw lw between 25 30 minutes is required to operate which demonstrate the requirement of backwash or chemical cleaning the maximum permeate flux was recorded as 120 l m2 h and the minimum one was recorded as 36 l m2 h which is lower than the recommended value 60 l m2 h which leads to waste of energy according to the results around 50 of tss more than 50 of cod and about 98 of turbidity have been removed by uf table 3 however unremarkable changes in conductivity and ph were observed which shows that uf is not able to remove ions in the solution despite low turbidity and relatively moderate cod content but not enough low cod value the uf permeate still contained high amounts of inorganic salts conductivity 700 μs cm which are not desired to reuse water in the laundry process therefore nf is required as the final treatment step before a possible reuse of this water in the laundry system as the uf was not able to remove efficiently the cod and npeo3 17 in the raw feed the mechanism of the separation is considered as mostly through sorption to membrane surface rather than size exclusion hydrophobic adsorption mostly influenced by the hydrophobicity of the pollutants is a main removal mechanism which aided organics removal as sorption is major mechanism with uf membranes for organic pollutants removal novel approaches to enhance surface morphology improve sorption site and surface modification could boost the performance of uf membranes in this case 50 4 3 1 effect of backwash and chemical cleaning on membrane performance fig 7 a b show the one step filtration to understand the backwash effect on membrane performance backwash was performed for around 60 s by applying the pressures of 30 psi as input and 20 psi as output to be sufficiently effective the backwash must be conducted at a flux rate of at least 230 lmh 135 gfd 115 l h 1 9 l min effective backwash duration varies between 30 and 60 s depending on the quality of the feed water and the type of operating cycle as can be seen permeate flux starts from 1 2 l min and reaches to about half of initial flux in 10 min this experiment shows that the ideal backwash is required every 10 min besides by using the flowrate of 2 5 l min the retentate flux is much higher than permeate flowrate not shown to reduce the ratio of concentrate flowrate over permeate flowrate the experiments were done by choosing 2 l min fig 7a shows the longtime of uf operation using 100 l of raw wastewater feed flowrate of 2 l min each 10 min the backwash was performed using permeate water every time between 85 100 increase in permeate flowrate was recorded according to these results after 1 h of operation each 10 min back wash the membrane needs chemical washing the permeability of membrane were decreased in a range of 64 78 during the 30 min of operation without any backwash however after a backwash with demi water potable or uf permeate water as well during 60 s the enhancement of permeability was recorded at 67 fig 7b between each run or when the membrane is clogged chemical washing is required it was carried out by the procedure mentioned in materials and methods section alkaline followed by acid to clean off organic deposits and to clean off inorganic deposits and or remove precipitation respectively depending on the quality of the source water and the flux rate the filtration time backwash and chemical cleaning vary furthermore the chemically enhanced backwash ceb process was performed with typical parameters for an intake flux rate of 120 lmh 1 l min the operating parameters were permissible tmp filtration pressure max 1 5 bar backwash pressure max 3 0 bar permissible ph during operation between 3 10 and permissible ph for cleaning between 1 13 it is reported that there is an alternative approach to reduce the membrane clogging such as the coupling of advance oxidation processes aops with membrane processes which results in decomposition or mineralization of organic contaminants responsible for the gel layer filtration cake formation 4 4 treatment of uf concentrate electrocoagulation of uf concentrate the concentrate from the uf was treated by use of electrocoagulation process with iron anode and graphite cathode electrodes fe gr in a paralleled cell of 2 5 l capacity comprising rectangular electrodes with recirculation in order to remove mostly ss and cod since it contains high amount of collides and suspended solids these parameters and their ranges were chosen on the basis of preliminary studies and then adjusted on the basis of the preliminary results the operating parameters were the current intensity 0 to 1 5 a the electrolysis time 20 min to 90 min and settling time 30 min to 90 min the ec eo of the concentrate was done for each of the two possible electrode configurations by varying the current intensity first the optimal current density was determined for each of the both configurations 10 20 and 40 ma cm2 the results showed that with an iron or aluminum anode the best configuration is the bipolar for the removal of the cod in addition it is less expensive as the energy point of view with 0 90 m3 of concentrate moreover the experiments were carried out for the two types of anodes namely iron and aluminum in order to study the effect of the electrode material in the determined optimal configuration bipolar 1 a the iron anode showed the higher performance for cod removal fig 8 displays the percentages of reduction of the cod at the different current densities during 60 min of operation furthermore fig 5 shows the npeo3 17 was removed successfully from uf concentrate in fact the ec involves the anodic dissolution of electrode materials to generate monomeric and polymeric species and hydroxide floc with high adsorption capacity performing as coagulants the processes in the bulk by the mechanism of bridging of coagulants species and adsorption of surfactants were predominant over the involvement of npeo3 17 in the ec processes which are just in charge of the electro generation of coagulants by increasing the number of ethoxylate chains which represents the more hydrophilicity of the surfactant the tendency to adsorb on the flocs is decreased and they remained in solution in a higher proportion 51 4 5 treatment of uf filtrate 4 5 1 electro oxidation of the uf filtrate the raw effluent from the commercial laundry was filtered as it passed through the ultrafiltration membrane after collecting the filtrate in a separate tank eo tests were carried out in an electrolytic reactor with a volume of 0 5 l various tests were carried out to determine the best operating conditions for the treatment of the filtrate originating from the lw the effects of various parameters such as the type of electrodes anodic and cathodic ph current intensity and electrolysis time were studied fig 9 a shows the efficiency of the eo process for different anodes ti iro2 ti pt and bdd a current intensity of 12 a a recirculation flow rate of 0 4 l min and a graphite cathode were imposed during this experiment an electrolyte 3 g l of na2so4 solution was added to the filtrate during the electrolysis an electrolysis operated during 120 min the use of the bdd as anode allowed a rapid elimination of the cod 77 reduction in 30 min and a total reduction of 99 after 120 min of treatment while by use of ti iro2 and ti pt electrodes elimination rates after 120 min of treatment were approximately 50 in the case of using these two electrodes ti iro2 and ti pt the oxidation kinetics of the cod was relatively slow these two electrodes did not allow to obtain the required residual concentration of cod 100 mg l for a possible reuse of treated lw the differences observed during this study can be explained by the fact that the bdd electrodes are much more efficient for the production of oxidizing agents such as hydroxyl radicals that attack the organic matters on the surface of the anodes direct oxidation on the other hand the bdd electrodes are also known for the production of persulphates h2s2o8 which can also react effectively with organic matters indirect oxidation indeed the bdd is known for its strong oxygen surge this helps to minimize the formation of oxygen parasitic reaction and it is in favor of the formation of hydroxyl radicals main desired reaction moreover fig 9b illustrates the effect of intensity of cod removal which resulted in higher cod removal at higher current as expected fig 5 presents the results of npeo3 17 oxidation in light of the results it can be seen that at 30 min of treatment the npeo3 17 removal reaches to 75 indicating a significant degradation of npeo3 17 by electrooxidation the oxidation process can decompose both the npeo3 17 and the polyethylene glycols formed as by products from npeo3 17 degradation 40 however since the concentration is relatively low relative to the total chemical oxygen demand the percentage degradation of cod are much lower 64 thus the treatment time must be increased in order to meet the recommendations for the reuse of greywater in the washing cycle of the laundry for a treatment time of 60 min the removal of cod and total organic carbon toc obtained 84 and 87 respectively the reduction of the npeo3 17 is also significant 92 6 therefore a treatment time of 60 min was chosen as optimum level because after 60 min the elimination of the cod remains stable and reaches a plateau a treatment time shorter than 60 min does not allow a significant reduction of the parameters to meet the reuse recommendations however the conductivity of the treated lw is higher than recommended values for reusing tables 3 and 4 4 5 2 adsorption processes 4 5 2 1 adsorption isotherm activated carbon ac and polymeric resins are of the most favorable materials for application of liquid phase treatment including the organic matters the batch or static experiments have been done in order to determine the equilibrium isotherm maximum adsorption capacity of contaminants to do that 100 ml of uf filtrate was added to different amount of adsorbent and was shaken up to 3 h at room temperature 20 1 c under 100 rpm equilibrium loading of cod are computed as follows 14 q e c 0 c e v m where q e is the equilibrium adsorbed cod c 0 is the initial concentration c e is the equilibrium concentration v is the volume of solution and m is the mass of adsorbent the results are presented in fig 10 generally the results of cod adsorptions were close for both adsorbents and gac showed slightly higher performance the langmuir adsorption generally can be expressed as follows 52 53 15 q e q m k a c e 1 k a c e and according to this equation there are 4 different types of linear forms as follows 16 t y p e 1 p l o t t i n g c e q e v s c e c e q e 1 q m c e 1 k a q m 17 t y p e 2 p l o t t i n g 1 q e v s 1 c e 1 q e 1 q m k l 1 c e 1 q m 18 t y p e 3 p l o t t i n g q e v s q e c e q e q m 1 k a q e c e 19 t y p e 4 p l o t t i n g q e c e v s q e q e c e k a q m k a q e the equilibrium isotherm of cod in this study obeys the langmuir ii isotherm formula 54 where kl 0 0013 qm 21 51 for resin and kl 0 0004 qm 69 93 for activated carbon which kl and qm are constants related to adsorption capacity and energy or net enthalpy of adsorption respectively so the mentioned equation in the manuscript is langmuir type 2 which represents unrestricted monolayer multilayer adsorption 4 5 2 2 dynamic adsorption in a column the uf filtrate was processed using polymeric resin pr and granular activated carbon gac adsorption system in order to investigate the performance of removal mostly npeo3 17 and cod adsorbents are classified into natural adsorbents and synthetic adsorbents hydrophobic mesoporous resins and polystyrene based hyper crosslinked polymer adsorbents are suitable options for removal of organic substances from wastewater because of the variations in surface area porosity and functionality of polymeric adsorbents they have been progressively more viewed as a resin for selective removal of specific organic compounds from wastewater 55 57 the optimum operating time and influent adsorbent ratio are the most important parameters in such a process two sets of experiments were carried out using gac and pr in different htr the sampled water of uf effluent was injected into the two identical columns as described earlier experiments were carried out in a tank containing 20 l of uf filtrate water which was well mixed the influent was clear and had an initial turbidity of around 1 ntu and a ph of 8 10 superficial contact time was chosen in the range of 6 30 min the flowrate was fixed using masterflex pump model 77201 62 as illustrated in fig 11 the conductivity of the effluent treated by resin was remarkably lower than effluent treated by gac but after a while 2 h for hrt 6 3 h for hrt 10 and 5 h for hrt 15 conductivities of effluents of both systems reached to the same level and stayed approximately constant simultaneously slight increase in ph was recorded at the outlet of column containing gac ph 10 vs 9 whereas at the outlet of column containing resin a considerable decrease in ph was measured ph 4 vs 9 the residual concentrations of cod recorded at the outlet of columns fig 11 slightly increased during first 2 h of operation and then remained constant as time passed the lowest residual concentration of cod was observed at the outlet of column at the beginning of operation and at higher hrt both resin and gac materials were equally effective in removing cod however resin was more efficient for removing npeo3 17 fig 5 because of its capability of hydrophobic organic species separation and its non ionic form this study showed the possibility of using granular gac and resin pr as adsorbent materials to remove npeo3 17 from contaminated water nevertheless for cod removal gac has slightly higher efficiency on the other hand the drawback of the gac is its effect for marginally increasing in turbidity of the treated water 1 turbidity 2 also the experiment by applying hrt 30 min was performed and the improvement of the water quality was obtained but its performance was not significant compared to hrt 15 table 3 the turbidity of effluent of ac was so high during first 10 min of operation which could not be collected as treated water which means that the activated carbon should be prewashed with demi water prewashing of the activated carbon has been performed in 15 min velocity 10 m s by demi water until the turbidity of the effluent reached to 0 3 ntu regarding the cod values of treated water with adsorption process it seemed that it was relatively high to be reused but it is surely meet the recommended values for rejection tss ph and turbidity were also very close to recommended values the adsorption of npeo3 17 from aqueous solutions mostly depends on the specific surface area and the pore size of the adsorbent apart from the ionic form as known the surface area of a pore greater than 1 5 nm is a critical aspect for the adsorption capacity of npeo3 17 and the average pore diameter of the resins are in a range of 1 6 71 nm the adsorption mechanism can be explained by hydrophobic effects π π bonds hydrogen bonding steric effects and electrostatic interactions however for npeo3 17 the adsorption method is functioned by an interaction of the hydrophobic section of the npeo3 17 with the surface of the polymer and also by the micelles formation pore size and molecular morphology in some studies it was found that the structure and functional groups of the polymer had not an important impact on the adsorption process also the adsorption of npeo3 17 with shorter eo chains is higher than adsorption of npeo3 17 with longer eo chains the studies showed that the adsorption is affected by adsorbent surface surfactant and surfactant surfactant lateral interactions but lateral interactions are contributed more to the aminated resins than on hypercrosslinked resins and the surface interactions are mostly caused by bonding between the hydrophobic moiety of the surfactant and hydrophobic surfaces of the resins by ignoring the electrical interactions or hydrogen bonding 40 4 5 2 3 regeneration of adsorbents in view of industrial developments of the various kinds of sorbents the stability of the materials and the reproducibility of the sorption properties are of utmost importance the desorption side of the process the material should be restored close to the original condition for effective reuse with undiminished pollutant uptake and no physical change or damage since the interactions between the pollutant and adsorbent are driven mainly by hydrophobic interactions organic solvents such as ethanol are suitable candidates for the regeneration of these material 58 59 chemical regeneration method regenerating solution can comprise an aqueous solution of about 20 to about 30 v v ethanol about 1 to about 4 m m sodium hydroxide and about 0 05 to about 0 5 m m hydrogen peroxide is preferred compared to thermal regeneration which requires special handling equipment and high energy in the present investigation the regeneration method and time were examined to reuse the adsorbents by chemical regeneration thus used gac resin is regenerated by washing with roughly one to three bed volumes of an aqueous solution of about 25 v v ethanol 2 m m naoh and 0 1 m m hydrogen peroxide h2o2 59 after 48 h of adsorption the regeneration step was performed after regeneration elution step must be done with lower hrt or higher flowrate the results showed that 7 min rinsing by using hrt of 1 min is suitable for final washing regenerated adsorbent showed the performance much less than fresh adsorbent during the first one hour of operation 140 vs 50 of outlet cod however for the rest of operation e g 2 h both regenerated and fresh adsorbents showed approximately the same behaviors 148 vs 143 of cod 4 5 3 nanofiltration nf of uf filtrate membrane technology is emerging as one of the leading contenders in the recovery of water in the batch production of surfactants and detergents and concentrated products from the rinsing waters in this study the uf filtrate was processed by nano filtration nf system the pore size of nf is generally between 1 5 nm and the required pressure is in the range of 7 30 bar and the typical pure flux of the effluent is between 20 200 l m2h 60 the aim of using nf in this project is separating npeo3 17 and cod from the filtrate of uf system the optimum operating conditions such as influent pressure transmembrane pressure filtration rate and operating time were investigated according to the preliminary tests pressure vs permeate flow at various total flow rate of influent it was found that the crossflow rate velocity is not an effective factor in permeate flow however the pressure is highly effective on the permeate flowrate nevertheless for obtaining the optimum pressure we need to examine the clogging of the membrane permeate concentrate flowrate rejection rate and the energy consumption versus the volume of treated water the water flux permeating through the membrane can be directly determined from the total volume of the permeate collected at a specific period over the effective membrane area 61 permeate flow rate stayed approximately constant during the operation at constant pressure and fouling was not observed during the test normally the membrane element has to be cleaned when the normal permeate flow dropped by 10 and or the rejection passage increased by 5 10 and or the pressure drop increase around 10 15 table 3 reveals the characteristics of nf filtrate and concentrate for 85 of recovery more than 50 of conductivity and more than 80 of cod were removed by nfx and nfs and also cod rejection did not change significantly by applying different pressure range from 100 to 200 psi fig 12 a fig 12b shows the ratio of permeate over the feed flowrate at different pressure this ratio increased by increasing the tmp and by decrease in feed flowrate the feed flowrate can be decreased in order to reduce the operating cost depending on the supplied pressure by the feed pump the pressure flow curve the permeate of nf see also table 3 could meet the recommendations of reusing values of lw in terms of tss cod turbidity ph conductivity and npeo3 17 fig 5 also fig 5 b shows the npeo3 17 distribution in raw lw and in the effluent of each process including adsorption uf and nf as a result almost the main group of eo are in the range of 7 10 for different treatment although the nf by the mwco 150 300 da was able to remarkably reduce the cod however testing the nf with higher mwco of 500 da dow filmtec nf270 could not meet the reusability standards by reaching to just 35 cod rejection the rejection of inorganic contaminants by the nf membrane was relatively high as can be observed on the basis of conductivity removal conductivity 120 μs cm the nf is more appropriate for removal of organic pollutants considering the size exclusion mechanism but larger pores can be employed if electrostatic repulsion or adsorption are the main mechanisms involved in the process 62 also the previous studies showed that the adsorption was mainly controlled by the hydrophobic interaction for removal of alkyl phenol by nf method 40 4 5 3 1 electrocoagulation for nf concentrate ec of concentrate from nanofiltration has been performed in order to evaluate the possibility of treatment in this case the operating conditions were as follows volume of solution 2200 ml recirculation rate 600 ml min reactor configuration biopolar involving 4 graphite plus 4 iron current and voltage i 1 a and v 27 23 v respectively na2so4 3 6 g l for enhanced conductivity and polymer addition 10 mg l for acceleration of flocculation according to the results fig 13 ec was not able to remove the cod significantly just around 20 as expected thus the electrooxidation test was applied instead see next section this result can be explained by this fact that in the case of soluble or miscible compounds they cannot react with iron ions and thus they will not be removed by ec just a small amount of contaminant was adsorbed on the flocs and removed incidentally in another case some species only react with fe ii and form insoluble compounds while the others act vice versa so these groups can be just partially removed 63 4 5 3 2 electro oxidation of the nf concentrate as nf concentrate contains high amounts of cod which involves mostly dissolved non biodegradable matters eo is favored for treatment of this waste operating conditions were as follows anode bdd cathode graphite total volume 1 lit reactor volume 500 ml recirculation flowrate 400 cc min applied constant current i 12 a varying voltage v 23 14 v salt concentration na2so4 3 g l and duration of operation 60 min eo could successfully remove the cod of nf concentrate 80 as shown in fig 13 however the higher conductivity was observed during the test 1 55 to 7 22 ms cm moreover ph increased from 9 8 to 10 7 and the turbidity decreased from 19 to 16 ntu to reject the treated water into the surface water with cod lower than 500 mg l 20 min of operation was sufficient in this scenario 5 conclusion the present study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed pathway for the treatment of lw 1 ultrafiltration uf of raw laundry water 2 electrocoagulation electrooxidation ec eo of the concentrate from uf 3 electrooxidation eo of the filtrate from uf 4 adsorption process of uf filtrate 4 nanofiltration of uf filtrate and 5 electrooxidation of nf concentrate optimum conditions of uf process were determined as 18 psi for pressure and feed flowrate of 2 l min for 80 recovery to achieve typical cod tss turbidity and npeo3 17 rejection of 50 95 97 75 respectively under optimum operating condition for eo of uf filtrate by applying anode type of bdd and cathode type of graphite cathode a current intensity of 12 a treatment time of 45 min potentially reusable treated water could be obtained with cod value lower than of 80 treatment of the uf concentrate with ec resulted in treated water for discharge into the sewage network by the following characterization cod 500 mg l tss 200 mg l npeo3 17 200 μg l the optimum operating conditions of the ec cell were provided as bipolar configuration of fe anode and gr cathode electrode current density of 40 ma cm2 and treatment time of 45 min nf under optimum conditions p 150 psi recovery 85 permeate feed flow 15 in one pass could efficiently remove the cod and npeo3 17 and turbidity by around 80 which is certainly reusable for commercial laundry influent treatment of nf concentrate by ec illustrated inefficient process while eo showed high cod removal to reject into the environment adsorption treatment of uf filtrate revealed that under superficial hrt of 30 average cod removal was around 40 45 and it was not able to remove turbidity however npeo3 17 removal efficiency was quite high 95 and 80 for resin and gac respectively the effect of temperature on the treatment processes must be also investigated as the output lw temperature is not at the ambient temperature in case of direct

14453,this work presents a new and simple modification approach to fabricate a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane with superior permeation separation and antifouling performance dopamine was introduced by blending into the membrane casting solution and the membrane was prepared using a classic non solvent induced phase separation technique the prepared flat sheet membrane was then dipped into a tris hcl buffer solution with a ph of 8 5 to trigger the polymerization of dopamine into polydopamine the effects of the modification on the membrane characteristics were analyzed in terms of a change in the chemical components hydrophilicity surface porosity and mechanical strength in addition the permeation separation and fouling resistant performance were studied by means of a filtration experiment using deionized water and humic acid solution as feeds the results revealed that the addition of dopamine successfully increased the porosity by 300 hydrophilicity by 180 and water flux performance by 600 compared to the original membrane polymerization of dopamine into the polydopamine layer recovered the loss of rejection due to pore enlargement by dopamine blending from 91 to 93 in addition the blended and polymerized membrane successfully recovered up to 92 of pure water flux after backwash which indicates the superior antifouling performance it can be concluded that this new technique can be a potential approach to produce membranes for the water treatment process with overall excellent performance keywords antifouling membrane dopamine polydopamine self polymerization water treatment 1 introduction in the last decade the application of membranes in the water treatment process has been continuously growing especially those made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polymer 1 2 this is due to the many excellent merits offered by pvdf such as outstanding mechanical traits as well as the high resistance to temperature and chemicals 1 2 however similar to most of the other polymeric materials pvdf possesses an exceptionally hydrophobic characteristic which is disadvantageous to the membrane as it promotes susceptibility to fouling especially during the separation process of pollutant containing water 3 5 fouling is caused by the interaction between the membrane surface and contaminants like protein microorganisms humic substances and so forth which leads to the accumulation of particles that simultaneously cover the surface and clog the membrane pores 3 6 8 the fouling phenomenon must be avoided as it causes a decline in the permeation performance of the membrane and requires more energy and cost for cleaning which also results in the shortened service life of the membrane 9 in an effort to mitigate the occurrence of fouling various endeavors have been made and will continue to be developed one such endeavor is modifying the membrane with other hydrophilic substances such as non organic particles or organic ones like polymers of the many materials lately polydopamine has been extensively developed as a hydrophilic modifier due to its super hydrophilic nature resulting from abundant hydroxyl groups 10 12 pda modification of the membrane can be undertaken through various techniques such as coating which is the most popular and commonly used 13 by simply dipping the membrane into an alkaline tris buffered dopamine solution a pda film will grow on the membrane surface due to polymerization 14 16 evidently a great amount of research has reported the successful improvement in hydrophilicity by surface coating with pda 11 17 23 due to the adhesiveness of pda surface coating by pda can also be useful as a medium to further modify the membrane with other functionalized components 13 however this technique has quite a problematic drawback as in most cases the pda layer deposited on the surface of the membrane causes blocking of the surface pores which leads to a decline in the flux performance 19 20 24 26 besides coating another way to add dopamine to the membrane is by blending the blending method can be performed by directly introducing dopamine into the membrane dope solution or by adding beforehand in the form of prepared pda large 27 nano sized 28 or nanotube shaped particles 27 in some cases the modification is done by adding the dopamine and oxidator into the dope solution and allowing the dopamine to undergo in situ polymerization to form pda just like the procedure reported in the work of jiang and research team 28 this method succeeded in increasing the hydrophilicity and antifouling as well as the permeation performance of the membrane due to the increase in the porosity and pore size however the promoted pore properties bring about major disadvantages to the membrane such as a decline in the permeate purity and mechanical strength 28 29 in this study we aim to provide a solution to overcome the trade off between the surface coating and blending of dopamine by combining both techniques through a simple and new approach the dopamine is blended into a pvdf based dope solution and the membrane is prepared by the nips method once ready the membrane is immersed in an alkaline tris hcl buffer to allow the growth of polydopamine through the auto oxidation polymerization reaction of dopamine in the membrane system this method idea was first proposed by ma et al 30 who performed a similar modification on electrospun pvdf membrane for which excellent results were reported after polymerization the dopamine blended electrospun membrane showed improved hydrophilicity with a water contact angle of 0 as well as outstanding performance of the dye and oil water separation unfortunately no information regarding membrane fouling behavior was available in their published report therefore this study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the fouling resistant performance of pvdf ultrafiltration membrane modified through this new and simple combination approach to the best of our knowledge this is the first time this method has been implemented on this type of uf membrane the resulting membrane is expected to have a good permeation performance from the blending of pore former dopamine particles as well as high separation antifouling and mechanical properties from the formation of polydopamine the study on permeation separation and antifouling performance was conducted using deionized water and 50 ppm of humic acid solution in addition other basic characteristics of the membrane were also evaluated such as chemical composition pore property hydrophilicity and mechanical strength 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials solef 6012 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf solvay specialty polymer usa with mw of 380 000 was used as the base polymer for the membrane n n dimethylacetamide dmac provided by wako pure chemical industries japan was employed as a solvent dopamine hydrochloride sigma aldrich germany and tris 2 amino 2 hydroxymethyl 1 3 propanediol wako pure chemical industries japan were used as an additive and buffer solution respectively humic acid sigma aldrich germany was used as a model foulant for the filtration experiment deionized di water was utilized as a non solvent for the membrane solvent for tris buffer preparation and as a feed for the filtration experiment 2 2 fabrication of the membranes membranes were prepared using a common non solvent induced phase separation nips technique by dissolving 15 g of pvdf powder and 2 g of dopamine in 85 g of dmac which was then stirred to homogeneity at 70 c the ready solution was cast on the surface of the glass plate with a film thickness of approximately 2 mm then dipped in a non solvent bath the finished membrane was then stored in di water and named p d0 membrane meanwhile some of these membranes were immersed in a tris hcl solution with ph 8 5 for 24 h and codenamed p d24 as a comparison control the original pvdf membrane was also made with the same procedure protocol and conditions but without the addition of dopamine this membrane was identified as p 2 3 membrane characterizations in order to understand the influences of dopamine and polydopamine modification on the pvdf membrane a series of basic characterizations was performed spectra analysis to see the changes in the chemical composition of the membrane after dopamine blending and polymerization was carried out using a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance instrument ftir atr thermo scientific id5 atr nicolet is5 ftir spectrophotometer japan the porosity ε of the membranes was determined by adapting the gravimetric method which was calculated using eq 1 31 32 1 ε ω w ω d ρ a l 100 ω w and ω d are the respective weights of the membrane sample in the wet and dried state kg ρ is the density of water 998 kg m3 a and l represent the surface area m2 and thickness m of the membrane sample respectively the water contact angle measurement using the sessile drop technique was performed to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the membranes by means of a contact angle meter drop master 300 kyowa interface science co japan a droplet of water with a volume of 1 μl was dropped on the outer surface of the membrane the data were recorded at the time when the droplet touched the membrane surface and the angle formed was used to represent the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane the measurement was done on at least five different points of the sample and the results were then averaged a tensile instrument autograph ags j shimadzu co japan was used to measure the mechanical strength of the membrane following the astm d638 14 protocol samples were prepared in a dumbbell shape with a length of 40 mm and a width of 4 mm the thickness of the membrane samples was measured by means of a micrometer mcd130 25 niigataseiki co japan the tensile rate was controlled at 20 mm min all the samples were tested in a dried condition the test was carried out in triplicate for each type of membrane and the average data were taken to minimize experimental error 2 4 filtration experiment and fouling study experiments were carried out using a uf cross flow module set using di water and humic acid as a representative of a natural organic matter nom contaminant model as feed solution prior to the collection of experimental data the membrane was first compacted for three hours by streaming pure water through the membrane at 1 bar pressure until stable flux data were obtained following that the filtration experiment of pure water was operated for two hours in which the volume of permeate was recorded every 15 min the flux of pure water jwb is calculated using eq 2 2 j q a δ t q is the amount of generated permeate l a is the area of working membrane m2 and δt is the time span of data collection during the filtration process h after two hours of operation the experiment was continued for another two hours by replacing the feed to the 50 ppm humic acid solution with a similar operating procedure and conditions the humic acid flux jha was also determined using eq 2 filtrated humic acid was accommodated and the concentration was inspected by means of a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the concentration data were used to determine the membrane rejection performance using eq 3 3 r 1 c p c f 100 cf and cp are the concentrations of humic acid before filtration feed solution and after filtration permeate respectively once finished the cleaning procedure of the membrane was carried out by backwash where the fouled membrane was placed upside down in the uf cell and di water was streamed into the cell at 0 1 bar for 20 min subsequently the membrane was placed back in its original position and the filtration experiment using di water was reconducted to obtain a pure water flux after membrane cleaning jwa the data from this whole set of experiments can be used to measure the quantity of water flux that can be restored after backwashing commonly known as the flux recovery ratio frr the frr is also an indication of whether the membrane has good fouling resistance through its easiness to be cleaned during backwash the frr is calculated using eq 4 4 f r r j w a j w b in addition to frr the fouling behavior of the membrane can also be studied from the flux loss caused by total fouling total fouling is a combination of reversible fouling rr which is the water flux that can be returned after cleaning and irreversible fouling rir which is the loss of flux due to fouling phenomena that cannot be returned even after physical washing of the membrane these three fouling behaviors are expressed mathematically in eqs 5 7 5 r t j w b j h a j w b 6 r r j w a j h a j w b 7 r i r j w b j w a j w b 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical composition in order to confirm the presence of dopamine and polydopamine in the membrane after modification analysis of the chemical composition was carried out by means of atr ftir the results are shown in fig 1 it is seen that the addition of dopamine in the membrane system causes a significant chemical change which is marked by the detection of new functional components not seen in the original pvdf membrane such as the amine nh and hydroxyl oh groups these functional groups are specific components of dopamine that are constructed of the catechol chain nhoh 12 14 by simply blending dopamine in the dope solution p d0 the intensity of existing specific groups is not very pronounced in comparison to that in the polymerized membrane p d24 from fig 1 the only obvious change in p d0 is at a wavenumber of 1600 1 cm which is attributed to the nh bond from dopamine 14 this is presumably because the modification is done in a blending manner and hence it is likely that most of the dopamine particle leached out during the immersion precipitation in a non solvent 29 on the other hand the same blended membrane after being dipped in a tris hcl solution ph 8 5 for 24 h showed a more significant change chemically as seen in fig 1 aside from a similar nh peak at 1600 1 cm new additional peaks are also prominently observed at 1505 1 cm and a spectrum range of 3100 3500 1 cm which belong to the bending vibration of the nh2 group and catechol nh oh respectively 14 15 33 immersion in the alkaline tris buffer solution triggered the dopamine to be polymerized via an auto oxidation reaction resulting in the formation of polydopamine with super long repeated catechol chains 14 33 thus it is reasonable that the specific groups detected have a large intensity in the polymerized dopamine blended pvdf membrane 3 2 membrane porosity to study the effect of dopamine polydopamine on the pore property of the membrane porosity evaluation was done using the gravimetric method for which the results are given in table 1 it is clear that the addition of dopamine increases the membrane porosity due to the working function of the dopamine particles as a pore former during phase inversion this phenomenon can be explained as follows since dopamine is a hydrophilic catechol bearing compound blending it into the dope solution increases the hydrophilicity of the dope solution which promotes the exchange rate between the solvent and the non solvent 29 34 moreover the dopamine particles possess high affinity to water due to their hydrophilic nature which will make the particles prone to travel to the top surface of membrane film or even being leached out 29 all of these events bring about the formation of a membrane with a porous structure as shown in table 1 a reduction in porosity is observed in the p d24 membrane this is attributed to the blocking of the pores by the pda film resulting from the polymerization 17 because polymerization is carried out on a dopamine blended membrane the possibility of pda formation is not only inside the membrane but also on the surface as over a prolonged time the deposited particles will form a thin film 30 3 3 surface hydrophilicity of membrane membrane hydrophilicity can be estimated by measuring the water contact angle which is the tendency or ability of the water to wet adsorb on the membrane surface a low contact angle indicates that the membrane surface has a large tendency to be wetted by water which in other words means the membrane is hydrophilic 35 the results of the water contact angle measurement of all the membranes are given in fig 2 overall it is seen that the pure pvdf membrane has the highest angle contact amongst the three prepared membranes with an average value of 77 1 6 this is a result of the original nature of pvdf which is a hydrophobic polymer caused by its fluorine content 1 after the introduction of dopamine into the membrane system by blending the contact angle of the non polymerized p d0 membrane decreased considerably to 57 1 2 and remarkably reduced further to 43 0 9 after the membrane was polymerized for 24 h in a tris buffered solution p d24 this is caused by the presence of the nh and oh groups from dopamine which increase in intensity after polymerization into polydopamine as previously confirmed by the ftir analysis results in section 3 1 moreover because the polymerization process is carried out after blending pda is formed not only on the surface of the membrane like common coating technique but also in the internal structure of the membrane 30 the presence of hydrophilic groups from dopamine polydopamine increases the interaction of water with the membrane surface hence the resulting contact angle of the water droplets becomes smaller more hydrophilic 28 36 in addition the hydrophilicity of the membrane is also influenced by other parameters such as the size and number of pores 14 as evidenced by the result of porosity evaluation given in table 1 the addition of dopamine increases the porosity of the membrane hence water is absorbed easily which causes the contact angle formed when the water droplet touches the membrane surface to become smaller altogether it can be concluded that the simple polymerization of dopamine blended membrane can further enhance the membrane interaction with water which is favorable for the permeation performance 3 4 permeability performance pure water permeability is a fundamental and vital characteristic of the membrane that needs to be evaluated especially when the membrane is expected to be applied to the water treatment process fig 3 presents the results of the pure water flux of all the membranes from the filtration experiment using di water as the feed a pure pvdf membrane showcases an extremely low pure water flux of only 17 l m2 h which is attributed to the dense and hydrophobic surface characteristics of pvdf for the blended p d0 pure water flux increases by up to 650 due to the improved membrane porosity however the polymerized p d24 membrane shows a slim decline in pure water flux which is caused by a growth of a thin pda layer on the membrane surface from the result of the tris induced dopamine polymerization despite giving a high hydrophilic nature to the membrane the additional layer of pda on the membrane surface results in the possibility of pore blockage and gives the membrane more resistance to water thus the obtained water flux is slightly lower than that of the non polymerized dopamine blended membrane 36 3 5 separation performance the effect of the addition of dopamine and polymerization on the flux and rejection of the solute was observed through the filtration experiment using a cross flow uf module with a humic acid solution 50 ppm as a feed from the results in fig 4 an increment in the humic acid solution water flux is seen in the dopamine modified membranes either without or with polymerization the increase is generally due to the enhanced porosity property of the dopamine blended membrane in contrast a small decrease in the humic acid solution water flux on the p d24 membrane is observed due to the formation of a polydopamine thin film on the membrane surface after polymerization as discussed in the previous section as for the rejection of humic acid all three types of membrane showcase an excellent separation performance with values above 90 the original pvdf membrane produces the highest rejection of 95 due to its dense structure despite having a more porous structure both dopamine blended membranes without and with polymerization generate permeate with a high rejection of 91 and 93 respectively once again the slim decline of humic acid rejection for p d0 membrane is caused by the improved surface porosity some nano sized humic acid particles managed to pass the membrane through the pores however after polymerization the p d24 membrane successfully recovers about 2 of rejection due to the formation of a thin pda layer on the surface 3 6 antifouling performance fouling occurs due to the build up of organic foulant on the surface or inside the membrane pores fouling on membranes can be either reversible or irreversible reversible fouling is a fouling phenomenon in which the accumulated foulant can still be washed by a simple membrane cleaning process meanwhile irreversible fouling is caused by the contaminant being absorbed by the membrane or into the membrane pores which cannot be physically removed 3 the effect of fouling on the membrane can be observed from the permeation performance of the membrane which is indicated by flux loss during the filtration process as shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows an illustration of the flux performance of the three prepared membranes in one round of the three stage filtration experiment the first test was carried out to obtain the initial water flux jwb and then continued with filtration using the ha solution once the ha filtration is completed the membrane was cleaned by backwashing then the pure water experiment by changing the feed to di water again this whole set of experiments is meant to investigate the effectivity of membrane cleaning in removing the formed fouling which can be measured by the quantity of flux that can be recovered after the cleaning commonly termed as the flux recovery ratio frr fig 6 shows the data resulting from the experiments related to the evaluation of the antifouling properties of the membrane as seen in general the dopamine modified membranes have much better antifouling properties than those of the original pvdf membrane based on the results of the separation performance which have been discussed in the previous section it appears that the original pvdf membrane has a high rejection which means that the membrane has a relatively smaller size or and number of pores the dense surface of the non modified pvdf causes humic acid to accumulate only on the surface of the membrane and does not enter the pore thus the flux loss caused by total fouling is only 46 however due to the hydrophobic nature of pvdf the accumulated foulant can hardly be cleaned during the backwash which is indicated by the extremely small reversible fouling value of only 0 8 thus simultaneously resulting in a very low recovery of flux which is only 54 of the initial flux as for the p d0 and p d24 membranes the pore characteristics are enhanced in terms of the number and size with the addition of dopamine which is also evidenced from the results of the pure water flux and slight decrease in humic acid rejection the improved surface porosity provides more contact area for humic acid particles to deposit on the membrane surface thus it is reasonable that the degree of flux loss due to total fouling on the p d0 and p d24 membranes is slightly larger at 54 nevertheless both of the dopamine modified membranes have greater reversible fouling values because the dopamine polydopamine increases the hydrophilicity of the membrane the hydrophilic surface reduces the binding interaction between the membrane and the humic acid molecules through the formation of a tight formed water layer on the surface and also inside the pores of the p d24 membrane which plays a role as a barrier to prevent the adsorption and penetration of the hydrophobic humic acid molecules 18 36 therefore the foulant attached to the membranes has a great chance of being cleaned and increasing the flux restoration up to 84 and 92 for the p d0 and p d24 membranes respectively from these overall results it can be concluded that the formation of pda through simple tris triggered polymerization can promote the antifouling properties of hydrophobic pvdf membrane 3 7 mechanical properties mechanical strength is an important parameter for membranes that operate by using pressure as a driving force because the membranes have to be sufficiently able to withstand the transmembrane pressure during operation in addition a membrane with weak mechanical strength will be easily destroyed during the cleaning process the mechanical properties of membranes are generally presented in the form of tensile and elongation at break the data obtained from this study are presented in fig 7 membrane p pure pvdf has a very high tensile strength of nearly 8 mpa with an elongation at break exceeding 120 pvdf is well known as a polymer with very high ductility 37 however the addition of dopamine in the membrane system brings about a decrease in the tensile and elongation at break values of the p d0 membrane to 4 6 mpa and 59 5 respectively the weakening is suspected to be due to the influence of dopamine which acts as a pore former causing the formation of macrovoids in the bulk structure of the membrane 28 38 however by soaking the dopamine blended membrane in tris hcl buffer solution for 24 h the tensile and elongation at the break of the resulting p d24 increased again this is because the pda formed from the polymerization reaction glues the structure of the membrane together due to its adhesive properties which causes the network linking of the membrane to be more strongly connected to each other hence more energy is needed to break the membrane 39 40 4 conclusion the fouling resistance and filtration performance of dopamine blended pvdf uf membrane has been significantly enhanced through modification by a new and simple tris buffered polymerization technique the existence of dopamine blended in a membrane system elevates the porosity of the membrane which causes a significant increase in the flux performance from 17 l m2 h to hundreds l m2 h whereas immersing the blended membrane in a tris hcl triggers the polymerization of dopamine into pda inside and on the surface of the membrane the formed pda enriches the presence of the catechol groups which further increases the hydrophilicity of the pvdf membrane to a water contact angle of 43 simultaneously the polymerization greatly enhances the fouling resistance of the membrane which is indicated by frr values up to 92 in addition improvement of the rejection and mechanical properties of the membrane also occurs due to the formation of a thin pda film on the membrane surface this new technique can be an alternative method for dopamine related membrane modification that can answer the trade off issue of the common coating or blending techniques acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the

23 due to the adhesiveness of pda surface coating by pda can also be useful as a medium to further modify the membrane with other functionalized components 13 however this technique has quite a problematic drawback as in most cases the pda layer deposited on the surface of the membrane causes blocking of the surface pores which leads to a decline in the flux performance 19 20 24 26 besides coating another way to add dopamine to the membrane is by blending the blending method can be performed by directly introducing dopamine into the membrane dope solution or by adding beforehand in the form of prepared pda large 27 nano sized 28 or nanotube shaped particles 27 in some cases the modification is done by adding the dopamine and oxidator into the dope solution and allowing the dopamine to undergo in situ polymerization to form pda just like the procedure reported in the work of jiang and research team 28 this method succeeded in increasing the hydrophilicity and antifouling as well as the permeation performance of the membrane due to the increase in the porosity and pore size however the promoted pore properties bring about major disadvantages to the membrane such as a decline in the permeate purity and mechanical strength 28 29 in this study we aim to provide a solution to overcome the trade off between the surface coating and blending of dopamine by combining both techniques through a simple and new approach the dopamine is blended into a pvdf based dope solution and the membrane is prepared by the nips method once ready the membrane is immersed in an alkaline tris hcl buffer to allow the growth of polydopamine through the auto oxidation polymerization reaction of dopamine in the membrane system this method idea was first proposed by ma et al 30 who performed a similar modification on electrospun pvdf membrane for which excellent results were reported after polymerization the dopamine blended electrospun membrane showed improved hydrophilicity with a water contact angle of 0 as well as outstanding performance of the dye and oil water separation unfortunately no information regarding membrane fouling behavior was available in their published report therefore this study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the fouling resistant performance of pvdf ultrafiltration membrane modified through this new and simple combination approach to the best of our knowledge this is the first time this method has been implemented on this type of uf membrane the resulting membrane is expected to have a good permeation performance from the blending of pore former dopamine particles as well as high separation antifouling and mechanical properties from the formation of polydopamine the study on permeation separation and antifouling performance was conducted using deionized water and 50 ppm of humic acid solution in addition other basic characteristics of the membrane were also evaluated such as chemical composition pore property hydrophilicity and mechanical strength 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials solef 6012 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf solvay specialty polymer usa with mw of 380 000 was used as the base polymer for the membrane n n dimethylacetamide dmac provided by wako pure chemical industries japan was employed as a solvent dopamine hydrochloride sigma aldrich germany and tris 2 amino 2 hydroxymethyl 1 3 propanediol wako pure chemical industries japan were used as an additive and buffer solution respectively humic acid sigma aldrich germany was used as a model foulant for the filtration experiment deionized di water was utilized as a non solvent for the membrane solvent for tris buffer preparation and as a feed for the filtration experiment 2 2 fabrication of the membranes membranes were prepared using a common non solvent induced phase separation nips technique by dissolving 15 g of pvdf powder and 2 g of dopamine in 85 g of dmac which was then stirred to homogeneity at 70 c the ready solution was cast on the surface of the glass plate with a film thickness of approximately 2 mm then dipped in a non solvent bath the finished membrane was then stored in di water and named p d0 membrane meanwhile some of these membranes were immersed in a tris hcl solution with ph 8 5 for 24 h and codenamed p d24 as a comparison control the original pvdf membrane was also made with the same procedure protocol and conditions but without the addition of dopamine this membrane was identified as p 2 3 membrane characterizations in order to understand the influences of dopamine and polydopamine modification on the pvdf membrane a series of basic characterizations was performed spectra analysis to see the changes in the chemical composition of the membrane after dopamine blending and polymerization was carried out using a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance instrument ftir atr thermo scientific id5 atr nicolet is5 ftir spectrophotometer japan the porosity ε of the membranes was determined by adapting the gravimetric method which was calculated using eq 1 31 32 1 ε ω w ω d ρ a l 100 ω w and ω d are the respective weights of the membrane sample in the wet and dried state kg ρ is the density of water 998 kg m3 a and l represent the surface area m2 and thickness m of the membrane sample respectively the water contact angle measurement using the sessile drop technique was performed to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the membranes by means of a contact angle meter drop master 300 kyowa interface science co japan a droplet of water with a volume of 1 μl was dropped on the outer surface of the membrane the data were recorded at the time when the droplet touched the membrane surface and the angle formed was used to represent the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane the measurement was done on at least five different points of the sample and the results were then averaged a tensile instrument autograph ags j shimadzu co japan was used to measure the mechanical strength of the membrane following the astm d638 14 protocol samples were prepared in a dumbbell shape with a length of 40 mm and a width of 4 mm the thickness of the membrane samples was measured by means of a micrometer mcd130 25 niigataseiki co japan the tensile rate was controlled at 20 mm min all the samples were tested in a dried condition the test was carried out in triplicate for each type of membrane and the average data were taken to minimize experimental error 2 4 filtration experiment and fouling study experiments were carried out using a uf cross flow module set using di water and humic acid as a representative of a natural organic matter nom contaminant model as feed solution prior to the collection of experimental data the membrane was first compacted for three hours by streaming pure water through the membrane at 1 bar pressure until stable flux data were obtained following that the filtration experiment of pure water was operated for two hours in which the volume of permeate was recorded every 15 min the flux of pure water jwb is calculated using eq 2 2 j q a δ t q is the amount of generated permeate l a is the area of working membrane m2 and δt is the time span of data collection during the filtration process h after two hours of operation the experiment was continued for another two hours by replacing the feed to the 50 ppm humic acid solution with a similar operating procedure and conditions the humic acid flux jha was also determined using eq 2 filtrated humic acid was accommodated and the concentration was inspected by means of a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the concentration data were used to determine the membrane rejection performance using eq 3 3 r 1 c p c f 100 cf and cp are the concentrations of humic acid before filtration feed solution and after filtration permeate respectively once finished the cleaning procedure of the membrane was carried out by backwash where the fouled membrane was placed upside down in the uf cell and di water was streamed into the cell at 0 1 bar for 20 min subsequently the membrane was placed back in its original position and the filtration experiment using di water was reconducted to obtain a pure water flux after membrane cleaning jwa the data from this whole set of experiments can be used to measure the quantity of water flux that can be restored after backwashing commonly known as the flux recovery ratio frr the frr is also an indication of whether the membrane has good fouling resistance through its easiness to be cleaned during backwash the frr is calculated using eq 4 4 f r r j w a j w b in addition to frr the fouling behavior of the membrane can also be studied from the flux loss caused by total fouling total fouling is a combination of reversible fouling rr which is the water flux that can be returned after cleaning and irreversible fouling rir which is the loss of flux due to fouling phenomena that cannot be returned even after physical washing of the membrane these three fouling behaviors are expressed mathematically in eqs 5 7 5 r t j w b j h a j w b 6 r r j w a j h a j w b 7 r i r j w b j w a j w b 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical composition in order to confirm the presence of dopamine and polydopamine in the membrane after modification analysis of the chemical composition was carried out by means of atr ftir the results are shown in fig 1 it is seen that the addition of dopamine in the membrane system causes a significant chemical change which is marked by the detection of new functional components not seen in the original pvdf membrane such as the amine nh and hydroxyl oh groups these functional groups are specific components of dopamine that are constructed of the catechol chain nhoh 12 14 by simply blending dopamine in the dope solution p d0 the intensity of existing specific groups is not very pronounced in comparison to that in the polymerized membrane p d24 from fig 1 the only obvious change in p d0 is at a wavenumber of 1600 1 cm which is attributed to the nh bond from dopamine 14 this is presumably because the modification is done in a blending manner and hence it is likely that most of the dopamine particle leached out during the immersion precipitation in a non solvent 29 on the other hand the same blended membrane after being dipped in a tris hcl solution ph 8 5 for 24 h showed a more significant change chemically as seen in fig 1 aside from a similar nh peak at 1600 1 cm new additional peaks are also prominently observed at 1505 1 cm and a spectrum range of 3100 3500 1 cm which belong to the bending vibration of the nh2 group and catechol nh oh respectively 14 15 33 immersion in the alkaline tris buffer solution triggered the dopamine to be polymerized via an auto oxidation reaction resulting in the formation of polydopamine with super long repeated catechol chains 14 33 thus it is reasonable that the specific groups detected have a large intensity in the polymerized dopamine blended pvdf membrane 3 2 membrane porosity to study the effect of dopamine polydopamine on the pore property of the membrane porosity evaluation was done using the gravimetric method for which the results are given in table 1 it is clear that the addition of dopamine increases the membrane porosity due to the working function of the dopamine particles as a pore former during phase inversion this phenomenon can be explained as follows since dopamine is a hydrophilic catechol bearing compound blending it into the dope solution increases the hydrophilicity of the dope solution which promotes the exchange rate between the solvent and the non solvent 29 34 moreover the dopamine particles possess high affinity to water due to their hydrophilic nature which will make the particles prone to travel to the top surface of membrane film or even being leached out 29 all of these events bring about the formation of a membrane with a porous structure as shown in table 1 a reduction in porosity is observed in the p d24 membrane this is attributed to the blocking of the pores by the pda film resulting from the polymerization 17 because polymerization is carried out on a dopamine blended membrane the possibility of pda formation is not only inside the membrane but also on the surface as over a prolonged time the deposited particles will form a thin film 30 3 3 surface hydrophilicity of membrane membrane hydrophilicity can be estimated by measuring the water contact angle which is the tendency or ability of the water to wet adsorb on the membrane surface a low contact angle indicates that the membrane surface has a large tendency to be wetted by water which in other words means the membrane is hydrophilic 35 the results of the water contact angle measurement of all the membranes are given in fig 2 overall it is seen that the pure pvdf membrane has the highest angle contact amongst the three prepared membranes with an average value of 77 1 6 this is a result of the original nature of pvdf which is a hydrophobic polymer caused by its fluorine content 1 after the introduction of dopamine into the membrane system by blending the contact angle of the non polymerized p d0 membrane decreased considerably to 57 1 2 and remarkably reduced further to 43 0 9 after the membrane was polymerized for 24 h in a tris buffered solution p d24 this is caused by the presence of the nh and oh groups from dopamine which increase in intensity after polymerization into polydopamine as previously confirmed by the ftir analysis results in section 3 1 moreover because the polymerization process is carried out after blending pda is formed not only on the surface of the membrane like common coating technique but also in the internal structure of the membrane 30 the presence of hydrophilic groups from dopamine polydopamine increases the interaction of water with the membrane surface hence the resulting contact angle of the water droplets becomes smaller more hydrophilic 28 36 in addition the hydrophilicity of the membrane is also influenced by other parameters such as the size and number of pores 14 as evidenced by the result of porosity evaluation given in table 1 the addition of dopamine increases the porosity of the membrane hence water is absorbed easily which causes the contact angle formed when the water droplet touches the membrane surface to become smaller altogether it can be concluded that the simple polymerization of dopamine blended membrane can further enhance the membrane interaction with water which is favorable for the permeation performance 3 4 permeability performance pure water permeability is a fundamental and vital characteristic of the membrane that needs to be evaluated especially when the membrane is expected to be applied to the water treatment process fig 3 presents the results of the pure water flux of all the membranes from the filtration experiment using di water as the feed a pure pvdf membrane showcases an extremely low pure water flux of only 17 l m2 h which is attributed to the dense and hydrophobic surface characteristics of pvdf for the blended p d0 pure water flux increases by up to 650 due to the improved membrane porosity however the polymerized p d24 membrane shows a slim decline in pure water flux which is caused by a growth of a thin pda layer on the membrane surface from the result of the tris induced dopamine polymerization despite giving a high hydrophilic nature to the membrane the additional layer of pda on the membrane surface results in the possibility of pore blockage and gives the membrane more resistance to water thus the obtained water flux is slightly lower than that of the non polymerized dopamine blended membrane 36 3 5 separation performance the effect of the addition of dopamine and polymerization on the flux and rejection of the solute was observed through the filtration experiment using a cross flow uf module with a humic acid solution 50 ppm as a feed from the results in fig 4 an increment in the humic acid solution water flux is seen in the dopamine modified membranes either without or with polymerization the increase is generally due to the enhanced porosity property of the dopamine blended membrane in contrast a small decrease in the humic acid solution water flux on the p d24 membrane is observed due to the formation of a polydopamine thin film on the membrane surface after polymerization as discussed in the previous section as for the rejection of humic acid all three types of membrane showcase an excellent separation performance with values above 90 the original pvdf membrane produces the highest rejection of 95 due to its dense structure despite having a more porous structure both dopamine blended membranes without and with polymerization generate permeate with a high rejection of 91 and 93 respectively once again the slim decline of humic acid rejection for p d0 membrane is caused by the improved surface porosity some nano sized humic acid particles managed to pass the membrane through the pores however after polymerization the p d24 membrane successfully recovers about 2 of rejection due to the formation of a thin pda layer on the surface 3 6 antifouling performance fouling occurs due to the build up of organic foulant on the surface or inside the membrane pores fouling on membranes can be either reversible or irreversible reversible fouling is a fouling phenomenon in which the accumulated foulant can still be washed by a simple membrane cleaning process meanwhile irreversible fouling is caused by the contaminant being absorbed by the membrane or into the membrane pores which cannot be physically removed 3 the effect of fouling on the membrane can be observed from the permeation performance of the membrane which is indicated by flux loss during the filtration process as shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows an illustration of the flux performance of the three prepared membranes in one round of the three stage filtration experiment the first test was carried out to obtain the initial water flux jwb and then continued with filtration using the ha solution once the ha filtration is completed the membrane was cleaned by backwashing then the pure water experiment by changing the feed to di water again this whole set of experiments is meant to investigate the effectivity of membrane cleaning in removing the formed fouling which can be measured by the quantity of flux that can be recovered after the cleaning commonly termed as the flux recovery ratio frr fig 6 shows the data resulting from the experiments related to the evaluation of the antifouling properties of the membrane as seen in general the dopamine modified membranes have much better antifouling properties than those of the original pvdf membrane based on the results of the separation performance which have been discussed in the previous section it appears that the original pvdf membrane has a high rejection which means that the membrane has a relatively smaller size or and number of pores the dense surface of the non modified pvdf causes humic acid to accumulate only on the surface of the membrane and does not enter the pore thus the flux loss caused by total fouling is only 46 however due to the hydrophobic nature of pvdf the accumulated foulant can hardly be cleaned during the backwash which is indicated by the extremely small reversible fouling value of only 0 8 thus simultaneously resulting in a very low recovery of flux which is only 54 of the initial flux as for the p d0 and p d24 membranes the pore characteristics are enhanced in terms of the number and size with the addition of dopamine which is also evidenced from the results of the pure water flux and slight decrease in humic acid rejection the improved surface porosity provides more contact area for humic acid particles to deposit on the membrane surface thus it is reasonable that the degree of flux loss due to total fouling on the p d0 and p d24 membranes is slightly larger at 54 nevertheless both of the dopamine modified membranes have greater reversible fouling values because the dopamine polydopamine increases the hydrophilicity of the membrane the hydrophilic surface reduces the binding interaction between the membrane and the humic acid molecules through the formation of a tight formed water layer on the surface and also inside the pores of the p d24 membrane which plays a role as a barrier to prevent the adsorption and penetration of the hydrophobic humic acid molecules 18 36 therefore the foulant attached to the membranes has a great chance of being cleaned and increasing the flux restoration up to 84 and 92 for the p d0 and p d24 membranes respectively from these overall results it can be concluded that the formation of pda through simple tris triggered polymerization can promote the antifouling properties of hydrophobic pvdf membrane 3 7 mechanical properties mechanical strength is an important parameter for membranes that operate by using pressure as a driving force because the membranes have to be sufficiently able to withstand the transmembrane pressure during operation in addition a membrane with weak mechanical strength will be easily destroyed during the cleaning process the mechanical properties of membranes are generally presented in the form of tensile and elongation at break the data obtained from this study are presented in fig 7 membrane p pure pvdf has a very high tensile strength of nearly 8 mpa with an elongation at break exceeding 120 pvdf is well known as a polymer with very high ductility 37 however the addition of dopamine in the membrane system brings about a decrease in the tensile and elongation at break values of the p d0 membrane to 4 6 mpa and 59 5 respectively the weakening is suspected to be due to the influence of dopamine which acts as a pore former causing the formation of macrovoids in the bulk structure of the membrane 28 38 however by soaking the dopamine blended membrane in tris hcl buffer solution for 24 h the tensile and elongation at the break of the resulting p d24 increased again this is because the pda formed from the polymerization reaction glues the structure of the membrane together due to its adhesive properties which causes the network linking of the membrane to be more strongly connected to each other hence more energy is needed to break the membrane 39 40 4 conclusion the fouling resistance and filtration performance of dopamine blended pvdf uf membrane has been significantly enhanced through modification by a new and simple tris buffered polymerization technique the existence of dopamine blended in a membrane system elevates the porosity of the membrane which causes a significant increase in the flux performance from 17 l m2 h to hundreds l m2 h whereas immersing the blended membrane in a tris hcl triggers the polymerization of dopamine into pda inside and on the surface of the membrane the formed pda enriches the presence of the catechol groups which further increases the hydrophilicity of the pvdf membrane to a water contact angle of 43 simultaneously the polymerization greatly enhances the fouling resistance of the membrane which is indicated by frr values up to 92 in addition improvement of the rejection and mechanical properties of the membrane also occurs due to the formation of a thin pda film on the membrane surface this new technique can be an alternative method for dopamine related membrane modification that can answer the trade off issue of the common coating or blending techniques acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the

14454,in this work the cotton stalks waste as a woody biomass widely produced in egypt was used as a carbonaceous precursor for synthesis of carbon nanotubes cnts with bamboo like structure via subsequent catalytic hydrothermal and carbonization routes nanocomposite of tio2 cnts was prepared by sol gel of titanium isopropoxide in presence of cnts as a support and followed by calcination at 500 c for 180 min under flowing of n2 gas in addition tio2 cnts was wrapped by silver nanoparticles agnps individually and in presence of synthesized cationic surfactant c10 to produce tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 respectively the resulting nanocomposites and unadorned cnts were characterized by transmission electron microscope tem field emission scanningelectron microscopy fe sem combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx x ray diffraction xrd raman spectroscopy n2 gas adsorption desorption at 196 c and uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv vis drs the obtained photocatalysts were used to remediate aqueous solutions of methylene blue mb dye under visible light irradiation the results affirmed that the surfactant improved the dispersion and surface interaction of agnps over tio2 cnts which formed effective photocatalytic sites the synthesized cnts enhanced the surface and electronic properties of tio2 while agnps significantly reduced the recombination of electron hole pairs over tio2 cnts agnps c10 accordingly tio2 cnts agnps c10 exhibited the superior photocatalytic degradation of mb dye and high stability as a result of good dispersion of agnps by the surfactant the lower band gap energy 2 25 ev and the larger surface area 146 m2 g than that of tio2 cnts agnps keywords carbon nanotubes cotton stalks nanocomposites photocatalytic methylene blue dye 1 introduction organic dyes are non biodegradable chemical compounds and most of them are complex molecules even at low concentrations they give undesirable colors to the water bodies consequently this will reduce the sunlight penetration and resist the photochemical and biological operations to aquatic life 1 however the dyes are widely used in many applications such as textile paper rubber plastics cosmetics printing leather tanning food processing and dye manufacturing industries 1 of particular the annual consumption of dyes in the textile industry worldwide is more than 10 000 tonnes and approximately there are 100 tonnes year of those discharged into the water streams 2 3 yearly over 7 105 tonnes of more than 100 000 commercial dyes are produced 1 the discharge of huge amounts of dyes to the water source has posed challenges to the global environmental and health issues especially in the developing countries in view of recycling and cleaning the contaminated wastewater with dyes the researchers have to search for advanced technologies with low cost and high efficiency for wastewater treatment currently various wastewater technologies such as adsorption coagulation membrane separation filtration and advanced oxidation processes aops are used in the removal of dyes 4 excepting aops in case of high concentrations of organic pollutants other technologies need high operating cost because they could generate toxic secondary contaminates aops are considered as an innovative wastewater technology including the wet oxidation oxidizing agents e g o3 or h2o2 fenton oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation operations through the heterogeneous catalysis 5 10 the principle advantage of such processes is the formation of highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals ho and superoxide ions o2 for mineralization of toxic organic compounds among these aops photocatalytic oxidation process employing semiconductor catalysts e g tio2 zno wo3 cds gap and zns was found to be an effective technology in degradation of large amounts of massive organics into small compounds and eventually mineralized them to carbon dioxide and water 11 13 actually titanium dioxide tio2 is the most active photocatalyst under the photon energy of 300 nm λ 390 nm in the uv range 4 it is distinguished by its biological and chemical inertness nontoxicity and inexpensive however it reflects two drawbacks when used firstly it shows low photocatalytic activity under uv only which accounts for only 4 of the incoming solar energy accompanied by high recombination of the electrons and holes which photo induced on its surface and in its bulk secondly it has low adsorptive affinity towards target pollutants 4 in this regard different strategies including doping tio2 with metallic e g fe ni mn co etc non metallic e g n p s etc noble metal ag au pt etc or introducing tio2 particles into carbonaceous materials were employed to avoid these drawbacks 4 11 among these strategies synthesis of high strength and ecofriendly nanocomposites of tio2 and carbonaceous materials as supports such as activated carbons carbon nanotubes graphene etc 14 17 represents one of the most efficient approaches to enhance photocatalytic activity of tio2 and to extend the light absorption into the visible region since the landmark paper by iijima 18 carbon nanotubes cnts have attracted significant attention in a variety of scientific fields because of their unique properties such as structural chemical thermal electrical and optical consequently synthesis of unique nanocomposites with efficient photocatalytic activity by inclusion of cnts into tio2 matrix has paid of many investigators 15 19 29 these reports showed that the photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanocrystallines can be significantly enhanced when decorated with cnts in these studies the main weight percent was of tio2 nanoparticles combined with low weight of cnts it was found that cnts acts as an electron acceptor and hence retards the recombination of electron hole pairs as well as it increases both the surface area and number of active sites of tio2 more recently the doping of tio2 cnts nanocomposites with silver nanoparticles agnps at tiny concentrations has lower fermi level than that of tio2 led to an increase in the surface plasmon resonance spr effect and then boosted the photocatalytic activity of tio2 cnts nanocomposite 30 39 therefore the incorporation of agnps into tio2 cnts nanocomposite is promising strategy to enhance the photocatalytic activity efficiently by i promoting charge separation and by ii extending the absorption edge to the visible region 30 39 throughout survey in the literature most of cnts used with tio2 are commercial and very expensive nevertheless to best of our knowledge s the synthesis of low cost cnts from cotton stalks coated with tio2 nanoparticles as nanocomposites for the photocatalytic degradation of dye has not been reported yet in addition the obtained tio2 cnts is wrapped by agnps using synthesized cationic surfactant to enhance the homogeneous dispersibility of agnps on the photoactivity of tio2 cnts it is reported that the surfactants could stabilize agnps dispersions for long durations and to obtain homogenous dispersions 40 42 in summary according to our previous works on synthesis of cnts from rice straw residue 43 44 novel and low cost cnts prepared from carbonization of cotton stalks hydrochar was used as a support to tio2 nanoparticles to produce tio2 cnts nanocomposite the resulting samples of cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps without surfactant and tio2 cnts agnps c10 surfactant were characterized by tem fe sem edx ftir raman n2 gas adsorption desorption and uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy techniques furthermore methylene blue mb as the targeted organic pollutant was used to study the adsorption and photocatalytic activity of the obtained samples variable factors such as h2o2 concentration 0 139 0 391 and 0 782 mol l dose of photocatalyst 0 2 1 g l and initial dye concentrations 10 100 mg l and inorganic salts 0 02 m of nacl nahco3 and na2so4 were studied total organic carbon as an indication parameter for mineralization degree of dye by these samples was determined the stability of the prepared photocatalyst nanocomposite was carried out during five cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 pretreatment of cotton stalks novel technology comprising of two sequence methods catalytic hydrothermal and carbonization ch c was carried out to synthesize cnts from cotton stalks hydrochar initially cotton stalks waste cs was collected washed with hot water dried crushed and sieved to sizes between 0 5 and 3 mm then 5 g of cs was added into a mixture solution containing nitrates of iron nickel and cobalt which dissolved at a least amount of water the weight percent of metals added was 10 wt for each fe iii and ni ii while for co ii metal it was 5 wt then about 10 wt of urea was dissolved in 20 ml distilled water and added to the prior mixture under vigorous stirring for 60 min the mixture was transferred into a 100 ml teflon lined autoclave tube inside a stainless steel reactor then the reactor was heated in an electrical muffle at 180 c for 180 min a suspended darkish brown powder of the pretreated cotton stalks in a liquid was obtained the cotton stalks hydrochar product was separated through filtration and then washed thoroughly with hot water after that it was dried at 80 c overnight and subjected to the pyrolysis process as shown in the next step 2 2 preparation of cnts for this purpose a vertical bed tubular reactor of stainless steel 27 mm of internal diameter and 600 mm of length having open neck in the upper part was used according to the method described elsewhere 44 in brief a ternary catalyst of fe ni cu oxides supported on al2o3 substrate was used to enhance the graphitization and rolling of graphene sheets during the pyrolysis of cotton stalks hydrochar the mass ratios of fe ni cu metals are 1 1 0 5 were loaded onto al oh 3 by a wetness impregnation then followed by heating at 750 c for 120 min in an electrical muffle both hydrochar and fe ni cu al2o3 samples were mixed together at mass ratio of 10 1 and then placed in the bottom of vertical reactor tube after closing the tubular the furnace was heated slowly up to 300 c at heating rate of 10 c min under n2 gas flow and held for 10 min then the temperature was raised slowly to 830 c and hold for 60 min without passing of any gases after cooling the furnace the black sample was subjected to further purification using mixture from 5 m of hno3 and h2so4 followed by washing thoroughly with hot distilled water till ph of filtrate becomes 6 and driedat 90 c overnight then the purified carbon nanotubes sample was functionalized by h2o2 30 wt at 25 c for 240 min the functionalized cnts sample was washed with h2o for several times and dried againat 90 c and kept in closed glass vial for any further use 2 3 preparation of tio2 cnts nanocomposite tio2 cnts nanocomposite was prepared by sol gel method about 2 g of cnts produced was well dispersed in 2 wt of dissolved sodium dodecyl sulfate sds anionic surfactant in 20 ml distilled water ch3 ch2 11oso3na sigma aldrich 98 using a magnetic stirrer for 10 min and then sonicated for 30 min in another beaker a milky sol of titanium isopropoxide tip ti och ch3 2 4 was prepared by mixing 2 84 g tip with 15 ml solution of ethanol and glacial acetic acid 1 2 under vigorous stirring for 30 min this sol was poured to mixture of cnts sds slowly dropwise under vigorous stirring for 120 min to attain good dispersion of ti nanoparticles onto the surface of cnts the ph of this mixture was adjusted to 9 using nh4oh solution and finally 10 ml of ethanol were added to the mixture keeping the stirring for another 30 min the final suspension was centrifuged and washed three times in ethanol the resulting nanocomposite was separated and dried at 60 c in an air oven overnight afterwards the solid product was thermally treated in a stainless steel reactor at 500 c for 180 min under flowing n2 gas to obtain tio2 cnts photocatalyst 2 4 preparation of silver nanoparticles 2 4 1 synthesis of cationic surfactant cationic surfactant c10 was synthesized through two steps esterification is the first step in this step 4 amino pyridine 0 1 mol 9 4 g was added to equal amount of 4 amino benzoic acid 0 1 mol 13 7 g in 50 ml of xylene as solvent the mixture was refluxed until we get the required amount of water 1 8 ml then the product was evaporated from xylene to produce 4 amino n pyridine 4 yl benzamide in the second step quaterniaztion the product from the first step 0 1 mol 21 3 g 4 amino n pyridine 4 yl benzamide and 0 1 mol 22 1 g bromodecane in 50 ml of absolute ethanol as a solvent were refluxed for 50 h the product 4 amino n 1 decylpyridine 1 ium bromide 4 yl benzamide was left to cool and evaporated from ethanol then purified by diethyl ether and recrystallized by ethanol to obtain the synthesized cationic surfactant as shown in fig 1 the chemical structure of the prepared cationic surfactant was confirmed earlier by ftir and 1h nmr spectroscopy 40 2 4 2 preparation of silver nanoparticles colloidal solution agnps using chemical reduction method described elsewhere 45 46 agnps colloidal solution was prepared all solutions of reacting materials were prepared in distilled water in typical experiment 50 ml of 1 10 3 m agno3 was heated up to boiling then drop by drop 5 ml of 1 trisodium citrate was added and during this procedure the solution was mingled strongly and heated until pale yellow is formed next it was removed from the device of heating and stirred until being cooled to be suited with room temperature 2 4 3 preparation of the cationic surfactants coated silver nanoparticles 5 ml saturated surfactant solution in deionized water was mixed with a 20 ml of citrate capped silver nanoparticles solution and efficiently stirred for 24 h until the yellow color was vanished 47 2 5 wrapping of tio2 cnts with agnps the fabrication of the tio2 cnts agnps nanocomposites was carried out according to the previous publication 48 in brief agnps solution 50 ml was added to cnts 0 2 g suspended in 50 ml ethanol the mixture was stirred for 24 h the precipitate was separated by centrifugation washed thoroughly with distilled water and dried under vacuum overnight the same method was used for preparation a ternary nanocomposite with surfactant and labeled as tio2 cnts agnps c10 2 6 characterization techniques several techniques were performed for characterizing the physico chemical properties of the synthesized nanocomposites high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem jeol jem 1230 japan was operated at 200 kv this technique was used to confirm the formation of nanotubes from pyrolysis of cotton stalks hydrochar preparation of samples for tem analysis was carried out by dispersing a few amount of the carbon product in ethanol solution by sonication for 30 min and depositing a drop of the suspension on a carbon coated copper tem grid the morphology and chemical compositions of the prepared samples were estimated by field emission scanning electron microscope sem combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction fe sem fei quanta feg 250 edx determination of surface functional groups developed on the surface of cnts and their nanocomposites

v 2 01 software x ray diffraction patterns of samples were investigated using a modern pan analytical diffractometer xpert pro model nickel filtered cupper radiation λ 1 542 å was used all the diffraction patterns were examined at room temperature and under constant operating conditions 40 kv 40 ma the scanning rate was at 2θ 1 min the studied samples were grounded to a fine powder and mounted in an appropriate aluminum folder the x ray diffraction pattern is essentially a plot of intensities as a function of the angle of reflection even by the material absence of any diffraction

fluoromax 3 spectrofluorimeter using a xe lamp as excitation source with excitation at 325 nm the textural parameters such as brunauer emmett teller surface area sbet m2 g total pore volume vp cm3 g and average pore diameter rp å were determined using nitrogen adsorption analysis at 196 c bel sorp microtracbel crop japan 49 to estimate the pore size distributions n2 gas adsorption data were

wavelength range of 190 2500 nm was performed to estimate the band gap energy eg ev of each sample the total organic carbon toc of the samples accounted in the dye before and after photocatalytic process was also analyzed using a multi n c 2000 analytic jena analyzer germany 2 7 photocatalytic experiments using h2o2 visible light the photocatalytic performance of each sample was tested toward degradation of a cationic dye such as methylene blue mb under both dark and h2o2 visible light irradiation prior to the visible irradiation the solid sample and mb dye solution mixture was sonicated for 30 min to attain well dispersion of sample and then stirred in the dark for further 30 min at 25 c in order to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium and to ensure that the removal of dye was completed by the photocatalytic process variable factors such as h2o2 concentration 0 139 0 391 and 0 782 mol l dose of photocatalyst 0 2 1 g l and initial dye concentrations 10 100 mg l were studied the photocatalytic experiments were performed by adding 50 mg of sample in 50 ml of mb dye solution with initial concentrations of 10 20 and 50 mg l at initial ph 6 of dye solution then h2o2 was added and the visible light was irradiated using house hold fluorescent lamp of 150 w philips this lamp irradiates outside at a distance of 10 cm from the surface of dye solution the temperature of the solution was maintained constant throughout the reaction then 1 ml of an aliquot solution of the dye was withdrawn at regular interval times after dilution into 10 ml the dye solution was separated from the solid by centrifuging at 1000 rpm for 10 min the remaining concentration of mb dye in the supernatant solution was estimated using the spectrophotometer at its λmax value 664 nm in order to assess the reproducibility and error of adsorption and photodegradation tests the absorbance of dye was recorded three times to take the average value regarding real life application of heterogeneous photocatalytic systems presence of various inorganic ions should be taken into account thus the effect of different dissolved inorganic salts on the photocatalytic performance of the prepared nanocomposite was studied using 0 02 m of nacl nahco3 and na2so4 salts prepared in 50 ml of mb dye solution 20 mg l and 0 5 g l of tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps or tio2 cnts agnps c10 samples and 0 782 mol l of h2o2 all mixture was stirred for 60 min in dark and then exposed to visible light for 120 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 tem sem and edx investigations the morphologies of the prepared cnts and the fabricated nanocomposites tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 as shown in fig 2 were demonstrated using tem the vertical pyrolysis of cotton stalks hydrochar at 830 c for 60 min produced clear multi walled carbon nanotubes with outer diameters of 50 100 nm the shape of cnts obtained seems to be bamboo like as illustrated in fig 2a clearly tio2 nanoparticles their sizes ranged from 5 10 nm are supported uniformly on walls of cnts fig 2b since the amount of agnps added on surface of tio2 cnts was less than 1 wt the shape of distributed agnps cannot be observed however black shadow was seen around spherical particles of tio2 fig 2 c and d according to the loading route of agnps some significant changes on tio2 cnts surface were observed after loading agnps by a chemical reduction method singly and in presence of surfactant c10 in fig 2c there is a swelling in the wall cnts on the other hand no changes on tio2 cnts agnps c10 surface are detected thus the introduction of agnps through c10 surfactant could preserve the structure of cnts as well as led to good dispersion of those on the surface of tio2 cnts fig 3 shows the sem images of tio2 cnts nanocomposite and its corresponding nanocomposite of tio2 cnts ag c10 as expected the tio2 assembled regularly on the surface of cnts upon loading agnps in presence of c10 surfactant the network of tio2 cnts was covered with agnps yielding rough surface the edx spectrum of tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite is depicted in fig 4 confirming the presence of ti and agnps also the histogram figure shows the elemental compositions in cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposites the weight percent of agnps was less than 1 the prominent elements of high content are c and o in all specimens fig 4 3 2 ftir analysis in order to reflect the changes in surface chemistry of the prepared nanocomposites ftir analysis was investigated the decoration of cnts surface with tio2 and then agnps led to significant alterations as illustrated in fig 5 ftir bands associated to oxygen containing functional groups as well as bands related to ti o c and ag ti o c groups were determined most of ftir bands in the cnts obtained are assigned to the oh stretching of cooh groups and of the adsorbed water molecules at 3430 cm 1 and to the deformation vibration of this group between 1623 and 1420 cm 1 as a result of functionalization of cnts with h2o2 the sharp band at 1093 cm 1 is attributed to co stretching vibration in carboxylic ether alcohol and ester in tio2 cnts sample the intensity of these vibration bands at 3430 and 1623 cm 1 is decreased with shifting to low wavenumbers at 3424 and 1567 cm 1 indicating that deformation vibration of oh is replaced by deformation vibration of ti oh bond on the surface of cnts the appearance of broad absorption band between 1000 and 500 cm 1 is ascribed to the bending vibrations of ti o ti and ti o c bonds 22 27 29 also the shifting in the absorption band of co from 1093 to 1115 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of ti o c bond the same results have been reported early by others 27 31 concerning to tio2 cnts ag and tio2 cnts ag c10 nanocomposites their ftir spectra show differences in the intensity of these bands compared to ftir spectrum of tio2 cnts and based on the loading procedure of agnps however ftir spectrum of tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite included a variety absorption bands as compared to that observed in ftir spectrum of tio2 cnts ag nanocomposite especially in the range between 1680 and 1000 cm 1 with disappearing band at 3430 cm 1 3 3 xrd measurements fig 6 illustrates the results of xrd patterns obtained from cnts and their nanocomposites two characteristic diffraction peaks for cnts were appeared at 2θ 25 8 and 44 3 both patterns are indexed to 002 and 101 planes of typical graphite sheets 23 36 37 however no diffraction peak was observed corresponding to cnts in the xrd pattern of tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 samples which might be due to the shielding of main characteristic peak of cnts at 25 8 by the main peak of anatase tio2 at 25 3 36 similar results were reported in the literature 37 in all nanocomposites their xrd patterns showed new peaks at 2θ 25 3 101 38 0 200 47 9 004 and 54 8 105 which affirmed the formation of anatase phases on the surface of cnts jcpds no 21 1276 37 on the other hand the peak observed at 62 8 002 was ascribed to rutile phase of tio2 the addition of agnps nanoparticles in absence of c10 only diffraction peak at 38 3 111 was found that overlapped with the peak of anatase in tio2 cnts agnps nevertheless the diffraction peaks related to agnps in tio2 cnts agnps c10 can be observed at 2θ 31 1 113 and 44 3 200 jcpds no 84 0713 and 04 0783 51 which referred to the face centered cubic fcc structure of silver nanoparticles this result reveals that agnps exist as zero valent form on the surface of tio2 cnts which is in agreement with the previous studies 37 41 3 4 raman spectroscopy raman spectra of cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposites are presented in fig 7 for cnts two prominent bands centered at 1335 and 1580 cm 1 were corresponded to the characteristic d and g bands of cnts the d band relates to the defects and structural disorder in carbon nanotubes and g band reflects the in plane vibration of sp2 bonded carbon atoms 52 in case of tio2 cnts nanocomposite additional four bands appeared at 149 389 516 and 625 cm 1 related to lattice vibrational modes of eg b1g a1g and eg that agree with the lattice vibrational modes of tio2 anatase 16 however in case of tio2 cnts doped with agnps in absence of c10 surfactant the intensity of such bands is decreased whereas is conversely when agnps loaded onto tio2 cnts in presence of c10 surfactant clearly it was found that the incorporation of both tio2 and agnps into the cnts matrix reduced the intensity of d and g bands probably this is due to the interfacial interaction between cnts and tio2 or tio2 agnps 38 39 this result indicated also that the entire surface of cnts is uniformly covered with agnps tio2 nanoparticles 3 5 textural properties the adsorption desorption isotherms of n2 gas at 196 c onto the synthesized samples and their corresponding pore size distributions using nldft method are illustrated in fig 8 the textural properties of cnts and those nanocomposites are listed in table 1 interestingly various adsorption desorption isotherms of n2 onto the samples synthesized were observed in fig 8a cnts and its tio2 cnts agnps nanocomposite produce a type iv with a hysteresis loop of h3 and h1 types according to the classification of iupac 49 50 respectively confirming their mesoporous structure after decorating cnts surface with tio2 nanoparticles tio2 cnts the adsorption isotherm belongs to type i as well as the same result with tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite was occurred hence tio2 cnts and its tio2 cnts agnps c10 are microporous materials these results are corroborated also with the pore size distribution plots using nldft analysis as depicted in fig 8b the highest peak of pore width in cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 was found to be 4 71 1 20 3 69 and 0 956 nm respectively moreover the results in table 1 exhibited that the specific surface area sbet m2 g of cnts increased from 110 to 187 m2 g 46 5 whereas the total pore volume vt cm3 g decreased from 0 198 to 0 098 cm3 g and associated with creation of micropores during the calcination of titanium isopropoxide to produce tio2 cnts on the other hand when tio2 cnts loaded with agnps a substantial decrease in both the sbet m2 g and vt cm3 g was obtained cf table 1 possibly the agnps close the internal pores developed in the tio2 cnts matrix however the specific surface area of tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite was higher than that of tio2 cnts agnps sample it can be concluded that the presence of c10 surfactant prevents the aggregation of agnps hence it enhances the active sites on the nanocomposite obtained 3 6 uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra of cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposites are shown in fig 9 it can be seen clearly that the absorption bands of the investigated samples are located in the range of 366 550 nm the cnts showed the lowest absorption band while tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite has the highest absorption band in the visible region accordingly the estimated band gap energy eg ev of each sample can be calculated according the following formula eg ev 1240 λg 36 where the band gap wavelength λg nm was obtained by extrapolating the wavelength edge of the absorption band in absorbance to the zero line from diffuse reflectance spectra as represented in fig 9 hence the values of the band gap energy of the cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 were calculated to be 3 39 ev 2 77 ev 2 48 ev and 2 25 ev respectively the presence of ag noble metal would extend largely the absorption behavior of tio2 from uv region wavelength 400 nm band gap energy of 3 2 ev to the visible light region due to their surface plasmon resonance spr effect 39 51 53 additionally the cnts as a porous support helps in the fast electron transport process and also works as an electron reservoir to reduce the recombination of electron hole pairs in tio2 resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity 53 thus the sample with the narrower band gap energy tio2 cnts agnps c10 possesses the higher photocatalytic activity the introduction of agnps into tio2 cnts using c10 surfactant effectively modified the electronic and crystal structures of tio2 supported on cnts and then facilitated the charge transfer among the tio2 valence or conduction band into the 4d level of ag ion 25 36 therefore the absorption of visible light is significantly improved as a result of the high reduction in the band gap energy of tio2 cnts 3 7 adsorption performance of samples the adsorption of mb dye onto the surface of samples was carried out and presented in fig 10 a the results revealed that the equilibrium attained at 60 min over all samples and tio2 cnts has the highest removal efficiency 60 as compared to others the adsorption behavior of mb dye over the samples was directly consistent with the order of specific surface area cf table 1 3 8 photodegradation performance of samples on the other hand the photocatalytic performance of cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 were demonstrated and their results are shown in fig 10b photocatalytic degradation of mb dye in absence of photocatalyst and under illumination of visible light was measured also in case of mb dye solution alone under visible light illumination through 240 min a minimal photodegradation rate 2 was observed for cnts its photoactivity toward degradation of mb reached to 32 in 240 min while after loading tio2 onto cnts there was a remarkable increase in degradation of mb dye reached to 66 this finding may be attributed to the combined factors of i the higher adsorption of mb dye onto this nanocomposite due to its higher surface area than cnts alone and ii the enhancement in photoactivity of tio2 nanoparticles by loading onto the cnts surface which rose to an increase in degradation of mb dye 20 moreover cnts as a photosensitizer can inject an electron in the conduction band ecb of tio2 and triggers the photocatalytic formation of reactive hydroxyl radicals ho which are responsible for further enhancement in the photodegradation of mb dye 54 additionally to the role of cnts agnps act as photoelectron trapping that improves the photocatalytic activity of tio2 cnts by lowering the electron hole pairs recombination in the current study agnps were loaded onto the surface of tio2 cnts in absence of surfactant tio2 cnts ag and in presence of surfactant tio2 cnts agnps c10 tio2 cnts agnps nanocomposite showed slight increase in the photodegradation of mb dye 68 of dye molecules was degraded in 240 min while tio2 cnts agnps c10 exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance 100 of dye was degraded in 180 min as shown in fig 10b this result confirms that the well distribution of agnps over tio2 cnts as a result of c10 surfactant effect is giving rise to the prolong life of charges separation i e electrons and holes and enhanced photocatalytic activity of tio2 cnts 3 9 factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of tio2 cnts agnps c10 the effects of important factors such as h2o2 concentration 0 139 0 391 and 0 782 mol l dose of photocatalyst 0 2 1 g l and initial dye concentration 10 100 mg l on the photocatalytic performance of the highest efficiency i e tio2 cnts agnps c10 were investigated the results of these factors are illustrated in fig 11 clearly the increase in the concentration of h2o2 expedited the photodegradation rate of mb dye over the photocatalyst at the early interval times as shown in fig 11a after 90 min a slow photodegradation rate toward mb dye was observed thus h2o2 enhanced the photocatalytic degradation process accompanying with full degradation of mb dye molecules at 120 min with 0 782 mol l of h2o2 the reason on this result is attributed to formation of ho radicals which results from decomposition of h2o2 over tio2 cnts agnps c10 under visible light irradiation according to the following reaction paths 55 1 h2o2 hv 2 ho 2 etio2 cb h2o2 ho oh accordingly the produced ho radicals can attack both the adsorbed and the remained dye molecules in the aqueous solution and then decompose them rapidly looking at fig 11b as the photocatalyst dose increased from 0 2 to 0 5 g l the photodegradation of mb dye increased also from 60 to 100 at 120 min and then decreased remarkably to 88 with 1 g l of photocatalyst thus further increase in the photocatalyst showed less effective in the photocatalytic degradation of mb dye this may result in agglomeration of photocatalysts particles and hence reduces the penetration of visible light into active sites the optimum dose is favored at 0 5 g l when 0 5 g l of photocatalyst was conducted with different concentrations of mb dye aqueous solution 10 20 50 and 100 mg l with 0 782 mol l of h2o2 for 120 min under visible irradiation the photocatalytic degradation of the studied dye was significantly impacted as shown in fig 11c more than 20 mg l the prepared tio2 cnts agnps c10 photocatalyst exhibited low photoactivity toward degradation of mb dye molecules where about 65 8 and 33 7 of mb molecules were degraded upon increasing the initial concentration to from 50 and 100 mg l respectively this finding postulates that the availability of reactive species was insufficient with increasing the initial concentration of mb dye under visible irradiation and constant loading of photocatalyst furthermore the effect of different dissolved inorganic salts such as nacl nahco3and na2so4 salts on the photocatalytic degradation of mb dye over the prepared nanocompositetio2 cnts agnps c10 and in presence 0 782 mol l of h2o2 is shown in fig 12 it was found that three anions cl hco3 and so4 2 have imposed negative effect on the photodegradation as compared to mb dye solution without anions blank thus the presence of these anions may compete with the adsorption of dye molecules on the tio2 cnts agnps c10 surface and deactivate the performance of photocatalyst consequently it reduces the photodegradation of mb dye such suppression in the photocatalytic performance might confirm that these anions behaved as scavengers and hinder the photoactivity of positive holes hvb and hydroxyl radicals ho in order to degrade mb dye thus the photodegradation of mb molecules was decreased from 100 up to 85 80 and 66 for nacl na2so4 and nahco3 salts respectively the same results were documented previously by other authors 54 3 10 reusability of tio2 cnts agnps c10 photocatalyst the stability of photocatalyst in the photocatalytic processes to remediate the colored wastewater which discharged from different industries is a pivotal factor to reduce the operation cost with regard to the practical applications the reusability of the tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite was determined by using the same photocatalyst repeatedly for 5 cycles fig 13 a shows that the photocatalytic activity of nanocomposite decreases slightly from 100 to 92 within three cycles and then became 77 at the fifth cycle based on the prescribed conditions thus the findings revealed that the prepared nanocomposite is an effective and stable photocatalyst within three cycles in order to assess the occurrence of photodegradation onto the surface of tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite the sem image of photocatalyst after photodegradation of mb dye was determined by comparing fig 13b with that fresh fig 3b fresh sample significant changes were occurred after photodegradation process it can be observed that there layers fully covered the surface of nanocomposite confirming the success of process moreover the mineralization degree of mb dye was estimated by measuring the total organic carbon as shown in the next section 3 11 estimation of total organic carbon toc in order to determine the mineralization efficacy of mb dye over the surface of cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 samples the total organic carbon of the reaction solution was measured before and after irradiation as given in table 2 obviously the values of toc of treated mb dye solutions were decreased in presence of the synthesized photocatalyst samples accordingly tio2 cnts agnps c10 sample enhanced the mineralization degree of mb dye and showed a remarkable decrease in toc value which reached to 84 5 upon irradiation of mb dye under visible light for 180 min generally the mineralization pathway of dyes contains the destruction of organic dye molecules into aromatic rings and aliphatic acids as intermediates during the photocatalytic degradation of dyes in presence of effective semiconductor e g tio2 moreover the heteroatoms e g n and s in the dye structure will be converted into nitrate and sulfate anions as well as harmless gaseous co2 and h2o under photocatalytic processes 56 the proposed scheme of tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite and mb dye solution under photodegradation on the basis of previous studies 30 36 40 is shown in fig 14 the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes on the tio2 cnts agnps c10 interface is shown in fig 14 agnps in contact with tio2 captured the photogenerated electrons e cb increased the separation of electrons holes and retarded their recombination electrons and holes were initiated the formation of ho radicals and or superoxide ions o2 the process of transferring electrons e cb from tio2 to agnps occurs spontaneously due to the lower fermi level of agnps 39 40 electrons stored in agnps are transferred to the surface of cnts which acts as donors of electrons to oxidize h2o2 into ho radicals ho radicals produced in this process have sufficient oxidative potential to degrade mb dye molecules in summary the tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite showed the best photocatalytic degradation activity of the mb dye solution under visible light irradiation 4 conclusions fabrication of nanocomposites from cnts tio2 and agnps as efficient photocatalysts for photodegradation of methylene blue dye is successfully investigated in this study for the first time cnts sample of bamboo like structure was synthesized from cotton stalks waste via subsequent catalytic hydrothermal and carbonization chc routes the produced cnts sample was wrapped by tio2 nanoparticles by sol gel and then calcinated at 500 c for 180 min to form amorphous anatase on the surface of cnts the obtained tio2 cnts was decorated by silver nanoparticles less than 1 in weight of agnps individually tio2 cnts agnps and in presence of synthesized cationic surfactant tio2 cnts agnps c10 in order to increase its dispersibility and surface interaction between tio2 and cnts tem and sem techniques exhibited the presence of cnts decorated by tio2 and agnps xrd and raman spectroscopy affirmed the presence of patterns which related to cnts tio2 and agnps also results deduced from n2 gas adsorption desorption at 196 c showed that both nanocomposites tio2 cnts and tio2 cnts agnps c10 have the largest surface area uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs confirmed that tio2 cnts agnps c10 has the lowest band gap energy of 2 25 ev resulting in a great photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation from all above findings it can be deduced clearly that the cnts synthesized from cotton stalks enhanced the surface and electronic properties of tio2 while agnps significantly reduced the recombination of electron hole pairs in tio2 cnts agnps c10 acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supports provided by the national research centre nrc egypt under the

14454,in this work the cotton stalks waste as a woody biomass widely produced in egypt was used as a carbonaceous precursor for synthesis of carbon nanotubes cnts with bamboo like structure via subsequent catalytic hydrothermal and carbonization routes nanocomposite of tio2 cnts was prepared by sol gel of titanium isopropoxide in presence of cnts as a support and followed by calcination at 500 c for 180 min under flowing of n2 gas in addition tio2 cnts was wrapped by silver nanoparticles agnps individually and in presence of synthesized cationic surfactant c10 to produce tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 respectively the resulting nanocomposites and unadorned cnts were characterized by transmission electron microscope tem field emission scanningelectron microscopy fe sem combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx x ray diffraction xrd raman spectroscopy n2 gas adsorption desorption at 196 c and uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv vis drs the obtained photocatalysts were used to remediate aqueous solutions of methylene blue mb dye under visible light irradiation the results affirmed that the surfactant improved the dispersion and surface interaction of agnps over tio2 cnts which formed effective photocatalytic sites the synthesized cnts enhanced the surface and electronic properties of tio2 while agnps significantly reduced the recombination of electron hole pairs over tio2 cnts agnps c10 accordingly tio2 cnts agnps c10 exhibited the superior photocatalytic degradation of mb dye and high stability as a result of good dispersion of agnps by the surfactant the lower band gap energy 2 25 ev and the larger surface area 146 m2 g than that of tio2 cnts agnps keywords carbon nanotubes cotton stalks nanocomposites photocatalytic methylene blue dye 1 introduction organic dyes are non biodegradable chemical compounds and most of them are complex molecules even at low concentrations they give undesirable colors to the water bodies consequently this will reduce the sunlight penetration and resist the photochemical and biological operations to aquatic life 1 however the dyes are widely used in many applications such as textile paper rubber plastics cosmetics printing leather tanning food processing and dye manufacturing industries 1 of particular the annual consumption of dyes in the textile industry worldwide is more than 10 000 tonnes and approximately there are 100 tonnes year of those discharged into the water streams 2 3 yearly over 7 105 tonnes of more than 100 000 commercial dyes are produced 1 the discharge of huge amounts of dyes to the water source has posed challenges to the global environmental and health issues especially in the developing countries in view of recycling and cleaning the contaminated wastewater with dyes the researchers have to search for advanced technologies with low cost and high efficiency for wastewater treatment currently various wastewater technologies such as adsorption coagulation membrane separation filtration and advanced oxidation processes aops are used in the removal of dyes 4 excepting aops in case of high concentrations of organic pollutants other technologies need high operating cost because they could generate toxic secondary contaminates aops are considered as an innovative wastewater technology including the wet oxidation oxidizing agents e g o3 or h2o2 fenton oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation operations through the heterogeneous catalysis 5 10 the principle advantage of such processes is the formation of highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals ho and superoxide ions o2 for mineralization of toxic organic compounds among these aops photocatalytic oxidation process employing semiconductor catalysts e g tio2 zno wo3 cds gap and zns was found to be an effective technology in degradation of large amounts of massive organics into small compounds and eventually mineralized them to carbon dioxide and water 11 13 actually titanium dioxide tio2 is the most active photocatalyst under the photon energy of 300 nm λ 390 nm in the uv range 4 it is distinguished by its biological and chemical inertness nontoxicity and inexpensive however it reflects two drawbacks when used firstly it shows low photocatalytic activity under uv only which accounts for only 4 of the incoming solar energy accompanied by high recombination of the electrons and holes which photo induced on its surface and in its bulk secondly it has low adsorptive affinity towards target pollutants 4 in this regard different strategies including doping tio2 with metallic e g fe ni mn co etc non metallic e g n p s etc noble metal ag au pt etc or introducing tio2 particles into carbonaceous materials were employed to avoid these drawbacks 4 11 among these strategies synthesis of high strength and ecofriendly nanocomposites of tio2 and carbonaceous materials as supports such as activated carbons carbon nanotubes graphene etc 14 17 represents one of the most efficient approaches to enhance photocatalytic activity of tio2 and to extend the light absorption into the visible region since the landmark paper by iijima 18 carbon nanotubes cnts have attracted significant attention in a variety of scientific fields because of their unique properties such as structural chemical thermal electrical and optical consequently synthesis of unique nanocomposites with efficient photocatalytic activity by inclusion of cnts into tio2 matrix has paid of many investigators 15 19 29 these reports showed that the photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanocrystallines can be significantly enhanced when decorated with cnts in these studies the main weight percent was of tio2 nanoparticles combined with low weight of cnts it was found that cnts acts as an electron acceptor and hence retards the recombination of electron hole pairs as well as it increases both the surface area and number of active sites of tio2 more recently the doping of tio2 cnts nanocomposites with silver nanoparticles agnps at tiny concentrations has lower fermi level than that of tio2 led to an increase in the surface plasmon resonance spr effect and then boosted the photocatalytic activity of tio2 cnts nanocomposite 30 39 therefore the incorporation of agnps into tio2 cnts nanocomposite is promising strategy to enhance the photocatalytic activity efficiently by i promoting charge separation and by ii extending the absorption edge to the visible region 30 39 throughout survey in the literature most of cnts used with tio2 are commercial and very expensive nevertheless to best of our knowledge s the synthesis of low cost cnts from cotton stalks coated with tio2 nanoparticles as nanocomposites for the photocatalytic degradation of dye has not been reported yet in addition the obtained tio2 cnts is wrapped by agnps using synthesized cationic surfactant to enhance the homogeneous dispersibility of agnps on the photoactivity of tio2 cnts it is reported that the surfactants could stabilize agnps dispersions for long durations and to obtain homogenous dispersions 40 42 in summary according to our previous works on synthesis of cnts from rice straw residue 43 44 novel and low cost cnts prepared from carbonization of cotton stalks hydrochar was used as a support to tio2 nanoparticles to produce tio2 cnts nanocomposite the resulting samples of cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps without surfactant and tio2 cnts agnps c10 surfactant were characterized by tem fe sem edx ftir raman n2 gas adsorption desorption and uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy techniques furthermore methylene blue mb as the targeted organic pollutant was used to study the adsorption and photocatalytic activity of the obtained samples variable factors such as h2o2 concentration 0 139 0 391 and 0 782 mol l dose of photocatalyst 0 2 1 g l and initial dye concentrations 10 100 mg l and inorganic salts 0 02 m of nacl nahco3 and na2so4 were studied total organic carbon as an indication parameter for mineralization degree of dye by these samples was determined the stability of the prepared photocatalyst nanocomposite was carried out during five cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 pretreatment of cotton stalks novel technology comprising of two sequence methods catalytic hydrothermal and carbonization ch c was carried out to synthesize cnts from cotton stalks hydrochar initially cotton stalks waste cs was collected washed with hot water dried crushed and sieved to sizes between 0 5 and 3 mm then 5 g of cs was added into a mixture solution containing nitrates of iron nickel and cobalt which dissolved at a least amount of water the weight percent of metals added was 10 wt for each fe iii and ni ii while for co ii metal it was 5 wt then about 10 wt of urea was dissolved in 20 ml distilled water and added to the prior mixture under vigorous stirring for 60 min the mixture was transferred into a 100 ml teflon lined autoclave tube inside a stainless steel reactor then the reactor was heated in an electrical muffle at 180 c for 180 min a suspended darkish brown powder of the pretreated cotton stalks in a liquid was obtained the cotton stalks hydrochar product was separated through filtration and then washed thoroughly with hot water after that it was dried at 80 c overnight and subjected to the pyrolysis process as shown in the next step 2 2 preparation of cnts for this purpose a vertical bed tubular reactor of stainless steel 27 mm of internal diameter and 600 mm of length having open neck in the upper part was used according to the method described elsewhere 44 in brief a ternary catalyst of fe ni cu oxides supported on al2o3 substrate was used to enhance the graphitization and rolling of graphene sheets during the pyrolysis of cotton stalks hydrochar the mass ratios of fe ni cu metals are 1 1 0 5 were loaded onto al oh 3 by a wetness impregnation then followed by heating at 750 c for 120 min in an electrical muffle both hydrochar and fe ni cu al2o3 samples were mixed together at mass ratio of 10 1 and then placed in the bottom of vertical reactor tube after closing the tubular the furnace was heated slowly up to 300 c at heating rate of 10 c min under n2 gas flow and held for 10 min then the temperature was raised slowly to 830 c and hold for 60 min without passing of any gases after cooling the furnace the black sample was subjected to further purification using mixture from 5 m of hno3 and h2so4 followed by washing thoroughly with hot distilled water till ph of filtrate becomes 6 and driedat 90 c overnight then the purified carbon nanotubes sample was functionalized by h2o2 30 wt at 25 c for 240 min the functionalized cnts sample was washed with h2o for several times and dried againat 90 c and kept in closed glass vial for any further use 2 3 preparation of tio2 cnts nanocomposite tio2 cnts nanocomposite was prepared by sol gel method about 2 g of cnts produced was well dispersed in 2 wt of dissolved sodium dodecyl sulfate sds anionic surfactant in 20 ml distilled water ch3 ch2 11oso3na sigma aldrich 98 using a magnetic stirrer for 10 min and then sonicated for 30 min in another beaker a milky sol of titanium isopropoxide tip ti och ch3 2 4 was prepared by mixing 2 84 g tip with 15 ml solution of ethanol and glacial acetic acid 1 2 under vigorous stirring for 30 min this sol was poured to mixture of cnts sds slowly dropwise under vigorous stirring for 120 min to attain good dispersion of ti nanoparticles onto the surface of cnts the ph of this mixture was adjusted to 9 using nh4oh solution and finally 10 ml of ethanol were added to the mixture keeping the stirring for another 30 min the final suspension was centrifuged and washed three times in ethanol the resulting nanocomposite was separated and dried at 60 c in an air oven overnight afterwards the solid product was thermally treated in a stainless steel reactor at 500 c for 180 min under flowing n2 gas to obtain tio2 cnts photocatalyst 2 4 preparation of silver nanoparticles 2 4 1 synthesis of cationic surfactant cationic surfactant c10 was synthesized through two steps esterification is the first step in this step 4 amino pyridine 0 1 mol 9 4 g was added to equal amount of 4 amino benzoic acid 0 1 mol 13 7 g in 50 ml of xylene as solvent the mixture was refluxed until we get the required amount of water 1 8 ml then the product was evaporated from xylene to produce 4 amino n pyridine 4 yl benzamide in the second step quaterniaztion the product from the first step 0 1 mol 21 3 g 4 amino n pyridine 4 yl benzamide and 0 1 mol 22 1 g bromodecane in 50 ml of absolute ethanol as a solvent were refluxed for 50 h the product 4 amino n 1 decylpyridine 1 ium bromide 4 yl benzamide was left to cool and evaporated from ethanol then purified by diethyl ether and recrystallized by ethanol to obtain the synthesized cationic surfactant as shown in fig 1 the chemical structure of the prepared cationic surfactant was confirmed earlier by ftir and 1h nmr spectroscopy 40 2 4 2 preparation of silver nanoparticles colloidal solution agnps using chemical reduction method described elsewhere 45 46 agnps colloidal solution was prepared all solutions of reacting materials were prepared in distilled water in typical experiment 50 ml of 1 10 3 m agno3 was heated up to boiling then drop by drop 5 ml of 1 trisodium citrate was added and during this procedure the solution was mingled strongly and heated until pale yellow is formed next it was removed from the device of heating and stirred until being cooled to be suited with room temperature 2 4 3 preparation of the cationic surfactants coated silver nanoparticles 5 ml saturated surfactant solution in deionized water was mixed with a 20 ml of citrate capped silver nanoparticles solution and efficiently stirred for 24 h until the yellow color was vanished 47 2 5 wrapping of tio2 cnts with agnps the fabrication of the tio2 cnts agnps nanocomposites was carried out according to the previous publication 48 in brief agnps solution 50 ml was added to cnts 0 2 g suspended in 50 ml ethanol the mixture was stirred for 24 h the precipitate was separated by centrifugation washed thoroughly with distilled water and dried under vacuum overnight the same method was used for preparation a ternary nanocomposite with surfactant and labeled as tio2 cnts agnps c10 2 6 characterization techniques several techniques were performed for characterizing the physico chemical properties of the synthesized nanocomposites high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem jeol jem 1230 japan was operated at 200 kv this technique was used to confirm the formation of nanotubes from pyrolysis of cotton stalks hydrochar preparation of samples for tem analysis was carried out by dispersing a few amount of the carbon product in ethanol solution by sonication for 30 min and depositing a drop of the suspension on a carbon coated copper tem grid the morphology and chemical compositions of the prepared samples were estimated by field emission scanning electron microscope sem combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction fe sem fei quanta feg 250 edx determination of surface functional groups developed on the surface of cnts and their nanocomposites was carried out using qualitative fourier transform infrared ftir absorption spectroscopy which was implemented by the use of ati mattson infinity series tm bench top 961 overcome by winning first tm v 2 01 software x ray diffraction patterns of samples were investigated using a modern pan analytical diffractometer xpert pro model nickel filtered cupper radiation λ 1 542 å was used all the diffraction patterns were examined at room temperature and under constant operating conditions 40 kv 40 ma the scanning rate was at 2θ 1 min the studied samples were grounded to a fine powder and mounted in an appropriate aluminum folder the x ray diffraction pattern is essentially a plot of intensities as a function of the angle of reflection even by the material absence of any diffraction peaks in the x ray pattern indicates the amorphous character of the sample under examination raman spectra of the samples were recorded with a micro raman spectrometer labram hr horiba jy using a laser of wavelength 633 nm uv vis absorption spectra were recorded with a jasco v 500 spectrophotometer in the wavelength range 190 1400 nm pl emission spectra of samples were obtained with a fluoromax 3 spectrofluorimeter using a xe lamp as excitation source with excitation at 325 nm the textural parameters such as brunauer emmett teller surface area sbet m2 g total pore volume vp cm3 g and average pore diameter rp å were determined using nitrogen adsorption analysis at 196 c bel sorp microtracbel crop japan 49 to estimate the pore size distributions n2 gas adsorption data were analyzed using nldft method which allows the quantification of both micro and mesopores 50 uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured on a uv vis nir spectrophotometer jasco corp v 570 uk with wavelength range of 190 2500 nm was performed to estimate the band gap energy eg ev of each sample the total organic carbon toc of the samples accounted in the dye before and after photocatalytic process was also analyzed using a multi n c 2000 analytic jena analyzer germany 2 7 photocatalytic experiments using h2o2 visible light the photocatalytic performance of each sample was tested toward degradation of a cationic dye such as methylene blue mb under both dark and h2o2 visible light irradiation prior to the visible irradiation the solid sample and mb dye solution mixture was sonicated for 30 min to attain well dispersion of sample and then stirred in the dark for further 30 min at 25 c in order to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium and to ensure that the removal of dye was completed by the photocatalytic process variable factors such as h2o2 concentration 0 139 0 391 and 0 782 mol l dose of photocatalyst 0 2 1 g l and initial dye concentrations 10 100 mg l were studied the photocatalytic experiments were performed by adding 50 mg of sample in 50 ml of mb dye solution with initial concentrations of 10 20 and 50 mg l at initial ph 6 of dye solution then h2o2 was added and the visible light was irradiated using house hold fluorescent lamp of 150 w philips this lamp irradiates outside at a distance of 10 cm from the surface of dye solution the temperature of the solution was maintained constant throughout the reaction then 1 ml of an aliquot solution of the dye was withdrawn at regular interval times after dilution into 10 ml the dye solution was separated from the solid by centrifuging at 1000 rpm for 10 min the remaining concentration of mb dye in the supernatant solution was estimated using the spectrophotometer at its λmax value 664 nm in order to assess the reproducibility and error of adsorption and photodegradation tests the absorbance of dye was recorded three times to take the average value regarding real life application of heterogeneous photocatalytic systems presence of various inorganic ions should be taken into account thus the effect of different dissolved inorganic salts on the photocatalytic performance of the prepared nanocomposite was studied using 0 02 m of nacl nahco3 and na2so4 salts prepared in 50 ml of mb dye solution 20 mg l and 0 5 g l of tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps or tio2 cnts agnps c10 samples and 0 782 mol l of h2o2 all mixture was stirred for 60 min in dark and then exposed to visible light for 120 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 tem sem and edx investigations the morphologies of the prepared cnts and the fabricated nanocomposites tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 as shown in fig 2 were demonstrated using tem the vertical pyrolysis of cotton stalks hydrochar at 830 c for 60 min produced clear multi walled carbon nanotubes with outer diameters of 50 100 nm the shape of cnts obtained seems to be bamboo like as illustrated in fig 2a clearly tio2 nanoparticles their sizes ranged from 5 10 nm are supported uniformly on walls of cnts fig 2b since the amount of agnps added on surface of tio2 cnts was less than 1 wt the shape of distributed agnps cannot be observed however black shadow was seen around spherical particles of tio2 fig 2 c and d according to the loading route of agnps some significant changes on tio2 cnts surface were observed after loading agnps by a chemical reduction method singly and in presence of surfactant c10 in fig 2c there is a swelling in the wall cnts on the other hand no changes on tio2 cnts agnps c10 surface are detected thus the introduction of agnps through c10 surfactant could preserve the structure of cnts as well as led to good dispersion of those on the surface of tio2 cnts fig 3 shows the sem images of tio2 cnts nanocomposite and its corresponding nanocomposite of tio2 cnts ag c10 as expected the tio2 assembled regularly on the surface of cnts upon loading agnps in presence of c10 surfactant the network of tio2 cnts was covered with agnps yielding rough surface the edx spectrum of tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite is depicted in fig 4 confirming the presence of ti and agnps also the histogram figure shows the elemental compositions in cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposites the weight percent of agnps was less than 1 the prominent elements of high content are c and o in all specimens fig 4 3 2 ftir analysis in order to reflect the changes in surface chemistry of the prepared nanocomposites ftir analysis was investigated the decoration of cnts surface with tio2 and then agnps led to significant alterations as illustrated in fig 5 ftir bands associated to oxygen containing functional groups as well as bands related to ti o c and ag ti o c groups were determined most of ftir bands in the cnts obtained are assigned to the oh stretching of cooh groups and of the adsorbed water molecules at 3430 cm 1 and to the deformation vibration of this group between 1623 and 1420 cm 1 as a result of functionalization of cnts with h2o2 the sharp band at 1093 cm 1 is attributed to co stretching vibration in carboxylic ether alcohol and ester in tio2 cnts sample the intensity of these vibration bands at 3430 and 1623 cm 1 is decreased with shifting to low wavenumbers at 3424 and 1567 cm 1 indicating that deformation vibration of oh is replaced by deformation vibration of ti oh bond on the surface of cnts the appearance of broad absorption band between 1000 and 500 cm 1 is ascribed to the bending vibrations of ti o ti and ti o c bonds 22 27 29 also the shifting in the absorption band of co from 1093 to 1115 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of ti o c bond the same results have been reported early by others 27 31 concerning to tio2 cnts ag and tio2 cnts ag c10 nanocomposites their ftir spectra show differences in the intensity of these bands compared to ftir spectrum of tio2 cnts and based on the loading procedure of agnps however ftir spectrum of tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite included a variety absorption bands as compared to that observed in ftir spectrum of tio2 cnts ag nanocomposite especially in the range between 1680 and 1000 cm 1 with disappearing band at 3430 cm 1 3 3 xrd measurements fig 6 illustrates the results of xrd patterns obtained from cnts and their nanocomposites two characteristic diffraction peaks for cnts were appeared at 2θ 25 8 and 44 3 both patterns are indexed to 002 and 101 planes of typical graphite sheets 23 36 37 however no diffraction peak was observed corresponding to cnts in the xrd pattern of tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 samples which might be due to the shielding of main characteristic peak of cnts at 25 8 by the main peak of anatase tio2 at 25 3 36 similar results were reported in the literature 37 in all nanocomposites their xrd patterns showed new peaks at 2θ 25 3 101 38 0 200 47 9 004 and 54 8 105 which affirmed the formation of anatase phases on the surface of cnts jcpds no 21 1276 37 on the other hand the peak observed at 62 8 002 was ascribed to rutile phase of tio2 the addition of agnps nanoparticles in absence of c10 only diffraction peak at 38 3 111 was found that overlapped with the peak of anatase in tio2 cnts agnps nevertheless the diffraction peaks related to agnps in tio2 cnts agnps c10 can be observed at 2θ 31 1 113 and 44 3 200 jcpds no 84 0713 and 04 0783 51 which referred to the face centered cubic fcc structure of silver nanoparticles this result reveals that agnps exist as zero valent form on the surface of tio2 cnts which is in agreement with the previous studies 37 41 3 4 raman spectroscopy raman spectra of cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposites are presented in fig 7 for cnts two prominent bands centered at 1335 and 1580 cm 1 were corresponded to the characteristic d and g bands of cnts the d band relates to the defects and structural disorder in carbon nanotubes and g band reflects the in plane vibration of sp2 bonded carbon atoms 52 in case of tio2 cnts nanocomposite additional four bands appeared at 149 389 516 and 625 cm 1 related to lattice vibrational modes of eg b1g a1g and eg that agree with the lattice vibrational modes of tio2 anatase 16 however in case of tio2 cnts doped with agnps in absence of c10 surfactant the intensity of such bands is decreased whereas is conversely when agnps loaded onto tio2 cnts in presence of c10 surfactant clearly it was found that the incorporation of both tio2 and agnps into the cnts matrix reduced the intensity of d and g bands probably this is due to the interfacial interaction between cnts and tio2 or tio2 agnps 38 39 this result indicated also that the entire surface of cnts is uniformly covered with agnps tio2 nanoparticles 3 5 textural properties the adsorption desorption isotherms of n2 gas at 196 c onto the synthesized samples and their corresponding pore size distributions using nldft method are illustrated in fig 8 the textural properties of cnts and those nanocomposites are listed in table 1 interestingly various adsorption desorption isotherms of n2 onto the samples synthesized were observed in fig 8a cnts and its tio2 cnts agnps nanocomposite produce a type iv with a hysteresis loop of h3 and h1 types according to the classification of iupac 49 50 respectively confirming their mesoporous structure after decorating cnts surface with tio2 nanoparticles tio2 cnts the adsorption isotherm belongs to type i as well as the same result with tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite was occurred hence tio2 cnts and its tio2 cnts agnps c10 are microporous materials these results are corroborated also with the pore size distribution plots using nldft analysis as depicted in fig 8b the highest peak of pore width in cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 was found to be 4 71 1 20 3 69 and 0 956 nm respectively moreover the results in table 1 exhibited that the specific surface area sbet m2 g of cnts increased from 110 to 187 m2 g 46 5 whereas the total pore volume vt cm3 g decreased from 0 198 to 0 098 cm3 g and associated with creation of micropores during the calcination of titanium isopropoxide to produce tio2 cnts on the other hand when tio2 cnts loaded with agnps a substantial decrease in both the sbet m2 g and vt cm3 g was obtained cf table 1 possibly the agnps close the internal pores developed in the tio2 cnts matrix however the specific surface area of tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite was higher than that of tio2 cnts agnps sample it can be concluded that the presence of c10 surfactant prevents the aggregation of agnps hence it enhances the active sites on the nanocomposite obtained 3 6 uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra of cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposites are shown in fig 9 it can be seen clearly that the absorption bands of the investigated samples are located in the range of 366 550 nm the cnts showed the lowest absorption band while tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite has the highest absorption band in the visible region accordingly the estimated band gap energy eg ev of each sample can be calculated according the following formula eg ev 1240 λg 36 where the band gap wavelength λg nm was obtained by extrapolating the wavelength edge of the absorption band in absorbance to the zero line from diffuse reflectance spectra as represented in fig 9 hence the values of the band gap energy of the cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 were calculated to be 3 39 ev 2 77 ev 2 48 ev and 2 25 ev respectively the presence of ag noble metal would extend largely the absorption behavior of tio2 from uv region wavelength 400 nm band gap energy of 3 2 ev to the visible light region due to their surface plasmon resonance spr effect 39 51 53 additionally the cnts as a porous support helps in the fast electron transport process and also works as an electron reservoir to reduce the recombination of electron hole pairs in tio2 resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity 53 thus the sample with the narrower band gap energy tio2 cnts agnps c10 possesses the higher photocatalytic activity the introduction of agnps into tio2 cnts using c10 surfactant effectively modified the electronic and crystal structures of tio2 supported on cnts and then facilitated the charge transfer among the tio2 valence or conduction band into the 4d level of ag ion 25 36 therefore the absorption of visible light is significantly improved as a result of the high reduction in the band gap energy of tio2 cnts 3 7 adsorption performance of samples the adsorption of mb dye onto the surface of samples was carried out and presented in fig 10 a the results revealed that the equilibrium attained at 60 min over all samples and tio2 cnts has the highest removal efficiency 60 as compared to others the adsorption behavior of mb dye over the samples was directly consistent with the order of specific surface area cf table 1 3 8 photodegradation performance of samples on the other hand the photocatalytic performance of cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 were demonstrated and their results are shown in fig 10b photocatalytic degradation of mb dye in absence of photocatalyst and under illumination of visible light was measured also in case of mb dye solution alone under visible light illumination through 240 min a minimal photodegradation rate 2 was observed for cnts its photoactivity toward degradation of mb reached to 32 in 240 min while after loading tio2 onto cnts there was a remarkable increase in degradation of mb dye reached to 66 this finding may be attributed to the combined factors of i the higher adsorption of mb dye onto this nanocomposite due to its higher surface area than cnts alone and ii the enhancement in photoactivity of tio2 nanoparticles by loading onto the cnts surface which rose to an increase in degradation of mb dye 20 moreover cnts as a photosensitizer can inject an electron in the conduction band ecb of tio2 and triggers the photocatalytic formation of reactive hydroxyl radicals ho which are responsible for further enhancement in the photodegradation of mb dye 54 additionally to the role of cnts agnps act as photoelectron trapping that improves the photocatalytic activity of tio2 cnts by lowering the electron hole pairs recombination in the current study agnps were loaded onto the surface of tio2 cnts in absence of surfactant tio2 cnts ag and in presence of surfactant tio2 cnts agnps c10 tio2 cnts agnps nanocomposite showed slight increase in the photodegradation of mb dye 68 of dye molecules was degraded in 240 min while tio2 cnts agnps c10 exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance 100 of dye was degraded in 180 min as shown in fig 10b this result confirms that the well distribution of agnps over tio2 cnts as a result of c10 surfactant effect is giving rise to the prolong life of charges separation i e electrons and holes and enhanced photocatalytic activity of tio2 cnts 3 9 factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of tio2 cnts agnps c10 the effects of important factors such as h2o2 concentration 0 139 0 391 and 0 782 mol l dose of photocatalyst 0 2 1 g l and initial dye concentration 10 100 mg l on the photocatalytic performance of the highest efficiency i e tio2 cnts agnps c10 were investigated the results of these factors are illustrated in fig 11 clearly the increase in the concentration of h2o2 expedited the photodegradation rate of mb dye over the photocatalyst at the early interval times as shown in fig 11a after 90 min a slow photodegradation rate toward mb dye was observed thus h2o2 enhanced the photocatalytic degradation process accompanying with full degradation of mb dye molecules at 120 min with 0 782 mol l of h2o2 the reason on this result is attributed to formation of ho radicals which results from decomposition of h2o2 over tio2 cnts agnps c10 under visible light irradiation according to the following reaction paths 55 1 h2o2 hv 2 ho 2 etio2 cb h2o2 ho oh accordingly the produced ho radicals can attack both the adsorbed and the remained dye molecules in the aqueous solution and then decompose them rapidly looking at fig 11b as the photocatalyst dose increased from 0 2 to 0 5 g l the photodegradation of mb dye increased also from 60 to 100 at 120 min and then decreased remarkably to 88 with 1 g l of photocatalyst thus further increase in the photocatalyst showed less effective in the photocatalytic degradation of mb dye this may result in agglomeration of photocatalysts particles and hence reduces the penetration of visible light into active sites the optimum dose is favored at 0 5 g l when 0 5 g l of photocatalyst was conducted with different concentrations of mb dye aqueous solution 10 20 50 and 100 mg l with 0 782 mol l of h2o2 for 120 min under visible irradiation the photocatalytic degradation of the studied dye was significantly impacted as shown in fig 11c more than 20 mg l the prepared tio2 cnts agnps c10 photocatalyst exhibited low photoactivity toward degradation of mb dye molecules where about 65 8 and 33 7 of mb molecules were degraded upon increasing the initial concentration to from 50 and 100 mg l respectively this finding postulates that the availability of reactive species was insufficient with increasing the initial concentration of mb dye under visible irradiation and constant loading of photocatalyst furthermore the effect of different dissolved inorganic salts such as nacl nahco3and na2so4 salts on the photocatalytic degradation of mb dye over the prepared nanocompositetio2 cnts agnps c10 and in presence 0 782 mol l of h2o2 is shown in fig 12 it was found that three anions cl hco3 and so4 2 have imposed negative effect on the photodegradation as compared to mb dye solution without anions blank thus the presence of these anions may compete with the adsorption of dye molecules on the tio2 cnts agnps c10 surface and deactivate the performance of photocatalyst consequently it reduces the photodegradation of mb dye such suppression in the photocatalytic performance might confirm that these anions behaved as scavengers and hinder the photoactivity of positive holes hvb and hydroxyl radicals ho in order to degrade mb dye thus the photodegradation of mb molecules was decreased from 100 up to 85 80 and 66 for nacl na2so4 and nahco3 salts respectively the same results were documented previously by other authors 54 3 10 reusability of tio2 cnts agnps c10 photocatalyst the stability of photocatalyst in the photocatalytic processes to remediate the colored wastewater which discharged from different industries is a pivotal factor to reduce the operation cost with regard to the practical applications the reusability of the tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite was determined by using the same photocatalyst repeatedly for 5 cycles fig 13 a shows that the photocatalytic activity of nanocomposite decreases slightly from 100 to 92 within three cycles and then became 77 at the fifth cycle based on the prescribed conditions thus the findings revealed that the prepared nanocomposite is an effective and stable photocatalyst within three cycles in order to assess the occurrence of photodegradation onto the surface of tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite the sem image of photocatalyst after photodegradation of mb dye was determined by comparing fig 13b with that fresh fig 3b fresh sample significant changes were occurred after photodegradation process it can be observed that there layers fully covered the surface of nanocomposite confirming the success of process moreover the mineralization degree of mb dye was estimated by measuring the total organic carbon as shown in the next section 3 11 estimation of total organic carbon toc in order to determine the mineralization efficacy of mb dye over the surface of cnts tio2 cnts tio2 cnts agnps and tio2 cnts agnps c10 samples the total organic carbon of the reaction solution was measured before and after irradiation as given in table 2 obviously the values of toc of treated mb dye solutions were decreased in presence of the synthesized photocatalyst samples accordingly tio2 cnts agnps c10 sample enhanced the mineralization degree of mb dye and showed a remarkable decrease in toc value which reached to 84 5 upon irradiation of mb dye under visible light for 180 min generally the mineralization pathway of dyes contains the destruction of organic dye molecules into aromatic rings and aliphatic acids as intermediates during the photocatalytic degradation of dyes in presence of effective semiconductor e g tio2 moreover the heteroatoms e g n and s in the dye structure will be converted into nitrate and sulfate anions as well as harmless gaseous co2 and h2o under photocatalytic processes 56 the proposed scheme of tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite and mb dye solution under photodegradation on the basis of previous studies 30 36 40 is shown in fig 14 the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes on the tio2 cnts agnps c10 interface is shown in fig 14 agnps in contact with tio2 captured the photogenerated electrons e cb increased the separation of electrons holes and retarded their recombination electrons and holes were initiated the formation of ho radicals and or superoxide ions o2 the process of transferring electrons e cb from tio2 to agnps occurs spontaneously due to the lower fermi level of agnps 39 40 electrons stored in agnps are transferred to the surface of cnts which acts as donors of electrons to oxidize h2o2 into ho radicals ho radicals produced in this process have sufficient oxidative potential to degrade mb dye molecules in summary the tio2 cnts agnps c10 nanocomposite showed the best photocatalytic degradation activity of the mb dye solution under visible light irradiation 4 conclusions fabrication of nanocomposites from cnts tio2 and agnps as efficient photocatalysts for photodegradation of methylene blue dye is successfully investigated in this study for the first time cnts sample of bamboo like structure was synthesized from cotton stalks waste via subsequent catalytic hydrothermal and carbonization chc routes the produced cnts sample was wrapped by tio2 nanoparticles by sol gel and then calcinated at 500 c for 180 min to form amorphous anatase on the surface of cnts the obtained tio2 cnts was decorated by silver nanoparticles less than 1 in weight of agnps individually tio2 cnts agnps and in presence of synthesized cationic surfactant tio2 cnts agnps c10 in order to increase its dispersibility and surface interaction between tio2 and cnts tem and sem techniques exhibited the presence of cnts decorated by tio2 and agnps xrd and raman spectroscopy affirmed the presence of patterns which related to cnts tio2 and agnps also results deduced from n2 gas adsorption desorption at 196 c showed that both nanocomposites tio2 cnts and tio2 cnts agnps c10 have the largest surface area uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs confirmed that tio2 cnts agnps c10 has the lowest band gap energy of 2 25 ev resulting in a great photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation from all above findings it can be deduced clearly that the cnts synthesized from cotton stalks enhanced the surface and electronic properties of tio2 while agnps significantly reduced the recombination of electron hole pairs in tio2 cnts agnps c10 acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supports provided by the national research centre nrc egypt under the
