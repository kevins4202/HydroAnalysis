19445,internal circulation ic anaerobic systems are especially suitable when plant designs that involve both small footprints and high organic loading rates 25 kg cod m 3 d 1 are required however given that operating anaerobic processes at high organic loads increases their vulnerability to external disturbances real time indicators of the stability conditions become particularly pertinent for ic reactors this paper addresses the design and full scale validation of a software sensor that uses only feeding flow rate and biogas flow rate measurements to classify the operating conditions of the reactor as strongly moderately or weakly stable a simulation based procedure was used to design the software sensor and configure its parameters then the performance of the software sensor was tested under real conditions in a full scale ic reactor of 1679 m3 installed in a recycled paper mill rpm graphical abstract image 1 keywords adm1 anaerobic digestion ic technology modelling pulp paper software sensor 1 introduction the waste and wastewater treatment market in the pulp and paper industry is expected to increase by 60 between 2012 and 2020 meyer and edwards 2014 currently the pulp and paper business produces nearly 400 m i l l i o n t o n s of paper every year skogsindustrierna 2010 and it consumes huge amounts of water ranging from 10 to 100 m 3 per ton of paper produced meyer and edwards 2014 greenbaum 2002 fpac 2009 thus it is estimated that the total amount of c o d available globally for recovering energy from mill wastewaters by means of anaerobic digestion ad might range from 4 to 400 m i l l i o n t o n s per year by transforming only 25 of that c o d load into biogas 1 to 100 t w h of electricity could be generated at a regional level as reported by aspapel aspapel 2015 71 spanish paper mills produced 6 2 m i l l i o n t o n s of paper in 2015 which is the sixth largest production in the eu and accounts for 3 of spanish gdp with regard to recycled paper mills rpm in 2015 spain was a leading figure in europe providing 5 2 m i l l i o n t o n s of recycled paper and board additionally 69 of paper used as raw material for recycling was locally sourced thus improving environmental and economic efficiency and contributing to the circular economy even though the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents has been traditionally addressed through aerobic activated sludge technology the last two decades have witnessed an exponential growth in anaerobic technology with two thirds of all anaerobic reactors treating effluents from rpm habets and driessen 2007 nonetheless it is believed that the benefits of ad can be harnessed to the fullest only when combined with aerobic post treatment buyukkamaci and koken 2010 accordingly nowadays a common scenario in the pulp and paper mill industry involves a combination of ad and activated sludge processes from an environmental perspective it is worth noting that 25 k g o f c o 2 emissions per ton of pulp air dried can be avoided thanks to combining anaerobic treatment with aerobic post treatment with a net positive energy amount that can make up 3 5 of the total mill energy consumption with regard to real world applications of ad technologies in the pulp and paper industry the popularity of the internal circulation ic technology an excellent representative of the third generation anaerobic reactors has been increasing relative to the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb technology habets and driessen 2007 since 2000 the ic technology can be thought of as two uasbs working in tandem where the bottom one has a high load and the top one has a low load thanks to their improved design relative to other anaerobic technologies ic reactors can simultaneously separate the gas phase the liquid phase and the biomass which results in enhanced biomass retention better treatment efficiency and superior quality treated wastewater mao et al 2015 thus ic reactors can operate at organic loading rates 20 50 k g c o d m 3 d 1 that are 2 3 times higher than uasb systems which together with their large height to diameter ratio 4 8 leads to plant designs characterized by lower investment cost and considerably smaller footprint wang et al 2015 when compared to aerobic systems anaerobic processes are in general more vulnerable to common disturbances such as organic feeding overloads the presence of inhibitory compounds and temperature drops two options for dealing with the above drawbacks are either to adopt oversized plant designs or to install real time monitoring and control tools capable of detecting and rejecting any critical disturbance within a reasonable time in this regard the latter has been an active area of investigation in the last decade the result being a plethora of published works addressing the design of automatic controllers for ad technology a detailed review of the most relevant literature on this topic is reported by jimenez et al 2015 the crucial role that mathematical modelling plays in control theory explains in part why the control of anaerobic digesters received special attention after the publication of the adm1 model anaerobic digestion model no 1 batstone et al 2002 in the same way as the activated sludge models henze et al 2000 stimulated the design and evaluation of automatic controllers for aerobic processes the adm1 has become de facto the standard modelling framework in simulation studies of control strategies for anaerobic systems from a practical perspective the lack of reliable and cost effective on line instrumentation has been a major barrier to adopting real time control solutions in full scale ad plants for instance though it is widely accepted that total alkalinity t a intermediate alkalinity i a and volatile fatty acids v f a are three key indicators for the early detection of unstable operational conditions on line industrial measurement devices are expensive and only affordable in plants where process failure is completely prohibited a direct consequence is that many control approaches validated either in the lab or in pilot scale plants remain unfeasible in real world applications in this context many different real time algorithms have been proposed that indirectly estimate unmeasured variables in order to provide valuable information about the operating conditions of anaerobic processes typically known as either state observers or software sensors these algorithms can be classified in two broad categories 1 those that make use of simplified models of the process and 2 those that rely on the intentional application of disturbances with regard to the first category some representative published studies in the wastewater sector are reported in cecil and kozlowska 2010 and jimenez et al 2015 a detailed review of software sensors for biological wastewater treatment processes can be found in haimi et al 2013 though only a few of the referenced works focus on anaerobic systems in particular tay and zhang 2000 develop a neural fuzzy model to predict the response of high rate anaerobic reactor the model measures at the nth time instant values of organic hydraulic and alkalinity loading rates olr hrt and alr methane production effluent total organic carbon toc and effluent vfa and predict the values of methane production effluent toc and effluent vfa at the n 1 th instant in marsili libelli and müller 1996 an adaptive fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed to recognise input disturbances in a small pilot scale anaerobic digester in this case the input variables used by the classification algorithm were the biogas flow rate and the concentration of hydrogen in the off gas more recently lara cisneros et al 2016 developed a robust non linear software sensor to estimate the concentration of vfa in continuous anaerobic digesters by using only methane flow rate measurements similarly alcaraz gonzález et al 2017 proposed a non linear model based virtual controller observer vco which combines an observer with an output feedback controller to estimate the influent concentration of c o d and v f a under different operating conditions within the second category the most popular approach consists of superimposing short pulses on the feeding flow rate and analysing their effect on variables of interest in order to diagnose the state of the process such a strategy is the basis of the so called probing controllers which are aimed at optimizing some measurable variable of the process velut et al 2007 specifically steyer et al 1999 applied this control solution in a pilot scale anaerobic reactor to maximize the instantaneous production of biogas in comparison to more sophisticated control approaches the intrinsic simplicity of probing control strategies gives them a certain advantage when applying them to full scale anaerobic plants however configuring the pulse parameters i e amplitude and length is a major issue when installing probing controllers since the values of these parameters are strongly dependent on both the composition of the feeding substrate and the reactor characteristics in this regard while using empirical trial and error tuning methods is an acceptable option for lab and pilot scale plants off line configuration procedures are imperative for full scale plants a classic solution for the latter is to develop tuning techniques that exploit the benefits of mathematical modelling and simulation tools this paper addresses the design of a software sensor that diagnoses the stability conditions in anaerobic reactors the operating principle of this virtual sensor is to excite the reactor by superimposing pulses on the feeding flow rate moreover a general model based simulation methodology is proposed which allows the parameters of the software sensor to be calculated for any specific case this methodology is applied to find the optimum pulse characteristics for a full scale ic reactor operating in a spanish rpm the paper concludes with an analysis and discussion of some real tests carried out in this reactor with the aim of assessing the practical reliability of the software sensor 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the effluent treatment plant the full scale ic reactor that has been used to test the real time software sensor is operating in the effluent treatment plant etp of a rpm in northern spain fig 1 the etp was designed to treat a 650 m 3 h 1 wastewater flow rate in order to optimize the water cycle in the manufacturing process the etp treats process water by means of the following physicochemical and biological units 1 primary clarification and pre acidification tank pre treatment stage 2 anaerobic digestion and 3 activated sludge process and softening post treatment stage the aforementioned units are organized in two parallel treatment lines with the main goal of ad being cod removal and biogas production and where the remaining cod removal is attained thanks to activated sludge units fig 2 part of the treated wastewater from the activated sludge unit is recycled into the manufacturing process whereas a proportion reaches a unique softening tank that is based on lamellar clarification and lime addition and that aims to increase the recirculation flow to the ad reactors a feeding tank prior to the ad reactors allows for wastewater conditioning by means of phosphate and ammonia addition it is known that in mill streams often are deficient in the nutrients that are necessary for anaerobic treatment and so in most cases macronutrients and trace nutrients have to be added at the pre acidification stage the ic reactor chosen to test the software sensor has a total volume of 1679 m 3 and the working volume is close to 1511 m 3 the hydraulic retention time hrt and the organic loading rate olr for the operating period taken as baseline to design and validate the software sensor were on average 5 h and 28 k g c o d m 3 d 1 respectively 2 2 mathematical model of the ic reactor though different approaches have been proposed for formulating mathematical models for granular sludge anaerobic reactors saravanan and sreekrishnan 2006 there is still considerable controversy about the underlying mechanisms behind both the flow pattern and the structure of granules most simulation studies on anaerobic biofilm processes have focused on the uasb technology where the general conclusion is that the operation of uasb systems can be satisfactorily predicted by using simplified formulations in which ideal mixing conditions are assumed and internal phenomena within the biofilm are not taken into account hinken et al 2014 lohani et al 2016 in contrast as far as the authors are aware there is no evidence of specific modelling and simulation studies for ic reactors the only exception is the very recent paper by feldman et al 2017 whose most remarkable innovation is the development of a dynamic model that includes specific formulations to describe the main mechanisms that take place inside the biofilm i e granule growth and distribution and microbial competition for substrate and space within the biofilm the above model is verified using real data from a full scale ic reactor however no specific details are given as to how the model parameters of the biofilm were calibrated and which real measurements were used to find their values when it comes to simulating the operation of full scale reactors the complexity of the mathematical model must be consistent with the quality and quantity of data available for calibration in general the more complex the model is the broader the range of operating situations that can be reproduced however in addition to increasing computational costs model complexity adds extra coefficients whose values are often unknown which means that a larger amount of real data is required for calibration the complexity of the model must also be consistent with the intended primary use if the model is intended for solving design problems a reduced algebraic model will be sufficient in contrast if the purpose is to design feedback controllers dynamic models are imperative however the uncertain attenuation property of feedback means that only the behaviour of the process around its cut off frequency will need to be correctly reproduced aström and hägglund 1995 in this study the ultimate objective of the model is to support the design of the software sensor for application to a full sale ic reactor in addition to this though the software sensor will initially be exclusively devoted to providing real time information to plant operators it is anticipated that in the future this software sensor will be the core component in achieving automatic regulation of the feeding flow rate fig 3 takes all these things into consideration showing a conceptual representation of the ic model that has been adopted to simulate the full scale ic anaerobic reactor aymerich et al 2015 while perfect mixing has been assumed to model the bottom and top compartments two coefficients f x b and f x t 0 f 1 have been included so as to reproduce biomass retention separately f 0 means ideal retention f 1 means no retention moreover the headspace of the full scale ic reactor has been mimicked in the model a single gas headspace collects the biogas produced by both compartments finally the standard adm1 model has been used for the biochemical transformations with some minor adaptations following the recommendations in de gracia et al 2009 some specific works that address the suitability of the adm1 model to predict the performance of high rate anaerobic reactors can be found in dereli et al 2010 spagni et al 2015 and pettigrew et al 2017 a compact formulation of the model equations used in the present study is given below let m b and m t be respectively the state vectors of the bottom and top reactors expressed in mass units similarly let m ghs be the state vector of the biogas headspace for the sake of clarity soluble and particulate states in m b and m t have been grouped in separate sub vectors m b m b s m b p and m t m t s m t p the model equations for soluble states can then be expressed as follows 1 d m b s d t q i n f x inf s m b s v b d m b s d t b i o 2 d m t s d t q i n f q w m b s v b m t s v t d m t s d t b i o where q i n f and q w are the feeding and sludge surplus flow rates m3 d 1 x inf s is a vector that contains the concentration of the soluble compounds in the influent wastewater v b and v t are the volume of the bottom and top compartments v b v t 755 m 3 and d m b s d t b i o and d m t s d t b i o represent the time derivative of soluble state variables due to biochemical physical and chemical reactions regarding particulate states the model equations are the following 3 d m b p d t q i n f x inf p q i n f q w f x b m b p v b q w m b p v b d m b p d t b i o 4 d m t p dt q inf q w f xb m b p v b f xt m t p v t d m t p dt bio where x inf p is a vector that contains the concentration of particulate compounds in the influent wastewater and d m b p d t b i o and d m t p d t b i o represent the time derivative of particulate state variables due to biochemical physical and chemical reactions the dynamics in the gas headspace can be expressed by the following equation 5 d m ghs d t q g o u t m ghs v g h s d m ghs d t b i o with q g o u t being the biogas flow rate m 3 d 1 v g h s the volume of the headspace v g h s 167 9 m 3 and d m ghs d t b i o the time derivative of the gaseous state variables due to mass gas transfer phenomena it must be pointed out that it has been assumed that the biogas output is channelled through an orifice the biogas flow rate q g o u t can be approximated by an equation that is proportional to the difference between the pressure p g h s in the gas headspace and a pre set value of p o 1 1 b a r in a pressure switch located in the orifice 6 q g o u t k g p g h s p o p g h s p o 7 q g o u t 0 p g h s p o the standard petersen matrix notation proposed in the adm1 model has been replicated in this model to express biochemical physical and chemical transformations 8 d m d t b i o e t ρ where e is the so called stoichiometry matrix and ρ is a column vector of kinetics moreover e and ρ have been split into four sub matrices e l s e l p e l g and e g l and two sub vectors ρ l and ρ l g ρ g l according to the criteria below e l s e l p and ρ l are associated with transformations that involve soluble and particulate state variables present only in the liquid phase e l g e g l and ρ l g ρ g l are related to transformations that involve state variables present in both the liquid and gas phases when incorporating this terminology into the general equations presented above the final model formulation results as follows 9 d m b s d t q i n f x inf s m b s v b e l s t ρ l b e l g t ρ l g b 10 d m t

with real data collected from the aforementioned full scale ic reactor an operating period of seven months was selected to calibrate the model while the first four months were devoted to adjusting the values of the model coefficients in order to reproduce the performance of the process the last three months were aimed at verifying the quality of predictions of the calibrated model it is worth noting to remark that rather than using computationally demanding calibration approaches based on monte carlo techniques sin et al 2007 an iterative trial and error procedure was followed for two main reasons 1 the final purpose of the model is to support the design of monitoring and control algorithms therefore if the uncertainty of the model is within reasonable limits it can be can be omitted and 2 the information that was available to calibrate the model limited the number of coefficients whose values could be adjusted to just a few table 1 shows the characterization parameters of the influent and effluent that are regularly measured in the process the average and the standard deviation of the parameters values for the whole calibration period are also included additionally a grab sample from the influent wastewater holding tank was specifically analysed to measure the fractionation of the organic matter with the following results v s s t s s 0 70 c o d f i l t c o d t o t 0 81 0 63 g h a c g v f a t o t 0 35 g h p r g v f a t o t 0 35 g h b u g v f a t o t additionally a biochemical potential test bmp was run with influent wastewater as suggested by sierra alvarez et al 1991 and field et al 1988 equally important in order to reproduce the ic reactor s operation measurements of the feeding flow rate q i n f the temperature t i c the mass of volatile suspended solids m v s s the sludge surplus mass flow rate m w the biogas flow rate q b i o g and the methane percentage in biogas c h 4 were also collected after compiling and processing all the collected information the calibration procedure involved two sequential steps firstly the default values reported in the adm1 model documentation were assigned to all the model coefficients then steady state simulations were run to calibrate the model specifically the average performance of the ic reactor during the first month of the calibration period was used to perform steady state simulations and to adjust the model coefficients secondly the bmp test was simulated to have a first estimate of those model coefficients that affect the decay kinetics finally once the model calibrated under steady state conditions four month dynamic simulations were run to refine the values of the model coefficients the initial condition adopted in these simulations was set to the steady state results obtained in the first step 2 4 model based simulation procedure for designing the software sensor the software sensor designed in this paper to assess the stability conditions in anaerobic reactors relies on the idea of exciting the ad reactor by superimposing short pulses on the feeding flow rate q i n f which provokes a transient response in the biogas flow rate q g o u t the trajectory of the latter provides indirect information for automatically diagnosing whether the process can accept a higher load or it has reached its maximum treatment capacity the design of this software sensor involves calculating the characteristics of the pulse to be applied that is finding appropriate values for both the amplitude a p and the length t p of this pulse to that end a steady state simulation analysis of the sensitivity of q g o u t to both a p and t p was conducted the effect of these two parameters on q g o u t was evaluated by running batch simulations for different combinations of the feeding flow rate the wastewater characteristics and the reactor temperature in order to reproduce a sufficiently broad range of operating conditions i e from strongly to weakly stable situations selecting the optimum pulse a p t p o p t took into consideration the following two criteria the value of tp must be as short as possible in order to minimize the effect of changes in the wastewater characteristics during the pulse but long enough as to provoke an observable response on q g o u t the value of a p must be sufficiently large as to provoke an observable effect on q g o u t but as small as possible so as to not affect the normal operation of the reactor regarding the amplitude of the pulse a p this parameter was expressed in relative rather than absolute m 3 d 1 units the rationale behind that decision was to facilitate the comparison between the simulated pulse responses of q g o u t regardless of the value of q i n f and as a result to identify patterns directly connected with the stability of the ic reactor the algorithm for real time diagnosis of the stability conditions was designed by combining the conclusions drawn from the simulated pulse responses of q g o u t and the analysis of real pulses in the full scale ic reactor 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the ic model table 2 shows the real data and the steady state predictions corresponding to the average operation of the ic reactor during the first month of the calibration period in that period the average measurements of q i n f o l r and t i c were 8184 m 3 d 1 28 8 k g c o d m 3 d 1 and 32 7 c respectively in a first iteration these predictions were achieved with minor adjustments of the adm1 default values the good prediction of q g o u t e r r o r 3 0 and c h 4 e r r o r 1 5 apparently revealed a satisfactory characterization of the biodegradable organic compounds in the influent wastewater the t s s total suspended solids concentration at the effluent of the ic reactor was correctly reproduced by adjusting the values of f x b and f x t moreover the values of these two coefficients had to be consistent with the fact that it is in the bottom compartment that almost all biodegradable c o d is removed while the top one works as a polishing stage habets et al 1997 eventually both issues were achieved by setting the values of these two coefficients to f x b 0 0033 and f x t 0 0294 more than 90 of the biodegradable c o d was removed in the bottom compartment with these values nonetheless the first iteration resulted in a poor prediction of c o d t o t e f f e r r o r 33 a plausible explanation could be that the content of inert matter in the influent was underestimated given that lab analysis methods of c o d determination contain some degree of uncertainty amanatidou et al 2012 the quality of the predictions was refined by adjusting the original influent wastewater characteristics in doing so it was necessary to repeat the steady state calibration and increase the total c o d at the influent by about 5 table 3 apart from providing valuable information to quantify the biodegradability of the wastewater the bmp test was also simulated to adjust some of the kinetic coefficients several authors have employed this test in combination with the adm1 yielding interesting results regarding the kinetics of the process girault et al 2013 biernacki et al 2013 in particular the first order kinetic parameters for the reactions of disintegration k d i s x c 2 and hydrolysis k h y d were modified in order to fit the constant rate that the methane production follows in the second half of the experiment fig 4 the fitting values for these two coefficients are given in table 3 as long as soluble b o d is available the production of methane is governed by acidogenic and methanogenic reactions in this particular case the first four days of the experiment fig 4 shows how the adm1 default values are not appropriate for predicting the real results for the first part of the bmp test a good fit of the entire bmp test involved substantial reductions in the values of the model coefficients associated with the above reactions i e k m s u k m a a k m f a k m c 4 k m p r k m x a c and k m h 2 for instance the maximum specific uptake rate of acetate k m a c had to be decreased from 8 default value to 0 24 however when this low value was used to reproduce the steady state performance model predictions were completely wrong such low values for these coefficients could be attributed to the fact that the inoculum had been inactive several days prior to the bmp test this might have caused microorganisms to work more slowly than predicted by the model at the beginning of the test therefore though a satisfactory fit could be achieved by adjusting the above kinetic coefficients results not shown these values were not adopted in the end the default adm1 values were kept the main outcome of the four month simulation period for the ic s long term operation which was used to refine the model fitting values obtained at the completion of the steady state study is summarized in fig 5 through boxplot representations the measurements for q i n f exhibited the smallest dispersion with 75 of the days being in the range between 7500 and 8500 m 3 d 1 while the average t i c was 31 6 c the measurements of this variable ranged between 29 c and 33 3 c for 75 of the whole period with minimum and maximum values being 24 2 c and 35 2 c respectively finally o l r had values between 24 7 and 32 2 k g c o d m 3 d 1 for more than 90 of the days fig 6 shows the simulation results for the long term operation of the full scale ic reactor at the end of the calibration process satisfactory predictions were achieved with minor adjustments to the model which had been previously calibrated for steady state conditions in this regard two main actions were carried out first after assuming a maximum uncertainty of 10 for the total c o d in the influent the characteristics of the wastewater were adapted with the objective of improving the prediction of q g o u t during the whole period secondly the values of f x b and f x t were slightly adjusted to get a better fit of the v s s measurements at the effluent finally f x t was fixed to 0 0279 and f x b to 0 0031 nonetheless it can be seen that though v s s e f f simulation results were good on average the model was not able to mimic the short term fluctuations that were detected in real observations this can be explained by the fact that v s s e f f depends to a great extent on the intricate hydrodynamics of the ic technology whose formulation in the ic model has been simplified by assuming perfect mixing see section 2 2 the simulation results for c o d t o t e f f also revealed a correct performance of the ic model in this case deviations between real observations and predictions were mainly attributed to an incorrect characterization of the real concentration of soluble inert products in the wastewater the sensitivity of the model coefficients to the quality of predictions was also analysed in particular the coefficient k m x a c its default value was 8 exhibited the highest sensitivity nonetheless for k m x a c 5 0 simulation results did not reveal appreciable differences a final step was needed to prove the predictive capabilities of the model formulated for the ic reactor this last stage aimed to test the prediction quality for an operating period other than the four month period chosen for model calibration to that end the three months following the four month calibration period were chosen fig 5 provides a visual insight into the main characteristics of this period the average values of q i n f o l r and t i c in that period were respectively 7821 m 3 d 1 29 0 k g c o d m 3 d 1 and 28 9 c and their respective ranges of variation were 6891 8442 21 9 34 8 and 24 2 36 3 fig 6 shows the simulation results for the validation period and compares them with the real performance of the ic reactor it can be seen that the quality of the model predictions in this validation period was quite similar to the quality obtained in the calibration period the linear regression between the real observations of q g o u t and their corresponding predictions illustrated in fig 7 resulted in a consistently high value of the r2 measure in both the calibration and validation periods in conclusion all the above results give evidence of the proposed model s suitability in reproducing the real operation of the ic reactor therefore it could be objectively stated at this point that the ic model was ready to be used to design the real time algorithm for diagnosing the stability conditions in the ic reactor 3 2 designing the optimum pulse characteristics the whole 7 month calibration of the ic model was analysed to define the operational scenarios for designing and testing the software sensor based on their full variability over the seven months the operating variables q i n f t i c c o d t o t i n f and v s i c were discretized into the following representative values q i n f m 3 d 1 6000 6500 7000 7500 8000 8500 9000 t i c c 24 27 30 33 36 c o d t o t i n f k g c o d m 3 4 42 4 78 5 20 5 61 6 01 6 43 v s i c t o n 72 85 98 the combination of all the values specified led to a total of 630 operating scenarios which covered all potential situations in the full scale ic reactor in order to find the optimum parameters of the pulse a p t p the effect of step increments δ q i n f in q i n f on both q g o u t and v f a e f f was simulated for each of the above scenarios moreover the above simulations were repeated for three values of the step amplitude a p δ q i n f a p q i n f namely 6 8 and 10 first the transient response of q g o u t in simulations corresponding to strongly stable operating conditions of the ic reactor were analysed five of these simulations are gathered in fig 8 where the time response of q g o u t and v f a e f f is illustrated the main characteristics of these simulations are provided in table 4 the low concentration of v f a e f f clearly evidences that the ic reactor is under operating conditions which are far away from its maximum treatment capacity the step δ q i n f took place in all the simulations at the same instant t 0 in fig 8 and the responses of q g o u t and v f a e f f were expressed as relative increases with respect to the steady state value prior to the application of δ q i n f moreover the relative increase of q g o u t was also divided by the respective value of a p so as to facilitate the analysis of the effect of this parameter on the time response of q g o u t it can be seen that regardless of the amplitude of the step a p the time response of q g o u t took about 40 50 m i n before reaching a new steady state regime thereafter the increase of q g o u t δ q g o u t was above 0 90 a p which indicates that the ic reactor could be operated at a much higher organic load this assertion is corroborated by the fact that δ q i n f caused a marginal effect on v f a e f f actually previous to the step δ q i n f the steady state values of v f a e f f were very low 0 020 k g c o d m 3 considering that the relative increment in δ v f a e f f due to δ q i n f was less than 15 then the new steady state regime for v f a e f f also resulted in very low concentration 0 023 k g c o d m 3 the results of the step response in strongly stable conditions showed that an appropriate design value for the pulse parameter t p should be within the range 40 50 m i n however the low hydraulic retention time of the storage tank that feeds the ic reactor 1 h makes the value t p 40 m i n desirable since it minimizes potential q g o u t fluctuations due to variations in the wastewater characteristics the three values of a p that were analysed did not give evidence of significant differences between their respective step responses therefore it was concluded that any value for this parameter between 6 and 10 represents a valid design solution values lower than 6 were rejected for their higher sensitivity to measuring errors on the other extreme amplitudes above 10 implied large disturbances in the ic reactor and thus were excluded from being potential design solutions in this respect the value a p 8 represents the best design option since it achieves a good trade off between sensitivity to measuring errors and the magnitude of disturbance the same analysis conducted for the scenario of strongly stable conditions was replicated for those simulations that evidenced to some extent unsafe i e near to instability conditions in the ic reactor five of these simulations are plotted together in fig 9 the main characteristics of each simulation are summarized in table 5 the first thing to note is that as expected the steady state regime of these simulations led to much higher accumulation of v f a e f f when compared to the strongly stable scenario specifically the v f a e f f steady state values ranged from 0 093 to 0 243 k g c o d m 3 which was indicative of different degrees of proximity to unstable conditions this becomes clearer when looking at the transient responses exhibited by q g o u t in fig 9 a common pattern in all these responses is that the time needed to reach the new steady state 150 m i n was considerably longer than under strongly stable operation 50 m i n actually 40 m i n after the step δ q i n f the relative increment of q g o u t was between 0 40 a p and 0 70 a p while being above 0 90 a p for strongly stable conditions to a certain extent this value can be thought of as an indirect measurement of how close the ic reactor is to its maximum treatment capacity thus it can be stated that values of δ q g o u t at instant t 40 m i n that are below 0 40 a p indicate weakly stable conditions and therefore there is a high risk of unstable operation in this respect the five operating scenarios chosen in this analysis exemplify two different situations in terms of their proximity to unstable conditions the first situation the three plots marked with ❶ in fig 9 represents operating points whose degree of stability is categorized as moderate in the sense that though the process is near the maximum treatment capacity large disturbances are necessary to provoke instability it can be seen that for these three operating scenarios and when a p 8 the value of δ q g o u t at t 40 m i n was between 0 55 a p and 0 70 a p in contrast in the second situation the two plots marked with ❷ stability conditions must be labelled as weak because even small disturbances would cause a complete failure of the reactor this fact becomes apparent through the response of δ v f a e f f in the two situations which showed an exponential increase that would eventually acidify the ic reactor moreover the larger the disturbance the shorter the time to provoke acidification it is for this reason that again t p 40 m i n and a p 8 are considered more suitable for pulse design under weak stability 3 3 design and full scale testing of the real time algorithm if the real response of δ q g o u t to feeding pulses had followed the smooth and clean pattern it exhibited in simulations indeed the design of the software sensor would have been straightforward unfortunately it turned out that the first pulses tested in the full scale reactor revealed a noisy and oscillating response that complicated the extraction of reliable information fig 10 left making it necessary to perform a data filtering algorithm on the original signal to that end a data fitting technique was implemented in which the following exponential delay model was adopted fig 10 right δ q g o u t t δ q g o t t d δ q g f δ q g o δ q g f e t t d t c t t d an interesting observation that occurred in most of the fitting solutions found for the tested pulse responses was that the time delay t d took values between 7 and 13 m i n for this reason the design value of the pulse length was increased from t p 40 m i n to t p 50 m i n fig 11 shows how the value that the exponential fitting curve takes at the end of the pulse point f is an adequate indicator of the stability conditions this indicator was called i n d x p f values of i n d x p f above 75 80 were associated with strongly stable conditions whereas values between 45 50 and 75 80 were attributed to moderate stability on the other hand values of i n d x p f below 45 50 were indicative of weakly stable situations in the ic reactor though initially the values of i n d x p f seemed to be sufficient for classifying the stability conditions it was observed that the presence of high noise levels in δ q g o u t had a negative effect on the reliability of i n d x p f which led in some cases to poor identification of the stability conditions in order to prevent this it was necessary to define two complementary indicators i n d a v g and i n d l a s t i n d a v g was computed as the mean value of the real measurements of δ q g o u t collected during the pulse the following three regions i n d x p f 60 65 35 40 i n d a v g 60 65 and i n d a v g 35 40 were respectively assigned to strongly moderately and weakly stable conditions similarly i n d l a s t was calculated as the average of the last n real sampled values of δ q g o u t during the pulse after analysing multiple pulse responses and by considering that δ q g o u t measurements were sampled at regular intervals of 0 5 m i n the parameter n was set to 20 fig 12 gives a visual insight on how these two indicators are calculated since i n d x p f and i n d l a s t are just two different forms of quantifying the value of δ q g o u t at the end of the pulse the same regions defined for i n d x p f to categorize the degree of stability were also assigned to i n d l a s t following the implementation of the software sensor in the full scale ic reactor more than 40 pulses were tested to evaluate its performance the results of six pulse responses are illustrated in fig 13 based on the analysis of i n d x p f i n d a v g and i n d l a s t calculated in each pulse three if then else rules were defined and incorporated into the software sensor in order to automatically classify the stability conditions i f i n d a v g 60 and i n d x p f 80 and i n d l a s t 80 t h e n stability strong e l s e i f i n d a v g 40 or i n d x p f 50 or i n d l a s t 50 t h e n stability weak e l s e stability moderate one question that arises at this point is why the software sensor relies only on information from the raising part of the biogas pulse response instead of also taking advantage of the falling trajectory when the pulse is stopped the answer to that is because the reliability of the software sensor is very sensitive to changes in the feeding wastewater composition during the interval in which the biogas transient response is being analysed therefore the length of this interval must be as short as possible in order to minimize the above sensitivity equally important the quality of software sensor measurements is also very sensitive to fluctuations of the biogas flow rate just before the feeding pulse is triggered in order to minimize this effect a continuous processing of q g o u t has also been implemented to provide an indication of its variability whenever this indication is above acceptable values pulses are not permitted in general the results of the software sensor agreed with the operating conditions of the ic reactor during the testing period two months the influent flow rate q i n f was quite constant with an average value of 6250 m 3 d 1 similarly on average the values of o l r and q g o u t were close to 25 k g c o d m 3 d 1 and 12500 n m 3 d 1 respectively which could be considered within the range of normal operating conditions therefore it was reasonable to expect that the stability conditions estimated by the software sensor were classified in most of the pulses as strong and moderate with the exception of the weak stability of the reactor in the first pulse as a matter of fact this estimate was consistent with the concentration of v f a e f f during this pulse that was 0 19 k g c o d m 3 and thus it is indicative of a plausible proximity to unstable conditions moreover it is worth mentioning that in the weeks preceding this first pulse the process suffered a loss of granular biomass which could have led to a gradual weakening of the stability conditions in that period all things considered the software sensor proved to be a valuable information tool for enabling plant operators to monitor the operating conditions of the process and accordingly to support decisions such as increasing the influent flow rate to produce more biogas or decreasing it in order to not jeopardize the stability of the reactor the software sensor will continue to undergo testing for a longer period in the full scale ic scenario and as a consequence a broad range of operating conditions will be assessed further research steps should focus on how to integrate this virtual sensor into the design of an automatic controller capable of guaranteeing simultaneously the above two objectives i e maximum biogas production and process stability 4 conclusions while the modelling and simulation of anaerobic digestion have found major application in the academic arena this paper shows their ability to address real world problems as well a model based methodology was developed to design a software sensor that classifies the stability conditions in ad reactors this software sensor has been tested in a full scale ic reactor demonstrating that an effective combination of relatively simple concepts and on line measurements from conventional sensors can produce valuable information for the prompt diagnosis of abnormal situations moreover new automatic controllers can be built that exploit this low cost sensor to optimize the performance of ad processes acknowledgments the authors wish to express their gratitude to the spanish companies veolia water technologies and saica as their active involvement

19445,internal circulation ic anaerobic systems are especially suitable when plant designs that involve both small footprints and high organic loading rates 25 kg cod m 3 d 1 are required however given that operating anaerobic processes at high organic loads increases their vulnerability to external disturbances real time indicators of the stability conditions become particularly pertinent for ic reactors this paper addresses the design and full scale validation of a software sensor that uses only feeding flow rate and biogas flow rate measurements to classify the operating conditions of the reactor as strongly moderately or weakly stable a simulation based procedure was used to design the software sensor and configure its parameters then the performance of the software sensor was tested under real conditions in a full scale ic reactor of 1679 m3 installed in a recycled paper mill rpm graphical abstract image 1 keywords adm1 anaerobic digestion ic technology modelling pulp paper software sensor 1 introduction the waste and wastewater treatment market in the pulp and paper industry is expected to increase by 60 between 2012 and 2020 meyer and edwards 2014 currently the pulp and paper business produces nearly 400 m i l l i o n t o n s of paper every year skogsindustrierna 2010 and it consumes huge amounts of water ranging from 10 to 100 m 3 per ton of paper produced meyer and edwards 2014 greenbaum 2002 fpac 2009 thus it is estimated that the total amount of c o d available globally for recovering energy from mill wastewaters by means of anaerobic digestion ad might range from 4 to 400 m i l l i o n t o n s per year by transforming only 25 of that c o d load into biogas 1 to 100 t w h of electricity could be generated at a regional level as reported by aspapel aspapel 2015 71 spanish paper mills produced 6 2 m i l l i o n t o n s of paper in 2015 which is the sixth largest production in the eu and accounts for 3 of spanish gdp with regard to recycled paper mills rpm in 2015 spain was a leading figure in europe providing 5 2 m i l l i o n t o n s of recycled paper and board additionally 69 of paper used as raw material for recycling was locally sourced thus improving environmental and economic efficiency and contributing to the circular economy even though the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents has been traditionally addressed through aerobic activated sludge technology the last two decades have witnessed an exponential growth in anaerobic technology with two thirds of all anaerobic reactors treating effluents from rpm habets and driessen 2007 nonetheless it is believed that the benefits of ad can be harnessed to the fullest only when combined with aerobic post treatment buyukkamaci and koken 2010 accordingly nowadays a common scenario in the pulp and paper mill industry involves a combination of ad and activated sludge processes from an environmental perspective it is worth noting that 25 k g o f c o 2 emissions per ton of pulp air dried can be avoided thanks to combining anaerobic treatment with aerobic post treatment with a net positive energy amount that can make up 3 5 of the total mill energy consumption with regard to real world applications of ad technologies in the pulp and paper industry the popularity of the internal circulation ic technology an excellent representative of the third generation anaerobic reactors has been increasing relative to the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb technology habets and driessen 2007 since 2000 the ic technology can be thought of as two uasbs working in tandem where the bottom one has a high load and the top one has a low load thanks to their improved design relative to other anaerobic technologies ic reactors can simultaneously separate the gas phase the liquid phase and the biomass which results in enhanced biomass retention better treatment efficiency and superior quality treated wastewater mao et al 2015 thus ic reactors can operate at organic loading rates 20 50 k g c o d m 3 d 1 that are 2 3 times higher than uasb systems which together with their large height to diameter ratio 4 8 leads to plant designs characterized by lower investment cost and considerably smaller footprint wang et al 2015 when compared to aerobic systems anaerobic processes are in general more vulnerable to common disturbances such as organic feeding overloads the presence of inhibitory compounds and temperature drops two options for dealing with the above drawbacks are either to adopt oversized plant designs or to install real time monitoring and control tools capable of detecting and rejecting any critical disturbance within a reasonable time in this regard the latter has been an active area of investigation in the last decade the result being a plethora of published works addressing the design of automatic controllers for ad technology a detailed review of the most relevant literature on this topic is reported by jimenez et al 2015 the crucial role that mathematical modelling plays in control theory explains in part why the control of anaerobic digesters received special attention after the publication of the adm1 model anaerobic digestion model no 1 batstone et al 2002 in the same way as the activated sludge models henze et al 2000 stimulated the design and evaluation of automatic controllers for aerobic processes the adm1 has become de facto the standard modelling framework in simulation studies of control strategies for anaerobic systems from a practical perspective the lack of reliable and cost effective on line instrumentation has been a major barrier to adopting real time control solutions in full scale ad plants for instance though it is widely accepted that total alkalinity t a intermediate alkalinity i a and volatile fatty acids v f a are three key indicators for the early detection of unstable operational conditions on line industrial measurement devices are expensive and only affordable in plants where process failure is completely prohibited a direct consequence is that many control approaches validated either in the lab or in pilot scale plants remain unfeasible in real world applications in this context many different real time algorithms have been proposed that indirectly estimate unmeasured variables in order to provide valuable information about the operating conditions of anaerobic processes typically known as either state observers or software sensors these algorithms can be classified in two broad categories 1 those that make use of simplified models of the process and 2 those that rely on the intentional application of disturbances with regard to the first category some representative published studies in the wastewater sector are reported in cecil and kozlowska 2010 and jimenez et al 2015 a detailed review of software sensors for biological wastewater treatment processes can be found in haimi et al 2013 though only a few of the referenced works focus on anaerobic systems in particular tay and zhang 2000 develop a neural fuzzy model to predict the response of high rate anaerobic reactor the model measures at the nth time instant values of organic hydraulic and alkalinity loading rates olr hrt and alr methane production effluent total organic carbon toc and effluent vfa and predict the values of methane production effluent toc and effluent vfa at the n 1 th instant in marsili libelli and müller 1996 an adaptive fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed to recognise input disturbances in a small pilot scale anaerobic digester in this case the input variables used by the classification algorithm were the biogas flow rate and the concentration of hydrogen in the off gas more recently lara cisneros et al 2016 developed a robust non linear software sensor to estimate the concentration of vfa in continuous anaerobic digesters by using only methane flow rate measurements similarly alcaraz gonzález et al 2017 proposed a non linear model based virtual controller observer vco which combines an observer with an output feedback controller to estimate the influent concentration of c o d and v f a under different operating conditions within the second category the most popular approach consists of superimposing short pulses on the feeding flow rate and analysing their effect on variables of interest in order to diagnose the state of the process such a strategy is the basis of the so called probing controllers which are aimed at optimizing some measurable variable of the process velut et al 2007 specifically steyer et al 1999 applied this control solution in a pilot scale anaerobic reactor to maximize the instantaneous production of biogas in comparison to more sophisticated control approaches the intrinsic simplicity of probing control strategies gives them a certain advantage when applying them to full scale anaerobic plants however configuring the pulse parameters i e amplitude and length is a major issue when installing probing controllers since the values of these parameters are strongly dependent on both the composition of the feeding substrate and the reactor characteristics in this regard while using empirical trial and error tuning methods is an acceptable option for lab and pilot scale plants off line configuration procedures are imperative for full scale plants a classic solution for the latter is to develop tuning techniques that exploit the benefits of mathematical modelling and simulation tools this paper addresses the design of a software sensor that diagnoses the stability conditions in anaerobic reactors the operating principle of this virtual sensor is to excite the reactor by superimposing pulses on the feeding flow rate moreover a general model based simulation methodology is proposed which allows the parameters of the software sensor to be calculated for any specific case this methodology is applied to find the optimum pulse characteristics for a full scale ic reactor operating in a spanish rpm the paper concludes with an analysis and discussion of some real tests carried out in this reactor with the aim of assessing the practical reliability of the software sensor 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the effluent treatment plant the full scale ic reactor that has been used to test the real time software sensor is operating in the effluent treatment plant etp of a rpm in northern spain fig 1 the etp was designed to treat a 650 m 3 h 1 wastewater flow rate in order to optimize the water cycle in the manufacturing process the etp treats process water by means of the following physicochemical and biological units 1 primary clarification and pre acidification tank pre treatment stage 2 anaerobic digestion and 3 activated sludge process and softening post treatment stage the aforementioned units are organized in two parallel treatment lines with the main goal of ad being cod removal and biogas production and where the remaining cod removal is attained thanks to activated sludge units fig 2 part of the treated wastewater from the activated sludge unit is recycled into the manufacturing process whereas a proportion reaches a unique softening tank that is based on lamellar clarification and lime addition and that aims to increase the recirculation flow to the ad reactors a feeding tank prior to the ad reactors allows for wastewater conditioning by means of phosphate and ammonia addition it is known that in mill streams often are deficient in the nutrients that are necessary for anaerobic treatment and so in most cases macronutrients and trace nutrients have to be added at the pre acidification stage the ic reactor chosen to test the software sensor has a total volume of 1679 m 3 and the working volume is close to 1511 m 3 the hydraulic retention time hrt and the organic loading rate olr for the operating period taken as baseline to design and validate the software sensor were on average 5 h and 28 k g c o d m 3 d 1 respectively 2 2 mathematical model of the ic reactor though different approaches have been proposed for formulating mathematical models for granular sludge anaerobic reactors saravanan and sreekrishnan 2006 there is still considerable controversy about the underlying mechanisms behind both the flow pattern and the structure of granules most simulation studies on anaerobic biofilm processes have focused on the uasb technology where the general conclusion is that the operation of uasb systems can be satisfactorily predicted by using simplified formulations in which ideal mixing conditions are assumed and internal phenomena within the biofilm are not taken into account hinken et al 2014 lohani et al 2016 in contrast as far as the authors are aware there is no evidence of specific modelling and simulation studies for ic reactors the only exception is the very recent paper by feldman et al 2017 whose most remarkable innovation is the development of a dynamic model that includes specific formulations to describe the main mechanisms that take place inside the biofilm i e granule growth and distribution and microbial competition for substrate and space within the biofilm the above model is verified using real data from a full scale ic reactor however no specific details are given as to how the model parameters of the biofilm were calibrated and which real measurements were used to find their values when it comes to simulating the operation of full scale reactors the complexity of the mathematical model must be consistent with the quality and quantity of data available for calibration in general the more complex the model is the broader the range of operating situations that can be reproduced however in addition to increasing computational costs model complexity adds extra coefficients whose values are often unknown which means that a larger amount of real data is required for calibration the complexity of the model must also be consistent with the intended primary use if the model is intended for solving design problems a reduced algebraic model will be sufficient in contrast if the purpose is to design feedback controllers dynamic models are imperative however the uncertain attenuation property of feedback means that only the behaviour of the process around its cut off frequency will need to be correctly reproduced aström and hägglund 1995 in this study the ultimate objective of the model is to support the design of the software sensor for application to a full sale ic reactor in addition to this though the software sensor will initially be exclusively devoted to providing real time information to plant operators it is anticipated that in the future this software sensor will be the core component in achieving automatic regulation of the feeding flow rate fig 3 takes all these things into consideration showing a conceptual representation of the ic model that has been adopted to simulate the full scale ic anaerobic reactor aymerich et al 2015 while perfect mixing has been assumed to model the bottom and top compartments two coefficients f x b and f x t 0 f 1 have been included so as to reproduce biomass retention separately f 0 means ideal retention f 1 means no retention moreover the headspace of the full scale ic reactor has been mimicked in the model a single gas headspace collects the biogas produced by both compartments finally the standard adm1 model has been used for the biochemical transformations with some minor adaptations following the recommendations in de gracia et al 2009 some specific works that address the suitability of the adm1 model to predict the performance of high rate anaerobic reactors can be found in dereli et al 2010 spagni et al 2015 and pettigrew et al 2017 a compact formulation of the model equations used in the present study is given below let m b and m t be respectively the state vectors of the bottom and top reactors expressed in mass units similarly let m ghs be the state vector of the biogas headspace for the sake of clarity soluble and particulate states in m b and m t have been grouped in separate sub vectors m b m b s m b p and m t m t s m t p the model equations for soluble states can then be expressed as follows 1 d m b s d t q i n f x inf s m b s v b d m b s d t b i o 2 d m t s d t q i n f q w m b s v b m t s v t d m t s d t b i o where q i n f and q w are the feeding and sludge surplus flow rates m3 d 1 x inf s is a vector that contains the concentration of the soluble compounds in the influent wastewater v b and v t are the volume of the bottom and top compartments v b v t 755 m 3 and d m b s d t b i o and d m t s d t b i o represent the time derivative of soluble state variables due to biochemical physical and chemical reactions regarding particulate states the model equations are the following 3 d m b p d t q i n f x inf p q i n f q w f x b m b p v b q w m b p v b d m b p d t b i o 4 d m t p dt q inf q w f xb m b p v b f xt m t p v t d m t p dt bio where x inf p is a vector that contains the concentration of particulate compounds in the influent wastewater and d m b p d t b i o and d m t p d t b i o represent the time derivative of particulate state variables due to biochemical physical and chemical reactions the dynamics in the gas headspace can be expressed by the following equation 5 d m ghs d t q g o u t m ghs v g h s d m ghs d t b i o with q g o u t being the biogas flow rate m 3 d 1 v g h s the volume of the headspace v g h s 167 9 m 3 and d m ghs d t b i o the time derivative of the gaseous state variables due to mass gas transfer phenomena it must be pointed out that it has been assumed that the biogas output is channelled through an orifice the biogas flow rate q g o u t can be approximated by an equation that is proportional to the difference between the pressure p g h s in the gas headspace and a pre set value of p o 1 1 b a r in a pressure switch located in the orifice 6 q g o u t k g p g h s p o p g h s p o 7 q g o u t 0 p g h s p o the standard petersen matrix notation proposed in the adm1 model has been replicated in this model to express biochemical physical and chemical transformations 8 d m d t b i o e t ρ where e is the so called stoichiometry matrix and ρ is a column vector of kinetics moreover e and ρ have been split into four sub matrices e l s e l p e l g and e g l and two sub vectors ρ l and ρ l g ρ g l according to the criteria below e l s e l p and ρ l are associated with transformations that involve soluble and particulate state variables present only in the liquid phase e l g e g l and ρ l g ρ g l are related to transformations that involve state variables present in both the liquid and gas phases when incorporating this terminology into the general equations presented above the final model formulation results as follows 9 d m b s d t q i n f x inf s m b s v b e l s t ρ l b e l g t ρ l g b 10 d m t

with real data collected from the aforementioned full scale ic reactor an operating period of seven months was selected to calibrate the model while the first four months were devoted to adjusting the values of the model coefficients in order to reproduce the performance of the process the last three months were aimed at verifying the quality of predictions of the calibrated model it is worth noting to remark that rather than using computationally demanding calibration approaches based on monte carlo techniques sin et al 2007 an iterative trial and error procedure was followed for two main reasons 1 the final purpose of the model is to support the design of monitoring and control algorithms therefore if the uncertainty of the model is within reasonable limits it can be can be omitted and 2 the information that was available to calibrate the model limited the number of coefficients whose values could be adjusted to just a few table 1 shows the characterization parameters of the influent and effluent that are regularly measured in the process the average and the standard deviation of the parameters values for the whole calibration period are also included additionally a grab sample from the influent wastewater holding tank was specifically analysed to measure the fractionation of the organic matter with the following results v s s t s s 0 70 c o d f i l t c o d t o t 0 81 0 63 g h a c g v f a t o t 0 35 g h p r g v f a t o t 0 35 g h b u g v f a t o t additionally a biochemical potential test bmp was run with influent wastewater as suggested by sierra alvarez et al 1991 and field et al 1988 equally important in order to reproduce the ic reactor s operation measurements of the feeding flow rate q i n f the temperature t i c the mass of volatile suspended solids m v s s the sludge surplus mass flow rate m w the biogas flow rate q b i o g and the methane percentage in biogas c h 4 were also collected after compiling and processing all the collected information the calibration procedure involved two sequential steps firstly the default values reported in the adm1 model documentation were assigned to all the model coefficients then steady state simulations were run to calibrate the model specifically the average performance of the ic reactor during the first month of the calibration period was used to perform steady state simulations and to adjust the model coefficients secondly the bmp test was simulated to have a first estimate of those model coefficients that affect the decay kinetics finally once the model calibrated under steady state conditions four month dynamic simulations were run to refine the values of the model coefficients the initial condition adopted in these simulations was set to the steady state results obtained in the first step 2 4 model based simulation procedure for designing the software sensor the software sensor designed in this paper to assess the stability conditions in anaerobic reactors relies on the idea of exciting the ad reactor by superimposing short pulses on the feeding flow rate q i n f which provokes a transient response in the biogas flow rate q g o u t the trajectory of the latter provides indirect information for automatically diagnosing whether the process can accept a higher load or it has reached its maximum treatment capacity the design of this software sensor involves calculating the characteristics of the pulse to be applied that is finding appropriate values for both the amplitude a p and the length t p of this pulse to that end a steady state simulation analysis of the sensitivity of q g o u t to both a p and t p was conducted the effect of these two parameters on q g o u t was evaluated by running batch simulations for different combinations of the feeding flow rate the wastewater characteristics and the reactor temperature in order to reproduce a sufficiently broad range of operating conditions i e from strongly to weakly stable situations selecting the optimum pulse a p t p o p t took into consideration the following two criteria the value of tp must be as short as possible in order to minimize the effect of changes in the wastewater characteristics during the pulse but long enough as to provoke an observable response on q g o u t the value of a p must be sufficiently large as to provoke an observable effect on q g o u t but as small as possible so as to not affect the normal operation of the reactor regarding the amplitude of the pulse a p this parameter was expressed in relative rather than absolute m 3 d 1 units the rationale behind that decision was to facilitate the comparison between the simulated pulse responses of q g o u t regardless of the value of q i n f and as a result to identify patterns directly connected with the stability of the ic reactor the algorithm for real time diagnosis of the stability conditions was designed by combining the conclusions drawn from the simulated pulse responses of q g o u t and the analysis of real pulses in the full scale ic reactor 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the ic model table 2 shows the real data and the steady state predictions corresponding to the average operation of the ic reactor during the first month of the calibration period in that period the average measurements of q i n f o l r and t i c were 8184 m 3 d 1 28 8 k g c o d m 3 d 1 and 32 7 c respectively in a first iteration these predictions were achieved with minor adjustments of the adm1 default values the good prediction of q g o u t e r r o r 3 0 and c h 4 e r r o r 1 5 apparently revealed a satisfactory characterization of the biodegradable organic compounds in the influent wastewater the t s s total suspended solids concentration at the effluent of the ic reactor was correctly reproduced by adjusting the values of f x b and f x t moreover the values of these two coefficients had to be consistent with the fact that it is in the bottom compartment that almost all biodegradable c o d is removed while the top one works as a polishing stage habets et al 1997 eventually both issues were achieved by setting the values of these two coefficients to f x b 0 0033 and f x t 0 0294 more than 90 of the biodegradable c o d was removed in the bottom compartment with these values nonetheless the first iteration resulted in a poor prediction of c o d t o t e f f e r r o r 33 a plausible explanation could be that the content of inert matter in the influent was underestimated given that lab analysis methods of c o d determination contain some degree of uncertainty amanatidou et al 2012 the quality of the predictions was refined by adjusting the original influent wastewater characteristics in doing so it was necessary to repeat the steady state calibration and increase the total c o d at the influent by about 5 table 3 apart from providing valuable information to quantify the biodegradability of the wastewater the bmp test was also simulated to adjust some of the kinetic coefficients several authors have employed this test in combination with the adm1 yielding interesting results regarding the kinetics of the process girault et al 2013 biernacki et al 2013 in particular the first order kinetic parameters for the reactions of disintegration k d i s x c 2 and hydrolysis k h y d were modified in order to fit the constant rate that the methane production follows in the second half of the experiment fig 4 the fitting values for these two coefficients are given in table 3 as long as soluble b o d is available the production of methane is governed by acidogenic and methanogenic reactions in this particular case the first four days of the experiment fig 4 shows how the adm1 default values are not appropriate for predicting the real results for the first part of the bmp test a good fit of the entire bmp test involved substantial reductions in the values of the model coefficients associated with the above reactions i e k m s u k m a a k m f a k m c 4 k m p r k m x a c and k m h 2 for instance the maximum specific uptake rate of acetate k m a c had to be decreased from 8 default value to 0 24 however when this low value was used to reproduce the steady state performance model predictions were completely wrong such low values for these coefficients could be attributed to the fact that the inoculum had been inactive several days prior to the bmp test this might have caused microorganisms to work more slowly than predicted by the model at the beginning of the test therefore though a satisfactory fit could be achieved by adjusting the above kinetic coefficients results not shown these values were not adopted in the end the default adm1 values were kept the main outcome of the four month simulation period for the ic s long term operation which was used to refine the model fitting values obtained at the completion of the steady state study is summarized in fig 5 through boxplot representations the measurements for q i n f exhibited the smallest dispersion with 75 of the days being in the range between 7500 and 8500 m 3 d 1 while the average t i c was 31 6 c the measurements of this variable ranged between 29 c and 33 3 c for 75 of the whole period with minimum and maximum values being 24 2 c and 35 2 c respectively finally o l r had values between 24 7 and 32 2 k g c o d m 3 d 1 for more than 90 of the days fig 6 shows the simulation results for the long term operation of the full scale ic reactor at the end of the calibration process satisfactory predictions were achieved with minor adjustments to the model which had been previously calibrated for steady state conditions in this regard two main actions were carried out first after assuming a maximum uncertainty of 10 for the total c o d in the influent the characteristics of the wastewater were adapted with the objective of improving the prediction of q g o u t during the whole period secondly the values of f x b and f x t were slightly adjusted to get a better fit of the v s s measurements at the effluent finally f x t was fixed to 0 0279 and f x b to 0 0031 nonetheless it can be seen that though v s s e f f simulation results were good on average the model was not able to mimic the short term fluctuations that were detected in real observations this can be explained by the fact that v s s e f f depends to a great extent on the intricate hydrodynamics of the ic technology whose formulation in the ic model has been simplified by assuming perfect mixing see section 2 2 the simulation results for c o d t o t e f f also revealed a correct performance of the ic model in this case deviations between real observations and predictions were mainly attributed to an incorrect characterization of the real concentration of soluble inert products in the wastewater the sensitivity of the model coefficients to the quality of predictions was also analysed in particular the coefficient k m x a c its default value was 8 exhibited the highest sensitivity nonetheless for k m x a c 5 0 simulation results did not reveal appreciable differences a final step was needed to prove the predictive capabilities of the model formulated for the ic reactor this last stage aimed to test the prediction quality for an operating period other than the four month period chosen for model calibration to that end the three months following the four month calibration period were chosen fig 5 provides a visual insight into the main characteristics of this period the average values of q i n f o l r and t i c in that period were respectively 7821 m 3 d 1 29 0 k g c o d m 3 d 1 and 28 9 c and their respective ranges of variation were 6891 8442 21 9 34 8 and 24 2 36 3 fig 6 shows the simulation results for the validation period and compares them with the real performance of the ic reactor it can be seen that the quality of the model predictions in this validation period was quite similar to the quality obtained in the calibration period the linear regression between the real observations of q g o u t and their corresponding predictions illustrated in fig 7 resulted in a consistently high value of the r2 measure in both the calibration and validation periods in conclusion all the above results give evidence of the proposed model s suitability in reproducing the real operation of the ic reactor therefore it could be objectively stated at this point that the ic model was ready to be used to design the real time algorithm for diagnosing the stability conditions in the ic reactor 3 2 designing the optimum pulse characteristics the whole 7 month calibration of the ic model was analysed to define the operational scenarios for designing and testing the software sensor based on their full variability over the seven months the operating variables q i n f t i c c o d t o t i n f and v s i c were discretized into the following representative values q i n f m 3 d 1 6000 6500 7000 7500 8000 8500 9000 t i c c 24 27 30 33 36 c o d t o t i n f k g c o d m 3 4 42 4 78 5 20 5 61 6 01 6 43 v s i c t o n 72 85 98 the combination of all the values specified led to a total of 630 operating scenarios which covered all potential situations in the full scale ic reactor in order to find the optimum parameters of the pulse a p t p the effect of step increments δ q i n f in q i n f on both q g o u t and v f a e f f was simulated for each of the above scenarios moreover the above simulations were repeated for three values of the step amplitude a p δ q i n f a p q i n f namely 6 8 and 10 first the transient response of q g o u t in simulations corresponding to strongly stable operating conditions of the ic reactor were analysed five of these simulations are gathered in fig 8 where the time response of q g o u t and v f a e f f is illustrated the main characteristics of these simulations are provided in table 4 the low concentration of v f a e f f clearly evidences that the ic reactor is under operating conditions which are far away from its maximum treatment capacity the step δ q i n f took place in all the simulations at the same instant t 0 in fig 8 and the responses of q g o u t and v f a e f f were expressed as relative increases with respect to the steady state value prior to the application of δ q i n f moreover the relative increase of q g o u t was also divided by the respective value of a p so as to facilitate the analysis of the effect of this parameter on the time response of q g o u t it can be seen that regardless of the amplitude of the step a p the time response of q g o u t took about 40 50 m i n before reaching a new steady state regime thereafter the increase of q g o u t δ q g o u t was above 0 90 a p which indicates that the ic reactor could be operated at a much higher organic load this assertion is corroborated by the fact that δ q i n f caused a marginal effect on v f a e f f actually previous to the step δ q i n f the steady state values of v f a e f f were very low 0 020 k g c o d m 3 considering that the relative increment in δ v f a e f f due to δ q i n f was less than 15 then the new steady state regime for v f a e f f also resulted in very low concentration 0 023 k g c o d m 3 the results of the step response in strongly stable conditions showed that an appropriate design value for the pulse parameter t p should be within the range 40 50 m i n however the low hydraulic retention time of the storage tank that feeds the ic reactor 1 h makes the value t p 40 m i n desirable since it minimizes potential q g o u t fluctuations due to variations in the wastewater characteristics the three values of a p that were analysed did not give evidence of significant differences between their respective step responses therefore it was concluded that any value for this parameter between 6 and 10 represents a valid design solution values lower than 6 were rejected for their higher sensitivity to measuring errors on the other extreme amplitudes above 10 implied large disturbances in the ic reactor and thus were excluded from being potential design solutions in this respect the value a p 8 represents the best design option since it achieves a good trade off between sensitivity to measuring errors and the magnitude of disturbance the same analysis conducted for the scenario of strongly stable conditions was replicated for those simulations that evidenced to some extent unsafe i e near to instability conditions in the ic reactor five of these simulations are plotted together in fig 9 the main characteristics of each simulation are summarized in table 5 the first thing to note is that as expected the steady state regime of these simulations led to much higher accumulation of v f a e f f when compared to the strongly stable scenario specifically the v f a e f f steady state values ranged from 0 093 to 0 243 k g c o d m 3 which was indicative of different degrees of proximity to unstable conditions this becomes clearer when looking at the transient responses exhibited by q g o u t in fig 9 a common pattern in all these responses is that the time needed to reach the new steady state 150 m i n was considerably longer than under strongly stable operation 50 m i n actually 40 m i n after the step δ q i n f the relative increment of q g o u t was between 0 40 a p and 0 70 a p while being above 0 90 a p for strongly stable conditions to a certain extent this value can be thought of as an indirect measurement of how close the ic reactor is to its maximum treatment capacity thus it can be stated that values of δ q g o u t at instant t 40 m i n that are below 0 40 a p indicate weakly stable conditions and therefore there is a high risk of unstable operation in this respect the five operating scenarios chosen in this analysis exemplify two different situations in terms of their proximity to unstable conditions the first situation the three plots marked with ❶ in fig 9 represents operating points whose degree of stability is categorized as moderate in the sense that though the process is near the maximum treatment capacity large disturbances are necessary to provoke instability it can be seen that for these three operating scenarios and when a p 8 the value of δ q g o u t at t 40 m i n was between 0 55 a p and 0 70 a p in contrast in the second situation the two plots marked with ❷ stability conditions must be labelled as weak because even small disturbances would cause a complete failure of the reactor this fact becomes apparent through the response of δ v f a e f f in the two situations which showed an exponential increase that would eventually acidify the ic reactor moreover the larger the disturbance the shorter the time to provoke acidification it is for this reason that again t p 40 m i n and a p 8 are considered more suitable for pulse design under weak stability 3 3 design and full scale testing of the real time algorithm if the real response of δ q g o u t to feeding pulses had followed the smooth and clean pattern it exhibited in simulations indeed the design of the software sensor would have been straightforward unfortunately it turned out that the first pulses tested in the full scale reactor revealed a noisy and oscillating response that complicated the extraction of reliable information fig 10 left making it necessary to perform a data filtering algorithm on the original signal to that end a data fitting technique was implemented in which the following exponential delay model was adopted fig 10 right δ q g o u t t δ q g o t t d δ q g f δ q g o δ q g f e t t d t c t t d an interesting observation that occurred in most of the fitting solutions found for the tested pulse responses was that the time delay t d took values between 7 and 13 m i n for this reason the design value of the pulse length was increased from t p 40 m i n to t p 50 m i n fig 11 shows how the value that the exponential fitting curve takes at the end of the pulse point f is an adequate indicator of the stability conditions this indicator was called i n d x p f values of i n d x p f above 75 80 were associated with strongly stable conditions whereas values between 45 50 and 75 80 were attributed to moderate stability on the other hand values of i n d x p f below 45 50 were indicative of weakly stable situations in the ic reactor though initially the values of i n d x p f seemed to be sufficient for classifying the stability conditions it was observed that the presence of high noise levels in δ q g o u t had a negative effect on the reliability of i n d x p f which led in some cases to poor identification of the stability conditions in order to prevent this it was necessary to define two complementary indicators i n d a v g and i n d l a s t i n d a v g was computed as the mean value of the real measurements of δ q g o u t collected during the pulse the following three regions i n d x p f 60 65 35 40 i n d a v g 60 65 and i n d a v g 35 40 were respectively assigned to strongly moderately and weakly stable conditions similarly i n d l a s t was calculated as the average of the last n real sampled values of δ q g o u t during the pulse after analysing multiple pulse responses and by considering that δ q g o u t measurements were sampled at regular intervals of 0 5 m i n the parameter n was set to 20 fig 12 gives a visual insight on how these two indicators are calculated since i n d x p f and i n d l a s t are just two different forms of quantifying the value of δ q g o u t at the end of the pulse the same regions defined for i n d x p f to categorize the degree of stability were also assigned to i n d l a s t following the implementation of the software sensor in the full scale ic reactor more than 40 pulses were tested to evaluate its performance the results of six pulse responses are illustrated in fig 13 based on the analysis of i n d x p f i n d a v g and i n d l a s t calculated in each pulse three if then else rules were defined and incorporated into the software sensor in order to automatically classify the stability conditions i f i n d a v g 60 and i n d x p f 80 and i n d l a s t 80 t h e n stability strong e l s e i f i n d a v g 40 or i n d x p f 50 or i n d l a s t 50 t h e n stability weak e l s e stability moderate one question that arises at this point is why the software sensor relies only on information from the raising part of the biogas pulse response instead of also taking advantage of the falling trajectory when the pulse is stopped the answer to that is because the reliability of the software sensor is very sensitive to changes in the feeding wastewater composition during the interval in which the biogas transient response is being analysed therefore the length of this interval must be as short as possible in order to minimize the above sensitivity equally important the quality of software sensor measurements is also very sensitive to fluctuations of the biogas flow rate just before the feeding pulse is triggered in order to minimize this effect a continuous processing of q g o u t has also been implemented to provide an indication of its variability whenever this indication is above acceptable values pulses are not permitted in general the results of the software sensor agreed with the operating conditions of the ic reactor during the testing period two months the influent flow rate q i n f was quite constant with an average value of 6250 m 3 d 1 similarly on average the values of o l r and q g o u t were close to 25 k g c o d m 3 d 1 and 12500 n m 3 d 1 respectively which could be considered within the range of normal operating conditions therefore it was reasonable to expect that the stability conditions estimated by the software sensor were classified in most of the pulses as strong and moderate with the exception of the weak stability of the reactor in the first pulse as a matter of fact this estimate was consistent with the concentration of v f a e f f during this pulse that was 0 19 k g c o d m 3 and thus it is indicative of a plausible proximity to unstable conditions moreover it is worth mentioning that in the weeks preceding this first pulse the process suffered a loss of granular biomass which could have led to a gradual weakening of the stability conditions in that period all things considered the software sensor proved to be a valuable information tool for enabling plant operators to monitor the operating conditions of the process and accordingly to support decisions such as increasing the influent flow rate to produce more biogas or decreasing it in order to not jeopardize the stability of the reactor the software sensor will continue to undergo testing for a longer period in the full scale ic scenario and as a consequence a broad range of operating conditions will be assessed further research steps should focus on how to integrate this virtual sensor into the design of an automatic controller capable of guaranteeing simultaneously the above two objectives i e maximum biogas production and process stability 4 conclusions while the modelling and simulation of anaerobic digestion have found major application in the academic arena this paper shows their ability to address real world problems as well a model based methodology was developed to design a software sensor that classifies the stability conditions in ad reactors this software sensor has been tested in a full scale ic reactor demonstrating that an effective combination of relatively simple concepts and on line measurements from conventional sensors can produce valuable information for the prompt diagnosis of abnormal situations moreover new automatic controllers can be built that exploit this low cost

19446,oxidation experiments chlorine ozone and bromine were carried out with synthetic saline waters containing natural organic matter nom extracts and model compounds to evaluate the potential of these surrogates to mimic the formation of brominated trihalomethanes br thms in natural saline waters synthetic saline water with pony lake fulvic acid plfa showed comparable results to natural brackish and sea water for br thms formation during chlorination and ozonation for typical ballast water treatment conditions cl2 0 5 mg l or o3 0 3 mg l the molar chbr3 yield in synthetic saline waters is higher for chlorination than for ozonation since ozone reacts slower with bromide and faster with thm precursors for bromination the molar yields of chbr3 for the nom model compounds phenol resorcinol 3 oxopentanedioic acid and hydroquinone are 28 62 91 and 11 respectively chbr3 formation is low during chlorination or ozonation of resorcinol containing synthetic saline waters due to the faster reaction of resorcinol with these oxidants compared to the bromine formation from bromide oxidation experiments with mixtures of hydroquinone and phenol or resorcinol were conducted to mimic various functional groups of nom reacting with cl2 or o3 in saline water with increasing hydroquinone concentrations the chbr3 formation increases during both chlorination and ozonation of the mixtures except for chlorination of the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol the formation of thms during chlorination of the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol is similar to that of resorcinol alone due to the much faster reaction of hox with resorcinol compared to hydroquinone in general plfa seems to be a reasonable dom surrogate to simulate chbr3 formation for realistic ballast water

formation is the bromide concentration heeb et al 2014 richardson et al 1999 during disinfection of bromide containing water bromide is oxidized by e g chlorine hocl ocl or ozone o3 to hypobromous acid hobr by reactions 1 kumar and margerum 1987 or 2 haag and hoigne 1983 liu et al 2001 hobr can then react with thm precursors to form brominated thms 1 h o c l b r h o b r c l k 1 1 55 10 3 m 1 s

which have elevated bromide levels 0 5 67 mg l holland 1978 valero and arbós 2010 therefore in these systems the primary oxidants chlorine or ozone have only a limited lifetime and are quickly transformed to bromine and have a small direct effect on dbps formation consequently mostly brominated thms have been observed in oxidative treatment of saline waters including seawater swimming pools parinet et al 2012 seawater desalination systems kim et al 2015 and salt impacted freshwater heller grossman et al 1999 oxidative treatment of ballast water before discharge has become a common practice due to the growing concerns about the spread of invasive marine species worldwide werschkun et al 2014 to this end the formation of dbps for disinfection oxidation of brackish and sea waters has been investigated werschkun et al 2012 the effects of salinity temperature type and concentration of dissolved organic matter dom and type and dose of oxidants on dbps formation have been investigated for the disinfection of six natural brackish and sea waters in a detailed study shah et al 2015 it could be shown that as expected the primary oxidants chlorine or ozone were converted quickly to bromine in these systems due to the high bromide concentrations during chlorination the subsequent faster reaction of hobr with dom compared to hocl leads to a preferential formation of bromoform chbr3 shah et al 2015 similarly during ozonation mainly chbr3 is formed however in this case also bromate was observed shah et al 2015 1 2 formation of brominated thms during bromination of model compounds it has been shown previously that resorcinol and phenol moieties in nom are likely to play important roles in thm formation during chlorination bond and graham 2017 gallard and von gunten 2002b some aliphatic β diketones or β ketoacid structures within nom may also be important for thm formation bond and graham 2017 dickenson et al 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002a in contrast it has been reported that at least 75 of hobr is reduced initially to bromide in an electron transfer process during reaction with nom criquet et al 2015 westerhoff et al 1998 o and p hydroxyphenol moieties such as hydroquinone and catechol within nom may be important for these redox processes criquet et al 2015 nevertheless for chlorination of bromide containing waters with excess chlorine most of the bromine will eventually yield bromo organic compounds such as adsorbable organic bromine aobr langsa et al 2017 in the present study three nom isolates two nordic nom extracts nordic aquatic humic acid naha and a nordic reservoir nom nr nom and pony lake fulvic acid plfa representing allochthonous terrestrial and autochthonous microbially derived humic substances respectively were chosen to investigate thm formation during oxidative treatment of synthetic brackish and sea water in addition based on previous results with model compounds as thm precursors resorcinol phenol hydroquinone and 3 oxopentanedioic acid were selected as model precursors to mimic thm formation in saline waters during ozonation bromination or chlorination chlorine and ozone were used as oxidants due to their full scale application in ballast water management systems werschkun et al 2014 experiments with hobr were performed as reference systems without other oxidants because it is readily formed as a secondary oxidant during oxidative ballast water treatment of saline waters shah et al 2015 the objectives of this study were i to investigate the influence of various parameters dom type concentration reaction time and bromide concentration on thm formation during oxidative treatment of synthetic saline water in presence of nom extracts ii compare them to natural saline waters iii to assess the potential of several model precursor compounds such as phenol resorcinol hydroquinone and 3 oxopentanedioic acid to form thms in saline waters and iv to investigate the effect of

were 2 3 or 3 0 mg l for the brackish waters from norway nor and germany de respectively table 1 shah et al 2015 to mimic this water quality the doc concentrations of synthetic brackish waters were selected as 2 and 3 mg l to enable a comparison of thm formation between synthetic and natural saline waters due to the predominance of bromination reactions in saline waters see above the current study will mainly focus on chbr3 formation fig 1 brackish waters and s1 si sea waters show the specific chbr3 formation μg chbr3 mg c for the treatment of various natural and synthetic saline waters as a function of a the chlorine or b the ozone dose for chlorine doses 5 mg l chbr3 formation for synthetic saline brackish or sea water with either naha or plfa is lower than for natural saline brackish or sea water inserts in figs 1a and s1a si this is caused by the higher hobr consumption in the synthetic waters compared to the natural waters figs s2a and s2b si see below for further explanations for chlorine doses 5 mg l chbr3 formation in the synthetic and natural saline waters levels off except for naha for which significantly higher concentrations were observed for naha the specific chbr3 formation μg chbr3 mg c is lower for the higher naha concentration this is caused by the higher number of precursor sites which get partially brominated but do not lead to full bromination with chbr3 formation this phenomenon has been described previously in the formation of cl br i thms during chlorination chloramination allard et al 2015 a similar trend could be observed for chbr2cl and chbrcl2 formations figs s3a s3b s3c and s3d si chbr3 formation in the saline brackish or sea water containing plfa is similar to the natural saline brackish or sea waters figs 1a and s1a si similar to chlorination for low ozone doses 3 mg l the specific chbr3 formation μg chbr3 mg c for natural saline brackish or sea water is higher than for synthetic saline brackish or sea water with either naha or plfa inserts in figs 1b and s1b si the specific chbr3 formation during ozonation of synthetic saline brackish or sea waters with naha doc 2 mg l is significantly higher than for natural saline brackish or sea waters for o3 doses 3 mg l however chbr3 formation for synthetic saline brackish or sea waters with plfa and naha doc 3 mg l is similar to natural saline brackish or sea water figs 1b and s1b si despite the fact that no chlorine formation is expected during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 low concentrations of chbr2cl are formed figs s3e and s3f si this may be due to mixed radical halide species e g brcl formation during ozonation of seawater grebel et al 2010 it is suggested that such radical halide species could react with dom precursors and results in chbr2cl formation during ozonation of natural saline waters shah et al 2015 the lower yields of chbr3 for synthetic saline brackish or sea water for low oxidant doses cl2 0 or o3 0 2 mg l reported above are caused by the lower residual hobr concentrations in synthetic saline waters compared to natural saline waters figs s2a s2b s2c and s2d si these phenomena may be caused by the different properties of dom in synthetic and natural saline waters since naha and plfa are only fractions of dom naha is a fraction of nr nom and has a higher electron donating capacity edc compared to nr nom for equal doc concentration aeschbacher et al 2012 therefore naha is expected to have a higher efficiency for ozone chlorine and hobr reduction compared to nr nom which leads to a lower residual hobr concentration and in turn to a lower chbr3 formation to test this hypothesis further ozonation experiments were conducted with nr nom doc 2 or 3 mg l and compared to naha in synthetic brackish water fig s4 si for an ozone dose of 1 mg l the specific chbr3 formation from nr nom is higher than for naha but still lower compared to natural waters however when the ozone dose was increased to 2 mg l in the nr nom experiment even in absence of residual hobr the chbr3 formation doc 2 mg l is slightly higher than in the natural water similarly a high edc value would be expected for plfa compared to the whole nom which leads to a lower chbr3 formation for saline waters containing plfa compared to natural saline waters at low oxidant doses cl2 0 or o3 0 2 mg l at higher oxidant doses cl2 0 5 mg l or o3 0 3 mg l synthetic saline brackish or sea waters with equal dom concentrations lead to higher chbr3 yields for naha than for plfa figs 1a 1b s1a and s1b si this is most likely due to the higher aromaticity of naha table s3 si based on the comparative specific chbr3 formation of synthetic and natural saline brackish or sea waters plfa seems to be a reasonable dom surrogate to simulate chbr3 formation in natural saline brackish or sea waters for oxidative treatment with chlorine or ozone for doses 2 mg l plfa is a microbially derived and autochthonous aquatic humic substance from a saline 5 ppt coastal pond in antarctica brown et al 2004 and has a lower aromatic content table s3 si compared to naha and a c n ratio of about 8 chin et al 1997 mcknight et al 1994 marine dom as in the natural saline waters such as sea water is derived from microalgae and bacteria and its c n is usually in the range from 8 to 20 ogawa and tanoue 2003 therefore it can be expected that the concentration of chbr3 precursor moieties in plfa may be similar to marine brackish dom within certain limits 3 2 effect of doc concentration on the formation of thms fig 2 shows the chbr3 formation during chlorination or ozonation of synthetic brackish waters containing plfa or naha in various concentrations doc concentrations 2 5 mg l figs 2a and b show that during chlorination and for low oxidant doses cl2 0 2 mg l or 7 4 mg l for plfa or naha respectively the chbr3 formation is higher for the lower doc concentration than for the higher doc concentrations this observation is mainly caused by a bromine distribution over more thm precursor sites for higher doc concentration which results in a less efficient chbr3 formation for low chlorine doses under these conditions no hobr residual was observed figs s5d and s5e si because hocl reacts relatively slowly with dom moieties the hobr formation should be similar for all dom concentrations and therefore only have a minor effect on thm formation the chlorine dose was further increased to investigate the effect of excessive chlorination under these conditions as expected a higher doc concentration leads to higher chbr3 concentrations cl2 0 9 mg l or 15 mg l for plfa or naha respectively a residual hobr concentration can be detected for these conditions figs s5d and s5e si the specific chbr3 formation inserts in figs 2a and b are highest for the lowest doc concentrations for both plfa and naha the highest specific chbr3 formations for high chlorine doses are very similar for all the doc concentrations this means that under these conditions the maximum chbr3 formation potential is reached because ultimately the hobr will be in large excess and all the precursor sites will be brominated langsa et al 2017 for ozone the chbr3 formation decreases with increasing doc concentration for plfa for o3 doses 3 mg l fig 2c for higher o3 doses the chbr3 formation becomes higher at the higher doc levels again these trends are linked to the availability of residual hobr figs 2c and s6c si for naha the chbr3 formation is highest for the lowest doc concentration for all o3 doses fig 2d this is due to i a slower transformation of bromide to hobr during ozonation reaction 2 haag and hoigne 1983 liu et al 2001 compared to chlorine reaction 1 kumar and margerum 1987 leading to a higher fraction of ozone reacting with dom extracts and a lower hobr formation for the higher doc concentrations ii more reactive sites which get only partially brominated for the higher doc concentrations lead to lower chbr3 formation low concentrations of chbr2cl are also observed during ozonation of either plfa or naha figs s6a and s6b si for explanations see above the highest specific yields of chbr3 in plfa containing waters are about 25 higher for chlorination than for ozonation for the same molar oxidant dose inserts in figs 2a and c this is caused by the lower efficiency of the bromide conversion to hobr during ozonation reaction 2 haag and hoigne 1983 liu et al 2001 compared to chlorine reaction 1 kumar and margerum 1987 furthermore most thm precursors e g resorcinol phenol dickenson et al 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002b react much more readily with ozone than with chlorine criquet et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 as a consequence more thm precursors are likely to be consumed during ozonation and hence not available anymore for chbr3 formation therefore both the specific yields and the absolute concentrations of chbr3 are higher during chlorination than during ozonation 3 3 kinetics of thms formation the chbr3 formation increases up to 120 h during oxidative treatment of synthetic brackish waters containing nom isolates for treatment of plfa containing synthetic water doc 3 mg l with chlorine or ozone the chbr3 concentrations are lower than for the same experiment with naha fig 3 for chlorination chbr3 formation is 391 or 629 μg l at 24 h or 120 h for plfa and 956 or 1066 μg l at 24 h or 120 h for naha respectively for ozonation chbr3 formation is 319 or 501 μg l at 24 h or 120 h for plfa and 403 or 469 μg l at 24 h or 120 h for naha respectively the more pronounced difference between 24 h and 120 h for plfa compared with naha is caused by residual hobr for plfa while there is no residual hobr for naha for both chlorination and ozonation after 24 h figs s7c and s7e si low levels of chbr2cl and or chbrcl2 were also formed during chlorination or ozonation of the same waters figs s7a s7b and s7d si generally two phase kinetics were observed for chbr3 formation which is in agreement to previous findings for chlorination of natural fresh brackish and sea waters gallard and von gunten 2002a shah et al 2015 it is hypothesized that resorcinol type aromatic structures aliphatic β diketones and or β ketoacids structures within the dom play important roles in the initial phase in the second phase with slower chbr3 formation dom moieties with lower reactivities may govern the thm formation criquet et al 2015 gallard and von gunten 2002a for the same oxidant doses and the same reaction times the initial chbr3 formations for both plfa and naha during ozonation are significantly lower than for chlorination for chlorine the efficiency of the bromide conversion to hobr is higher compared for ozone t 1 2 1 1 or 9 s at br 0 33 5 mg l 419 μm and oxidant 0 104 μm for chlorination or ozonation respectively during this phase ozone is available to oxidize resorcinol phenol type moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which results in a lower chbr3 formation during the initial phase of an ozonation the chlorine reactions with resorcinol type moieties of dom are much slower than the corresponding ozone reactions deborde and von gunten 2008 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the ozone effect on chbr3 formation for naha is significantly more pronounced than for plfa fig 3 this may be due to the higher aromaticity of naha compared to plfa table s3 si which results in a higher ozone reactivity and consequently a more significant consumption of thm precursors the chbr3 formation from plfa in synthetic brackish water doc 3 0 mg l is within certain limits comparable to natural brackish water ne doc 3 6 mg l shah et al 2015 during either chlorination or ozonation compare figs 3 and 1 a similar trend was observed for chbr2cl and chbrcl2 formations from plfa figs s7a s7b and s7d si the residual hobr concentrations in synthetic brackish waters for plfa are also similar to natural brackish waters figs s7c and s7e si chbr3 formation for ozonation of synthetic brackish water in presence of naha doc 3 mg l is also quite comparable to natural brackish water however during chlorination it is significantly higher compared to natural brackish water figs 1 and 3 3 4 effect of bromide concentration on the formation of thms when increasing the bromide concentration from 12 5 to 125 μm 1 10 mg l chbr3 formation increases significantly fig 4 in contrast chbr2cl or chbrcl2 formation decrease remarkably with increasing bromide concentrations during chlorination of brackish waters containing plfa or naha figs s8a and s8b si however the chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 concentrations vary only slightly for bromide concentrations 125 μm 10 mg l overall a shift to more brominated thms can be observed for increasing bromide concentrations the effect of the bromide concentrations on the chbr3 formation during ozonation of saline water is more pronounced than during chlorination fig 4 as mentioned above the formation of hobr during ozonation is slower than for hocl haag and hoigne 1983 kumar and margerum 1987 liu et al 2001 the half life time of ozone depends directly on the bromide concentration t 1 2 o3 37 and 9 s for br 0 125 and 419 μm 10 and 33 5 mg l at o3 0 5 mg l respectively therefore for lower bromide concentrations the ozone reaction with dom is more pronounced leading to a partial abatement of thm precursors furthermore due to the consumption of ozone less bromide can be oxidized to hobr which in turn leads to a lower thm formation figs s8c and s8e si the chbr3 formation during chlorination and ozonation of brackish water containing plfa are similar for high bromide concentrations this is due to the lower ozone reactivity of plfa and more efficient ozone quenching for higher bromide concentrations the chbr3 formation in brackish water containing naha is much higher for chlorination than for ozonation as mentioned above this may be caused by the higher aromaticity of naha compared with plfa table s3 si which results in a higher consumptions of both ozone and thm precursors during ozonation of brackish water containing naha 3 5 thm formation from model phenolic precursors during bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic saline waters it has been demonstrated that phenol and resorcinol play important roles in chx3 formation during chlorination or bromination bond and graham 2017 boyce and hornig 1983 dickenson et al 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002a gallard and von gunten 2002b br incorporation is very low during the bromination of o and p hydroxyphenols because hobr reacts mainly by electron transfer et and is thereby mainly reduced to bromide by these compounds criquet et al 2015 based on these observations phenol resorcinol and hydroquinone were selected as model compounds to mimic various dom precursors electrophilic aromatic substitution and electron transfer for chbr3 formation during bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic saline waters figs 5 s10 and s11 si 3 5 1 phenol fig 5 a shows the chbr3 formation as a function of the oxidant phenol ratio for bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic brackish waters chbr3 increases with increasing phenol concentrations in the range of 3 12 μm for a hobr dose of 104 μm at a molar oxidant phenol ratio of 8 2 the maximum chbr3 formation is achieved at a phenol concentration of 12 7 μm table s4 si for smaller oxidant phenol ratios the oxidant concentrations are not sufficient to fully brominate phenol all the way to chbr3 resulting in a pronounced decrease of chbr3 formation fig 5a for hobr phenol ratios 8 2 the hobr concentration is high enough to brominate all the precursor sites however in this case the chbr3 formation depends directly on the phenol concentration resulting in a proportional decrease of the chbr3 formation with decreasing phenol concentrations fig 5a low concentrations of chbr2cl are also found during bromination of phenol fig s11a si this may be due to the presence of mixed haline species such as brcl which could be formed by the reaction of hobr with cl cl concentration is 0 27 m in synthetic brackish water table 1 in saline waters reaction 3 liu and margerum 2001 the brcl concentration is approximately 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than the hobr concentration during chlorination of seawater heeb et al 2014 and brcl has a high reactivity towards organic compounds sivey et al 2013 3 b r c l h 2 o h o b r c l h k 1 3 0 1 10 4 m 2 s 1 the trend of the variation of chbr3 and chbr2cl formation for phenol during chlorination is similar to that of bromination figs 5a and s11a si because the chlorine reactivity with phenol is low gallard and von gunten 2002b ozone reacts much faster with phenol than with bromide table s5 si which leads to a partial destruction of phenol ramseier and gunten 2009 and hence less chbr3 formation with a maximum of only 178 μg l compared to 898 μg l and 908 μg l for bromination and chlorination respectively nevertheless the general trend of chbr3 formation is similar to bromination and chlorination fig 5a 3 5 2 resorcinol fig 5b shows that for bromination chbr3 formation increases with increasing resorcinol concentrations from 3 to 12 μm however the chbr3 formation decreases gradually for higher resorcinol concentrations because as for phenol an excess of precursor does not lead to chbr3 due to the distribution of bromine over many sites the chbr3 formation from resorcinol is very limited during chlorination resorcinol has a high reactivity with hocl criquet et al 2015 and the hobr formation is in competition to the resorcinol reaction for low resorcinol concentrations the rate of hobr formation is about a factor 6 higher than the chlorine resorcinol reaction whereas for the highest resorcinol concentration chlorine reacts about a factor of 2 faster with resorcinol than with bromide based on these kinetic boundary conditions fig s12 si there will always be a mix of chbr3 chbr2cl chbrcl2 and chcl3 in these experiments with bromoform decreasing from 3 μm resorcinol to higher resorcinol concentrations figs 5b s11b and s11c si the ozone reaction with resorcinol is much faster than hobr formation table s5 si which leads to only minor concentrations of chbr3 and chbr2cl during ozonation figs 5b and s11b si 3 5 3 hydroquinone despite the dominance of electron transfer for the reaction of hobr with hydroquinone criquet et al 2015 chbr3 formation was observed for all oxidants fig 5c nevertheless the molar chbr3 yield from hydroquinone is significantly lower compared to phenol and resorcinol table s4 si the trends for chbr3 formation from hydroquinone are similar for all tested oxidants and the chbr3 concentrations decreased in the order bromination chlorination ozonation for the same hydroquinone concentration fig 5c because a part of the hocl can react with hydroquinone directly with a second order rate constant of 6 83 101 m 1 s 1 table s5 si criquet et al 2015 the consumed hocl is no longer available for the oxidation of bromide and results in a lower chbr3 formation compared to bromination however this effect is much smaller compared to resorcinol because the latter reacts much faster with chlorine than hydroquinone the lowest chbr3 formation was observed during ozonation hydroquinone reacts fast with ozone 9 5 108 m 1 s 1 table s5 si von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which leads to a lower oxidant exposure and hence a lower hobr formation for low hydroquinone concentrations ozone will oxidize it beyond primary products at the same time also bromide is efficiently oxidized to hobr which can react with some of the intermediates such as α methyl ketones von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for high hydroquinone concentrations mostly primary transformation products are formed during ozonation and also limited hobr is formed however in this case the transformation products from hydroquinone oxidation are still more electron rich von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and might have an overall higher yield of chbr3 overall the differences between high and low hydroquinone concentrations are not so significant since these two trends partially compensate each other 3 6 thms formation from a β dicarbonyl acid during bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic saline waters it has been shown that aliphatic β dicarbonyl acids are efficient thms precursor with molar yields of chcl3 or chbr3 for 3 oxopentanedioic acid of 71 or 81 during chlorination or bromination respectively dickenson et al 2008 3 oxopentanedioic acid was used as a representative precursor for this class of moieties to investigate the chbr3 formation during bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic brackish waters figs 6 and s13 si the trend of chbr3 formation as a function of the oxidant 3 oxopentanedioic acid ratio is similar for all selected oxidants fig 6 the apparent second order rate constant for chcl3 formation from the reaction of 3 oxopentanedioic acid with chlorine at ph 8 is only 0 58 m 1 s 1 dickenson et al 2008 in contrast the reactivity of 3 oxopentanedioic acid with bromine is much higher because 96 or 2 3 of the 24 h chbr3 or chcl3 formation could be reached in 5 min at ph 8 during bromination or chlorination respectively dickenson et al 2008 the reaction of 3 oxopentanedioic acid with ozone should be slow due to its low ozone reactivity von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore only a small loss of either chlorine or ozone is expected due to their reactions with 3 oxopentanedioic acid which leads to a similar conversion of br to hobr and therefore a similar trend for chbr3 formation for all selected oxidants the molar yield of chbr3 formation for bromination is comparable to previous studies table s4 si dickenson et al 2008 larson and rockwell 1979 in addition minor concentrations of chbr2cl also formed for all selected oxidants fig s13a si as aforementioned this may be because that hobr could reacts with cl cl 0 27 m table 1 in synthetic brackish waters to form high reactivity mixed haline species e g brcl reaction 3 liu and margerum 2001 3 7 thm formation from mixtures of hydroquinone and phenol or resorcinol during bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic saline waters to mimic nom moieties reacting with hobr predominantly by electron transfer e g hydroquinone or electrophilic aromatic substitution e g phenol or resorcinol experiments with mixtures of these precursors hydroquinone phenol or hydroquinone resorcinol were carried out the sum of the precursor concentration was fixed 41 67 μm doc 3 0 mg l and the effect of various ratios 1 10 1 5 1 2 1 1 2 1 5 1 10 1 and 20 1 of hydroquinone and phenol or resorcinol on thm formation was investigated in synthetic brackish waters for the selected oxidants 104 μm no residual hobr could be observed for any of these reaction conditions 3 7 1 hydroquinone phenol mixtures the formations of chbr3 during bromination chlorination and ozonation of mixtures of hydroquinone and phenol are shown in fig s14a si the chbr3 formation increases with increasing hydroquinone concentration initially up to a hydroquinone phenol ratio of about 5 1 but decreases with a further increase of the hydroquinone phenol ratios to 10 1 or 20 1 during bromination or chlorination respectively for bromination as shown in equation 6 and fig s15a si the fraction of hydroquinone or phenol reacting with hobr is almost the same as its proportion in the mixture since the apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of hobr with hydroquinone at ph 8 5 65 105 m 1 s 1 table s5 si is similar to that for phenol 5 6 105 m 1 s 1 table s5 si criquet et al 2015 this indicates that the chbr3 formation depends entirely on the proportion of hydroquinone phenol in the mixture and the yields of the corresponding reactions 4 h o b r p h e n o l b r p h e n o l k 4 5 6 10 5 m 1 s 1 5 h o b r h y d r o q u i n o n e b r h y d r o q u i n o n e k 5 5 65 10 5 m 1 s 1 f p h e n o l h o b r k 4 h o b r p h e n o l k 4 h o b r p h e n o l k 5 h o b

n o l h o b r where f p h e n o l h o b r or f h y d r o q u i n o n e h o b r is the fraction of hobr reacting with phenol or hydroquinone respectively phenol or hydroquinone is the concentration of phenol or hydroquinone m respectively when the hydroquinone phenol ratios increase from 1 10 to 1 1 low chbr3 concentrations are formed because of the high phenol concentrations see fig 5a during bromination of the mixture of hydroquinone and phenol fig s14a si at a hydroquinone phenol ratio of 1 1 the fraction of hobr reacting with hydroquinone is similar to that for phenol hydroquinone concentration 20 8 μm fig s15a si and the highest chbr3 formation is found for the bromination of hydroquinone alone at a concentration of 20 μm fig 5c therefore for these conditions a high chbr3 concentration is expected during bromination of the mixture however a high chbr3 formation is not observed under these conditions fig s14a si since the total precursor concentration was 41 67 μm or about 20 μm for each hydroquinone and phenol while the hobr concentration is about 100 μm fig 5 this leads to a distribution of bromine over many sites with less chbr3 formation the chbr3 formation increases with increasing hydroquinone phenol ratios from 1 1 to 5 1 fig s14a si because chbr3 formation mainly depends on the fraction of hydroquinone reacting with hobr in these cases fig s15a si and the hobr hydroquinone reaction has a higher chbr3 yield for these conditions maximum chbr3 formation for hobr phenol and hobr hydroquinone is 8 2 and 4 9 respectively table s4 si however the chbr3 formation decreases by increasing the hydroquinone phenol ratios from 5 1 to 20 1 due to a bromine distribution over more precursor sites with increasing hydroquinone concentrations figs 5c and s14a si for chlorine the oxidation of bromide is the predominant reaction for all the ratios of hydroquinone and phenol since the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of hocl with bromide and the subsequently reaction of hobr with phenol or hydroquinone is about 20 times and four orders of magnitude higher than that for chlorination of phenol or hydroquinone respectively table s5 si criquet et al 2015 hence the rational for the chbr3 formation during chlorination of the mixture is similar to that for bromination fig s14a si ozone reacts much faster with phenol 1 8 107 m 1 s 1 or hydroquinone 9 54 108 m 1 s 1 table s5 si than with bromide 1 60 2 58 102 m 1 s 1 haag and hoigne 1983 liu et al 2001 this leads to an abatement of the thm precursor compounds and less hobr formation resulting in lower chbr3 formation than for chlorination or bromination ozone reacting with hydroquinone is the predominant reaction for all the hydroquinone phenol ratios since the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of ozone and hydroquinone at ph 8 is approximately 50 times higher than for phenol table s5 si for hydroquinone phenol ratios in the range of 1 10 to 1 1 the extent of oxidation of hydroquinone by ozone is still significant leading to lower chbr3 formation derived from hydroquinone under these conditions phenol will be oxidized by ozone due to its relatively high proportion of the mixture and low chbr3 formation is expected due to the high phenol concentration fig 5a therefore chbr3 formation during ozonation derived from either hydroquinone or phenol is expected to be low and results in low chbr3 formation for hydroquinone phenol ratios ranging from 1 10 to 1 1 for further increases of the hydroquinone phenol ratios from 2 1 to 20 1 more ozone will be consumed by hydroquinone for this situation the intermediate products from hydroquinone oxidation will be still more electron rich and are expected to have an overall higher yield of chbr3 similar to the ozone hydroquinone experiment alone therefore the chbr3 concentrations increase with increasing hydroquinone concentrations in the mixture fig s14a si 3 7 2 hydroquinone resorcinol mixtures for bromination the chbr3 formation from the mixture is similar to resorcinol alone figs 5b and s14c si since the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of hobr with resorcinol at ph 8 is about 30 times higher than for hydroquinone table s5 si two equations similar to equations 6 and 7 could be obtained based on equations 5 and 8 with analogous calculations of the fractions of hobr reacting with resorcinol or hydroquinone in the mixture bromination of the mixture is dominated by the bromination of resorcinol for all the hydroquinone resorcinol ratios fig s15b si therefore the chbr3 formation from the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol is similar to that for resorcinol alone fig s14c si 8 h o b r r e s o r c i n o l b r r e s o r c i n o l k 8 1 8 10 7 m 1 s 1 for chlorination the results obtained from kinetic model calculations fig s16a si are inconsistent with the experimental results figs s14c s14d and s14e si the kinetic model calculations only took the primary reactions into account and not the subsequent reactions of hox hocl or hobr with the intermediates derived from the oxidation of resorcinol or hydroquinone as shown in fig s16b si the fractions of both hocl and hobr reacting with resorcinol dominate during chlorination of mixtures for all the hydroquinone resorcinol ratios this is caused by the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of resorcinol with hocl or hobr at ph 8 which is about 150 or 30 times higher than that for hydroquinone respectively table s5 si therefore the formation of chbr3 chbr2cl chbrcl2 and chcl3 from the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol is similar to resorcinol alone figs 5c s11b s11c s14c s14d and s14e si ozone reacts much faster with resorcinol or hydroquinone than with bromide table s5 si which results in low chbr3 formation higher chbr3 formations are observed only at higher hydroquinone concentrations in the mixture fig s14c si this may be due to the fact that hydroquinone has higher chbr3 yields than resorcinol figs 5b and c in addition a significant chbr3 concentration is observed in the ozonation of the mixture when the hydroquinone resorcinol ratios are 5 1 however this should occur at a much lower hydroquinone resorcinol ratios since the ozone reaction with hydroquinone at ph 8 9 54 108 m 1 s 1 is estimated to be about 5 times higher than with resorcinol 1 66 108 m 1 s 1 table s5 si lee and von gunten 2012 however this discrepancy might be caused by the uncertainty from theoretical predictions of the two rate constants lee and von gunten 2012 chbr3 formation between the standard nom extracts and the model phenolic compounds was compared in terms of phenolic content of standard nom extracts table s8 si for chlorination chbr3 formation from phenol seems to match well with synthetic brackish water containing plfa at a low doc concentration however chbr3 formation from chlorination of both resorcinol and hydroquinone is significantly lower than from synthetic brackish water with plfa or naha this is mainly caused by the high reactivity with hocl table s5 si and low chbr3 yield respectively table s4 si for ozonation chbr3 formations from the three phenolic compounds are all far lower than from synthetic brackish water containing either plfa or naha at a low doc concentration and it is speculated that aliphatic β dicarbonyl acids such as 3 oxopentanedioic acid might play an important role in chbr3 formation from standard nom extracts since they have high yields of chbr3 even during ozonation fig 6 4 conclusions as dbps in saline water becomes an important issue with the application of chemical disinfectants in ballast water treatment the aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using synthetic brackish and sea waters containing standard nom extracts to mimic the br thms formation during ballast water treatment with chlorine or ozone furthermore phenol resorcinol hydroquinone and 3 oxopentanedioic acid were used as model thms precursors to simulate the behavior of dom for chbr3 formation during bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic saline waters for typical ballast water treatment conditions cl2 0 5 mg l or o3 0 3 mg l chbr3 formation for natural brackish or sea water is comparable to synthetic saline waters containing pony lake fulvic acid plfa nordic aquatic humic acid naha generally produces significantly higher chbr3 levels than natural brackish or sea waters the chbr3 formation decreases with increasing doc concentration for both plfa and naha during either chlorination or ozonation this is caused by bromine distribution over more thm precursor moieties for higher doc concentration in the case of insufficient oxidant dose the chbr3 formation during chlorination of synthetic saline water is more pronounced than that for ozonation since chlorine reacts faster with bromide and slower with thm precursor compared to ozone during either chlorination or ozonation chbr3 formation after 24 h is 60 or 85 of the maximum concentration achieved after 120 h for synthetic brackish water containing plfa or naha respectively chbr3 formation increases significantly with increasing bromide concentration from 12 5 to 125 μm and reaching a plateau for further increasing bromide concentrations low levels of chbr2cl and or chbrcl2 were also formed during both chlorination and ozonation overall plfa seems to be a reasonable dom surrogate to simulate chbr3 formation during oxidative treatment of natural saline ballast water with chlorine or ozone for bromination of model compounds the molar yields of chbr3 for phenol resorcinol 3 oxopentanedioic acid and hydroquinone are 28 62 91 and 11 respectively all the model compounds play certain roles in chbr3 formation during chlorination for ozonation 3 oxopentanedioic acid may play a more important role in chbr3 formation than the three phenolic compounds because the aromatic precursors are abated by ozone before they can react with hobr which has not been formed at this stage to simulate the role of various reactive moieties in the dom for br thms formation in saline water mixtures of hydroquinone and phenol or resorcinol were treated with bromine chlorine and ozone the chbr3 formation increases with increasing hydroquinone concentrations for both chlorination and ozonation except for chlorination of the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol the formation of thms from the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol is similar to resorcinol alone during chlorination since the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of resorcinol with hox is significantly higher than that for hydroquinone model phenolic compounds were also compared with standard nom extracts for chbr3 formation during oxidative treatment with chlorine and ozone in synthetic saline waters chbr3 formation from phenol is similar to that obtained from chlorination of synthetic brackish water containing plfa at a low doc concentration for ozonation chbr3 might be controlled by β dicarbonyl acids but no simple surrogate could be identified the results obtained in this study showed that plfa could be used to simulate chbr3 formation during oxidative treatment of natural saline brackish or sea waters with chlorine or ozone for typical ballast water treatment conditions cl2 0 5 mg l or o3 0 3 mg l accordingly if the main characteristics of ballast water such as doc and bromide concentrations are available synthetic saline water with plfa might be a simpler option than natural ballast water to evaluate br thms formation during ballast water treatment with chlorine or ozone to minimize the formation of br thms ozone is a better choice than chlorine for oxidative treatment of ballast water since the molar chbr3 yield in saline waters is lower for ozonation than for chlorination another option is to reduce the chlorine ozone dose if the disinfection standards

19446,oxidation experiments chlorine ozone and bromine were carried out with synthetic saline waters containing natural organic matter nom extracts and model compounds to evaluate the potential of these surrogates to mimic the formation of brominated trihalomethanes br thms in natural saline waters synthetic saline water with pony lake fulvic acid plfa showed comparable results to natural brackish and sea water for br thms formation during chlorination and ozonation for typical ballast water treatment conditions cl2 0 5 mg l or o3 0 3 mg l the molar chbr3 yield in synthetic saline waters is higher for chlorination than for ozonation since ozone reacts slower with bromide and faster with thm precursors for bromination the molar yields of chbr3 for the nom model compounds phenol resorcinol 3 oxopentanedioic acid and hydroquinone are 28 62 91 and 11 respectively chbr3 formation is low during chlorination or ozonation of resorcinol containing synthetic saline waters due to the faster reaction of resorcinol with these oxidants compared to the bromine formation from bromide oxidation experiments with mixtures of hydroquinone and phenol or resorcinol were conducted to mimic various functional groups of nom reacting with cl2 or o3 in saline water with increasing hydroquinone concentrations the chbr3 formation increases during both chlorination and ozonation of the mixtures except for chlorination of the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol the formation of thms during chlorination of the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol is similar to that of resorcinol alone due to the much faster reaction of hox with resorcinol compared to hydroquinone in general plfa seems to be a reasonable dom surrogate to simulate chbr3 formation for realistic ballast water

and von gunten 2000 dickenson et al 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002a gallard and von gunten 2002b larson and rockwell 1979 reckhow et al 1990 westerhoff et al 2004 one important parameter in dbp formation is the bromide concentration heeb et al 2014 richardson et al 1999 during disinfection of bromide containing water bromide is oxidized by e g chlorine hocl ocl or ozone o3 to hypobromous acid hobr by reactions 1 kumar and margerum 1987 or 2 haag and hoigne 1983 liu et al 2001 hobr can then react with thm precursors to form brominated thms 1 h o c l b r h o b r c l k 1 1 55 10 3 m 1 s

which have elevated bromide levels 0 5 67 mg l holland 1978 valero and arbós 2010 therefore in these systems the primary oxidants chlorine or ozone have only a limited lifetime and are quickly transformed to bromine and have a small direct effect on dbps formation consequently mostly brominated thms have been observed in oxidative treatment of saline waters including seawater swimming pools parinet et al 2012 seawater desalination systems kim et al 2015 and salt impacted freshwater heller grossman et al 1999 oxidative treatment of ballast water before discharge has become a common practice due to the growing concerns about the spread of invasive marine species worldwide werschkun et al 2014 to this end the formation of dbps for disinfection oxidation of brackish and sea waters has been investigated werschkun et al 2012 the effects of salinity temperature type and concentration of dissolved organic matter dom and type and dose of oxidants on dbps formation have been investigated for the disinfection of six natural brackish and sea waters in a detailed study shah et al 2015 it could be shown that as expected the primary oxidants chlorine or ozone were converted quickly to bromine in these systems due to the high bromide concentrations during chlorination the subsequent faster reaction of hobr with dom compared to hocl leads to a preferential formation of bromoform chbr3 shah et al 2015 similarly during ozonation mainly chbr3 is formed however in this case also bromate was observed shah et al 2015 1 2 formation of brominated thms during bromination of model compounds it has been shown previously that resorcinol and phenol moieties in nom are likely to play important roles in thm formation during chlorination bond and graham 2017 gallard and von gunten 2002b some aliphatic β diketones or β ketoacid structures within nom may also be important for thm formation bond and graham 2017 dickenson et al 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002a in contrast it has been reported that at least 75 of hobr is reduced initially to bromide in an electron transfer process during reaction with nom criquet et al 2015 westerhoff et al 1998 o and p hydroxyphenol moieties such as hydroquinone and catechol within nom may be important for these redox processes criquet et al 2015 nevertheless for chlorination of bromide containing waters with excess chlorine most of the bromine will eventually yield bromo organic compounds such as adsorbable organic bromine aobr langsa et al 2017 in the present study three nom isolates two nordic nom extracts nordic aquatic humic acid naha and a nordic reservoir nom nr nom and pony lake fulvic acid plfa representing allochthonous terrestrial and autochthonous microbially derived humic substances respectively were chosen to investigate thm formation during oxidative treatment of synthetic brackish and sea water in addition based on previous results with model compounds as thm precursors resorcinol phenol hydroquinone and 3 oxopentanedioic acid were selected as model precursors to mimic thm formation in saline waters during ozonation bromination or chlorination chlorine and ozone were used as oxidants due to their full scale application in ballast water management systems werschkun et al 2014 experiments with hobr were performed as reference systems without other oxidants because it is readily formed as a secondary oxidant during oxidative ballast water treatment of saline waters shah et al 2015 the objectives of this study were i to investigate the influence of various parameters dom type concentration reaction time and bromide concentration on thm formation during oxidative treatment of synthetic saline water in presence of nom extracts ii compare them to natural saline waters iii to assess the potential of several model precursor compounds such as phenol resorcinol hydroquinone and 3 oxopentanedioic acid to form thms in saline waters and iv to investigate the effect of hydroquinone to phenol or resorcinol ratios mimicking different dom sites on thm formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and standards dom extracts including plfa naha and nr nom experiments

of 1 20 mg l applied in ballast water treatment for ozone it is the upper limit for oxidative treatment of ballast water shah et al 2015 predetermined volumes of solutions containing either dom extracts or model compounds were added to 10 ml headspace vials after addition of an oxidant chlorine o3 or hobr they were sealed immediately with tfe lined screw caps the total volume in the vials was 10 ml after the addition of the oxidant no headspace which allowed minimal volatilization of thms during the reaction time after quenching the excess oxidant with a freshly prepared na2so3

resorcinol and hydroquinone systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 thm formation during disinfection of natural and synthetic saline brackish or sea waters in our previous study the doc concentrations were 2 3 or 3 0 mg l for the brackish waters from norway nor and germany de respectively table 1 shah et al 2015 to mimic this water quality the doc concentrations of synthetic brackish waters were selected as 2 and 3 mg l to enable a comparison of thm formation between synthetic and natural saline waters due to the predominance of bromination reactions in saline waters see above the current study will mainly focus on chbr3 formation fig 1 brackish waters and s1 si sea waters show the specific chbr3 formation μg chbr3 mg c for the treatment of various natural and synthetic saline waters as a function of a the chlorine or b the ozone dose for chlorine doses 5 mg l chbr3 formation for synthetic saline brackish or sea water with either naha or plfa is lower than for natural saline brackish or sea water inserts in figs 1a and s1a si this is caused by the higher hobr consumption in the synthetic waters compared to the natural waters figs s2a and s2b si see below for further explanations for chlorine doses 5 mg l chbr3 formation in the synthetic and natural saline waters levels off except for naha for which significantly higher concentrations were observed for naha the specific chbr3 formation μg chbr3 mg c is lower for the higher naha concentration this is caused by the higher number of precursor sites which get partially brominated but do not lead to full bromination with chbr3 formation this phenomenon has been described previously in the formation of cl br i thms during chlorination chloramination allard et al 2015 a similar trend could be observed for chbr2cl and chbrcl2 formations figs s3a s3b s3c and s3d si chbr3 formation in the saline brackish or sea water containing plfa is similar to the natural saline brackish or sea waters figs 1a and s1a si similar to chlorination for low ozone doses 3 mg l the specific chbr3 formation μg chbr3 mg c for natural saline brackish or sea water is higher than for synthetic saline brackish or sea water with either naha or plfa inserts in figs 1b and s1b si the specific chbr3 formation during ozonation of synthetic saline brackish or sea waters with naha doc 2 mg l is significantly higher than for natural saline brackish or sea waters for o3 doses 3 mg l however chbr3 formation for synthetic saline brackish or sea waters with plfa and naha doc 3 mg l is similar to natural saline brackish or sea water figs 1b and s1b si despite the fact that no chlorine formation is expected during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 low concentrations of chbr2cl are formed figs s3e and s3f si this may be due to mixed radical halide species e g brcl formation during ozonation of seawater grebel et al 2010 it is suggested that such radical halide species could react with dom precursors and results in chbr2cl formation during ozonation of natural saline waters shah et al 2015 the lower yields of chbr3 for synthetic saline brackish or sea water for low oxidant doses cl2 0 or o3 0 2 mg l reported above are caused by the lower residual hobr concentrations in synthetic saline waters compared to natural saline waters figs s2a s2b s2c and s2d si these phenomena may be caused by the different properties of dom in synthetic and natural saline waters since naha and plfa are only fractions of dom naha is a fraction of nr nom and has a higher electron donating capacity edc compared to nr nom for equal doc concentration aeschbacher et al 2012 therefore naha is expected to have a higher efficiency for ozone chlorine and hobr reduction compared to nr nom which leads to a lower residual hobr concentration and in turn to a lower chbr3 formation to test this hypothesis further ozonation experiments were conducted with nr nom doc 2 or 3 mg l and compared to naha in synthetic brackish water fig s4 si for an ozone dose of 1 mg l the specific chbr3 formation from nr nom is higher than for naha but still lower compared to natural waters however when the ozone dose was increased to 2 mg l in the nr nom experiment even in absence of residual hobr the chbr3 formation doc 2 mg l is slightly higher than in the natural water similarly a high edc value would be expected for plfa compared to the whole nom which leads to a lower chbr3 formation for saline waters containing plfa compared to natural saline waters at low oxidant doses cl2 0 or o3 0 2 mg l at higher oxidant doses cl2 0 5 mg l or o3 0 3 mg l synthetic saline brackish or sea waters with equal dom concentrations lead to higher chbr3 yields for naha than for plfa figs 1a 1b s1a and s1b si this is most likely due to the higher aromaticity of naha table s3 si based on the comparative specific chbr3 formation of synthetic and natural saline brackish or sea waters plfa seems to be a reasonable dom surrogate to simulate chbr3 formation in natural saline brackish or sea waters for oxidative treatment with chlorine or ozone for doses 2 mg l plfa is a microbially derived and autochthonous aquatic humic substance from a saline 5 ppt coastal pond in antarctica brown et al 2004 and has a lower aromatic content table s3 si compared to naha and a c n ratio of about 8 chin et al 1997 mcknight et al 1994 marine dom as in the natural saline waters such as sea water is derived from microalgae and bacteria and its c n is usually in the range from 8 to 20 ogawa and tanoue 2003 therefore it can be expected that the concentration of chbr3 precursor moieties in plfa may be similar to marine brackish dom within certain limits 3 2 effect of doc concentration on the formation of thms fig 2 shows the chbr3 formation during chlorination or ozonation of synthetic brackish waters containing plfa or naha in various concentrations doc concentrations 2 5 mg l figs 2a and b show that during chlorination and for low oxidant doses cl2 0 2 mg l or 7 4 mg l for plfa or naha respectively the chbr3 formation is higher for the lower doc concentration than for the higher doc concentrations this observation is mainly caused by a bromine distribution over more thm precursor sites for higher doc concentration which results in a less efficient chbr3 formation for low chlorine doses under these conditions no hobr residual was observed figs s5d and s5e si because hocl reacts relatively slowly with dom moieties the hobr formation should be similar for all dom concentrations and therefore only have a minor effect on thm formation the chlorine dose was further increased to investigate the effect of excessive chlorination under these conditions as expected a higher doc concentration leads to higher chbr3 concentrations cl2 0 9 mg l or 15 mg l for plfa or naha respectively a residual hobr concentration can be detected for these conditions figs s5d and s5e si the specific chbr3 formation inserts in figs 2a and b are highest for the lowest doc concentrations for both plfa and naha the highest specific chbr3 formations for high chlorine doses are very similar for all the doc concentrations this means that under these conditions the maximum chbr3 formation potential is reached because ultimately the hobr will be in large excess and all the precursor sites will be brominated langsa et al 2017 for ozone the chbr3 formation decreases with increasing doc concentration for plfa for o3 doses 3 mg l fig 2c for higher o3 doses the chbr3 formation becomes higher at the higher doc levels again these trends are linked to the availability of residual hobr figs 2c and s6c si for naha the chbr3 formation is highest for the lowest doc concentration for all o3 doses fig 2d this is due to i a slower transformation of bromide to hobr during ozonation reaction 2 haag and hoigne 1983 liu et al 2001 compared to chlorine reaction 1 kumar and margerum 1987 leading to a higher fraction of ozone reacting with dom extracts and a lower hobr formation for the higher doc concentrations ii more reactive sites which get only partially brominated for the higher doc concentrations lead to lower chbr3 formation low concentrations of chbr2cl are also observed during ozonation of either plfa or naha figs s6a and s6b si for explanations see above the highest specific yields of chbr3 in plfa containing waters are about 25 higher for chlorination than for ozonation for the same molar oxidant dose inserts in figs 2a and c this is caused by the lower efficiency of the bromide conversion to hobr during ozonation reaction 2 haag and hoigne 1983 liu et al 2001 compared to chlorine reaction 1 kumar and margerum 1987 furthermore most thm precursors e g resorcinol phenol dickenson et al 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002b react much more readily with ozone than with chlorine criquet et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 as a consequence more thm precursors are likely to be consumed during ozonation and hence not available anymore for chbr3 formation therefore both the specific yields and the absolute concentrations of chbr3 are higher during chlorination than during ozonation 3 3 kinetics of thms formation the chbr3 formation increases up to 120 h during oxidative treatment of synthetic brackish waters containing nom isolates for treatment of plfa containing synthetic water doc 3 mg l with chlorine or ozone the chbr3 concentrations are lower than for the same experiment with naha fig 3 for chlorination chbr3 formation is 391 or 629 μg l at 24 h or 120 h for plfa and 956 or 1066 μg l at 24 h or 120 h for naha respectively for ozonation chbr3 formation is 319 or 501 μg l at 24 h or 120 h for plfa and 403 or 469 μg l at 24 h or 120 h for naha respectively the more pronounced difference between 24 h and 120 h for plfa compared with naha is caused by residual hobr for plfa while there is no residual hobr for naha for both chlorination and ozonation after 24 h figs s7c and s7e si low levels of chbr2cl and or chbrcl2 were also formed during chlorination or ozonation of the same waters figs s7a s7b and s7d si generally two phase kinetics were observed for chbr3 formation which is in agreement to previous findings for chlorination of natural fresh brackish and sea waters gallard and von gunten 2002a shah et al 2015 it is hypothesized that resorcinol type aromatic structures aliphatic β diketones and or β ketoacids structures within the dom play important roles in the initial phase in the second phase with slower chbr3 formation dom moieties with lower reactivities may govern the thm formation criquet et al 2015 gallard and von gunten 2002a for the same oxidant doses and the same reaction times the initial chbr3 formations for both plfa and naha during ozonation are significantly lower than for chlorination for chlorine the efficiency of the bromide conversion to hobr is higher compared for ozone t 1 2 1 1 or 9 s at br 0 33 5 mg l 419 μm and oxidant 0 104 μm for chlorination or ozonation respectively during this phase ozone is available to oxidize resorcinol phenol type moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which results in a lower chbr3 formation during the initial phase of an ozonation the chlorine reactions with resorcinol type moieties of dom are much slower than the corresponding ozone reactions deborde and von gunten 2008 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the ozone effect on chbr3 formation for naha is significantly more pronounced than for plfa fig 3 this may be due to the higher aromaticity of naha compared to plfa table s3 si which results in a higher ozone reactivity and consequently a more significant consumption of thm precursors the chbr3 formation from plfa in synthetic brackish water doc 3 0 mg l is within certain limits comparable to natural brackish water ne doc 3 6 mg l shah et al 2015 during either chlorination or ozonation compare figs 3 and 1 a similar trend was observed for chbr2cl and chbrcl2 formations from plfa figs s7a s7b and s7d si the residual hobr concentrations in synthetic brackish waters for plfa are also similar to natural brackish waters figs s7c and s7e si chbr3 formation for ozonation of synthetic brackish water in presence of naha doc 3 mg l is also quite comparable to natural brackish water however during chlorination it is significantly higher compared to natural brackish water figs 1 and 3 3 4 effect of bromide concentration on the formation of thms when increasing the bromide concentration from 12 5 to 125 μm 1 10 mg l chbr3 formation increases significantly fig 4 in contrast chbr2cl or chbrcl2 formation decrease remarkably with increasing bromide concentrations during chlorination of brackish waters containing plfa or naha figs s8a and s8b si however the chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 concentrations vary only slightly for bromide concentrations 125 μm 10 mg l overall a shift to more brominated thms can be observed for increasing bromide concentrations the effect of the bromide concentrations on the chbr3 formation during ozonation of saline water is more pronounced than during chlorination fig 4 as mentioned above the formation of hobr during ozonation is slower than for hocl haag and hoigne 1983 kumar and margerum 1987 liu et al 2001 the half life time of ozone depends directly on the bromide concentration t 1 2 o3 37 and 9 s for br 0 125 and 419 μm 10 and 33 5 mg l at o3 0 5 mg l respectively therefore for lower bromide concentrations the ozone reaction with dom is more pronounced leading to a partial abatement of thm precursors furthermore due to the consumption of ozone less bromide can be oxidized to hobr which in turn leads to a lower thm formation figs s8c and s8e si the chbr3 formation during chlorination and ozonation of brackish water containing plfa are similar for high bromide concentrations this is due to the lower ozone reactivity of plfa and more efficient ozone quenching for higher bromide concentrations the chbr3 formation in brackish water containing naha is much higher for chlorination than for ozonation as mentioned above this may be caused by the higher aromaticity of naha compared with plfa table s3 si which results in a higher consumptions of both ozone and thm precursors during ozonation of brackish water containing naha 3 5 thm formation from model phenolic precursors during bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic saline waters it has been demonstrated that phenol and resorcinol play important roles in chx3 formation during chlorination or bromination bond and graham 2017 boyce and hornig 1983 dickenson et al 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002a gallard and von gunten 2002b br incorporation is very low during the bromination of o and p hydroxyphenols because hobr reacts mainly by electron transfer et and is thereby mainly reduced to bromide by these compounds criquet et al 2015 based on these observations phenol resorcinol and hydroquinone were selected as model compounds to mimic various dom precursors electrophilic aromatic substitution and electron transfer for chbr3 formation during bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic saline waters figs 5 s10 and s11 si 3 5 1 phenol fig 5 a shows the chbr3 formation as a function of the oxidant phenol ratio for bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic brackish waters chbr3 increases with increasing phenol concentrations in the range of 3 12 μm for a hobr dose of 104 μm at a molar oxidant phenol ratio of 8 2 the maximum chbr3 formation is achieved at a phenol concentration of 12 7 μm table s4 si for smaller oxidant phenol ratios the oxidant concentrations are not sufficient to fully brominate phenol all the way to chbr3 resulting in a pronounced decrease of chbr3 formation fig 5a for hobr phenol ratios 8 2 the hobr concentration is high enough to brominate all the precursor sites however in this case the chbr3 formation depends directly on the phenol concentration resulting in a proportional decrease of the chbr3 formation with decreasing phenol concentrations fig 5a low concentrations of chbr2cl are also found during bromination of phenol fig s11a si this may be due to the presence of mixed haline species such as brcl which could be formed by the reaction of hobr with cl cl concentration is 0 27 m in synthetic brackish water table 1 in saline waters reaction 3 liu and margerum 2001 the brcl concentration is approximately 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than the hobr concentration during chlorination of seawater heeb et al 2014 and brcl has a high reactivity towards organic compounds sivey et al 2013 3 b r c l h 2 o h o b r c l h k 1 3 0 1 10 4 m 2 s 1 the trend of the variation of chbr3 and chbr2cl formation for phenol during chlorination is similar to that of bromination figs 5a and s11a si because the chlorine reactivity with phenol is low gallard and von gunten 2002b ozone reacts much faster with phenol than with bromide table s5 si which leads to a partial destruction of phenol ramseier and gunten 2009 and hence less chbr3 formation with a maximum of only 178 μg l compared to 898 μg l and 908 μg l for bromination and chlorination respectively nevertheless the general trend of chbr3 formation is similar to bromination and chlorination fig 5a 3 5 2 resorcinol fig 5b shows that for bromination chbr3 formation increases with increasing resorcinol concentrations from 3 to 12 μm however the chbr3 formation decreases gradually for higher resorcinol concentrations because as for phenol an excess of precursor does not lead to chbr3 due to the distribution of bromine over many sites the chbr3 formation from resorcinol is very limited during chlorination resorcinol has a high reactivity with hocl criquet et al 2015 and the hobr formation is in competition to the resorcinol reaction for low resorcinol concentrations the rate of hobr formation is about a factor 6 higher than the chlorine resorcinol reaction whereas for the highest resorcinol concentration chlorine reacts about a factor of 2 faster with resorcinol than with bromide based on these kinetic boundary conditions fig s12 si there will always be a mix of chbr3 chbr2cl chbrcl2 and chcl3 in these experiments with bromoform decreasing from 3 μm resorcinol to higher resorcinol concentrations figs 5b s11b and s11c si the ozone reaction with resorcinol is much faster than hobr formation table s5 si which leads to only minor concentrations of chbr3 and chbr2cl during ozonation figs 5b and s11b si 3 5 3 hydroquinone despite the dominance of electron transfer for the reaction of hobr with hydroquinone criquet et al 2015 chbr3 formation was observed for all oxidants fig 5c nevertheless the molar chbr3 yield from hydroquinone is significantly lower compared to phenol and resorcinol table s4 si the trends for chbr3 formation from hydroquinone are similar for all tested oxidants and the chbr3 concentrations decreased in the order bromination chlorination ozonation for the same hydroquinone concentration fig 5c because a part of the hocl can react with hydroquinone directly with a second order rate constant of 6 83 101 m 1 s 1 table s5 si criquet et al 2015 the consumed hocl is no longer available for the oxidation of bromide and results in a lower chbr3 formation compared to bromination however this effect is much smaller compared to resorcinol because the latter reacts much faster with chlorine than hydroquinone the lowest chbr3 formation was observed during ozonation hydroquinone reacts fast with ozone 9 5 108 m 1 s 1 table s5 si von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which leads to a lower oxidant exposure and hence a lower hobr formation for low hydroquinone concentrations ozone will oxidize it beyond primary products at the same time also bromide is efficiently oxidized to hobr which can react with some of the intermediates such as α methyl ketones von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for high hydroquinone concentrations mostly primary transformation products are formed during ozonation and also limited hobr is formed however in this case the transformation products from hydroquinone oxidation are still more electron rich von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and might have an overall higher yield of chbr3 overall the differences between high and low hydroquinone concentrations are not so significant since these two trends partially compensate each other 3 6 thms formation from a β dicarbonyl acid during bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic saline waters it has been shown that aliphatic β dicarbonyl acids are efficient thms precursor with molar yields of chcl3 or chbr3 for 3 oxopentanedioic acid of 71 or 81 during chlorination or bromination respectively dickenson et al 2008 3 oxopentanedioic acid was used as a representative precursor for this class of moieties to investigate the chbr3 formation during bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic brackish waters figs 6 and s13 si the trend of chbr3 formation as a function of the oxidant 3 oxopentanedioic acid ratio is similar for all selected oxidants fig 6 the apparent second order rate constant for chcl3 formation from the reaction of 3 oxopentanedioic acid with chlorine at ph 8 is only 0 58 m 1 s 1 dickenson et al 2008 in contrast the reactivity of 3 oxopentanedioic acid with bromine is much higher because 96 or 2 3 of the 24 h chbr3 or chcl3 formation could be reached in 5 min at ph 8 during bromination or chlorination respectively dickenson et al 2008 the reaction of 3 oxopentanedioic acid with ozone should be slow due to its low ozone reactivity von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore only a small loss of either chlorine or ozone is expected due to their reactions with 3 oxopentanedioic acid which leads to a similar conversion of br to hobr and therefore a similar trend for chbr3 formation for all selected oxidants the molar yield of chbr3 formation for bromination is comparable to previous studies table s4 si dickenson et al 2008 larson and rockwell 1979 in addition minor concentrations of chbr2cl also formed for all selected oxidants fig s13a si as aforementioned this may be because that hobr could reacts with cl cl 0 27 m table 1 in synthetic brackish waters to form high reactivity mixed haline species e g brcl

increases with increasing hydroquinone concentration initially up to a hydroquinone phenol ratio of about 5 1 but decreases with a further increase of the hydroquinone phenol ratios to 10 1 or 20 1 during bromination or chlorination respectively for bromination as shown in equation 6 and fig s15a si the fraction of hydroquinone or phenol reacting with hobr is almost the same as its proportion in the mixture since the apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of hobr with hydroquinone at ph 8 5 65 105 m 1 s 1 table s5 si is similar to that for phenol 5 6 105 m 1 s 1 table s5 si criquet et al 2015 this indicates that the chbr3 formation depends entirely on the proportion of hydroquinone phenol in the mixture and the yields of the corresponding reactions 4 h o b r p h e n o l b r p h e n o l k 4 5 6 10 5 m 1 s 1 5 h o b r h y d r o q u i n o n e b r h y d r o q u i n o n e k 5 5 65 10 5 m 1 s 1 f p h e n o l h o b r k 4 h o b r p h e n o l k 4 h o b r p h e n o l k 5 h o b

n o l h o b r where f p h e n o l h o b r or f h y d r o q u i n o n e h o b r is the fraction of hobr reacting with phenol or hydroquinone respectively phenol or hydroquinone is the concentration of phenol or hydroquinone m respectively when the hydroquinone phenol ratios increase from 1 10 to 1 1 low chbr3 concentrations are formed because of the high phenol concentrations see fig 5a during bromination of the mixture of hydroquinone and phenol fig s14a si at a hydroquinone phenol ratio of 1 1 the fraction of hobr reacting with hydroquinone is similar to that for phenol hydroquinone concentration 20 8 μm fig s15a si and the highest chbr3 formation is found for the bromination of hydroquinone alone at a concentration of 20 μm fig 5c therefore for these conditions a high chbr3 concentration is expected during bromination of the mixture however a high chbr3 formation is not observed under these conditions fig s14a si since the total precursor concentration was 41 67 μm or about 20 μm for each hydroquinone and phenol while the hobr concentration is about 100 μm fig 5 this leads to a distribution of bromine over many sites with less chbr3 formation the chbr3 formation increases with increasing hydroquinone phenol ratios from 1 1 to 5 1 fig s14a si because chbr3 formation mainly depends on the fraction of hydroquinone reacting with hobr in these cases fig s15a si and the hobr hydroquinone reaction has a higher chbr3 yield for these conditions maximum chbr3 formation for hobr phenol and hobr hydroquinone is 8 2 and 4 9 respectively table s4 si however the chbr3 formation decreases by increasing the hydroquinone phenol ratios from 5 1 to 20 1 due to a bromine distribution over more precursor sites with increasing hydroquinone concentrations figs 5c and s14a si for chlorine the oxidation of bromide is the predominant reaction for all the ratios of hydroquinone and phenol since the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of hocl with bromide and the subsequently reaction of hobr with phenol or hydroquinone is about 20 times and four orders of magnitude higher than that for chlorination of phenol or hydroquinone respectively table s5 si criquet et al 2015 hence the rational for the chbr3 formation during chlorination of the mixture is similar to that for bromination fig s14a si ozone reacts much faster with phenol 1 8 107 m 1 s 1 or hydroquinone 9 54 108 m 1 s 1 table s5 si than with bromide 1 60 2 58 102 m 1 s 1 haag and hoigne 1983 liu et al 2001 this leads to an abatement of the thm precursor compounds and less hobr formation resulting in lower chbr3 formation than for chlorination or bromination ozone reacting with hydroquinone is the predominant reaction for all the hydroquinone phenol ratios since the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of ozone and hydroquinone at ph 8 is approximately 50 times higher than for phenol table s5 si for hydroquinone phenol ratios in the range of 1 10 to 1 1 the extent of oxidation of hydroquinone by ozone is still significant leading to lower chbr3 formation derived from hydroquinone under these conditions phenol will be oxidized by ozone due to its relatively high proportion of the mixture and low chbr3 formation is expected due to the high phenol concentration fig 5a therefore chbr3 formation during ozonation derived from either hydroquinone or phenol is expected to be low and results in low chbr3 formation for hydroquinone phenol ratios ranging from 1 10 to 1 1 for further increases of the hydroquinone phenol ratios from 2 1 to 20 1 more ozone will be consumed by hydroquinone for this situation the intermediate products from hydroquinone oxidation will be still more electron rich and are expected to have an overall higher yield of chbr3 similar to the ozone hydroquinone experiment alone therefore the chbr3 concentrations increase with increasing hydroquinone concentrations in the mixture fig s14a si 3 7 2 hydroquinone resorcinol mixtures for bromination the chbr3 formation from the mixture is similar to resorcinol alone figs 5b and s14c si since the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of hobr with resorcinol at ph 8 is about 30 times higher than for hydroquinone table s5 si two equations similar to equations 6 and 7 could be obtained based on equations 5 and 8 with analogous calculations of the fractions of hobr reacting with resorcinol or hydroquinone in the mixture bromination of the mixture is dominated by the bromination of resorcinol for all the hydroquinone resorcinol ratios fig s15b si therefore the chbr3 formation from the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol is similar to that for resorcinol alone fig s14c si 8 h o b r r e s o r c i n o l b r r e s o r c i n o l k 8 1 8 10 7 m 1 s 1 for chlorination the results obtained from kinetic model calculations fig s16a si are inconsistent with the experimental results figs s14c s14d and s14e si the kinetic model calculations only took the primary reactions into account and not the subsequent reactions of hox hocl or hobr with the intermediates derived from the oxidation of resorcinol or hydroquinone as shown in fig s16b si the fractions of both hocl and hobr reacting with resorcinol dominate during chlorination of mixtures for all the hydroquinone resorcinol ratios this is caused by the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of resorcinol with hocl or hobr at ph 8 which is about 150 or 30 times higher than that for hydroquinone respectively table s5 si therefore the formation of chbr3 chbr2cl chbrcl2 and chcl3 from the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol is similar to resorcinol alone figs 5c s11b s11c s14c s14d and s14e si ozone reacts much faster with resorcinol or hydroquinone than with bromide table s5 si which results in low chbr3 formation higher chbr3 formations are observed only at higher hydroquinone concentrations in the mixture fig s14c si this may be due to the fact that hydroquinone has higher chbr3 yields than resorcinol figs 5b and c in addition a significant chbr3 concentration is observed in the ozonation of the mixture when the hydroquinone resorcinol ratios are 5 1 however this should occur at a much lower hydroquinone resorcinol ratios since the ozone reaction with hydroquinone at ph 8 9 54 108 m 1 s 1 is estimated to be about 5 times higher than with resorcinol 1 66 108 m 1 s 1 table s5 si lee and von gunten 2012 however this discrepancy might be caused by the uncertainty from theoretical predictions of the two rate constants lee and von gunten 2012 chbr3 formation between the standard nom extracts and the model phenolic compounds was compared in terms of phenolic content of standard nom extracts table s8 si for chlorination chbr3 formation from phenol seems to match well with synthetic brackish water containing plfa at a low doc concentration however chbr3 formation from chlorination of both resorcinol and hydroquinone is significantly lower than from synthetic brackish water with plfa or naha this is mainly caused by the high reactivity with hocl table s5 si and low chbr3 yield respectively table s4 si for ozonation chbr3 formations from the three phenolic compounds are all far lower than from synthetic brackish water containing either plfa or naha at a low doc concentration and it is speculated that aliphatic β dicarbonyl acids such as 3 oxopentanedioic acid might play an important role in chbr3 formation from standard nom extracts since they have high yields of chbr3 even during ozonation fig 6 4 conclusions as dbps in saline water becomes an important issue with the application of chemical disinfectants in ballast water treatment the aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using synthetic brackish and sea waters containing standard nom extracts to mimic the br thms formation during ballast water treatment with chlorine or ozone furthermore phenol resorcinol hydroquinone and 3 oxopentanedioic acid were used as model thms precursors to simulate the behavior of dom for chbr3 formation during bromination chlorination and ozonation of synthetic saline waters for typical ballast water treatment conditions cl2 0 5 mg l or o3 0 3 mg l chbr3 formation for natural brackish or sea water is comparable to synthetic saline waters containing pony lake fulvic acid plfa nordic aquatic humic acid naha generally produces significantly higher chbr3 levels than natural brackish or sea waters the chbr3 formation decreases with increasing doc concentration for both plfa and naha during either chlorination or ozonation this is caused by bromine distribution over more thm precursor moieties for higher doc concentration in the case of insufficient oxidant dose the chbr3 formation during chlorination of synthetic saline water is more pronounced than that for ozonation since chlorine reacts faster with bromide and slower with thm precursor compared to ozone during either chlorination or ozonation chbr3 formation after 24 h is 60 or 85 of the maximum concentration achieved after 120 h for synthetic brackish water containing plfa or naha respectively chbr3 formation increases significantly with increasing bromide concentration from 12 5 to 125 μm and reaching a plateau for further increasing bromide concentrations low levels of chbr2cl and or chbrcl2 were also formed during both chlorination and ozonation overall plfa seems to be a reasonable dom surrogate to simulate chbr3 formation during oxidative treatment of natural saline ballast water with chlorine or ozone for bromination of model compounds the molar yields of chbr3 for phenol resorcinol 3 oxopentanedioic acid and hydroquinone are 28 62 91 and 11 respectively all the model compounds play certain roles in chbr3 formation during chlorination for ozonation 3 oxopentanedioic acid may play a more important role in chbr3 formation than the three phenolic compounds because the aromatic precursors are abated by ozone before they can react with hobr which has not been formed at this stage to simulate the role of various reactive moieties in the dom for br thms formation in saline water mixtures of hydroquinone and phenol or resorcinol were treated with bromine chlorine and ozone the chbr3 formation increases with increasing hydroquinone concentrations for both chlorination and ozonation except for chlorination of the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol the formation of thms from the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol is similar to resorcinol alone during chlorination since the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of resorcinol with hox is significantly higher than that for hydroquinone model phenolic compounds were also compared with standard nom extracts for chbr3 formation during oxidative treatment with chlorine and ozone in synthetic saline waters chbr3 formation from phenol is similar to that obtained from chlorination of synthetic brackish water containing plfa at a low doc concentration for ozonation chbr3 might be controlled by β dicarbonyl acids but no simple surrogate could be identified the results obtained in this study showed that plfa could be used to simulate chbr3 formation during oxidative treatment of natural saline brackish or sea waters with chlorine or ozone for typical ballast water treatment conditions cl2 0 5 mg l or o3 0 3 mg l accordingly if the main characteristics of ballast water such as doc and bromide concentrations are available synthetic saline water with plfa might be a simpler option than natural ballast water to evaluate br thms formation during ballast water treatment with chlorine or ozone to minimize the formation of br thms ozone is a better choice than chlorine for oxidative treatment of ballast water since the molar chbr3 yield in saline waters is lower for ozonation than for chlorination another option is to reduce the chlorine ozone dose if the disinfection standards

19447,a series of one dimensional column experiments were conducted to investigate the transport and retention of micron sized plastic spheres mps with diameters of 0 1 2 0 μm in seawater saturated sand in seawater with salinity of 35 psu practical salinity units the mass percentages recovered from the effluent meff of the larger mps increased from 13 6 to 41 3 as mp size decreased from 2 0 μm to 0 8 μm this occurred because of the gradual reduction of physical straining effect of mps in the pores between sands the smaller mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm showed the stronger inhibition of mps mobility with meff values of 11 5 11 9 and 9 8 respectively this was due to the lower energy barriers from 108 kbt to 16 kbt between the smaller mps and the sand surface when compared with the larger mps from 296 kbt to 161 kbt in particular the aggregation of mps 0 6 or 0 4 μm triggered a progressive decrease in mp concentration in the effluent retention experiments showed that the vertical migration distance of most mp colloids was 0 4 cm at the inlet of column for 0 6 or 0 4 μm mps the particles were concentrated over a 0 2 cm vertical distance moreover the salinity 35 3 5 psu did not affect the transport of the larger mps 2 0 0 8 μm however as seawater salinity decreased from 35 psu to 17 5 or 3 5 psu the aggregation of the smaller mps 0 6 0 1 μm was dramatically inhibited or completely prevented meanwhile ripening of the sand surface by the mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm no longer occurred by contrast all mps in deionized water 0 psu achieved complete column breakthroughs because of the strong repulsive energy barrier from 218 kbt to 4192 kbt between the mps and the sand surface consequently we find that the transport and retention of mps in sandy marine environment strongly relies on both the mp size and the salinity levels graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater microplastics transport retention marine salinity natural sea sand 1 introduction microplastics mps are anthropogenic granular contaminants that have recently attracted worldwide attention because of the potential risks they pose to marine aquatic environments hidalgo ruz et al 2012 thompson et al 2004 marine sedimentary environments such as estuarine nearshore and beach are significant sinks for mps nizzetto et al 2016 reisser et al 2014 andrady 2011 the mp samples gathered from sandy beaches are generally smaller than those from sea surfaces and seawater columns hidalgo ruz et al 2012 a recent study revealed that almost 60 of mps deposited in marine sediment were less than 11 μm in diameter bergmann et al 2017 however the underlying mechanisms for the accumulation and transport of micron sized mps in marine sandy sediment are not yet fully understood bradford et al 2002 2003 2007 conducted a series of studies on the transport of micron sized polystyrene spheres 0 45 3 0 μm in ottawa sand and glass beads and developed mechanisms and models of colloidal mp transport in subsurface environments the mobility of mps in these column experiments increased with a decrease in the ionic strength of the solution and a decrease in the ratio of the colloidal mp diameter ddls to the median grain size of sand d50 although these studies are significant and provide valuable information for assessing the environmental behavior of mps the maximum concentration of nacl background solution was close to 100 mmol l considerably lower than natural seawater salinity 35 psu nearly 500 mmol l nacl quevedo and tufenkji 2012 atkinson et al 2007 xu et al 2013 according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory high salinity has a remarkably strong effect on the surface physicochemical properties i e ζ potential and the stability of colloids bergami et al 2016 babakhani et al 2015 in seawater high salinity can induce rapid aggregation of engineered nanoparticles e g metal oxides and quantum dots and as much as a several hundred fold increase in colloid size xiao et al 2017 wang et al 2015 large aggregates z average 0 9 μm of nano sized polystyrene 40 nm in seawater also were observed bergami et al 2016 these aggregates or agglomerates could ultimately hinder transport and promote retention of the colloids e g titanium dioxide tio2 and zero valent iron fe0 in porous media godinez and darnault 2011 babakhani et al 2015 conversely the ζ potential of porous medium i e sand would become less negative in higher salt solution mitzel et al 2016 therefore a greater decrease in the energy barrier between colloids and sand leads to increased retention of colloids on the sand surface accordingly the general mechanism of mp transport in a low salt solution might not accurately describe natural seawater environments babakhani et al 2017 kamrani et al 2017 in addition the transport and retention of colloidal particles may be related to the physicochemical characteristics interface roughness and volume heterogeneity of porous media sun et al 2015 shen et al 2012 the heterogeneity of porous media significantly influences the transport behavior of colloidal particles under a variety of environmental conditions for example natural soil showed stronger transport inhibition of fullerene nanoparticles than ottawa sands because of the greater surface charge heterogeneity and surface roughness of soil zhang et al 2012 fine grain sand is a natural and essential component of marine sedimentary systems and plays a major role in influencing the interfacial interaction and mass transfer of colloids to better describe the transport of mps in marine environments natural heterogeneous sand is recommended as a column filling medium however most column transport experiments of mps have been conducted with granular porous media such as glass beads shen et al 2008 and ottawa sands mitzel et al 2016 to date only a few works have used loamy sand quevedo and tufenkji 2012 or heterogeneous quartz silica hoggan et al 2016 in this work we collected natural seabed sand from the eastern sea of china it is composed of sand grains that range in size from 0 13 to 1 53 mm the aim of this study is to evaluate the size dependent transport and retention of micron sized plastic spheres 2 0 1 5 0 8 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm in marine sandy environments at different salinity gradients 35 17 5 3 5 and 0 psu the commercial polystyrene spheres were chosen as model mps because they extensively used as containers for chemical reactions in drug delivery medical imaging and regenerative medicine yap and zhang 2007 they would be discharged into the environment from the industrial wastewater medical wastewater or municipal wastewater browne et al 2007 in recent studies these commercial polystyrene spheres have been used as model materials to explore the aggregation and transport of microplastics nanoplastics in the water environment cai et al 2018 liu et al 2018 the breakthrough curves btcs and retention profiles rps were measured and further modeled by hydrus 1d to explore the size dependent transport mechanism in seawater saturated sand we also performed dlvo and extended dlvo xdlvo interaction energy calculations to better understand the mechanisms of mp mobility the results of this work will be helpful in predicting the potential risk of micron sized plastic particles in marine depositional environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fine grained sand was collected from the seafloor of pingtan strait in fujian province in china the sand was air dried and sifted to remove large particles and impurities such as shells and other marine organism residues xia et al 2015 and then washed with 4 hcl followed by two washes of 4 h2o2 the sand was then rinsed repeatedly with deionized water until the filtrate had a neutral ph finally the clean sand was oven dried at 105 c overnight and stored for all experiments the porosity of the sand 44 88 was measured according to the method of klute 1986 the size of the

from 10 to 80 with a step size of 0 1 s step in this work the commercial polystyrene spheres with different particle diameter 0 1 2 0 μm were used as representative mps and were purchased from shanghai huge biotechnology co ltd shanghai china they are identified by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir fig s2 the good matching 91 55 with standard database confirms the reliability of the commercial polystyrene spheres all spheres were produced through emulsion polymerization without excessive surface modification it just has trace amount of surface carboxyl groups 30 μmol g for stable suspension in aqueous solution such few surface groups have negligible impact on the transport of mps bradford et al 2007 the original diameters of the mps suspended in deionized water were 2 0 1 5 0 8 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm as obtained by transmission electron microscope tem measurements the coefficient of variation cv of the diameters of the mps was below 3 the microsphere suspension was shipped with trace quantities of an added surfactant to enhance their hydrophilicity and stability in the aqueous phase the hydrodynamic diameters intensity averaged and the zeta potential of the mps were measured by a zetasizer nano marlvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk with dynamic light scattering dls and electrophoretic mobility analyses respectively the morphology of the mps was determined using a tem jem 2011 jeol ltd tokyo japan operated at 200 kv based on a preestablished calibration curve of mps in aqueous phase using a ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md the concentration of the mps in the aqueous phase was determined by measuring uv absorbance at 300 nm for 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm mps and 500 nm for 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm mps respectively artificial seawater salinity 35 psu was prepared by dissolving various salts with freshwater according to kester et al 1967 the low salinity seawaters 17 5 and 3 5 psu were obtained by diluting 35 psu seawater in deionized water 2 2 column transport and retention experiments the sands were dry packed into glass columns 1 cm inner diameter 10 cm length with 50 μm stainless steel screens on both ends to contain sand each column had an average length of 9 0 0 2 cm and contained approximately 10 50 0 20 g of sand dry weight the column was tapped with a rubber mallet to induce uniform packing and then operated upward using a peristaltic pump before starting the transport experiment the column was rinsed with 100 ml background solution 0 3 5 17 5 or 35 psu seawater without mps to reach saturation at a flow of 2 20 0 10 ml min meanwhile the column was tapped with a rubber mallet to remove small air bubbles the selective column properties are shown in table s1 the transport of conservative tracer pentafluorobenzoic acid pfba is described in detail in the supplementary material the influents of the mps were temporarily prepared before the column experiments by diluting the stock suspension to 30 mg l with different background solutions 35 17 5 3 5 and 0 psu the solutions were sonicated using an ultrasonic cleaner sk3200hp kudos co ltd shanghai china for 10 min to break up possible aggregates and increase the stability of the suspension hoggan et al 2016 in the column experiments the mp sample solution was pumped into the column from a 500 ml glass beaker for 40 min then the background solution was pumped into the column for 10 min the effluent samples were collected in glass vials every 2 min nearly 1 467 pore volumes pv to determine the concentrations of the mps in the transport process the retention profiles rps of mps were obtained after the column transport experiments in brief the sand was carefully transferred in approximately 1 cm thick increments to 50 ml vials containing 25 ml of deionized water then the mixtures were shaken for 60 min to remobilize mps from the surface of the sand similar methods were used in previous studies sun et al 2015 jiang et al 2012 to directly describe the state of mps in sand columns the sand samples at the inlet and outlet of the column were collected to measure their morphology via sem the mass balance information i e the mass percentages recovered from effluent sand and total is shown in table 1 2 3 mathematical modeling of mp transport the btc of the conservative tracer pfba was simulated using the convective dispersive equation cde and the column pore water velocity and dispersivity were obtained by inverse optimization by the code cxtfit 2 1 toride et al 1995 the transport experiments of the mps were analyzed using the hydrus 1d code which allows model parameters to be inversely fitted to the experimental btc šimůnek et al 2008 the transport of mps was simulated using the cde equation with terms for one site kinetic retention kasel et al 2013 the total mass balance equation is described as follows 1 c t ρ θ s t d 2 c x 2 ν c x and 2 ρ θ s t kψc where c m l3 is the concentration of the mps in the aqueous suspension s m m are the concentrations of the mps on the sand surface t is time t x l is the distance from the column inlet ρ m l3 is the dry bulk density of the packed column θ is the porosity of the packed column d l2 t is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient v l t is the pore water velocity k is the first order attachment coefficient t 1 and ψ is the blocking factor we can express ψ as follows 3 ψ 1 s s max d c x d c β or 4 ψ max 1 s s m a x where smax m m is the maximum solid phase concentration of the mps dc l is the median diameter of the sand grains and β 0 432 is an empirical parameter that controls the shape of the colloid spatial distribution bradford et al 2003 a time and depth dependent blocking of retention sites eq 3 describes the decrease of ψ with increasing colloid mass retention kasel et al 2013 conversely enhanced colloid retention during porous medium ripening can be theoretically described using eq 4 in which ψ increases with increasing colloid mass retention šimůnek et al 2006 the btcs and rps of the mps were fitted with eqs 1 4 using the hydrus 1d code with k and smax as the fitting parameters 2 4 dlvo and xdlvo calculation to better interpret the stability of mps in seawater the classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was used to calculate the total mp mp interaction energies han et al 2017 brant 2002 in the column transport experiments xdlvo was used to calculate the interaction forces between mps and sand xia et al 2015 hoek and agarwal 2006 the detailed equations and parameters are shown in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 size dependent characterization of mps and sand in seawater the particle morphologies of the mps suspended in 35 psu seawater at different suspension times t 0 and 50 min were characterized by tem fig 1 during the 50 min interval the mps with commercially reported diameters ranging from 0 8 to 2 0 μm existed as well dispersed particles consisting of individual and separated colloids in the suspensions i e monodisperse reese et al 2000 however the small mps 0 1 0 6 μm aggregated after 50 min thereby resulting in a complex size distribution and configuration of mp colloids the phenomena were further demonstrated by dls analysis which is widely used to measure the hydrodynamic diameter ddls and size distribution of colloidal suspensions e g carbon nanotubes and titanium dioxide nanoparticles englehart et al 2016 wang et al 2012 the mean ddls in the seawater 35 psu was measured at six time points t 0 10 20 30 40 and 50 min fig 2 a the ddls of the mps 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm remained essentially unchanged during the 50 min interval average sizes of 2 50 0 15 2 20 0 03 and 0 78 0 02 μm respectively by contrast the ddls of the mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm gradually increased from 1 04 0 04 μm to 1 61 0 06 μm 0 94 0 04 μm to 1 84 0 07 μm and 0 17 0 00 μm to 0 31 0 00 μm respectively zeta ζ potential is representative of a particle s surface charge and is a key indicator of the stability of colloids in solutions variations in the ζ potential of mp colloids in the 35 psu seawater indicate size dependent dispersion and aggregation of the mps the lowest most negative ζ potentials were measured for the mps with original diameters of 0 8 and 1 5 μm 30 9 1 3 mv and 30 0 1 3 mv respectively fig 2b this indicated strong repulsive forces between mps 0 8 or 1 5 μm which are required to stabilize particle dispersion against van der waals attractive forces furthermore dlvo interaction profiles show that the mps 1 5 and 0 8 μm possessed a high energy barrier 643 kbt and 383 kbt respectively fig s3 in contrast the smaller mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm had higher ζ potentials 26 4 1 3 mv to 23 0 0 7 mv and a lower energy barrier 154 kbt to 13 kbt which are associated with the colloidal aggregation of mps godinez and darnault 2011 fig s4 shows that small mp aggregates readily settled in seawater and the concentration of suspended particles decreased rapidly which might be one of the reasons for the emergence of micro nano plastics into deep sea sediments bergmann et al 2017 it is worth noting that the 2 0 μm mps did not aggregate in seawater despite having the highest least negative ζ potential 18 9 1 7 mv and the lowest energy barrier 37 kbt figs 1 and 2b this is because colloidal stability depends not only on ζ potential and energy barrier but also the colloidal particle number li et al 2016 tripathy et al 2014 in this study mps of different sizes had the same mass concentration 30 mg l which resulted in substantially different particle number concentrations the 2 0 μm mp sample possessed the lowest particle number concentration which might be less than the critical aggregation concentration kurzhals et al 2017 variety in the salinity gradient of seawater is one of the main features of estuarine environments therefore the ζ potentials and ddls of all mps in dilute seawater 17 5 and 3 5 psu and deionized water 0 psu were systematically measured fig 2b and c these measurements showed that all mps were relatively stable in low salinity seawater 3 5 and 0 psu at 17 5 psu the mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm gradually aggregated fig 2c according to dlvo theory an increase in salinity compresses the double layer thickness and reduces the double layer repulsion bradford et al 2007 wang et al 2015 for a given size of mp a decrease in salinity caused a more negative ζ potential fig 2b this result is consistent with the observations in previous studies including the colloidal aggregation of cdse quantum dots and tio2 nanoparticles xiao et al 2017 wang et al 2015 the transport and retention of mps in porous media also depends on the physicochemical properties of the collectors i e sand such as morphology composition and surface electrical property bradford et al 2007 liang et al 2013 the sem image of the sand used in the current experiment fig s5 shows that the sand had a rough surface which offers a large attachment site xrd reveals that the characteristic peaks of the sand can be indexed to sio2 and k feldspar kalsi3o8 according to the database using mdi jade 6 0 software fig s6 the ζ potential of the sand decreased from 34 7 1 4 mv to 11 5 2 3 mv with increasing seawater salinity from 0 psu to 35 psu fig s7 negatively charged mps and sand are unfavorable for attachment during mp transport kasel et al 2013 3 2 size dependent transport and retention of mps in seawater one dimensional column experiments were conducted to assess the effect of particle size on mp transport and retention in marine sediments the preliminary experiment shows that aggregation of mps in bulk solution cannot influence the stability of the concentration of mps in the influent solution because of the blending with bump fig s8 it demonstrates that the relative concentration of mps was consistent in the column experiments first we obtained the hydrodynamic parameters including pore water velocity 2 870 cm min and dispersivity 0 352 cm2 min by the cde via cxtfit 2 1 fit from the btcs of pfba genuchten 1995 helmke et al 2005 the mass percentage recovered from the effluent meff of pfba was close to 100 table s1 and the btcs were symmetrical in shape fig s9 indicating that pfba is an ideal nonreactive tracer the btcs and rps fig 3 of the mps in the column experiments were fitted in hydrus 1d with the one site transport model sun et al 2015 kasel et al 2013 the high determination coefficient r2 0 97 indicates that the model is applicable to simulate the btcs of the larger mps table 1 the total mass balance mtot for mps in the column experiments ranged from 93 3 to 107 7 table 1 regardless of colloidal particle size the btcs of all mps reached the column outlet only shortly after the conservative tracer pfba fig 3a b fig s9 thereby indicating that size exclusion and detachment were negligible in the transport of mps in this work babakhani et al 2017 kasel et al 2013 fig 3a shows the transport of mps increased with decreasing mp size from 2 0 μm to 0 8 μm accordingly the maximum effluent concentration mec of mps increased from 0 23 to 0 44 and mass percentages recovered from the effluent meff increased from 13 6 to 41 3 table 1 furthermore the fit values of the first order attachment coefficient rate k from 0 806 to 0 243 min 1 and the maximum solid phase concentration smax from 140 50 to 6 37 mg g gradually decreased with decreasing mp size from 2 0 μm to 0 8 μm table 1 these results are consistent with the prediction of colloid filtration theory which states that colloidal retention increases with an increase in the ratio of the colloid diameter ddls to the median grain size d50 bradford et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 however xdlvo calculation fig s10 shows the repulsive energy barrier between mps 2 0 and 1 5 μm and sand were higher 270 and 296 kbt respectively than that of 0 8 μm mps 161 kbt therefore we hypothesized that the transport of larger mps 2 0 0 8 μm is physically limited by the colloid size of mps and the pore space of sand that is a straining location adjacent to grain grain contact points bradford et al 2007 when the pores are smaller than the critical size the colloids will be retained in the pores thereby causing straining therefore colloid transport may occur in other pores that are larger than the critical size bradford et al 2003 in this work the ratios of the colloid diameters 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm to the median grain size 0 450 mm were approximately 0 0059 0 0049 and 0 0017 respectively table 1 the ratio for the 2 0 μm mp was higher than the reported threshold 0 0050 for straining xu et al 2006 resulting in a significant decrease in 2 0 μm mp transport compared with 1 5 μm mp these results were further confirmed by the retention profiles fig 3c fig 3c shows that in the column inlet more 2 0 μm mp are retained at the intersection of sand surfaces whereas 1 5 and 0 8 μm mps tend to migrate for a longer distance fig 3c in addition 2 μm mps exhibit a steeper btc shape fig 3a which may be linked to a stronger blocking effect the blocking effect is due to a gradually increasing occupancy of the retention location on the sand surface with the colloidal particles bradford et al 2002 babakhani et al 2017 accordingly we observed more 2 μm mps in the effluent in fig 3b and d weak transport and strong retention of the smaller mps 0 6 0 1 μm in the columns is apparent the mec values of the mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm were 0 23 0 20 and 0 14 respectively and the meff values were 11 5 11 9 and 9 8 respectively table 1 these observations might be related to the surface charge and aggregation behaviors of the mps the ζ potentials of mps 0 6 0 1 μm ranged from 23 0 0 7 mv to 26 4 1 3 mv fig 2b thereby resulting in weaker repulsive forces between the mps and the sand the xdlvo profile fig s10 further shows that the energy barrier between mps 0 6 0 1 μm and sand decreased from 108 kbt to 16 kbt suggesting that these mps attach to the sand surface interestingly the btcs of the mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm were abnormal meaning the c c0 of the mps initially reached the mec and then gradually declined fig 3b the phenomenon is called ripening and indicates that the deposition rate of mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm increases with time babakhani et al 2017 the increase in deposition rate is caused by stronger particle particle interaction on the surface of porous media than the interactions between particle media surface bradford et al 2007 babakhani et al 2017 it can be explained in two ways first the mp aggregates 0 6 and 0 4 μm gradually increased in size in the influent solutions fig 2b before being injected into the columns which means that the aggregates formed were progressively bigger than the previous ones therefore the latter mps were larger and had more heterogeneous surfaces than the original mps the mp aggregates retained in a pore constriction will reduce the effective size clogging phenomenon of the pore and subsequently increase straining and reduce permeability at this location bradford et al 2007 hosseini and tosco 2013 second mp mp interactions may be enhanced in pores because their collision frequency will drastically increase relative to that in bulk solutions bradford et al 2007 the subsequent mps more readily adsorbed on previously formed aggregate structures the new collectors rather than directly on sand surfaces nascimento et al 2006 these factors could result in complicated flow pathways narrow pore throats and many dead end pores in the seawater saturated columns the rps of mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm typically exhibited a hyperexponential shape fig 3d suggesting retention occurred mostly in the column inlet and rapidly decreased with increasing transport distance furthermore the results are evidenced by sem images in which we observed an agglomeration of mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm at the inlet and few mps exited the columns fig s11b the ripening model provides a good description of the downward trend of btcs and the hyperexponential rps of the mps 0 4 and 0 6 μm however it fails to capture the breakthrough peak the model describes a flat plateau fig 3b possibly because we did not consider the particle interaction e g aggregation rate coefficient in eq 4 in hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 although the aggregation of 0 1 μm mps was similar to that of the 0 6 and 0 4 μm mps the btc of 0 1 μm mps showed a rising plateau similar to the btcs of 2 0 μm mp the r2 value of the 0 1 μm mp was more than 0 99 table 1 implying that the one site transport model depth dependent blocking model provides a perfect fit for the observed data and that the blocking effect was essential in the transport of 0 1 μm mps in 35 psu seawater fig s11b shows that a great deal of 0 1 μm mps aggregate on the sand surface at the inlet and outlet of the column moreover the rp shows that more 0 1 μm mps reached the outlet of the column in comparison with 0 6 and 0 4 μm mps the aggregation size of the 0 1 μm mps ranged from 0 17 0 00 μm to 0 31 0 00 μm which was considerably less than that of the 0 4 μm mps 1 84 0 07 μm and the 0 6 μm mps 1 61 0 06 μm therefore the aggregates of the 0 1 μm mps did not reduce the effective pore size or induce clogging although retained mps on the sand surface could offer new attachment sites the attachment affinity between mps might be lower than that between mp and sand babakhani et al 2017 accordingly the transport of 0 1 μm mps increased in the column over time 3 3 effect of seawater salinity on mp transport the column transport experiments were conducted by seawater with different salinities 35 17 5 and 3 5 psu and deionized water 0 psu to fully understand mp transport in marine systems especially in estuarine regions with different salinity gradients the btcs and fitting results of the mps in the porous media at different salinities are shown in fig 4 and table 1 respectively the influence of salinity on mp transport is dependent on colloidal particle size fig 4 shows that the btcs of the large mps 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm under different salinities 35 17 5 and 3 5 psu were initially similar to one another and even overlapped suggesting salinity had little impact on mp transport 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm a similar result was found in previous studies bradford et al 2007 quevedo and tufenkji 2012 quevedo and tufenkji studied the mobility of functionalized quantum dots in loamy quartz and found that mec values remained nearly constant at approximately 0 09 as the potassium chloride kcl concentration of the background solution increased from 1 mmol l to 10 mmol l quevedo and tufenkji 2012 generally mp transport depends on chemical factors such as solution ph ionic strength and colloid surface charge and physical factors such as ddls d50 and hydrodynamics bradford et al 2007 conducted an experiment on the coupling of the physical and chemical mechanisms of colloid straining in saturated porous media and demonstrated that physical factors can sometimes restrain the influence of chemical factors for instance when ddls d50 is high the btcs of mps at different ionic strengths 56 and 81 mmol l nacl are similar in shape bradford et al 2007 the effect of salinity on the transport of small mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm was significant however the meff of the 0 1 μm mp 9 8 10 9 and 62 4 increased with decreasing salinity from 35 psu to 3 5 psu table 1 for 3 5 psu the btc of the 0 1 μm mps exhibited an evident blocking profile which may be associated to the high electronegativity of both mps and sand in the 3 5 psu system fig 2b table s1 the higher negative charge leads to the expansion of the electrostatic double layer between mps and sand and between mps and mps thereby promoting the transport of mps meanwhile the mec values of the 0 6 and 0 4 μm mps increased from 0 23 to 0 46 and 0 20 to 0 50 respectively with decreasing salinity from 35 psu to 3 5 psu table 1 in addition ripening disappeared when the salinity was 3 5 and 17 5 psu and was replaced by a relatively symmetrical shape fig 4 the disappearance of the ripening effect for the 0 6 and 0 4 μm mps possibly is due to the decreased aggregation sizes 0 94 and 0 69 μm respectively of the mps in 17 5 psu fig 2c these phenomena are consistent with the experimental studies of zinc oxide zno nanoparticle transport in quartz sand jiang et al 2012 we observed flat breakthrough plateaus at a relatively low ionic strength 1 mmol l to 5 mmol l nacl solution and 0 1 mmol l to 0 5 mmol l calcium chloride cacl2 solutions and observed ripening at high ionic strength 10 mmol l to 20 mmol l nacl solution and 1 0 mmol l cacl2 solutions jiang et al 2012 therefore the ripening effect may strongly rely on chemical factors e g salinity or ionic strength the mec of all mps in deionized water 0 psu ranged from 0 96 to 0 99 and the meff values exceeded 96 0 fig 4 and table 1 complete breakthrough for all mps indicates that mp transport is independent of colloidal particle size the ζ potential of the sand in deionized water was 34 7 1 4 mv which is more negative than that in 35 psu seawater 11 5 2 3 mv moreover the xdlvo profile fig s12 shows that the energy barrier between mps and sand ranged from 218 kbt 0 1 μm mp to 4192 kbt 2 0 μm mp this suggests that stronger repulsion existed between sand and mp colloids in deionized water than in seawater this repulsion prevents mps from accessing straining sites and increases the critical straining ratio of ddls d50 shen et al 2008 therefore although ddls d50 in deionized water was similar to those in other salinities 35 17 5 and 3 5 psu we did not observe a straining effect in 0 psu 4 conclusions in the simulated seawater 35 psu the large mps 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm existed predominantly as single particles the increase of mp size from 0 8 to 2 0 μm resulted in reduced mp transport because of an increase of ddls d50 however the aggregation of mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm weakened the mobility of mps because of strong aggregation and agglomeration the transport of the 0 6 and 0 4 μm mps was dominated by ripening and clogging phenomena which led to the temporal decline in the effluent concentration of mps and the hyperexponential rps furthermore rps show that most of mps could only migrate a short distance 0 4 cm which was consistent with previous reports martin et al 2017 yu et al 2016 additionally mp aggregation or agglomeration was mainly retarded at the sand surface in the simulated estuarine 17 5 and 3 5 psu and freshwater environments 0 psu the effect of salinity on mp transport strongly depended on mp size in 17 5 psu seawater the mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm exhibited normal btcs as a result of their declining aggregation sizes whereas the btcs of the mps of other sizes were similar to that in 35 psu seawater in 3 5 psu seawater mp transport 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm was significantly enhanced but the mps 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm were retained at a high rate similar to those in 17 5 and 35 psu conditions in deionized water 0 psu we observed complete breakthroughs c c0 close to 1 for all mps and this result is likely linked to the high electronegativity and strong repulsion between the sand grain and the plastic particle the real microplastics in the environment are produced naturally during the fragmentation of plastic debris and usually possess high heterogeneity including irregular shape surface groups and fractal nature imhof et al 2016 schymanski et al 2017 therefore the transport and retention of commercial polystyrene spheres in this work would be different from that of real microplastics in the future we will further study the transport of naturally existing heterogeneous mps in porous media to predict and evaluate the potential risks of mps in marine environments appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 1

19447,a series of one dimensional column experiments were conducted to investigate the transport and retention of micron sized plastic spheres mps with diameters of 0 1 2 0 μm in seawater saturated sand in seawater with salinity of 35 psu practical salinity units the mass percentages recovered from the effluent meff of the larger mps increased from 13 6 to 41 3 as mp size decreased from 2 0 μm to 0 8 μm this occurred because of the gradual reduction of physical straining effect of mps in the pores between sands the smaller mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm showed the stronger inhibition of mps mobility with meff values of 11 5 11 9 and 9 8 respectively this was due to the lower energy barriers from 108 kbt to 16 kbt between the smaller mps and the sand surface when compared with the larger mps from 296 kbt to 161 kbt in particular the aggregation of mps 0 6 or 0 4 μm triggered a progressive decrease in mp concentration in the effluent retention experiments showed that the vertical migration distance of most mp colloids was 0 4 cm at the inlet of column for 0 6 or 0 4 μm mps the particles were concentrated over a 0 2 cm vertical distance moreover the salinity 35 3 5 psu did not affect the transport of the larger mps 2 0 0 8 μm however as seawater salinity decreased from 35 psu to 17 5 or 3 5 psu the aggregation of the smaller mps 0 6 0 1 μm was dramatically inhibited or completely prevented meanwhile ripening of the sand surface by the mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm no longer occurred by contrast all mps in deionized water 0 psu achieved complete column breakthroughs because of the strong repulsive energy barrier from 218 kbt to 4192 kbt between the mps and the sand surface consequently we find that the transport and retention of mps in sandy marine environment strongly relies on both the mp size and the salinity levels graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater microplastics transport retention marine salinity natural sea sand 1 introduction microplastics mps are anthropogenic granular contaminants that have recently attracted worldwide attention because of the potential risks they pose to marine aquatic environments hidalgo ruz et al 2012 thompson et al 2004 marine sedimentary environments such as estuarine nearshore and beach are significant sinks for mps nizzetto et al 2016 reisser et al 2014 andrady 2011 the mp samples gathered from sandy beaches are generally smaller than those from sea surfaces and seawater columns hidalgo ruz et al 2012 a recent study revealed that almost 60 of mps deposited in marine sediment were less than 11 μm in diameter bergmann et al 2017 however the underlying mechanisms for the accumulation and transport of micron sized mps in marine sandy sediment are not yet fully understood bradford et al 2002 2003 2007 conducted a series of studies on the transport of micron sized polystyrene spheres 0 45 3 0 μm in ottawa sand and glass beads and developed mechanisms and models of colloidal mp transport in subsurface environments the mobility of mps in these column experiments increased with a decrease in the ionic strength of the solution and a decrease in the ratio of the colloidal mp diameter ddls to the median grain size of sand d50 although these studies are significant and provide valuable information for assessing the environmental behavior of mps the maximum concentration of nacl background solution was close to 100 mmol l considerably lower than natural seawater salinity 35 psu nearly 500 mmol l nacl quevedo and tufenkji 2012 atkinson et al 2007 xu et al 2013 according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory high salinity has a remarkably strong effect on the surface physicochemical properties i e ζ potential and the stability of colloids bergami et al 2016 babakhani et al 2015 in seawater high salinity can induce rapid aggregation of engineered nanoparticles e g metal oxides and quantum dots and as much as a several hundred fold increase in colloid size xiao et al 2017 wang et al 2015 large aggregates z average 0 9 μm of nano sized polystyrene 40 nm in seawater also were observed bergami et al 2016 these aggregates or agglomerates could ultimately hinder transport and promote retention of the colloids e g titanium dioxide tio2 and zero valent iron fe0 in porous media godinez and darnault 2011 babakhani et al 2015 conversely the ζ potential of porous medium i e sand would become less negative in higher salt solution mitzel et al 2016 therefore a greater decrease in the energy barrier between colloids and sand leads to increased retention of colloids on the sand surface accordingly the general mechanism of mp transport in a low salt solution might not accurately describe natural seawater environments babakhani et al 2017 kamrani et al 2017 in addition the transport and retention of colloidal particles may be related to the physicochemical characteristics interface roughness and volume heterogeneity of porous media sun et al 2015 shen et al 2012 the heterogeneity of porous media significantly influences the transport behavior of colloidal particles under a variety of environmental conditions for example natural soil showed stronger transport inhibition of fullerene nanoparticles than ottawa sands because of the greater surface charge heterogeneity and surface roughness of soil zhang et al 2012 fine grain sand is a natural and essential component of marine sedimentary systems and plays a major role in influencing the interfacial interaction and mass transfer of colloids to better describe the transport of mps in marine environments natural heterogeneous sand is recommended as a column filling medium however most column transport experiments of mps have been conducted with granular porous media such as glass beads shen et al 2008 and ottawa sands mitzel et al 2016 to date only a few works have used loamy sand quevedo and tufenkji 2012 or heterogeneous quartz silica hoggan et al 2016 in this work we collected natural seabed sand from the eastern sea of china it is composed of sand grains that range in size from 0 13 to 1 53 mm the aim of this study is to evaluate the size dependent transport and retention of micron sized plastic spheres 2 0 1 5 0 8 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm in marine sandy environments at different salinity gradients 35 17 5 3 5 and 0 psu the commercial polystyrene spheres were chosen as model mps because they extensively used as containers for chemical reactions in drug delivery medical imaging and regenerative medicine yap and zhang 2007 they would be discharged into the environment from the industrial wastewater medical wastewater or municipal wastewater browne et al 2007 in recent studies these commercial polystyrene spheres have been used as model materials to explore the aggregation and transport of microplastics nanoplastics in the water environment cai et al 2018 liu et al 2018 the breakthrough curves btcs and retention profiles rps were measured and further modeled by hydrus 1d to explore the size dependent transport mechanism in seawater saturated sand we also performed dlvo and extended dlvo xdlvo interaction energy calculations to better understand the mechanisms of mp mobility the results of this work will be helpful in predicting the potential risk of micron sized plastic particles in marine depositional environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fine grained sand was collected from the seafloor of pingtan strait in fujian province in china the sand was air dried and sifted to remove large particles and impurities such as shells and other marine organism residues xia et al 2015 and then washed with 4 hcl followed by two washes of 4 h2o2 the sand was then rinsed repeatedly with deionized water until the filtrate had a neutral ph finally the clean sand was oven dried at 105 c overnight and stored for all experiments the porosity of the sand 44 88 was measured according to the method of klute 1986 the size of the sand grains d50 was 0 45 0 03 mm fig s1 as determined by laser scattering particle size distribution analysis la 960 horiba ltd kyoto japan the morphology of the sand was measured by scanning electron microscopy sem nanosem 450 fei waltham ma usa the crystalline structure of the sand was determined by x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance diffractometer bruker ma usa at 40 kv and 30 ma over the 2θ range from 10 to 80 with a step size of 0 1 s step in this work the commercial polystyrene spheres with different particle diameter 0 1 2 0 μm were used as representative mps and were purchased from shanghai huge biotechnology co ltd shanghai china they are identified by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir fig s2 the good matching 91 55 with standard database confirms the reliability of the commercial polystyrene spheres all spheres were produced through emulsion polymerization without excessive surface modification it just has trace amount of surface carboxyl groups 30 μmol g for stable suspension in aqueous solution such few surface groups have negligible impact on the transport of mps bradford et al 2007 the original diameters of the mps suspended in deionized water were 2 0 1 5 0 8 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm as obtained by transmission electron microscope tem measurements the coefficient of variation cv of the diameters of the mps was below 3 the microsphere suspension was shipped with trace quantities of an added surfactant to enhance their hydrophilicity and stability in the aqueous phase the hydrodynamic diameters intensity averaged and the zeta potential of the mps were measured by a zetasizer nano marlvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk with dynamic light scattering dls and electrophoretic mobility analyses respectively the morphology of the mps was determined using a tem jem 2011 jeol ltd tokyo japan operated at 200 kv based on a preestablished calibration curve of mps in aqueous phase using a ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md the concentration of the mps in the aqueous phase was determined by measuring uv absorbance at 300 nm for 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm mps and 500 nm for 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm mps respectively artificial seawater salinity 35 psu was prepared by dissolving various salts with freshwater according to kester et al 1967 the low salinity seawaters 17 5 and 3 5 psu were obtained by diluting 35 psu seawater in deionized water 2 2 column transport and retention experiments the sands were dry packed into glass columns 1 cm inner diameter 10 cm length with 50 μm stainless steel screens on both ends to contain sand each column had an average length of 9 0 0 2 cm and contained approximately 10 50 0 20 g of sand dry weight the column was tapped with a rubber mallet to induce uniform packing and then operated upward using a peristaltic pump before starting the transport experiment the column was rinsed with 100 ml background solution 0 3 5 17 5 or 35 psu seawater without mps to reach saturation at a flow of 2 20 0 10 ml min meanwhile the column was tapped with a rubber mallet to remove small air bubbles the selective column properties are shown in table s1 the transport of conservative tracer pentafluorobenzoic acid pfba is described in detail in the supplementary material the influents of the mps were temporarily prepared before the column experiments by diluting the stock suspension to 30 mg l with different background solutions 35 17 5 3 5 and 0 psu the solutions were sonicated using an ultrasonic cleaner sk3200hp kudos co ltd shanghai china for 10 min to break up possible aggregates and increase the stability of the suspension hoggan et al 2016 in the column experiments the mp sample solution was pumped into the column from a 500 ml glass beaker for 40 min then the background solution was pumped into the column for 10 min the effluent samples were collected in glass vials every 2 min nearly 1 467 pore volumes pv to determine the concentrations of the mps in the transport process the retention profiles rps of mps were obtained after the column transport experiments in brief the sand was carefully transferred in approximately 1 cm thick increments to 50 ml vials containing 25 ml of deionized water then the mixtures were shaken for 60 min to remobilize mps from the surface of the sand similar methods were used in previous studies sun et al 2015 jiang et al 2012 to directly describe the state of mps in sand columns the sand samples at the inlet and outlet of the column were collected to measure their morphology via sem the mass balance information i e the mass percentages recovered from effluent sand and total is shown in table 1 2 3 mathematical modeling of mp transport the btc of the conservative tracer pfba was simulated using the convective dispersive equation cde and the column pore water velocity and dispersivity were obtained by inverse optimization by the code cxtfit 2 1 toride et al 1995 the transport experiments of the mps were analyzed using the hydrus 1d code which allows model parameters to be inversely fitted to the experimental btc šimůnek et al 2008 the transport of mps was simulated using the cde equation with terms for one site kinetic retention kasel et al 2013 the total mass balance equation is described as follows 1 c t ρ θ s t d 2 c x 2 ν c x and 2 ρ θ s t kψc where c m l3 is the concentration of the mps in the aqueous suspension s m m are the concentrations of the mps on the sand surface t is time t x l is the distance from the column inlet ρ m l3 is the dry bulk density of the packed column θ is the porosity of the packed column d l2 t is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient v l t is the pore water velocity k is the first order attachment coefficient t 1 and ψ is the blocking factor we can express ψ as follows 3 ψ 1 s s max d c x d c β or 4 ψ max 1 s s m a x where smax m m is the maximum solid phase concentration of the mps dc l is the median diameter of the sand grains and β 0 432 is an empirical parameter that controls the shape of the colloid spatial distribution bradford et al 2003 a time and depth dependent blocking of retention sites eq 3 describes the decrease of ψ with increasing colloid mass retention kasel et al 2013 conversely enhanced colloid retention during porous medium ripening can be theoretically described using eq 4 in which ψ increases with increasing colloid mass retention šimůnek et al 2006 the btcs and rps of the mps were fitted with eqs 1 4 using the hydrus 1d code with k and smax as the fitting parameters 2 4 dlvo and xdlvo calculation to better interpret the stability of mps in seawater the classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was used to calculate the total mp mp interaction energies han et al 2017 brant 2002 in the column transport experiments xdlvo was used to calculate the interaction forces between mps and sand xia et al 2015 hoek and agarwal 2006 the detailed equations and parameters are shown in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 size dependent characterization of mps and sand in seawater the particle morphologies of the mps suspended in 35 psu seawater at different suspension times t 0 and 50 min were characterized by tem fig 1 during the 50 min interval the mps with commercially reported diameters ranging from 0 8 to 2 0 μm existed as well dispersed particles consisting of individual and separated colloids in the suspensions i e monodisperse reese et al 2000 however the small mps 0 1 0 6 μm aggregated after 50 min thereby resulting in a complex size distribution and configuration of mp colloids the phenomena were further demonstrated by dls analysis which is widely used to measure the hydrodynamic diameter ddls and size distribution of colloidal suspensions e g carbon nanotubes and titanium dioxide nanoparticles englehart et al 2016 wang et al 2012 the mean ddls in the seawater 35 psu was measured at six time points t 0 10 20 30 40 and 50 min fig 2 a the ddls of the mps 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm remained essentially unchanged during the 50 min interval average sizes of 2 50 0 15 2 20 0 03 and 0 78 0 02 μm respectively by contrast the ddls of the mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm gradually increased from 1 04 0 04 μm to 1 61 0 06 μm 0 94 0 04 μm to 1 84 0 07 μm and 0 17 0 00 μm to 0 31 0 00 μm respectively zeta ζ potential is representative of a particle s surface charge and is a key indicator of the stability of colloids in solutions variations in the ζ potential of mp colloids in the 35 psu seawater indicate size dependent dispersion and aggregation of the mps the lowest most negative ζ potentials were measured for the mps with original diameters of 0 8 and 1 5 μm 30 9 1 3 mv and 30 0 1 3 mv respectively fig 2b this indicated strong repulsive forces between mps 0 8 or 1 5 μm which are required to stabilize particle dispersion against van der waals attractive forces furthermore dlvo interaction profiles show that the mps 1 5 and 0 8 μm possessed a high energy barrier 643 kbt and 383 kbt respectively fig s3 in contrast the smaller mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm had higher ζ potentials 26 4 1 3 mv to 23 0 0 7 mv and a lower energy barrier 154 kbt to 13 kbt which are associated with the colloidal aggregation of mps godinez and darnault 2011 fig s4 shows that small mp aggregates readily settled in seawater and the concentration of suspended particles decreased rapidly which might be one of the reasons for the emergence of micro nano plastics into deep sea sediments bergmann et al 2017 it is worth noting that the 2 0 μm mps did not aggregate in seawater despite having the highest least negative ζ potential 18 9 1 7 mv and the lowest energy barrier 37 kbt figs 1 and 2b this is because colloidal stability depends not only on ζ potential and energy barrier but also the colloidal particle number li et al 2016 tripathy et al 2014 in this study mps of different sizes had the same mass concentration 30 mg l which resulted in substantially different particle number concentrations the 2 0 μm mp sample possessed the lowest particle number concentration which might be less than the critical aggregation concentration kurzhals et al 2017 variety in the salinity gradient of seawater is one of the main features of estuarine environments therefore the ζ potentials and ddls of all mps in dilute seawater 17 5 and 3 5 psu and deionized water 0 psu were systematically measured fig 2b and c these measurements showed that all mps were relatively stable in low salinity seawater 3 5 and 0 psu at 17 5 psu the mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm gradually aggregated fig 2c according to dlvo theory an increase in salinity compresses the double layer thickness and reduces the double layer repulsion bradford et al 2007 wang et al 2015 for a given size of mp a decrease in salinity caused a more negative ζ potential fig 2b this result is consistent with the observations in previous studies including the colloidal aggregation of cdse quantum dots and tio2 nanoparticles xiao et al 2017 wang et al 2015 the transport and retention of mps in porous media also depends on the physicochemical properties of the collectors i e sand such as morphology composition and surface electrical property bradford et al 2007 liang et al 2013 the sem image of the sand used in the current experiment fig s5 shows that the sand had a rough surface which offers a large attachment site xrd reveals that the characteristic peaks of the sand can be indexed to sio2 and k feldspar kalsi3o8 according to the database using mdi jade 6 0 software fig s6 the ζ potential of the sand decreased from 34 7 1 4 mv to 11 5 2 3 mv with increasing seawater salinity from 0 psu to 35 psu fig s7 negatively charged mps and sand are unfavorable for attachment during mp transport kasel et al 2013 3 2 size dependent transport and retention of mps in seawater one dimensional column experiments were conducted to assess the effect of particle size on mp transport and retention in marine sediments the preliminary experiment shows that aggregation of mps in bulk solution cannot influence the stability of the concentration of mps in the influent solution because of the blending with bump fig s8 it demonstrates that the relative concentration of mps was consistent in the column experiments first we obtained the hydrodynamic parameters including pore water velocity 2 870 cm min and dispersivity 0 352 cm2 min by the cde via cxtfit 2 1 fit from the btcs of pfba genuchten 1995 helmke et al 2005 the mass percentage recovered from the effluent meff of pfba was close to 100 table s1 and the btcs were symmetrical in shape fig s9 indicating that pfba is an ideal nonreactive tracer the btcs and rps fig 3 of the mps in the column experiments were fitted in hydrus 1d with the one site transport model sun et al 2015 kasel et al 2013 the high determination coefficient r2 0 97 indicates that the model is applicable to simulate the btcs of the larger mps table 1 the total mass balance mtot for mps in the column experiments ranged from 93 3 to 107 7 table 1 regardless of colloidal particle size the btcs of all mps reached the column outlet only shortly after the conservative tracer pfba fig 3a b fig s9 thereby indicating that size exclusion and detachment were negligible in the transport of mps in this work babakhani et al 2017 kasel et al 2013 fig 3a shows the transport of mps increased with decreasing mp size from 2 0 μm to 0 8 μm accordingly the maximum effluent concentration mec of mps increased from 0 23 to 0 44 and mass percentages recovered from the effluent meff increased from 13 6 to 41 3 table 1 furthermore the fit values of the first order attachment coefficient rate k from 0 806 to 0 243 min 1 and the maximum solid phase concentration smax from 140 50 to 6 37 mg g gradually decreased with decreasing mp size from 2 0 μm to 0 8 μm table 1 these results are consistent with the prediction of colloid filtration theory which states that colloidal retention increases with an increase in the ratio of the colloid diameter ddls to the median grain size d50 bradford et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 however xdlvo calculation fig s10 shows the repulsive energy barrier between mps 2 0 and 1 5 μm and sand were higher 270 and 296 kbt respectively than that of 0 8 μm mps 161 kbt therefore we hypothesized that the transport of larger mps 2 0 0 8 μm is physically limited by the colloid size of mps and the pore space of sand that is a straining location adjacent to grain grain contact points bradford et al 2007 when the pores are smaller than the critical size the colloids will be retained in the pores thereby causing straining therefore colloid transport may occur in other pores that are larger than the critical size bradford et al 2003 in this work the ratios of the colloid diameters 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm to the median grain size 0 450 mm were approximately 0 0059 0 0049 and 0 0017 respectively table 1 the ratio for the 2 0 μm mp was higher than the reported threshold 0 0050 for straining xu et al 2006 resulting in a significant decrease in 2 0 μm mp transport compared with 1 5 μm mp these results were further confirmed by the retention profiles fig 3c fig 3c shows that in the column inlet more 2 0 μm mp are retained at the intersection of sand surfaces whereas 1 5 and 0 8 μm mps tend to migrate for a longer distance fig 3c in addition 2 μm mps exhibit a steeper btc shape fig 3a which may be linked to a stronger blocking effect the blocking effect is due to a gradually increasing occupancy of the retention location on the sand surface with the colloidal particles bradford et al 2002 babakhani et al 2017 accordingly we observed more 2 μm mps in the effluent in fig 3b and d weak transport and strong retention of the smaller mps 0 6 0 1 μm in the columns is apparent the mec values of the mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm were 0 23 0 20 and 0 14 respectively and the meff values were 11 5 11 9 and 9 8 respectively table 1 these observations might be related to the surface charge and aggregation behaviors of the mps the ζ potentials of mps 0 6 0 1 μm ranged from 23 0 0 7 mv to 26 4 1 3 mv fig 2b thereby resulting in weaker repulsive forces between the mps and the sand the xdlvo profile fig s10 further shows that the energy barrier between mps 0 6 0 1 μm and sand decreased from 108 kbt to 16 kbt suggesting that these mps attach to the sand surface interestingly the btcs of the mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm were abnormal meaning the c c0 of the mps initially reached the mec and then gradually declined fig 3b the phenomenon is called ripening and indicates that the deposition rate of mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm increases with time babakhani et al 2017 the increase in deposition rate is caused by stronger particle particle interaction on the surface of porous media than the interactions between particle media surface bradford et al 2007 babakhani et al 2017 it can be explained in two ways first the mp aggregates 0 6 and 0 4 μm gradually increased in size in the influent solutions fig 2b before being injected into the columns which means that the aggregates formed were progressively bigger than the previous ones therefore the latter mps were larger and had more heterogeneous surfaces than the original mps the mp aggregates retained in a pore constriction will reduce the effective size clogging phenomenon of the pore and subsequently increase straining and reduce permeability at this location bradford et al 2007 hosseini and tosco 2013 second mp mp interactions may be enhanced in pores because their collision frequency will drastically increase relative to that in bulk solutions bradford et al 2007 the subsequent mps more readily adsorbed on previously formed aggregate structures the new collectors rather than directly on sand surfaces nascimento et al 2006 these factors could result in complicated flow pathways narrow pore throats and many dead end pores in the seawater saturated columns the rps of mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm typically exhibited a hyperexponential shape fig 3d suggesting retention occurred mostly in the column inlet and rapidly decreased with increasing transport distance furthermore the results are evidenced by sem images in which we observed an agglomeration of mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm at the inlet and few mps exited the columns fig s11b the ripening model provides a good description of the downward trend of btcs and the hyperexponential rps of the mps 0 4 and 0 6 μm however it fails to capture the breakthrough peak the model describes a flat plateau fig 3b possibly because we did not consider the particle interaction e g aggregation rate coefficient in eq 4 in hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 although the aggregation of 0 1 μm mps was similar to that of the 0 6 and 0 4 μm mps the btc of 0 1 μm mps showed a rising plateau similar to the btcs of 2 0 μm mp the r2 value of the 0 1 μm mp was more than 0 99 table 1 implying that the one site transport model depth dependent blocking model provides a perfect fit for the observed data and that the blocking effect was essential in the transport of 0 1 μm mps in 35 psu seawater fig s11b shows that a great deal of 0 1 μm mps aggregate on the sand surface at the inlet and outlet of the column moreover the rp shows that more 0 1 μm mps reached the outlet of the column in comparison with 0 6 and 0 4 μm mps the aggregation size of the 0 1 μm mps ranged from 0 17 0 00 μm to 0 31 0 00 μm which was considerably less than that of the 0 4 μm mps 1 84 0 07 μm and the 0 6 μm mps 1 61 0 06 μm therefore the aggregates of the 0 1 μm mps did not reduce the effective pore size or induce clogging although retained mps on the sand surface could offer new attachment sites the attachment affinity between mps might be lower than that between mp and sand babakhani et al 2017 accordingly the transport of 0 1 μm mps increased in the column over time 3 3 effect of seawater salinity on mp transport the column transport experiments were conducted by seawater with different salinities 35 17 5 and 3 5 psu and deionized water 0 psu to fully understand mp transport in marine systems especially in estuarine regions with different salinity gradients the btcs and fitting results of the mps in the porous media at different salinities are shown in fig 4 and table 1 respectively the influence of salinity on mp transport is dependent on colloidal particle size fig 4 shows that the btcs of the large mps 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm under different salinities 35 17 5 and 3 5 psu were initially similar to one another and even overlapped suggesting salinity had little impact on mp transport 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm a similar result was found in previous studies bradford et al 2007 quevedo and tufenkji 2012 quevedo and tufenkji studied the mobility of functionalized quantum dots in loamy quartz and found that mec values remained nearly constant at approximately 0 09 as the potassium chloride kcl concentration of the background solution increased from 1 mmol l to 10 mmol l quevedo and tufenkji 2012 generally mp transport depends on chemical factors such as solution ph ionic strength and colloid surface charge and physical factors such as ddls d50 and hydrodynamics bradford et al 2007 conducted an experiment on the coupling of the physical and chemical mechanisms of colloid straining in saturated porous media and demonstrated that physical factors can sometimes restrain the influence of chemical factors for instance when ddls d50 is high the btcs of mps at different ionic strengths 56 and 81 mmol l nacl are similar in shape bradford et al 2007 the effect of salinity on the transport of small mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm was significant however the meff of the 0 1 μm mp 9 8 10 9 and 62 4 increased with decreasing salinity from 35 psu to 3 5 psu table 1 for 3 5 psu the btc of the 0 1 μm mps exhibited an evident blocking profile which may be associated to the high electronegativity of both mps and sand in the 3 5 psu system fig 2b table s1 the higher negative charge leads to the expansion of the electrostatic double layer between mps and sand and between mps and mps thereby promoting the transport of mps meanwhile the mec values of the 0 6 and 0 4 μm mps increased from 0 23 to 0 46 and 0 20 to 0 50 respectively with decreasing salinity from 35 psu to 3 5 psu table 1 in addition ripening disappeared when the salinity was 3 5 and 17 5 psu and was replaced by a relatively symmetrical shape fig 4 the disappearance of the ripening effect for the 0 6 and 0 4 μm mps possibly is due to the decreased aggregation sizes 0 94 and 0 69 μm respectively of the mps in 17 5 psu fig 2c these phenomena are consistent with the experimental studies of zinc oxide zno nanoparticle transport in quartz sand jiang et al 2012 we observed flat breakthrough plateaus at a relatively low ionic strength 1 mmol l to 5 mmol l nacl solution and 0 1 mmol l to 0 5 mmol l calcium chloride cacl2 solutions and observed ripening at high ionic strength 10 mmol l to 20 mmol l nacl solution and 1 0 mmol l cacl2 solutions jiang et al 2012 therefore the ripening effect may strongly rely on chemical factors e g salinity or ionic strength the mec of all mps in deionized water 0 psu ranged from 0 96 to 0 99 and the meff values exceeded 96 0 fig 4 and table 1 complete breakthrough for all mps indicates that mp transport is independent of colloidal particle size the ζ potential of the sand in deionized water was 34 7 1 4 mv which is more negative than that in 35 psu seawater 11 5 2 3 mv moreover the xdlvo profile fig s12 shows that the energy barrier between mps and sand ranged from 218 kbt 0 1 μm mp to 4192 kbt 2 0 μm mp this suggests that stronger repulsion existed between sand and mp colloids in deionized water than in seawater this repulsion prevents mps from accessing straining sites and increases the critical straining ratio of ddls d50 shen et al 2008 therefore although ddls d50 in deionized water was similar to those in other salinities 35 17 5 and 3 5 psu we did not observe a straining effect in 0 psu 4 conclusions in the simulated seawater 35 psu the large mps 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm existed predominantly as single particles the increase of mp size from 0 8 to 2 0 μm resulted in reduced mp transport because of an increase of ddls d50 however the aggregation of mps 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm weakened the mobility of mps because of strong aggregation and agglomeration the transport of the 0 6 and 0 4 μm mps was dominated by ripening and clogging phenomena which led to the temporal decline in the effluent concentration of mps and the hyperexponential rps furthermore rps show that most of mps could only migrate a short distance 0 4 cm which was consistent with previous reports martin et al 2017 yu et al 2016 additionally mp aggregation or agglomeration was mainly retarded at the sand surface in the simulated estuarine 17 5 and 3 5 psu and freshwater environments 0 psu the effect of salinity on mp transport strongly depended on mp size in 17 5 psu seawater the mps 0 6 and 0 4 μm exhibited normal btcs as a result of their declining aggregation sizes whereas the btcs of the mps of other sizes were similar to that in 35 psu seawater in 3 5 psu seawater mp transport 0 6 0 4 and 0 1 μm was significantly enhanced but the mps 2 0 1 5 and 0 8 μm were retained at a high rate similar to those in 17 5 and 35 psu conditions in deionized water 0 psu we observed complete breakthroughs c c0 close to 1 for all mps and this result is likely linked to the high electronegativity and strong repulsion between the sand grain and the plastic particle the real microplastics in the environment are produced naturally during the fragmentation of plastic debris and usually possess high heterogeneity including irregular shape surface groups and fractal nature imhof et al 2016 schymanski et al 2017 therefore the transport and retention of commercial polystyrene spheres in this work would be different from that of real microplastics in the future we will further study the transport of naturally existing heterogeneous mps in porous media to predict and evaluate the potential risks of mps in marine environments appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 1

19448,sanitation systems based on source separation and valorisation of human urine can improve the environmental sustainability of wastewater management yet the social acceptability of such new resource oriented sanitation practices have not been assessed systematically we attempt to address this research gap by reporting the findings of a survey conducted at a south indian university that evaluated support for urine recycling among 1252 indian consumers we place our findings in the context of the theory of planned behaviour quantify consumer attitude to urine recycling through an exploratory numerical approach and identify explanatory factors that shape consumer beliefs and perceptions overall a moderately positive attitude was observed 68 stated human urine should not be disposed but recycled 55 considered it as fertiliser but only 44 would consume food grown using it while 65 believed using urine as crop fertiliser could pose a health risk majority 80 believed it could be treated so as to not pose a risk the respondents willingness to consume urine fertilised food was found to be strongly influenced by their willingness to pay consumer environmental attitudes as evaluated using the new ecological paradigm scale did not influence their attitude towards urine recycling behaviour we thus believe that simply appealing to people s environmental sensitivities is not enough for introducing environmentally friendly technologies like urine recycling but that more targeted marketing messages are needed we find sufficient support among our surveyed consumers for urine recycling but highlight that further research is needed to identify what information and agency will help translate positive attitudes into action and behaviour graphical abstract image 1 keywords survey ecological sanitation new ecological paradigm source separation theory of planned behaviour wastewater 1 introduction in the sanitation sector there is growing recognition that conventional systems in place today will not be able to fulfil the world s sustainability mandate guest et al 2009 several experts are convinced that the sector is in urgent need for a paradigm shift that transforms sanitation planning functioning and management by placing more emphasis on recycling human wastes langergraber and muellegger 2005 guest et al 2009 larsen et al 2013 over the past few decades new sanitation systems based on source separation and valorisation of various domestic wastewater fractions have started to attract research attention lens et al 2001 vinnerås and jönsson 2002

skambraks et al 2017 in many places source separated toilet wastes are applied to soil as crop fertiliser jönsson et al 2004 langergraber and muellegger 2005 it has been however been suggested that people s perceptions and willingness to change their sanitation behaviour can be significantly affected by culture traditions and beliefs rosenquist 2005 jewitt 2011a 2011b nawab et al 2006 simha et al 2017 what people think of human excreta and how they manage it varies both spatially and temporally rosenquist 2005 jewitt 2011b jewitt 2011a p 765 in fact suggests that deeply rooted emotions and taboos associated with human waste often occlude rational responses to its disposal handling and reuse people s sanitation outlooks and behaviours do not rely solely on apparent logic or scientific knowledge but may be affected by socio demographical cultural and environmental factors black and fawcett 2010 these factors might include age gender religion education income occupation and surrounding environment as well as people s necessities circumstances and aspirations there is evidence that interventions aimed at improving sanitation tend to fail if they do not consider this social complexity black and fawcett 2010 new sanitation systems based on urine diversion require wide behavioural changes such as users familiarising themselves with diverting type toilets at home and elsewhere farmers adopting to new crop fertilisation practices and even consumers who are to purchase food grown using recycled toilet wastes as fertiliser for an overview see lienert 2013 sociological studies investigating people s willingness to accept such new sanitation practices have been performed across different settings pahl wostl et al 2003 nawab et al 2006 lienert and larsen 2009 mariwah and drangert 2011 lamichhane and babcock 2013 okem et al 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 simha et al 2017 findings from these studies suggest that a myriad of factors interact and determine whether people communities think favourably of source separation technologies if they intend to change their sanitation behaviour and what would motivate or discourage them to do so in some studies surveyed populations with common attributes were homogenous in their stated attitudes and beliefs for instance mariwah and drangert 2011 found that 84 of the peri urban residents they surveyed in ghana at an agricultural community with little variation in demographic characteristics agreed that human excreta is a waste suitable only for disposal perhaps similarly but with contrasting results lienert and larsen s 2009 review of seven european countries revealed that a majority of the respondents liked the idea of using urine as a fertiliser situational and socio economic aspects of sanitation behaviour are also more evident in some studies than others for example a stark contrast in willingness to pay for urine diverting toilets was reported between residents in pakistan nawab et al 2006 and the united states lamichhane and babcock 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 based on such findings in literature it can be suggested that different attitudes to excreta urine recycling exist in different settings this is in line with jewitt s 2011a b assertion of the existence of spatial cultural differences in sanitation practices and also in how taboos surrounding excreta are conceptualised if that is indeed the case findings of perceptions and attitudes to new sanitation systems from a particular setting may not hold true in another hence further sociological research will be necessary to explore whether new sanitation practices will be socially sustainable in different places and to support sanitation planning and decision making with evidence based case studies in 2014 the government of india launched the swachh bharat mission sbm its flagship campaign to promote cleanliness and achieve universal sanitation coverage the campaign s aim is to eradicate open defecation which according to the who and unicef 2017 was practiced by 40 of the population as estimated in 2015 unlike india s past sanitation schemes e g nirmal bharat abhiyan sbm has a strong focus on collective behavioural change it encourages people to adopt and use cost effective and appropriate technologies for ecologically safe and sustainable sanitation and develop community managed systems for solid and liquid waste management ministry of drinking water and sanitation 2017 however as tran 2017 observed in a case study that evaluated the implementation of sbm in india s punjab region understanding people s expectations about what constitutes appropriate behaviour e g whether or not open defecation carries stigma and finding ways to change such expectations is key to sbm s success the separate collection and recycling of human urine using urine diverting toilets is one way of promoting ecologically sound sanitation but as discussed above requires significant changes to people s sanitation behaviour hence the objective in this study was to understand whether urine recycling will find support among consumers in india to survey indian consumers this study elected to sample a university community in south india vit university following work done elsewhere lamichhane and babcock 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 universities offer an interesting platform to evaluate people s behavioural intentions since they have been touted as experimental sites for introducing sustainable technologies evans and karvonen 2010 such as urine recycling universities also tend to shape how a country s youth population could behave as local and global citizens tuncer 2008 this aspect is perhaps more significant to india since it is home to the world s largest youth population according to the latest census the youth 15 34 years population of the country stood at 423 million people central statistics office 2017 the motivation to report on consumer behavioural intentions was two fold firstly to the authors best knowledge this is the first study to investigate what indian consumers think of using human urine as crop fertiliser secondly the results of the present investigation complement those obtained by the authors earlier where the attitudes of south indian farmers to new crop fertilisation practices was investigated simha et al 2017 since this study was performed in a university setting the results do not represent the urine recycling intentions of all indian consumers but may be indicative of intentions at other university communities in india findings from this study add to the existing literature on socio cultural aspects of new sanitation systems and also the socio technical discourse surrounding environmental technologies in emerging economies 2 methodology 2 1 survey instrument the survey was conducted at the vit university campus located in vellore south india all 28 000 people at the university staff students researchers and faculty were invited to voluntarily respond to an online questionnaire that collected anonymous responses using google forms an email with a link to the survey www goo gl forms h02ivnylp5a7xspn2 was sent using the university s electronic mailing list and made available for a period of four weeks reminder emails were sent at the beginning of weeks 2 3 and 4 the survey instrument and the study methodology were approved by the university s research committee the survey requested single responses to closed ended questions that were either binary yes no or multiple choice type the questionnaire comprised of three sections supplementary information after seeking participant consent demographic information including age gender affiliation religion and caste was requested the next section sought respondent perceptions of urine cow human as a fertiliser 5 questions their willingness to consume food grown using urine 4 questions and whether they perceived any risks associated with the use of urine as fertiliser 4 questions the revised new ecological paradigm nep scale was used to assess environmental attitudes of the respondents dunlap et al 2000 participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement with 15 nep statements on a 5 point likert like scale in the online form the statements were presented as three matrix type questions each comprising of five randomly ordered statements following ogunbode 2013 the wording of the nep statements was slightly modified 2 2 data and statistical analysis in total the survey registered 1252 responses giving a response rate of 4 5 based on the size of the sample n 1252 and the population n 28000 with 99 confidence level the margin of error is estimated to be 5 the collected survey data was analysed by assigning all positive responses a numerical value of 2 and negative responses a value of 1 so that the mean 1 μ 2 depicted the probability of the response being positive lamichhane and babcock 2013 the influence of demographic variables on respondent perceptions to urine recycling was assessed through chi squared test χ 2 and one way analysis of variance anova differences between categories of variables were considered significant if p value was 0 05 to analyse consumer environmental attitudes individual responses to the nep statements were coded as 1 to 5 where 1 indicated strong disagreement and 5 indicated strong agreement dunlap et al 2000 the seven even numbered nep statements were reverse coded since disagreement with the statements indicated a pro ecological worldview the overall nep rating 1 μ nep 5 of the dataset was calculated as the average of all responses to the individual scale items ogunbode 2013 an overall nep rating of 3 was considered the boundary between pro ecological and anthropocentric worldviews van petegem and blieck 2006 following dunlap et al 2000 and wilhelm rechmann et al 2014 cronbach s alpha α and mcdonald s omega ω tests were performed coefficients α and ω widely used measures of internal consistency reliability were calculated to see if survey participants were internally consistent in their responses to the statements in the nep scale using hierarchical factor analysis two forms of the omega coefficient hierarchical omega ω h and total omega ω t were estimated to analyse the nep scale and determine its latent structure exploratory factor analysis was carried out in addition principal component analysis with varimax rotation was performed to test the dimensionality of the scale against five hypothesised facets or worldviews 1 reality of limits to growth 2 anti anthropocentrism 3 fragility of nature s balance 4 rejection of human exemptionalism belief that humans are exempt from environmental forces and 5 the possibility of an ecocrisis dunlap et al 2000 ogunbode 2013 to explore whether respondent environmental views affected their attitude to urine recycling and if these views were influenced by socio demographical factors respondents with mean nep rating of 3 and 3 were categorised as likely to endorse pro environmental and anti environmental worldviews respectively 2 3 theory of planned behaviour azjen s 2002 theory of planned behaviour tpb was used in this study to investigate consumer behavioural intentions to recycle human urine the tpb is a well validated social cognitive model to predict people s intentions and behaviour armitage and conner 2001 according to the tpb one s behaviour to act is guided principally by one s intention which in turn depends on three aspects attitude towards the behaviour the degree of a person s favourable or unfavourable evaluation or appraisal of the behaviour in question fishbein and ajzen 1975 the subjective norm the perceived social pressure to perform or not to perform the behaviour ajzen 1991 and perceived behavioural control people s perception of ease or difficulty in performing the behaviour of interest ajzen 2002 if that is the case in line with the tpb consumers who have a positive attitude to urine recycling and believe there is normative support for using it as a crop fertiliser and feel it is easy for them to engage in urine recycling should have strong intentions to carry out the behaviour fig 1 2 4 attitude towards the behaviour consumer attitudes to urine recycling were evaluated according to the following procedure three aspects were taken into consideration i perception of human urine as a crop fertiliser ii willingness to consume food grown using human urine and iii whether respondents felt urine should be disposed and never recycled the weighted arithmetic mean of participant responses r 1 or 2 to the three aspects were assumed to represent the individual attitude score eq 1 whereas overall attitude score of the university community was estimated as the mean of attitude scores of all the respondents 1 c o n s u m e r a t t i t u d e s c o r e 1 n i 1 n w i r i initially all three aspects were considered to be of equal importance w 1 a mean attitude score of 1 5 was taken to represent a positive attitude while those 1 5 represented a negative attitude on the other hand segregated consumer attitude score was defined in this study as the mean attitude of respondents belonging to a select category of a demographic variable e g the mean attitude of all christians within the demographic variable religion this was calculated using eq 2 where μ is the mean response of all the segregated groups of consumers and n is the number of aspects 2 s e g r e g a t e d c o n s u m e r a t t i t u d e s c o r e 1 n i 1 n w i μ i since an exploratory approach for estimating consumer attitudes was used the overall attitude and segregated attitudes scores were recalculated by varying the weights used in eq 1 and eq 2 firstly more importance was assigned to respondent s willingness to eat urine fertilised food since this could be a stronger indication of consumer behaviour than whether or not they believed in urine s fertilising potential secondly we considered the scenario where more significance is assigned to willingness to consume and respondent beliefs on whether urine should never be recycled all statistical analyses were performed using r v 3 3 4 2 5 subjective norm according to bikhcahndani et al 1998 people tend to make similar choices when faced with similar action alternatives payoffs and information something that could lead to convergent behaviour according to the authors moreover frith and frith 2006 suggest that people tend to predict what others would do in a given situation and that their own behaviour is influenced by observing the actions of others hence in order to capture the subject norm the respondents were asked to indicate what they believed their friends colleagues thought about urine recycling in one of the surveys questions que 15 2 6 perceived behavioural control human urine collected in source separating sanitation systems can be cross contaminated with faeces which could introduce transmission routes of infectious diseases when urine is used as fertiliser schönning et al 2002 also urine and urine based fertilisers can contain many micropollutants from human metabolism pharmaceuticals hormones larsen et al 2004 hence following mariwah and drangert 2011 behavioural control was captured by participant responses to questions 17 21 in the survey where they were asked to indicate perceived health risks pathogens and pharmaceuticals against using urine as a crop fertiliser in addition consumer willingness to pay for urine fertilised food was sought this was done because the cost aspect of new systems and practices if often perceived by citizens as a risk cf pahl wostl et al 2003 ishii and boyer 2016 and thus could point to potential inability to perform urine recycling behaviour 3 results 3 1 consumer attitudes to urine recycling individual consumer attitude scores were found to vary considerably the overall attitude score of the dataset n 1252 was 1 56 0 37 eq 1 this suggested that a moderately positive attitude to human urine recycling existed among consumers surveyed at vit university table 1 segregated attitudes scores of the consumers based on different categories of the demographic variables suggested that a there was a positive correlation between age categories 17 19 to 41 50 and attitude r 2 0 98 as acceptance increased with age b female respondents were slightly more negative than their male counterparts 1 53 vs 1 57 p 0 01 c religious and caste demographics did not influence consumer attitudes except among those who identified themselves as jains n 33 buddhists n 7 and scheduled tribes n 8 fig 2 when different weights were assigned to the three aspects assumed to determine consumer attitude the overall attitude score changed albeit not considerably when more importance was assigned to the willingness of respondents to consume food grown using human urine as fertiliser the overall score decreased from 1 56 to 1 53 when more importance was given to willingness to consume and whether respondents believed urine should be recycled and not disposed there was no change in the attitude as against the original attitude of the dataset 3 1 1 attitude towards urine recycling behaviour environmental outlook the mean nep rating of the dataset was 3 32 indicating that the respondents were moderately environmentally conscious and in favour of a pro ecological worldview table 2 in particular the majority endorsed the possibility of an ecocrisis as well as anti anthropocentric views but the acceptance of the view that humankind may be approaching its limits to growth was not high table s4 cronbach s alpha 0 α 1 an indicator of internal consistency in the nep scale was calculated as 0 55 which according to nunnally 1967 is acceptable reliability for preliminary research mcdonald s omega was estimated as hierarchical omega ω h 0 57 and total omega 0 79 which also suggested that the nep scale constituted an internally consistent measure the principal component analysis revealed that one major factor explained 24 8 of the total variance in the dataset the anova revealed that there were no significant difference between the mean nep ratings of the different categories of demographic variables table 3 the only exception to this was the variation displayed by different age categories as it was observed that the younger the respondent the more pro ecological the stated belief p 0 05 it has been suggested that environmental concern diffuses through the public over time and thus younger people who are less attached to traditional outlooks may be more supportive of an ecological worldview jones and dunlap 1992 dunlap et al 2000 complementary work in support of this hypothesis has however not been carried out the environmental outlook of the respondents did not significantly influence their attitude to urine recycling fig 3 the mean nep rating of the respondents and their urine recycling attitude scores calculated in eq 1 did not correlate meaningfully despite indications that respondent groups with a pro ecological worldview 3 5 μ nep 4 5 displayed more favourable urine recycling orientations than their counterparts however for the respondent group with nep rating between 2 5 and 3 0 an almost equal distribution of respondents with pro urine n 164 and anti urine n 170 attitudes was seen 3 1 2 do consumers perceive cow and human urine differently when asked if cow urine could be used as crop fertiliser the majority 88 responded positively however only little more than half 55 were of the opinion that human urine could be used as a fertiliser fig 4 the mean nep rating of the respondents who believed human urine can be used as a fertiliser was 3 35 suggesting that these consumers would most likely be inclined to endorse pro environmental views when these consumers were asked to rate the sustainability of urine recycling que 11 66 believed that using human urine in agriculture was more sustainable than using chemical fertilisers while 14 thought it was similar to it however the nep rating of those who considered urine recycling to be sustainable and those who did not was very similar this implied that some respondents n 136 did not consider urine recycling as being sustainable despite having pro environmental views participant responses were substantively different when they were asked to state their willingness to consume food that was grown using urine the majority 71 stated they would consume food grown using cow urine while only 44 would eat food that was grown using human urine fig 4 younger respondents were less positive to the notion of urine as a fertiliser p 0 001 and less prepared to consume food grown using both cow urine p 0 005 and human urine p 0 001 table 3 however responses did not differ significantly with respect to gender religion or caste demographics of the consumers although educational work affiliation had a strong influence on consumer attitude inferences could not be drawn as no significant patterns were found more respondents from the business vitbs μ 1 58 and bio sciences sbst μ 1 58 schools were willing to consume human urine fertilised food in contrast majority of the respondents working with or studying information technology site μ 1 31 computer sciences engineering scope μ 1 37 and electronics engineering sense μ 1 38 were unwilling to do so no respondents from the language school ssl μ 1 00 were willing to consume human urine fertilised food 3 2 role of subjective norms in forming behavioural intentions it was our intention to explore whether the urine recycling intentions of others subjective norm in the university community had any effect if at all on individual consumer attitudes the respondents were asked to indicate what they believed would be the orientations of most of their friends and colleagues only 34 of all those who responded to this survey were of the opinion that others in the university community would be willing to eat urine fertilised food around 180 respondents 14 of all respondents provided comments to the question exploring the subjective norm several of these comments expressed their uncertainty in predicting their community s behaviour i don t know i am unsure maybe it depends on whether some of them would not all can t comment etc an interesting observation was that 68 of the respondents who did not provide a comment felt their friends or colleagues would be unwilling to eat urine fertilised food while only 54 of the respondents who did provide a comment thought so some consumers were of the belief that initially the concept of urine recycling might not be well accepted by others but once things set in place or if urine fertilised food was packed attractively or others in the university community were not informed how the urine fertilised food was actually produced people may accept it many respondents indicated that people around them are unaware of how their food is grown today and that urine use in agriculture may already be happening to quote respondent 637 we are already eating crops cultivated on land polluted emphasis added with human animal waste across the socio demographic variables consumer age was the only one that significantly influenced this perception p 0 005 respondents in the youngest age group 17 19 yrs which accounts for half of all the survey respondents were least likely to perceive their friends or colleagues as being willing to consume urine fertilised food however f test revealed no significant difference in urine recycling attitudes of those who thought their friends colleagues would eat urine fertilised food and those who did not 3 3 perceptions of behavioural control risks against urine recycling the questionnaire elicited from the respondents whether they felt the use of urine as a fertiliser posed a health risk to them as food consumers they were also asked if they thought human urine contained pharmaceuticals and pathogens out of all the respondents n 1252 65 were of the opinion that using human urine as a fertiliser would pose a health risk 70 thought urine contained pharmaceutical residues and 73 believed it contained pathogens of those who considered urine to pose a health risk 80 were of the belief that these risks could be mitigated with treatment the overall attitude to urine recycling was not influenced by consumer health risk perceptions or their beliefs of the presence of pharmaceuticals or pathogens in urine p 0 05 on the other hand consumer willingness to pay for urine fertilised food factored strongly in shaping their overall attitude 83 of those that stated they would eat urine fertilised food n 551 were willing to do so only if it cost them less than or similar to what they usually paid when buying the same food the effects of consumer socio demography on risk perceptions was also explored consumer age significantly affected perceptions fig 5 the perceived health risks seemed more evident among the young respondents 17 19 yrs than in their older counterparts 41 50 yrs p 0 005 likewise more of the young consumers stated that they thought human urine contained both pathogens and pharmaceuticals caste demographics and to a lesser extent academic work affiliation and religion affected consumer risk perceptions in comparison to the rest more of the respondents who identified themselves as scheduled castes believed that urine did not contain pathogens or pharmaceuticals p 0 05 and did not pose a health risk table s5 4 discussion 4 1 understanding urine recycling intentions in the university community this study explored urine recycling behavioural intentions of a university community in south india in the context of azjen s 2002 tpb an overall moderately positive attitude towards urine recycling behaviour was recorded among the respondents from vit university s vellore campus while the community also displayed a moderately positive environmental outlook we observed that their environmental outlook did not significantly influence their attitude towards urine recycling this is interesting as contrasting results have been reported in earlier studies where it has been observed that one s pro environmental beliefs of new sanitation systems and one s intention to support adopt it are related lamichhane and babcock 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 poortvliet et al 2018 however we did find that the respondents viewed cow urine and human urine very differently and found this to affect their attitudes in our survey 87 of the respondents thought of cow urine as fertiliser and 70 would eat cow urine fertilised food but only 55 viewed human urine as fertiliser with even fewer 44 willing to consume food grown using it fig 4 in an earlier study we have reported on perceptions of farmers also from vellore district to urine as crop fertiliser where we have observed a similar cow urine versus human urine distinction simha et al 2017 the subjective norm explored in this study did not feature in shaping the community s behavioural intentions we did not observe any significant difference between the attitude towards urine recycling behaviour of those who thought their friends colleagues would eat urine fertilised food and those who did not if recycling urine and using it as fertiliser is indeed a taboo as noted elsewhere black and fawcett 2010 jewitt 2011a it could be expected that one s urine recycling behaviour will be influenced by behavioural intentions of others in a community arvola et al 2008 especially those that have the opportunity and or authority to assert such influence in our case these would be other students faculty staff who as friends colleagues or supervisors of the respondents could influence individual recycling intentions since such influence was not explicit in this study one explanation could be that the respondents perhaps felt that their intention to recycle urine was not contingent on those of others in the community on the other hand maybe they did not believe in this social norm which could be because they ignore or underestimate the extent to which the actions of the community they belong to affect their own actions e g cialdini 2005 it is also possible that the influence of social norms may be less important than other factors e g willingness to pay cf croker et al 2009 or that there are other normative beliefs that influence consumer intentions to recycle urine masking the importance of social norm in this study future studies will need to explore these aspects according to the tpb a high level of perceived control over performing a behaviour should translate into favourable behavioural intentions however consumers may feel they lack volitional control e g consider a hypothetical scenario where a farmer uses untreated human urine to grow vegetables and does not inform consumers about this practice in an earlier survey in south india we did find that farmers were unwilling to disclose to their consumers if they used urine as fertiliser simha et al 2017 this was because they were afraid consumers would not buy their produce if they knew how it had been grown however consumers surveyed in this study did not raise such concerns health risks especially from pharmaceutical residues has been pointed out by consumers elsewhere as one worrying issue with recycling urine lienert and larsen 2009 however in our study we did not find consumer urine recycling intentions to be influenced by their health risk perceptions or their beliefs that urine contained pharmaceuticals and pathogens the majority in fact believe that human urine could be treated to not pose health risks to food consumers we did find respondent willingness to pay for urine fertilised food to influence their intentions there is literature that suggests that indian consumers may be unwilling to pay price premiums towards environment friendly practices manaktola and jauhari 2007 dwivedy and mittal 2013 because they fear that this would increase their living costs and are of the attitude that such costs must be borne by others e g the state this could be one bottleneck for progress in urine recycling particularly if consumers with positive attitudes feel they should be paying less for urine fertilised food or if consumers think urine fertilised food costs more than food grown using animal manure or chemical fertilisers 4 2 social sustainability of new sanitation systems through this survey we identified factors that influence urine recycling intentions of a south indian university community respondent age their willingness to pay for urine fertilised food educational work background and perceived health risks factored significantly in explaining their behavioural intentions religion and caste demographics environmental attitude or the explored social norm did not have as large of an impact while we find similarities between our findings and those reported earlier in literature we also find some differences very few of our respondents were willing to eat urine fertilised food similarly mariwah and drangert 2011 observed that peri urban residents in ghana would accept the use of human excreta in agriculture but were less inclined to do it themselves or consume crops grown using it farmers in south india pointed to cultural norms and religious objections as factors constraining them from using human urine simha et al 2017 as did farmers in nigeria and ghana cofie et al 2010 in contrast surveys in europe and in other western countries have indicated a rather high level of acceptance of human urine as a fertiliser as well as consumer willingness and preference in some cases to buy eat food grown using urine or urine based fertilisers pahl wostl et al 2003 lienert and larsen 2009 lamichhane and babcock 2013 in contrast to what we found respondents in these surveys raised concerns about micropollutants pharmaceuticals health risks and governmental regulations surrounding urine recycling lamichhane and babcock 2013 even found that more than 60 of their respondents at a university community in hawaii were willing to pay a price premium for diverting toilets to be installed on campus according to the results of our survey the majority of our respondents were willing to eat urine fertilised food only if cost them similar to or less than what they usually paid and were unwilling to pay a price premium for urine fertilised food while we recognise that our results and those reported by others do not necessarily qualify for direct comparison we believe that qualitative indications of differences between these studies are sufficient grounds to re examine the notion of social sustainability of new sanitation systems the above discussion certainly underpins the need for identifying place based definitions of sustainable sanitation as suggested by guest et al 2009 jewitt 2011a b too noted that social conceptualisations of human excreta vary enormously in both space and time and that there is a need for spatially specific understanding of sanitation related issues further sociological research may help unlock various internalised aspects that shape human behaviour and attitudes to new sanitation systems in different regions of the world 4 3 implications of this study 4 3 1 should we appeal to people s environmental sensitivities some studies performed in high income countries eu usa have indicated that there is a positive correlation between pro environmental attitudes and support acceptance of new sanitation systems the thinking is that environmental arguments in favour of such systems should be communicated to people to improve its adoption lienert and larsen 2009 lamichhane and babcock 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 poortvliet et al 2018 in the present study while the majority of our respondents also endorsed a pro ecological worldview table 3 we did not find their environmental attitudes to factor significantly in shaping their attitudes to urine recycling behaviour fig 3 we also observed that a considerable number of respondents 136 out of 1252 did not think of urine recycling as being sustainable despite having pro environmental views as no pre survey information package was provided to the participants and their level of awareness on various sanitation issues was not evaluated it is difficult to conclusively state that their environmental sensitivities will not determine their urine recycling behaviour then again if such environmental sensitivities do exist the question remains should they be appealed to or not a pro environmental outlook does not necessarily translate directly into pro environmental behaviour in the context of an emerging economy like india environmental commitments often tend to be given lower priority than say economic growth or poverty alleviation atteridge et al 2012 if that is the case there is an urgent need to understand how new environmental technologies should be introduced to the public since urine diversion and recycling can promote to an extent both socio economic wellbeing and environmental protection etter et al 2011 dickin et al 2018 the relative importance that people assign to these aspects must be understood this could possibly help guide sanitation planning and implementation there is a wealth of studies supporting the view that new sanitation technologies based on urine diversion and recycling have excellent environmental benefits to offer e g tidåker et al 2007 lam et al 2015 ishii and boyer 2015 however if people do not value these benefits value it less in comparison to other benefits or do not agree with the results of these studies efforts to convince them to adopt the technologies might not succeed for instance while communicating the water saving benefits of urine diversion is certainly an appropriate measure for targeting a community that greatly values water conservation lamichhane and babcock 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 in others it might not be as experiences from the erdos project in china suggest the drivers for improving sanitation tend to be quite temporal here rapid changes in the local economy and opening of a new water pipeline resulted in residents not perceiving water shortage to be a significant problem and thus not a driver for acceptance of dry toilets rosemarin et al 2012 this again ties back to the discussion in the earlier section where we talk about the need for identifying place based definitions of sustainable sanitation 4 3 2 theoretical and managerial implications based on this study it is arguable that consumer attitude is not the limiting factor for the spread of urine recycling in the surveyed community according to diffusion of innovations theory rogers 2003 uptake of innovations within a population follows an s curve innovators and early adopters first use the technology followed by exponential adoption once the use of the technology reaches 16 25 of the population as the market share of a technology increases knowledge attitudes and norms also change making it easier for others to adopt the innovation according to the results of this study over 40 of the respondents would eat food fertilised by human urine this is well beyond the acceptance rate needed to start an exponential spread of urine recycling however as discussed above a positive attitude does not necessarily lead to behaviour change according to the tpb our actions arise first from an intention to act which in turn is influenced by norms attitudes and knowledge ajzen 2002 this study highlights a range of attitudes knowledge regarding risks and an intention for urine recycling on behalf of the respondents this should not be surprising considering that the use of urine is a rather innovative concept and there are few established norms regarding the practice it is also likely that people do not fully understand the risks or potential benefits with urine recycling instead individuals come from different backgrounds and have access to different levels of knowledge that influence their normative perspectives and attitudes given that consumer attitude in the studied case is not strictly negative the question becomes what information or agency do consumers need to move from a positive attitude to intention and action here there is room for further research the results of this study may help guide two possible research strategies first what messaging is needed to form a positive attitude in the most conservative consumers in this study this group is the youngest respondents who are at the beginning of their university education while further research is needed to understand why this group has a lower acceptance level they are also a group that is relatively easy to target with educational material at the university in fact rothman et al 2015 suggest that major shifts in people s environment e g moving to the university s residence could temporarily leave their habits vulnerable to change and act as entry points for initiating support for a new behaviour second research could focus on what policy or communication instruments are needed to enable the 40 of consumers who are positive to consuming food fertilised with human urine to actually do so here it is likely that communication messages will need to be matched with economic and technological steering mechanisms that cover the entire chain of urine management from toilet to field new behaviour such as using a urine diverting toilet or buying urine fertilised food is easy to neglect or forget but this can be mitigated by creating support for people to repeat the behaviour and develop a stable behavioural pattern neal et al 2016 in this regard universities are likely to be ideal settings for initiating and sustaining positive sanitation behaviour especially among young students that move into campus residence context shift where they could be encouraged and also rewarded at least initially to repeat a desired habit in the same setting for extended time periods this study has also shown that consumers are unlikely to pay a price premium for urine fertilised food meaning that urine fertilisers will need to be economically competitive with other fertilisers the challenge of urine recycling is more likely to lie in creating the infrastructure and logistic systems to enable recycling rather than in creating a market for end products many actors in the food industry refer to low consumer acceptance when they reject urine fertilisers utilities with mandates for management of human waste also refer to a lack of a market for urine fertilisers mcconville et al 2015 mcconville et al 2017 the main barriers to urine recycling may well be the attitudes of other stakeholders within the service chain than with consumers or farmers this study concludes that there is enough consumer acceptance to support the spread of urine recycling systems in the surveyed community at the same time it is clear that consumer demand is not a driving force for a shift to increased urine recycling further research is needed to understand where the largest resistance is within the urine management service chain and what policy measures and information campaigns would be needed to change attitudes at that blockage point 4 4 study limitations there were some limitations to this study urine recycling attitudes of the respondents were quantified using an aggregated metric through an exploratory approach although this facilitated an understanding of pro and anti urine attitudes it would need to be refined in future studies when statistically treating the dataset mean consumer attitude score calculated in eq 1 of 1 5 and mean nep rating of 3 were considered to represent negative attitudes to urine recycling and anti environmental outlooks respectively although they merely indicated consumer indifference to the two aspects since consumers who displayed neither positive nor negative attitude may change their stance over time the overall positive attitude may have been underestimated when presented with the question do you think your friends colleagues would consume urine fertilised food more than 180 respondents provided comments in addition to the response yes no many of the comments expressed their uncertainty or inability to predict the behavioural intentions of others in the university community we recognise that this is a very difficult question to answer however people around us do affect our own cognition of things and thus asking respondents to take a stance may provide indirect indications of what they themselves think about urine recycling another limitation to this study was that some demographic variable categories were not adequately represented in the sampled population anova revealed that respondents associated with demographic variables that had low sample sizes responded significantly different to certain questions table 3 for instance the segregated attitudes of jains n 33 buddhists n 7 and people belonging to scheduled tribes n 8 was not positive toward urine recycling however these results may not be representative of all consumers on the university campus who identify themselves as belonging to these religions or caste and therefore must be taken with caution 5 conclusion this study presented the urine recycling perceptions and behavioural intentions of 1252 consumers from a south indian university community the majority of the consumers believed urine should be recycled were moderately positive to the idea of urine as fertiliser but less than half of them were willing to eat urine fertilised food the results of this study and those available in literature seem to suggest that there is sufficient support among farmers consumers and toilet users for recycling human urine collected in new sanitation systems if that is the case future studies should evaluate where the resistance to recycle urine lies in the urine management chain and how existing behaviour e g open defecation among toilet users of various stakeholders could be disrupted also of research interest will be case studies that help identify regional drivers and barriers to the adoption of urine recycling such studies should attempt to understand not only what aspects of sustainable sanitation technologies people think are important but also the relative importance they assign to each aspect this could help bridge the knowledge gaps that remain with respect to the social aspects surrounding source separating sanitation systems and will be vital to inform policymaking acknowledgements this

19448,sanitation systems based on source separation and valorisation of human urine can improve the environmental sustainability of wastewater management yet the social acceptability of such new resource oriented sanitation practices have not been assessed systematically we attempt to address this research gap by reporting the findings of a survey conducted at a south indian university that evaluated support for urine recycling among 1252 indian consumers we place our findings in the context of the theory of planned behaviour quantify consumer attitude to urine recycling through an exploratory numerical approach and identify explanatory factors that shape consumer beliefs and perceptions overall a moderately positive attitude was observed 68 stated human urine should not be disposed but recycled 55 considered it as fertiliser but only 44 would consume food grown using it while 65 believed using urine as crop fertiliser could pose a health risk majority 80 believed it could be treated so as to not pose a risk the respondents willingness to consume urine fertilised food was found to be strongly influenced by their willingness to pay consumer environmental attitudes as evaluated using the new ecological paradigm scale did not influence their attitude towards urine recycling behaviour we thus believe that simply appealing to people s environmental sensitivities is not enough for introducing environmentally friendly technologies like urine recycling but that more targeted marketing messages are needed we find sufficient support among our surveyed consumers for urine recycling but highlight that further research is needed to identify what information and agency will help translate positive attitudes into action and behaviour graphical abstract image 1 keywords survey ecological sanitation new ecological paradigm source separation theory of planned behaviour wastewater 1 introduction in the sanitation sector there is growing recognition that conventional systems in place today will not be able to fulfil the world s sustainability mandate guest et al 2009 several experts are convinced that the sector is in urgent need for a paradigm shift

decades new sanitation systems based on source separation and valorisation of various domestic wastewater fractions have started to attract research attention lens et al 2001 vinnerås and jönsson 2002

cheng et al 2017 in northern europe source separating sanitation systems are being piloted across several cities such as sneek netherlands helsingborg sweden ghent belgium and hamburg germany skambraks et al 2017 in many places source separated toilet wastes are applied to soil as crop fertiliser jönsson et al 2004 langergraber and muellegger 2005 it has been however been suggested that people s perceptions and willingness to change their sanitation behaviour can be significantly affected by culture traditions and beliefs rosenquist 2005 jewitt 2011a 2011b nawab et al 2006 simha et al 2017 what people think of human excreta and how they manage it varies both spatially and temporally rosenquist 2005 jewitt 2011b jewitt 2011a p 765 in fact suggests that deeply rooted emotions and taboos associated with human waste often occlude rational responses to its disposal handling and reuse people s sanitation outlooks and behaviours do not rely solely on apparent logic or scientific knowledge but may be affected by socio demographical cultural and environmental factors black and fawcett 2010 these factors might include age gender religion education income occupation and surrounding environment as well as people s necessities circumstances and aspirations there is evidence that interventions aimed at improving sanitation tend to fail if they do not consider this social complexity black and fawcett 2010 new sanitation systems based on urine diversion require wide behavioural changes such as users familiarising themselves with diverting type toilets at home and elsewhere farmers adopting to new crop fertilisation practices and even consumers who are to purchase food grown using recycled toilet wastes as fertiliser for an overview see lienert 2013 sociological studies investigating people s willingness to accept such new sanitation practices have been performed across different settings pahl wostl et al 2003 nawab et al 2006 lienert and larsen 2009 mariwah and drangert 2011 lamichhane and babcock 2013 okem et al 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 simha et al 2017 findings from these studies suggest that a myriad of factors interact and determine whether people communities think favourably of source separation technologies if they intend to change their sanitation behaviour and what would motivate or discourage them to do so in some studies surveyed populations with common attributes were homogenous in their stated attitudes and beliefs for instance mariwah and drangert 2011 found that 84 of the peri urban residents they surveyed in ghana at an agricultural community with little variation in demographic characteristics agreed that human excreta is a waste suitable only for disposal perhaps similarly but with contrasting results lienert and larsen s 2009 review of seven european countries revealed that a majority of the respondents liked the idea of using urine as a fertiliser situational and socio economic aspects of sanitation behaviour are also more evident in some studies than others for example a stark contrast in willingness to pay for urine diverting toilets was reported between residents in pakistan nawab et al 2006 and the united states lamichhane and babcock 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 based on such findings in literature it can be suggested that different attitudes to excreta urine recycling exist in different settings this is in line with jewitt s 2011a b assertion of the existence of spatial cultural differences in sanitation practices and also in how taboos surrounding excreta are conceptualised if that is indeed the case findings of perceptions and attitudes to new sanitation systems from a particular setting may not hold true in another hence further sociological research will be necessary to explore whether new sanitation practices will be socially sustainable in different places and to support sanitation planning and decision making with evidence based case studies in 2014 the government of india launched the swachh bharat mission sbm its flagship campaign to promote cleanliness and achieve universal sanitation coverage the campaign s aim is to eradicate open defecation which according to the who and unicef 2017 was practiced by 40 of the population as estimated in 2015 unlike india s past sanitation schemes e g nirmal bharat abhiyan sbm has a strong focus on collective behavioural change it encourages people to adopt and use cost effective and appropriate technologies for ecologically safe and sustainable sanitation and develop community managed systems for solid and liquid waste management ministry of drinking water and sanitation 2017 however as tran 2017 observed in a case study that evaluated the implementation of sbm in india s punjab region understanding people s expectations about what constitutes appropriate behaviour e g whether or not open defecation carries stigma and finding ways to change such expectations is key to sbm s success the separate collection and recycling of human urine using urine diverting toilets is one way of promoting ecologically sound sanitation but as discussed above requires significant changes to people s sanitation behaviour hence the objective in this study was to understand whether urine recycling will find support among consumers in india to survey indian consumers this study elected to sample a university community in south india vit university following work done elsewhere lamichhane and babcock 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 universities offer an interesting platform to evaluate people s behavioural intentions since they have been touted as experimental sites for introducing sustainable technologies evans and karvonen 2010 such as urine recycling universities also tend to shape how a country s youth population could behave as local and global citizens tuncer 2008 this aspect is perhaps more significant to india since it is home to the world s largest youth population according to the latest census the youth 15 34 years population of the country stood at 423 million people central statistics office 2017 the motivation to report on consumer behavioural intentions was two fold firstly to the authors best knowledge this is the first study to investigate what indian consumers think of using human urine as crop fertiliser secondly the results of the present investigation complement those obtained by the authors earlier where the attitudes of south indian farmers to new crop fertilisation practices was investigated simha et al 2017 since this study was performed in a university setting the results do not represent the urine recycling intentions of all indian consumers but may be indicative of intentions at other university communities in india findings from this study add to the existing literature on socio cultural aspects of new sanitation systems and also the socio technical discourse surrounding environmental technologies in emerging economies 2 methodology 2 1 survey instrument the survey was conducted at the vit university campus located in vellore south india all 28 000 people at the university staff students researchers and faculty were invited to voluntarily respond to an online questionnaire that collected anonymous responses using google forms an email with a link to the survey www goo gl forms h02ivnylp5a7xspn2 was sent using the university s electronic mailing list and made available for a period of four weeks reminder emails were sent at the beginning of weeks 2 3 and 4 the survey instrument and the study methodology were approved by the university s research committee the survey requested single responses to closed ended questions that were either binary yes no or multiple choice type the questionnaire comprised of three sections supplementary information after seeking participant consent demographic information including age gender affiliation religion and caste was requested the next section sought respondent perceptions of urine cow human as a fertiliser 5 questions their willingness to consume food grown using urine 4 questions and whether they perceived any risks associated with the use of urine as fertiliser 4 questions the revised new ecological paradigm nep scale was used to assess environmental attitudes of the respondents dunlap et al 2000 participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement with 15 nep statements on a 5 point likert like scale in the online form the statements were presented as three matrix type questions each comprising of five randomly ordered statements following ogunbode 2013 the wording of the nep statements was slightly modified 2 2 data and statistical analysis in total the survey registered 1252 responses giving a response rate of 4 5 based on the size of the sample n 1252 and the population n 28000 with 99 confidence level the margin of error is estimated to be 5 the collected survey data was analysed by assigning all positive responses a numerical value of 2 and negative responses a value of 1 so that the mean 1 μ 2 depicted the probability of the response being positive lamichhane and babcock 2013 the influence of demographic variables on respondent perceptions to urine recycling was assessed through chi squared test χ 2 and one way analysis of variance anova differences between categories of variables were considered significant if p value was 0 05 to analyse consumer environmental attitudes individual responses to the nep statements were coded as 1 to 5 where 1 indicated strong disagreement and 5 indicated strong agreement dunlap et al 2000 the seven even numbered nep statements were reverse coded since disagreement with the statements indicated a pro ecological worldview the overall nep rating 1 μ nep 5 of the dataset was calculated as the average of all responses to the individual scale items ogunbode 2013 an overall nep rating of 3 was considered the boundary between pro ecological and anthropocentric worldviews van petegem and blieck 2006 following dunlap et al 2000 and wilhelm rechmann et al 2014 cronbach s alpha α and mcdonald s omega ω tests were performed coefficients α and ω widely used measures of internal consistency reliability were calculated to see if survey participants were internally consistent in their responses to the statements in the nep scale using hierarchical factor analysis two forms of the omega coefficient hierarchical omega ω h and total omega ω t were estimated to analyse the nep scale and determine its latent structure exploratory factor analysis was carried out in addition principal component analysis with varimax rotation was performed to test the dimensionality of the scale against five hypothesised facets or worldviews 1 reality of limits to growth 2 anti anthropocentrism 3 fragility of nature s balance 4 rejection of human exemptionalism belief that humans are exempt from environmental forces and 5 the possibility of an ecocrisis dunlap et al 2000 ogunbode 2013 to explore whether respondent environmental views affected their attitude to urine recycling and if these views were influenced by socio demographical factors respondents with mean nep rating of 3 and 3 were categorised as likely to endorse pro environmental and anti environmental worldviews respectively 2 3 theory of planned behaviour azjen s 2002 theory of planned behaviour tpb was used in this study to investigate consumer behavioural intentions to recycle human urine the tpb is a well validated social cognitive model to predict people s intentions and behaviour armitage and conner 2001 according to the tpb one s behaviour to act is guided principally by one s intention which in turn depends on three aspects attitude towards the behaviour the degree of a person s favourable or unfavourable evaluation or appraisal of the behaviour in question fishbein and ajzen 1975 the subjective norm the perceived social pressure to perform or not to perform the behaviour ajzen 1991 and perceived behavioural control people s perception of ease or difficulty in performing the behaviour of interest ajzen 2002 if that is the case in line with the tpb consumers who have a positive attitude to urine recycling and believe there is normative support for using it as a crop fertiliser and feel it is easy for them to engage in urine recycling should have strong intentions to carry out the behaviour fig 1 2 4 attitude towards the behaviour consumer attitudes to urine recycling were evaluated according to the following procedure three aspects were taken into consideration i perception of human urine as a crop fertiliser ii willingness to consume food grown using human urine and iii whether respondents felt urine should be disposed and never recycled the weighted arithmetic mean of participant responses r 1 or 2 to the three aspects were assumed to represent the individual attitude score eq 1 whereas overall attitude score of the university community was estimated as the mean of attitude scores of all the respondents 1 c o n s u m e r a t t i t u d e s c o r e 1 n i 1 n w i r i initially all three aspects were considered to be of equal importance w 1 a mean attitude score of 1 5 was taken to represent a positive attitude while those 1 5 represented a negative attitude on the other hand segregated consumer attitude score was defined in this study as the mean attitude of respondents belonging to a select category of a demographic variable e g the mean attitude of all christians within the demographic variable religion this was calculated using eq 2 where μ is the mean response of all the segregated groups of consumers and n is the number of aspects 2 s e g r e g a t e d c o n s u m e r a t t i t u d e s c o r e 1 n i 1 n w i μ i since an exploratory approach for estimating consumer attitudes was used the overall attitude and segregated attitudes scores were recalculated by varying the weights used in eq 1 and eq 2 firstly more importance was assigned to respondent s willingness to eat urine fertilised food since this could be a stronger indication of consumer behaviour than whether or not they believed in urine s fertilising potential secondly we considered the scenario where more significance is assigned to willingness to consume and respondent beliefs on whether urine should never be recycled all statistical analyses were performed using r v 3 3 4 2 5 subjective norm according to bikhcahndani et al 1998 people tend to make similar choices when faced with similar action alternatives payoffs and information something that could lead to convergent behaviour according to the authors moreover frith and frith 2006 suggest that people tend to predict what others would do in a given situation and that their own behaviour is influenced by observing the actions of others hence in order to capture the subject norm the respondents were asked to indicate what they believed their friends colleagues thought about urine recycling in one of the surveys questions que 15 2 6 perceived behavioural control human urine collected in source separating sanitation systems can be cross contaminated with faeces which could introduce transmission routes of infectious diseases when urine is used as fertiliser schönning et al 2002 also urine and urine based fertilisers can contain many micropollutants from human metabolism pharmaceuticals hormones larsen et al 2004 hence following mariwah and drangert 2011 behavioural control was captured by participant responses to questions 17 21 in the survey where they were asked to indicate perceived health risks pathogens and pharmaceuticals against using urine as a crop fertiliser in addition consumer willingness to pay for urine fertilised food was sought this was done because the cost aspect of new systems and practices if often perceived by citizens as a risk cf pahl wostl et al 2003 ishii and boyer 2016 and thus could point to potential inability to perform urine recycling behaviour 3 results 3 1 consumer attitudes to urine recycling individual consumer attitude scores were found to vary considerably the overall attitude score of the dataset n 1252 was 1 56 0 37 eq 1 this suggested that a moderately positive attitude to human urine recycling existed among consumers surveyed at vit university table 1 segregated attitudes scores of the consumers based on different categories of the demographic variables suggested that a there was a positive correlation between age categories 17 19 to 41 50 and attitude r 2 0 98 as acceptance increased with age b female respondents were slightly more negative than their male counterparts 1 53 vs 1 57 p 0 01 c religious and caste demographics did not influence consumer attitudes except among those who identified themselves as jains n 33 buddhists n 7 and scheduled tribes n 8 fig 2 when different weights were assigned to the three aspects assumed to determine consumer attitude the overall attitude score changed albeit not considerably when more importance was assigned to the willingness of respondents to consume food grown using human urine as fertiliser the overall score decreased from 1 56 to 1 53 when more importance was given to willingness to consume and whether respondents believed urine should be recycled and not disposed there was no change in the attitude as against the original attitude of the dataset 3 1 1 attitude towards urine recycling behaviour environmental outlook the mean nep rating of the dataset was 3 32 indicating that the respondents were moderately environmentally conscious and in favour of a pro ecological worldview table 2 in particular the majority endorsed the possibility of an ecocrisis as well as anti anthropocentric views but the acceptance of the view that humankind may be approaching its limits to growth was not high table s4 cronbach s alpha 0 α 1 an indicator of internal consistency in the nep scale was calculated as 0 55 which according to nunnally 1967 is acceptable reliability for preliminary research mcdonald s omega was estimated as hierarchical omega ω h 0 57 and total omega 0 79 which also suggested that the nep scale constituted an internally consistent measure the principal component analysis revealed that one major factor explained 24 8 of the total variance in the dataset the anova revealed that there were no significant difference between the mean nep ratings of the different categories of demographic variables table 3 the only exception to this was the variation displayed by different age categories as it was observed that the younger the respondent the more pro ecological the stated belief p 0 05 it has been suggested that environmental concern diffuses through the public over time and thus younger people who are less attached to traditional outlooks may be more supportive of an ecological worldview jones and dunlap 1992 dunlap et al 2000 complementary work in support of this hypothesis has however not been carried out the environmental outlook of the respondents did not significantly influence their attitude to urine recycling fig 3 the mean nep rating of the respondents and their urine recycling attitude scores calculated in eq 1 did not correlate meaningfully despite indications that respondent groups with a pro ecological worldview 3 5 μ nep 4 5 displayed more favourable urine recycling orientations than their counterparts however for the respondent group with nep rating between 2 5 and 3 0 an almost equal distribution of respondents with pro urine n 164 and anti urine n 170 attitudes was seen 3 1 2 do consumers perceive cow and human urine differently when asked if cow urine could be used as crop fertiliser the majority 88 responded positively however only little more than half 55 were of the opinion that human urine could be used as a fertiliser fig 4 the mean nep rating of the respondents who believed human urine can be used as a fertiliser was 3 35 suggesting that these consumers would most likely be inclined to endorse pro environmental views when these consumers were asked to rate the sustainability of urine recycling que 11 66 believed that using human urine in agriculture was more sustainable than using chemical fertilisers while 14 thought it was similar to it however the nep rating of those who considered urine recycling to be sustainable and those who did not was very similar this implied that some respondents n 136 did not consider urine recycling as being sustainable despite having pro environmental views participant responses were substantively different when they were asked to state their willingness to consume food that was grown using urine the majority 71 stated they would consume food grown using cow urine while only 44 would eat food that was grown using human urine fig 4 younger respondents were less positive to the notion of urine as a fertiliser p 0 001 and less prepared to consume food grown using both cow urine p 0 005 and human urine p 0 001 table 3 however responses did not differ significantly with respect to gender religion or caste demographics of the consumers although educational work affiliation had a strong influence on consumer attitude inferences could not be drawn as no significant patterns were found more respondents from the business vitbs μ 1 58 and bio sciences sbst μ 1 58 schools were willing to consume human urine fertilised food in contrast majority of the respondents working with or studying information technology site μ 1 31 computer sciences engineering scope μ 1 37 and electronics engineering sense μ 1 38 were unwilling to do so no respondents from the language school ssl μ 1 00 were willing to consume human urine fertilised food 3 2 role of subjective norms in forming behavioural intentions it was our intention to explore whether the urine recycling intentions of others subjective norm in the university community had any effect if at all on individual consumer attitudes the respondents were asked to indicate what they believed would be the orientations of most of their friends and colleagues only 34 of all those who responded to this survey were of the opinion that others in the university community would be willing to eat urine fertilised food around 180 respondents 14 of all respondents provided comments to the question exploring the subjective norm several of these comments expressed their uncertainty in predicting their community s behaviour i don t know i am unsure maybe it depends on whether some of them would not all can t comment etc an interesting observation was that 68 of the respondents who did not provide a comment felt their friends or colleagues would be unwilling to eat urine fertilised food while only 54 of the respondents who did provide a comment thought so some consumers were of the belief that initially the concept of urine recycling might not be well accepted by others but once things set in place or if urine fertilised food was packed attractively or others in the university community were not informed how the urine fertilised food was actually produced people may accept it many respondents indicated that people around them are unaware of how their food is grown today and that urine use in agriculture may already be happening to quote respondent 637 we are already eating crops cultivated on land polluted emphasis added with human animal waste across the socio demographic variables consumer age was the only one that significantly influenced this perception p 0 005 respondents in the youngest age group 17 19 yrs which accounts for half of all the survey respondents were least likely to perceive their friends or colleagues as being willing to consume urine fertilised food however f test revealed no significant difference in urine recycling attitudes of those who thought their friends colleagues would eat urine fertilised food and those who did not 3 3 perceptions of behavioural control risks against urine recycling the questionnaire elicited from the respondents whether they felt the use of urine as a fertiliser posed a health risk to them as food consumers they were also asked if they thought human urine contained pharmaceuticals and pathogens out of all the respondents n 1252 65 were of the opinion that using human urine as a fertiliser would pose a health risk 70 thought urine contained pharmaceutical residues and 73 believed it contained pathogens of those who considered urine to pose a health risk 80 were of the belief that these risks could be mitigated with treatment the overall attitude to urine recycling was not influenced by consumer health risk perceptions or their beliefs of the presence of pharmaceuticals or pathogens in urine p 0 05 on the other hand consumer willingness to pay for urine fertilised food factored strongly in shaping their overall attitude 83 of those that stated they would eat urine fertilised food n 551 were willing to do so only if it cost them less than or similar to what they usually paid when buying the same food the effects of consumer socio demography on risk perceptions was also explored consumer age significantly affected perceptions fig 5 the perceived health risks seemed more evident among the young respondents 17 19 yrs than in their older counterparts 41 50 yrs p 0 005 likewise more of the young consumers stated that they thought human urine contained both pathogens and pharmaceuticals caste demographics and to a lesser extent academic work affiliation and religion affected consumer risk perceptions in comparison to the rest more of the respondents who identified themselves as scheduled castes believed that urine did not contain pathogens or pharmaceuticals p 0 05 and did not pose a health risk table s5 4 discussion 4 1 understanding urine recycling intentions in the university community this study explored urine recycling behavioural intentions of a university community in south india in the context of azjen s 2002 tpb an overall moderately positive attitude towards urine recycling behaviour was recorded among the respondents from vit university s vellore campus while the community also displayed a moderately positive environmental outlook we observed that their environmental outlook did not significantly influence their attitude towards urine recycling this is interesting as contrasting results have been reported in earlier studies where it has been observed that one s pro environmental beliefs of new sanitation systems and one s intention to support adopt it are related lamichhane and babcock 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 poortvliet et al 2018 however we did find that the respondents viewed cow urine and human urine very differently and found this to affect their attitudes in our survey 87 of the respondents thought of cow urine as fertiliser and 70 would eat cow urine fertilised food but only 55 viewed human urine as fertiliser with even fewer 44 willing to consume food grown using it fig 4 in an earlier study we have reported on perceptions of farmers also from vellore district to urine as crop fertiliser where we have observed a similar cow urine versus human urine distinction simha et al 2017 the subjective norm explored in this study did not feature in shaping the community s behavioural intentions we did not observe any significant difference between the attitude towards urine recycling behaviour of those who thought their friends colleagues would eat urine fertilised food and those who did not if recycling urine and using it as fertiliser is indeed a taboo as noted elsewhere black and fawcett 2010 jewitt 2011a it could be expected that one s urine recycling behaviour will be influenced by behavioural intentions of others in a community arvola et al 2008 especially those that have the opportunity and or authority to assert such influence in our case these would be other students faculty staff who as friends colleagues or supervisors of the respondents could influence individual recycling intentions since such influence was not explicit in this study one explanation could be that the respondents perhaps felt that their intention to recycle urine was not contingent on those of others in the community on the other hand maybe they did not believe in this social norm which could be because they ignore or underestimate the extent to which the actions of the community they belong to affect their own actions e g cialdini 2005 it is also possible that the influence of social norms may be less important than other factors e g willingness to pay cf croker et al 2009 or that there are other normative beliefs that influence consumer intentions to recycle urine masking the importance of social norm in this study future studies will need to explore these aspects according to the tpb a high level of perceived control over performing a behaviour should translate into favourable behavioural intentions however consumers may feel they lack volitional control e g consider a hypothetical scenario where a farmer uses untreated human urine to grow vegetables and does not inform consumers about this practice in an earlier survey in south india we did find that farmers were unwilling to disclose to their consumers if they used urine as fertiliser simha et al 2017 this was because they were afraid consumers would not buy their produce if they knew how it had been grown however consumers surveyed in this study did not raise such concerns health risks especially from pharmaceutical residues has been pointed out by consumers elsewhere as one worrying issue with recycling urine lienert and larsen 2009 however in our study we did not find consumer urine recycling intentions to be influenced by their health risk perceptions or their beliefs that urine contained pharmaceuticals and pathogens the majority in fact believe that human urine could be treated to not pose health risks to food consumers we did find respondent willingness to pay for urine fertilised food to influence their intentions there is literature that suggests that indian consumers may be unwilling to pay price premiums towards environment friendly practices manaktola and jauhari 2007 dwivedy and mittal 2013 because they fear that this would increase their living costs and are of the attitude that such costs must be borne by others e g the state this could be one bottleneck for progress in urine recycling particularly if consumers with positive attitudes feel they should be paying less for urine fertilised food or if consumers think urine fertilised food costs more than food grown using animal manure or chemical fertilisers 4 2 social sustainability of new sanitation systems through this survey we identified factors that influence urine recycling intentions of a south indian university community respondent age their willingness to pay for urine fertilised food educational work background and perceived health risks factored significantly in explaining their behavioural intentions religion and caste demographics environmental attitude or the explored social norm did not have as large of an impact while we find similarities between our findings and those reported earlier in literature we also find some differences very few of our respondents were willing to eat urine fertilised food similarly mariwah and drangert 2011 observed that peri urban residents in ghana would accept the use of human excreta in agriculture but were less inclined to do it themselves or consume crops grown using it farmers in south india pointed to cultural norms and religious objections as factors constraining them from using human urine simha et al 2017 as did farmers in nigeria and ghana cofie et al 2010 in contrast surveys in europe and in other western countries have indicated a rather high level of acceptance of human urine as a fertiliser as well as consumer willingness and preference in some cases to buy eat food grown using urine or urine based fertilisers pahl wostl et al 2003 lienert and larsen 2009 lamichhane and babcock 2013 in contrast to what we found respondents in these surveys raised concerns about micropollutants pharmaceuticals health risks and governmental regulations surrounding urine recycling lamichhane and babcock 2013 even found that more than 60 of their respondents at a university community in hawaii were willing to pay a price premium for diverting toilets to be installed on campus according to the results of our survey the majority of our respondents were willing to eat urine fertilised food only if cost them similar to or less than what they usually paid and were unwilling to pay a price premium for urine fertilised food while we recognise that our results and those reported by others do not necessarily qualify for direct comparison we believe that qualitative indications of differences between these studies are sufficient grounds to re examine the notion of social sustainability of new sanitation systems the above discussion certainly underpins the need for identifying place based definitions of sustainable sanitation as suggested by guest et al 2009 jewitt 2011a b too noted that social conceptualisations of human excreta vary enormously in both space and time and that there is a need for spatially specific understanding of sanitation related issues further sociological research may help unlock various internalised aspects that shape human behaviour and attitudes to new sanitation systems in different regions of the world 4 3 implications of this study 4 3 1 should we appeal to people s environmental sensitivities some studies performed in high income countries eu usa have indicated that there is a positive correlation between pro environmental attitudes and support acceptance of new sanitation systems the thinking is that environmental arguments in favour of such systems should be communicated to people to improve its adoption lienert and larsen 2009 lamichhane and babcock 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 poortvliet et al 2018 in the present study while the majority of our respondents also endorsed a pro ecological worldview table 3 we did not find their environmental attitudes to factor significantly in shaping their attitudes to urine recycling behaviour fig 3 we also observed that a considerable number of respondents 136 out of 1252 did not think of urine recycling as being sustainable despite having pro environmental views as no pre survey information package was provided to the participants and their level of awareness on various sanitation issues was not evaluated it is difficult to conclusively state that their environmental sensitivities will not determine their urine recycling behaviour then again if such environmental sensitivities do exist the question remains should they be appealed to or not a pro environmental outlook does not necessarily translate directly into pro environmental behaviour in the context of an emerging economy like india environmental commitments often tend to be given lower priority than say economic growth or poverty alleviation atteridge et al 2012 if that is the case there is an urgent need to understand how new environmental technologies should be introduced to the public since urine diversion and recycling can promote to an extent both socio economic wellbeing and environmental protection etter et al 2011 dickin et al 2018 the relative importance that people assign to these aspects must be understood this could possibly help guide sanitation planning and implementation there is a wealth of studies supporting the view that new sanitation technologies based on urine diversion and recycling have excellent environmental benefits to offer e g tidåker et al 2007 lam et al 2015 ishii and boyer 2015 however if people do not value these benefits value it less in comparison to other benefits or do not agree with the results of these studies efforts to convince them to adopt the technologies might not succeed for instance while communicating the water saving benefits of urine diversion is certainly an appropriate measure for targeting a community that greatly values water conservation lamichhane and babcock 2013 ishii and boyer 2016 in others it might not be as experiences from the erdos project in china suggest the drivers for improving sanitation tend to be quite temporal here rapid changes in the local economy and opening of a new water pipeline resulted in residents not perceiving water shortage to be a significant problem and thus not a driver for acceptance of dry toilets rosemarin et al 2012 this again ties back to the discussion in the earlier section where we talk about the need for identifying place based definitions of sustainable sanitation 4 3 2 theoretical and managerial implications based on this study it is arguable that consumer attitude is not the limiting factor for the spread of urine recycling in the surveyed community according to diffusion of innovations theory rogers 2003 uptake of innovations within a population follows an s curve innovators and early adopters first use the technology followed by exponential adoption once the use of the technology reaches 16 25 of the population as the market share of a technology increases knowledge attitudes and norms also change making it easier for others to adopt the innovation according to the results of this study over 40 of the respondents would eat food fertilised by human urine this is well beyond the acceptance rate needed to start an exponential spread of urine recycling however as discussed above a positive attitude does not necessarily lead to behaviour change according to the tpb our actions arise first from an intention to act which in turn is influenced by norms attitudes and knowledge ajzen 2002 this study highlights a range of attitudes knowledge regarding risks and an intention for urine recycling on behalf of the respondents this should not be surprising considering that the use of urine is a rather innovative concept and there are few established norms regarding the practice it is also likely that people do not fully understand the risks or potential benefits with urine recycling instead individuals come from different backgrounds and have access to different levels of knowledge that influence their normative perspectives and attitudes given that consumer attitude in the studied case is not strictly negative the question becomes what information or agency do consumers need to move from a positive attitude to intention and action here there is room for further research the results of this study may help guide two possible research strategies first what messaging is needed to form a positive attitude in the most conservative consumers in this study this group is the youngest respondents who are at the beginning of their university education while further research is needed to understand why this group has a lower acceptance level they are also a group that is relatively easy to target with educational material at the university in fact rothman et al 2015 suggest that major shifts in people s environment e g moving to the university s residence could temporarily leave their habits vulnerable to change and act as entry points for initiating support for a new behaviour second research could focus on what policy or communication instruments are needed to enable the 40 of consumers who are positive to consuming food fertilised with human urine to actually do so here it is likely that communication messages will need to be matched with economic and technological steering mechanisms that cover the entire chain of urine management from toilet to field new behaviour such as using a urine diverting toilet or buying urine fertilised food is easy to neglect or forget but this can be mitigated by creating support for people to repeat the behaviour and develop a stable behavioural pattern neal et al 2016 in this regard universities are likely to be ideal settings for initiating and sustaining positive sanitation behaviour especially among young students that move into campus residence context shift where they could be encouraged and also rewarded at least initially to repeat a desired habit in the same setting for extended time periods this study has also shown that consumers are unlikely to pay a price premium for urine fertilised food meaning that urine fertilisers will need to be economically competitive with other fertilisers the challenge of urine recycling is more likely to lie in creating the infrastructure and logistic systems to enable recycling rather than in creating a market for end products many actors in the food industry refer to low consumer acceptance when they reject urine fertilisers utilities with mandates for management of human waste also refer to a lack of a market for urine fertilisers mcconville et al 2015 mcconville et al 2017 the main barriers to urine recycling may well be the attitudes of other stakeholders within the service chain than with consumers or farmers this study concludes that there is enough consumer acceptance to support the spread of urine recycling systems in the surveyed community at the same time it is clear that consumer demand is not a driving force for a shift to increased urine recycling further research is needed to understand where the largest resistance is within the urine management service chain and what policy measures and information campaigns would be needed to change attitudes at that blockage point 4 4 study limitations there were some limitations to this study urine recycling attitudes of the respondents were quantified using an aggregated metric through an exploratory approach although this facilitated an understanding of pro and anti urine attitudes it would need to be refined in future studies when statistically treating the dataset mean consumer attitude score calculated in eq 1 of 1 5 and mean nep rating of 3 were considered to represent negative attitudes to urine recycling and anti environmental outlooks respectively although they merely indicated consumer indifference to the two aspects since consumers who displayed neither positive nor negative attitude may change their stance over time the overall positive attitude may have been underestimated when presented with the question do you think your friends colleagues would consume urine fertilised food more than 180 respondents provided comments in addition to the response yes no many of the comments expressed their uncertainty or inability to predict the behavioural intentions of others in the university community we recognise that this is a very difficult question to answer however people around us do affect our own cognition of things and thus asking respondents to take a stance may provide indirect indications of what they themselves think about urine recycling another limitation to this study was that some demographic variable categories were not adequately represented in the sampled population anova revealed that respondents associated with demographic variables that had low sample sizes responded significantly different to certain questions table 3 for instance the segregated attitudes of jains n 33 buddhists n 7 and people belonging to scheduled tribes n 8 was not positive toward urine recycling however these results may not be representative of all consumers on the university campus who identify themselves as belonging to these religions or caste and therefore must be taken with caution 5 conclusion this study presented the urine recycling perceptions and behavioural intentions of 1252 consumers from a south indian university community the majority of the consumers believed urine should be recycled were moderately positive to the idea of urine as fertiliser but less than half of them were willing to eat urine fertilised food the results of this study and those available in literature seem to suggest that there is sufficient support among farmers consumers and toilet users for recycling human urine collected in new sanitation systems if that is the case future studies should evaluate where the resistance to recycle urine lies in the urine management chain and how existing behaviour e g open defecation among toilet users of various stakeholders could be disrupted also of research interest will be case studies that help identify regional drivers and barriers to the adoption of urine recycling such studies should attempt to understand not only what aspects of sustainable sanitation technologies people think are important but also the relative importance they assign to each aspect this could help bridge the knowledge gaps that remain with respect to the social aspects surrounding source separating sanitation systems and will be vital to inform policymaking acknowledgements this

19449,removing harmful cyanobacteria intact by coagulation can prevent cell lysis and toxin release which provides many benefits for drinking water production including reduction of the burden on subsequent processes and guaranteeing the water quality but the electronegativity and buoyancy of cyanobacterial cells make them settle slowly and their accumulation and concentration in flocs would still have severe adverse effects in this study we introduced a photocatalyst powder to act as a ballasting agent in the coagulation process and to degrade the cells and cyanotoxins during sludge storage results showed that adding n tio2 would decrease the coagulant dose to half of the conventional value and also allow microcystis aeruginosa cells to completely settle within 10 min during sludge storage the algal cells cyanotoxins and other organics in sludge would be degraded to safe levels after 32 h visible light irradiation meanwhile the n tio2 water and some of the coagulant in purified sludge will be directly and safely reused thus this is an environmentally friendly and cost effective technology which incorporates photocatalyst in algal flocs to enhance coagulation and sedimentation and to enable the sludge produced to be self purified under visible light graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacteria photocatalysis ballasted coagulation self purification sludge

in some developing countries due to the shortage of better water sources qu et al 2012 the presence of cyanobacteria and their metabolites in drinking water may degrade water quality and cause the production of unpleasant tastes and odours more seriously several cyanobacterial species are potent producers of a variety of toxins poisonous to animals and humans zamyadi et al 2012 tracey et al 2011 for example microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa the most notorious species in eutrophic surface waters adamovsky et al 2015 li et al 2014 can produce a suite of hepatotoxins known as microcystins mariani et al 2015 johan et al 2017 blake and raj 2013 in drinking water plants the conventional treatment process includes coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection zhao and zhang 2011 for toxic cyanobacteria removal the coagulation sedimentation process plays the most important role xu et al 2016 if the cyanobacterial cells were not adequately removed from drinking water in this process residual cells in the supernatant would have serious impacts on the subsequent processes for example residual cyanobacterial cells in water would cause filter clogging and shorten the filter runs ma and liu 2002 on the other hand the metabolites produced by algal cells are precursors of disinfection by products ma and liu 2002 which can increase the required dose of oxidant in the disinfection process however the coagulation and sedimentation of toxic cyanobacteria in conventional drinking water treatment is not satisfactory from other perspectives the cyanobacteria and their metabolites can increase the electronegativity of the colloid surfaces which increases the necessary dosage of cationic coagulant zhao and zhang 2011 high doses of coagulant can increase the concentration of metal ions in water resulting in secondary pollution on the other hand the settling of cyanobacterial flocs in the sedimentation process needs a long time due to the buoyancy of algal cells noyma et al 2016 which is adverse to efficient drinking water treatment therefore it is necessary to seek enhanced coagulation methods to reduce the coagulant dose and simultaneously improve the settleability of flocs for the treatment of cyanobacteria contaminated water after coagulation cyanobacterial flocs settle in a sedimentation tank forming cyanobacteria containing sludge in this process the toxic cyanobacteria and cell bound toxins will accumulate in the tank before being discharged the accumulated cyanobacterial cells may easily die and decompose during storage releasing large amounts of toxins and other harmful substances into the sludge the contaminated sludge discharged into water bodies is reported to be toxic to aquatic life while that disposed of in landfill increases the land requirement of the landfill site abhilash and ahammed 2014 thus the cyanobacteria containing sludge also needs to be carefully treated in drinking water plants ballasted coagulation is a gravity based physicochemical separation process usually employed to remove particulate matter in drinking water treatment plants gasperi et al 2012 the process involves the incorporation of a ballasting agent in flocs during coagulation to increase the floc density and size mathieu and benoit 2016 and then accelerate the sedimentation through increasing floc masses gorin et al 2015 in our previous study ballasted coagulation was applied to solve the issues caused by cyanobacterial cells in coagulation and sedimentation processes within drinking water plants pei et al 2017 ballast particles such as clay soil and sand serve as seed grains when coagulation proceeds accelerating the sedimentation through increasing floc masses gorin et al 2015 simultaneously the small ballast particles would be able to adsorb the negatively charged cyanobacterial cells and metabolites improving the algae removal efficiency and reducing the coagulant dose pei et al 2017 however the common ballast particles just promote separation of the cyanobacterial cells from supernatant in the coagulation and sedimentation processes the settled cyanobacteria and their harmful metabolites in sludge still could not be eliminated therefore we considered upgrading the ballast materials to empower them to degrade the harmful cyanobacteria and their metabolites especially the cyanotoxins while they continue to play their marvelous roles in the coagulation and sedimentation processes thus we attempted to replace the conventional ballast materials with photocatalyst powder such as nitrogen doped tio2 n tio2 with nitrogen doping in tio2 lattice to narrow its band gap n tio2 can make use of visible light to generate reactive oxidizing species so as to degrade cyanobacterial cells and organic matter choi et al 2007 sacco et al 2015 vaiano et al 2015 meanwhile we also attempted to directly reuse the formed cyanobacteria containing sludge including the photocatalyst water and coagulant in the sludge after it has been purified through photocatalysis to reduce the cost of this technology with no pollutant discharged but can photocatalyst be used as ballast particles can photocatalyst still maintain its powerful photocatalytic potency when it is enmeshed in cyanobacterial sludge can the purified sludge be directly reused in this technology if the answers were positive we should be able to provide a cost effective and environmentally beneficial technology that could simultaneously purify the cyanobacteria contaminated water and the cyanobacterial sludge formed in drinking water plants until now no relevant research on this has been reported 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 cyanobacterial culture m aeruginosa fachb 905 purchased from institute of hydrobiology

vigorous stirring for 1 h after heating at 80 c for 3 h the ph of the solution was adjusted with naoh to a value of 7 and the transparent solution became a white sol gel the sol gel was then calcined at 450 c for 3 h with a 5 k min heating rate lastly the calcined white solid was ground and sieved 40 μm before use kontos et al 2008 nitrogen was successfully doped into the tio2 framework as

cyanobacterial coagulation and sedimentation the coagulation experiments were performed with a six paddle stirrer zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co china in a series of 1000 ml

17 7 ntu polyaluminium ferric chloride pafc was used as the coagulant in this experiment after pafc and n tio2 were simultaneously added the m aeruginosa solution was stirred at 250 rpm for 1 min and 40 rpm for another 20 min the n tio2 doses in m aeruginosa solution were 0 50 100 200 and 400 mg l as the optimal dose of pafc was 15 mg l for treating 106 cells ml of m aeruginosa cells jin et al 2017 we used half the optimal dose 7 5 mg l in each system to identify the enhancement of cyanobacterial coagulation by n tio2 algal removal efficiencies were measured for both the coagulation and the

supernatant all the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results are presented as the mean values and standard deviations 2 3 photocatalytic purification of cyanobacteria containing sludge in the system with 200 mg l n tio2 after coagulation and sedimentation 930 ml supernatant was removed leaving 70 ml of lab simulated cyanobacteria containing sludge the same volume of sludge was transferred to 3 kinds of cylindrical quartzose beakers a low beaker l beaker diameter height 7 cm 5 cm a medium height beaker m beaker diameter height 5 cm 6 cm and a high beaker h beaker diameter height 4 cm 8 cm these were then covered with thin transparent film the sludge in these beakers was held at the intended temperature 25 c and irradiated with a 55 w led lamp fsl co china positioned above the surface of the sludge the distance between the sludge surface and the led lamp was 2 cm and the light intensity was 30 000 lux the cyanobacteria containing sludge was magnetically stirred

standard deviation sd 2 4 the reuse of purified cyanobacteria containing sludge after visible light irradiation for 32 h the purified cyanobacteria containing sludge in the l beaker was directly added to 1 l of 1 106 cells ml raw m aeruginosa solution in this technology adding only the purified sludge could not satisfactorily coagulate all algal cells thus 0 6 mg l pafc was also dosed with the appropriate pafc dose all algal cells were aggregated to flocs and settled next a 930 ml volume of supernatant was removed and the remaining 70 ml of cyanobacteria containing sludge was treated with the photocatalytic treatment mentioned above this constituted the first time reuse the purified sludge in the first time reuse was collected and the procedure above was repeated for that material which then constituted the second time reuse the experiment was performed in triplicate and the data is expressed as the respective mean standard deviation sd 2 5 analysis methods 2 5 1 residual n tio2 after coagulation the residual n tio2 in supernatant was measured at 30 60 90 and 120 min into the sedimentation process in each system 100 ml supernatant was sampled and heated to evaporate the solution to about 10 ml then the condensed solution was centrifuged at 11 000 g for 10 min discarding the supernatant and retaining the remaining white solid the white solid was washed 3 times and dried at 60 c for 24 h yielding pure n tio2 powder lastly the n tio2 powder was weighed and the concentration of residual n tio2 in the supernatant could thus be calculated 2 5 2 chlorophyll a to

software version 16 0 and the statistical significance bands were defined as 0 01 p 0 05 and p 0 01 all statistical analyses were carried out using origin 9 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 ballasted coagulation of cyanobacterial cells with photocatalyst powder fig 1 shows that photocatalyst containing algal flocs were able to gradually settle during the slow stirring period of the coagulation operation not just during the sedimentation operation this indicates that with increasing of the floc mass by use of photocatalyst powder the sedimentation of flocs was remarkably improved and many algal flocs could rapidly settle after they had just formed therefore many m aeruginosa cells could be removed from the supernatant during the coagulation process alone in systems of 200 and 400 mg l n tio2 dose 80 85 of the m aeruginosa cells were able to be separated from the supernatant during the coagulation process after coagulation the remaining algal cells were able to be removed within only 10 min and the removal efficiency was as high as 97 the satisfactory result is attributed to the excellent sedimentation of the algal flocs systems with 50 and 100 mg l n tio2 had lower algal removal efficiencies during coagulation 40 and 54 and in the sedimentation process 95 of algal cells were removed after 60 min which indicates that these algal cells had a lower settling velocity without n tio2 increasing the floc mass few algal cells settled during the coagulation process these algal cells began to settle during the sedimentation process and could not be satisfactorily removed during 120 min sedimentation manifesting the worst algal removal efficiency the ballasted flocs settling velocity was impacted by the degree to which the ballast medium was incorporated into the flocs mathieu and benoit 2016 this could explain the various algal removal efficiencies with different doses of photocatalyst with 200 and 400 mg l n tio2 sufficient ballast medium was incorporated into algal flocs and the floc masses were greatly increased resulting in a rapid settling velocity for 50 and 100 mg l n tio2 with less ballasting agent some insufficiently ballasted and non ballasted flocs were formed as this fraction of the flocs had a low settling velocity it would reduce the overall performance of the process thus with 7 5 mg l pafc and 200 400 mg l n tio2 all algal cells in the m aeruginosa solution 1 106 cells ml can be rapidly removed as the optimal dose of pafc was 15 mg l in our previous study with conventional treatment this technology can decrease pafc consumption by 50 besides that benefit it also reduced the treatment time due to the rapid settling velocity of flocs which can allow the hydraulic retention time hrt in drinking water treatment to be decreased however there was an issue that should be considered when applying photocatalyst as ballast particles after coagulation was there any residual photocatalyst powder in the supernatant many researchers have reported cytotoxic genotoxic and haemolytic effects of tio2 nanoparticles manosij et al 2013 canesi et al 2010 as a derivative of tio2 n tio2 might have similar toxic effects so when applying it in drinking water treatment the residual dose of n tio2 in supernatant must be controlled to guarantee the safety of water quality fig s3 shows the residual n tio2 in the supernatant during the sedimentation process it can be seen that when adding 50 200 mg l n tio2 the residual levels of n tio2 in supernatant were about 5 8 mg l which are relatively low concentrations as the supernatant would subsequently be treated by filtration in a drinking water plant the level of residual n tio2 in treated water can be well controlled on the other hand when adding 400 mg l n tio2 nearly 100 mg l remained in the supernatant after coagulation and only a small proportion settled during the sedimentation process this implies that the 400 mg l dose of ballasting agent exceeded the capacity of the algal flocs and the residual ballast material being mostly small particles tended to remain suspended in the supernatant the residual n tio2 would not only threaten the water quality but also significantly increase the filtration load of a drinking water treatment plant in general an excess dose of photocatalyst would not further enhance the coagulation and sedimentation of algal cells but would increase the residual photocatalyst in the supernatant therefore in this study 200 mg l n tio2 was the optimal dose in coagulation and sedimentation which would achieve high algal removal efficiency rapid floc settling velocity and low residual concentration of photocatalyst in the supernatant 3 2 self purification of cyanobacteria containing sludge after coagulation and sedimentation the photocatalyst ballasted algal flocs are consolidated into cyanobacteria containing sludge at the bottom of the sedimentation tank a feature of this technology is that the sludge can be self purified without adding other substances during the storage period this process is based on the reactive species produced by n tio2 under visible light which can degrade algal cells and the metabolites in sludge in this part of the research the self purification of cyanobacteria containing sludge formed by 7 5 mg l pafc and 200 mg l n tio2 powder was studied during the storage period in this process different shapes of sludge containers may influence the utilization of visible light and thereby affect the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation thus identical volumes of cyanobacteria containing sludge were added to three kinds of beakers with different heights and diameters to simulate the influence of vessel shape in drinking water plants as shown in fig 2 a chlorophyll a levels were measured to analyze the destruction of m aeruginosa cells during photocatalytic treatment of cyanobacteria containing sludge due to the attack of the reactive species formed on the surface of the photocatalyst pinho et al 2015 all m aeruginosa cells in the l beaker m beaker and h beaker were destroyed within 8 h 12 h and 16 h respectively cells in the l beaker had the greatest photocatalytic destruction efficiency and this was attributed to two causes one was that the same volume of sludge in the l beaker would have a large area of free surface which increases the area of sludge exposed to visible light and thereby captures more optical energy the other one was that the low height of the l beaker mitigated light attenuation in the cyanobacteria containing sludge devlin et al 2008 and photocatalyst at the bottom of the l beaker were also able to achieve adequate irradiation in short sludge in the l beaker had the best utilization of optical energy by contrast cells in the h beaker had the worst photocatalytic destruction efficiency due to the small exposed surface area and the tall profile which led to a low efficiency utilization of optical energy fig 2b compares the cyanobacteria containing sludge before treatment and after 32 h photocatalytic treatment in the l beaker it can be seen that the green cyanobacterial cells in the sludge had been completely destroyed while the remaining white photocatalyst powder formed flocs settled at the bottom which demonstrates satisfactory results although most cyanobacterial cells were able to be destroyed after 8 16 h in the three beakers the released mcs and other organic matter in sludges need more time to be degraded the changes in mc levels during the photocatalytic treatment of cyanobacteria containing sludge are shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the initial sludge presents high intracellular 152 μg l and low extracellular 3 25 μg l mc concentrations which means that until this moment most m aeruginosa cells were intact pinho et al 2015 the photocatalytic degradation of mcs in the l beaker was better than in the m beaker or h beaker which was due to the more effective utilization of optical energy after the 32 h treatment nearly 99 of total mcs in the sludge were able to be degraded in the l beaker and the final concentration was below the guideline value of 1 μg l for drinking water world health organization 2011 in this process a large increase in extracellular mc concentration was observed during the initial stages which is correlated to the marked decrease in the number of live cells fig 2 this indicates that in the first few hours more mcs were released from cells than were degraded by reactive species formed on the photocatalyst during 8 12 h as most m aeruginosa cells had already lysed fig 2 and there would be little ongoing release of mcs the concentration of extracellular mc reached a maximum further photocatalytic treatment time led to a substantial reduction of total mcs finally decreasing the concentration to a safe level for the sludge in the m beaker and the h beaker the photocatalytic mc degradation efficiencies were 97 and 95 respectively after 32 h treatment slightly lower than in the l beaker the corresponding final concentrations of total mc in the m beaker and the h beaker were 4 27 μg l and 7 64 μg l which are above the safe level for drinking water 1 μg l the relatively unsatisfactory degradation results might be due to the low efficiency utilization of optical energy which led to inadequate formation of reactive species in addition the inadequate generation of reactive species caused the complete cell lysis and release of most intracellular mcs in those two beakers to occur only after 12 16 h which was later than in the l beaker furthermore the degradation rate during the subsequent photocatalytic treatment time was relatively low too cod content is also an important indicator to identify whether the cyanobacteria containing sludges were effectively purified the changes in tcod and scod during the photocatalytic treatment can reflect the degradation and solubilization of organic matter jonathan et al 2015 from fig 4 most cod in the initial sludge was insoluble and the tcod was nearly 73 mg l far beyond the environmental quality standards for level iii surface water in china 20 mg l gb 3838 2002 which is the maximum threshold value for cod in drinking water sources national environmental protection agency of china 2002 after 32 h treatment the final tcod contents in the three beakers were all below 20 mg l thus the organic matter contents of the sludges were reduced to safe levels even more impressively the final tcod contents of sludges in the l beaker and the m beaker were both below 15 mg l meeting the environmental quality standards for level ii surface water in china gb 3838 2002 which represents a high quality for drinking water national environmental protection agency of china 2002 in the process the degradation efficiencies in the l beaker m beaker and h beaker were respectively 84 79 and 73 similar to mcs organic matter within the sludge in the l beaker was able to be degraded more effectively and at a higher rate than in the m beaker or the h beaker during the photocatalysis the increase in scod concentration during the initial stage indicated a significant disruption of cyanobacterial cells in the sludge and the release of intracellular biopolymers proteins and sugars from sludge flocs into the soluble phase which led to the solubilization of organic matter tyagi and lo 2013 according to fig 4 the maximum scod levels of sludges in the l beaker m beaker and h beaker occurred at 8 h 12 h and 16 h respectively which correlates with the time of m aeruginosa cell destruction after that the soluble organic matter concentration rapidly reduced to a low level greatly increasing the water quality interestingly at the end of treatment most of the remaining cod was insoluble cod while the scod was able to be rapidly degraded in the final stage the insoluble cod decreased slowly there are two possible reasons one is that most of the remaining organics might be non degradable matter such as humic acid the other is that after treatment some organic matter was still contained in the photocatalyst flocs fig 2b and was difficult to release into the soluble phase due to the binding within the flocs however this would not alter the satisfactory result achieved for reduction of cod therefore the photocatalytic treatment of cyanobacteria containing sludge resulted in simultaneous solubilization of the organics and the oxidation of the solubilized organic components of the sludge as realized by a decrease in both the tcod and scod values fig 5 shows the mlvss content in cyanobacteria containing sludge before and after the photocatalytic degradation the treatment caused reductions of 80 85 in sludge mlvss and the reduction in the l beaker was slightly better than in the other beakers as mlvss can stand for solid organics or biomass concentration the changes in mlvss concentrations directly reflect the degradation of cyanobacterial cells and their metabolites in this research thus these observations indicate that most of the biomass in sludge was degraded during the sludge self purification period which corresponds to the above results for degradation of cyanobacterial cells mcs and cod photocatalysis can non selectively degrade target pollutants through reactive species attack leading to mineralization of pollutants to non harmful end products fotiou et al 2015 to assess the mineralization degree of pollutants in sludge the percentage ratios of released nh4 no3 no2 to tn and po4 3 to tp were measured to reflect the mineralization of n containing and p containing organic matter respectively as shown in fig 6 a after 32 h irradiation the proportion of nh4 tn was 39 in the l beaker while the results in the m beaker and h beaker were 34 and 27 respectively unlike the case for nh4 the percentage ratios of released no3 to tn in the three beakers were not distinct during the photocatalytic treatment no3 tn in the three beakers were12 14 lower than the proportion of nh4 to tn fig 6b it can be seen that more nh4 ions were produced than no3 ions in the degradation process for n containing organic matter the reason was that during illumination the organic nitrogen was first transformed to nh4 and then the formed nh4 was photo oxidised to no3 in the aqueous phase rosana et al 2001 this was a relatively slow process and the conversion yield of nh4 to no3 was low as well rosana et al 2001 in contrast to no3 and nh4 the no2 content did not increase during the mineralization some no2 content was detected in the initial sludge but it rapidly vanished with increasing irradiation time fig 6c it is possible that the no2 ions are oxidized rapidly into no3 ions during the photocatalytic process rosana et al 2001 therefore in the aqueous phase the mineralization percent of n containing organics were about 40 50 and most of the converted inorganic ions were nh4 and no3 some n containing organics might still remain in sludge which correspond to the 16 27 of residual cod after treatment fig 4 other n containing organics might be converted into oxides of nitrogen no x species in the gas phase from the oxidation of these organics by reactive species which can explain the losses of nitrogen in the mass balances sergi et al 2017 for the mineralization of p containing organic matter the percentage ratio of released po4 3 to tp increased from 10 to about 47 in the three beakers fig 6d the degree of tp mineralization was similar to that for tn thus after 32 h photocatalytic treatment the mineralization percent of organic matter in cyanobacteria containing sludge was more than 40 50 3 3 direct reuse of purified cyanobacteria containing sludge for coagulation and photocatalytic degradation the above measurements indicated that all cyanobacterial cells in the sludge were destroyed and that the organics and mc contents in the sludge were at safe levels after treatment which mean that the purified sludge met the stringent quality requirements for drinking water and can be directly added to raw water in the feed to a drinking water treatment plant however can the coagulant and photocatalyst in purified sludge be effectively reused to purify the cyanobacteria contaminated water and the cyanobacterial sludge again to test this possibility the purified sludge was directly added to 1 l of 1 106 cells ml raw m aeruginosa solution the same as in the initial treatment to repeat the coagulation and photocatalysis process above for two times as shown in fig 7 with dosing purified sludge only 70 of the algal cells were removed from the supernatant in the two times reuse treatments after adding 3 4 5 mg l pafc almost all cells could be removed and the flocs that formed can be settled at the bottom as the dose of pafc in the initial treatment was 7 5 mg l this observation implies that nearly 50 of the pafc added in coagulation can be reused after the purification of cyanobacteria containing sludge however as half of the dosed pafc in coagulation can be reused where is the lost pafc in this technology to investigate this question the concentrations of al and fe were measured during the coagulation and photocatalytic degradation processes these measurements revealed that when 7 5 mg l pafc was dosed into the cyanobacteria contaminated water 1060 46 μg al and 276 54 μg fe were present in solution table 1 after coagulation nearly one third of the dosed pafc remained in the 930 ml supernatant when the 70 ml of cyanobacteria containing sludge was separated from the supernatant only about 70 of dosed coagulant remained in the sludge in the present technology the coagulant in supernatant cannot be reused which is one of the reasons for the lost pafc another reason for the loss of coagulant might be the hydrolysis of pafc in the coagulation and photocatalytic degradation processes the hydrolysis of pafc will cause some of the al and fe ions to form hydroxide precipitates cheng 2002 and lose the ability to neutralize electronegative m aeruginosa although the hydrolysis rate of polymeric coagulant such as pafc is much slower cheng 2002 there will inevitably be some al and fe ion hydrolyzing in sludge during the long time stirring an interesting phenomenon evident in table 1 is that the contents of al and fe in the soluble phase of purified sludge were very low that s because after the destruction of algal cells the dissolved al and fe ions in sludge will rapidly coagulate the n tio2 powder thereby forming the photocatalyst flocs and completely settling at the bottom fig 2b thus most of the reused coagulant might be contained in the photocatalyst flocs not in the interstitial sludge water when the treated sludge is added to raw water the reused photocatalyst flocs will be broken up by the rapid mixing phase of the coagulation process flocs would then form again from the al and fe ions n tio2 powder and m aeruginosa cells during the slow stirring period of the coagulation process in the sludge reuse treatments the water quality of supernatant after coagulation was measured table 2 with about half the coagulant dose of the initial treatment the turbidities of supernatant in the two times reuse treatments had no significant differences from the initial treatment which was a satisfactory result however the concentration of inorganic ions including no3 nh4 and po4 3 increased when reusing the purified sludge which was due to the mineralization of organic matter during photocatalytic degradation corresponding to fig 6 the inorganic ions produced through mineralization will be directly added to the raw m aeruginosa solution with the reuse of sludge as these inorganic ions cannot be thoroughly coagulated their concentrations in supernatant will rise in the sludge reuse treatments fortunately after sludge reuse treatments the inorganic ions concentrations in the supernatant were still at safe levels according to the environmental quality standards for level iii surface water in china gb 3838 2002 and the guidelines for drinking water quality of world health organization national environmental protection agency of china 2002 world health organization 2011 even so this potential issue with the technology should be heeded to solve this problem the sludge reuse time must be carefully controlled or less mass of purified sludge should be added after several iterations of reuse the photocatalytic degradation of cyanobacteria containing sludge formed in the initial and reuse treatments were studied and compared as shown in table 3 after 32 h photocatalysis all algal cells were destroyed in the two times sludge reuse treatments and the concentrations of scod in the reuse treatments were similar to that in the initial treatment however the removal efficiencies of tcod reduced from 84 to about 78 although the degradation efficiency of organic matter slightly decreased the cod content in sludge still met the above mentioned level iii surface water standard the degradation efficiency of mcs in the reuse treatments was nearly 97 which had no significant difference from the initial treatment 99 but as the initial concentration of mcs is too high the mc content in sludge still exceeded the guideline value of 1 μg l for drinking water however in this technology when mixing approximately 70 ml of treated sludge with 1 l of raw water the mc content in the resulting solution can be below 1 μg l which is still a safe level for drinking water thus although the degradation efficiencies of organic matter and mcs by the photocatalyst were slightly reduced the sludge formed in each of the two reuse treatments can still be satisfactorily self purified 3 4 implications the proposed technology combines ballasted coagulation and photocatalysis to solve the poor sedimentation of cyanobacteria and enable the formed cyanobacteria containing sludge to be self purified simultaneously the photocatalyst water and some of the coagulant in the purified sludge can be directly reused in this technology fig 8 illustrates the mechanism and application of this technology in drinking water plants by adding coagulant and photocatalyst powder to enhance coagulation the required coagulant dose can be reduced while also yielding an excellent algal removal efficiency in addition due to the incorporation of photocatalyst powder into algal flocs the flocs masses are greatly increased leading to the rapid sedimentation of those ballasted algal flocs after sedimentation the treated water is separated off leaving the coagulated cyanobacteria containing sludge during the sludge storage period the reactive species will be formed on the surface of the photocatalyst that is contained in sludge due to the incidence of visible light and this would lead to the sludge being self purified to a safe level in this process due to the attack of reactive species cyanobacterial cells in sludge break up releasing the intracellular organic matter and cyanotoxins and then the released pollutants are degraded by photocatalysis when the treatment is finished the concentrations of organic matter and mcs in sludge have met the quality requirement for drinking water and the remaining photocatalyst powders in flocs will settle at the bottom when the purified sludge is directly added to the raw cyanobacteria contaminated water for reuse all algal cells can be removed with only half the coagulant dose of the initial ballasted coagulation and without dosing any additional high cost photocatalyst besides with reuse of the photocatalyst the sludge formed in the reuse treatments can also be purified to a safe level and the purified sludge might hence continue to be reused several times thus there are many advantages for the application of this technology in drinking water plants 1 all the algal cells can be rapidly and completely removed by the ballasted coagulation in conventional drinking water treatment algal cells are difficult to settle and some cells would remain in the supernatant and cause filter clogging and the production of disinfection byproducts fig s4 on the other hand the rapid sedimentation of algal cells would decrease the hrt in the drinking water plant and hence increase the efficiency of water treatment 2 half of the required coagulant dose can be reduced by through reuse of the purified sludge formed by photocatalyst ballasted coagulation cutting the required coagulant consumption not only decreases the expenditure on coagulant but also reduces the quantity of metal ions released into water which can cause secondary pollution 3 the cyanobacteria containing sludge can be self purified and directly reused the reuse of the high cost photocatalyst will remarkably reduce the cost of this technology and increase the feasibility in practical drinking water treatment plant furthermore the reuse of purified water will help address the shortage of water in some developing countries with the sludge reuse no pollutant will be discharged with this technology which satisfies the requirements of green technology however some potential issues associated with this technology should be heeded as well the reuse of purified sludge might cause the accumulation of inorganic ions due to the mineralization of organic matter and the degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst will gradually reduce with the perpetuation of reuse to solve these potential issues repeated reuse of the same sludge must be carefully controlled and the mixing proportion between treated sludge and raw water should be appropriately adjusted in drinking water treatment photocatalyst used in this study should be improved as well although n tio2 can thoroughly degrade the high concentration of algal cells and metabolites in sludge the relatively long treatment time would limit its application in drinking water treatment plants thus other photocatalysts with more intensive photocatalytic efficiency under visible light irradiation should be used in the future in addition the technology was applied for the treatment of unicellular m aeruginosa in this experiment however is there the possibility of some problems if it were used for filamentous cyanobacteria because the physiology and morphology of filamentous cyanobacteria are different from the unicellular cyanobacteria the behaviors of the cyanobacterial coagulation and degradation might be different in this technology on one hand unicellular m aeruginosa can be enveloped into flocs which can protect cells against the nasty attack from outside whereas filamentous cyanobacteria with long filaments is hard to be wrapped and prone to suffering physical damage and releasing cyanotoxins during coagulation li et al 2018 on the other hand the metabolites produced by filamentous cyanobacteria are different from m aeruginosa such as 2 methylisoborneol geosmin and cylindrospermopsin compared to mcs the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of these metabolites might be lower pelaez et al 2012 in the future we will study the behaviors of filamentous cyanobacteria during the process to verify our concerns and solve the possible problems of filamentous cyanobacteria 4 conclusion cyanobacterial cells 1 106 cells ml can be thoroughly removed by dosing 7 5 mg l pafc and 200 mg l n tio2 powder in this process all the algal cells were able to rapidly settle within only 10 min after coagulation and the removal efficiency was as high as 97 compared to conventional drinking water treatment the required pafc dose was reduced to about half after coagulation and sedimentation the cyanobacteria containing sludge that is formed can be self purified under visible light due to the photocatalyst powder incorporated into cyanobacterial flocs by ballasted coagulation during this period sludge in containers with large free surface area and low height l beaker can be most effectively purified through photocatalysis due to the high efficiency utilization of optical energy in the l beaker most cyanobacterial cells in sludge can be destroyed within 8 h 99 of total mcs 84 of tcod and 85 of mlvss can be degraded within 32 h and their final contents were reduced to safe levels which permits direct reuse for drinking water production when the purified sludge was directly added to raw cyanobacteria contaminated water nearly half of the dosed coagulant in the initial treatment was still active on the other hand the reused photocatalyst can still effectively purify the newly formed cyanobacteria containing sludge to a safe condition and the photocatalytic efficiency was just slightly lower than the initial treatment thus the combination of photocatalyst ballasted coagulation with reuse of sludge for further water treatment is a cost effective and environmentally beneficial technology to simultaneously purify cyanobacteria contaminated water and the produced cyanobacterial sludge in drinking water treatment acknowledgements this work was supported by the natural science foundation of china 51478251

19449,removing harmful cyanobacteria intact by coagulation can prevent cell lysis and toxin release which provides many benefits for drinking water production including reduction of the burden on subsequent processes and guaranteeing the water quality but the electronegativity and buoyancy of cyanobacterial cells make them settle slowly and their accumulation and concentration in flocs would still have severe adverse effects in this study we introduced a photocatalyst powder to act as a ballasting agent in the coagulation process and to degrade the cells and cyanotoxins during sludge storage results showed that adding n tio2 would decrease the coagulant dose to half of the conventional value and also allow microcystis aeruginosa cells to completely settle within 10 min during sludge storage the algal cells cyanotoxins and other organics in sludge would be degraded to safe levels after 32 h visible light irradiation meanwhile the n tio2 water and some of the coagulant in purified sludge will be directly and safely reused thus this is an environmentally friendly and cost effective technology which incorporates photocatalyst in algal flocs to enhance coagulation and sedimentation and to enable the sludge produced to be self purified under visible light graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacteria photocatalysis ballasted coagulation self purification sludge reuse 1 introduction proliferation of cyanobacteria is becoming a serious water quality problem in lakes and reservoirs worldwide de wit et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 stephanie 2012 many natural and artificial lakes have undergone eutrophication and suffered from blooms of harmful cyanobacteria hartshorn et al 2016 however cyanobacteria contaminated water is still used for drinking water purposes in some developing countries due to the shortage of better water sources qu et al 2012 the presence of cyanobacteria and their metabolites in drinking water may degrade water quality and cause the production of unpleasant tastes and odours more seriously several cyanobacterial species are potent producers of a variety of toxins poisonous to animals and humans zamyadi et al 2012 tracey et al 2011 for example microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa the most notorious species in eutrophic surface waters adamovsky et al 2015 li et al 2014 can produce a suite of hepatotoxins known as microcystins mariani et al 2015 johan et al 2017 blake and raj 2013 in drinking water plants the conventional treatment process includes coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection zhao and zhang 2011 for toxic cyanobacteria removal the coagulation sedimentation process plays the most important role xu et al 2016 if the cyanobacterial cells were not adequately removed from drinking water in this process residual cells in the supernatant would have serious impacts on the subsequent processes for example residual cyanobacterial cells in water would cause filter clogging and shorten the filter runs ma and liu 2002 on the other hand the metabolites produced by algal cells are precursors of disinfection by products ma and liu 2002 which can increase the required dose of oxidant in the disinfection process however the coagulation and sedimentation of toxic cyanobacteria in conventional drinking water treatment is not satisfactory from other perspectives the cyanobacteria and their metabolites can increase the electronegativity of the colloid surfaces which increases the necessary dosage of cationic coagulant zhao and zhang 2011 high doses of coagulant can increase the concentration of metal ions in water resulting in secondary pollution on the other hand the settling of cyanobacterial flocs in the sedimentation process needs a long time due to the buoyancy of algal cells noyma et al 2016 which is adverse to efficient drinking water treatment therefore it is necessary to seek enhanced coagulation methods to reduce the coagulant dose and simultaneously improve the settleability of flocs for the treatment of cyanobacteria contaminated water after coagulation cyanobacterial flocs settle in a sedimentation tank forming cyanobacteria containing sludge in this process the toxic cyanobacteria and cell bound toxins will accumulate in the tank before being discharged the accumulated cyanobacterial cells may easily die and decompose during storage releasing large amounts of toxins and other harmful substances into the sludge the contaminated sludge discharged into water bodies is reported to be toxic to aquatic life while that disposed of in landfill increases the land requirement of the landfill site abhilash and ahammed 2014 thus the cyanobacteria containing sludge also needs to be carefully treated in drinking water plants ballasted coagulation is a gravity based physicochemical separation process usually employed to remove particulate matter in drinking water treatment plants gasperi et al 2012 the process involves the incorporation of a ballasting agent in flocs during coagulation to increase the floc density and size mathieu and benoit 2016 and then accelerate the sedimentation through increasing floc masses gorin et al 2015 in our previous study ballasted coagulation was applied to solve the issues caused by cyanobacterial cells in coagulation and sedimentation processes within drinking water plants pei et al 2017 ballast particles such as clay soil and sand serve as seed grains when coagulation proceeds accelerating the sedimentation through increasing floc masses gorin et al 2015 simultaneously the small ballast particles would be able to adsorb the negatively charged cyanobacterial cells and metabolites improving the algae removal efficiency and reducing the coagulant dose pei et al 2017 however the common ballast particles just promote separation of the cyanobacterial cells from supernatant in the coagulation and sedimentation processes the settled cyanobacteria and their harmful metabolites in sludge still could not be eliminated therefore we considered upgrading the ballast materials to empower them to degrade the harmful cyanobacteria and their metabolites especially the cyanotoxins while they continue to play their marvelous roles in the coagulation and sedimentation processes thus we attempted to replace the conventional ballast materials with photocatalyst powder such as nitrogen doped tio2 n tio2 with nitrogen doping in tio2 lattice to narrow its band gap n tio2 can make use of visible light to generate reactive oxidizing species so as to degrade cyanobacterial cells and organic matter choi et al 2007 sacco et al 2015 vaiano et al 2015 meanwhile we also attempted to directly reuse the formed cyanobacteria containing sludge including the photocatalyst water and coagulant in the sludge after it has been purified through photocatalysis to reduce the cost of this technology with no pollutant discharged but can photocatalyst be used as ballast particles can photocatalyst still maintain its powerful photocatalytic potency when it is enmeshed in cyanobacterial sludge can the purified sludge be directly reused in this technology if the answers were positive we should be able to provide a cost effective and environmentally beneficial technology that could simultaneously purify the cyanobacteria contaminated water and the cyanobacterial sludge formed in drinking water plants until now no relevant research on this has been reported 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 cyanobacterial culture m aeruginosa fachb 905 purchased from institute of hydrobiology

vigorous stirring for 1 h after heating at 80 c for 3 h the ph of the solution was adjusted with naoh to a value of 7 and the transparent solution became a white sol gel the sol gel was then calcined at 450 c for 3 h with a 5 k min heating rate lastly the calcined white solid was ground and sieved 40 μm before use kontos et al 2008 nitrogen was successfully doped into the tio2 framework as confirmed through the n h peak in fourier transform infrared spectroscopy bruker alpha t fig s1 the band gap of the prepared n tio2 was found to be 2 31 ev by the measurement of photoluminescence

cyanobacterial coagulation and sedimentation the coagulation experiments were performed with a six paddle stirrer zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co china in a series of 1000 ml beakers containing 1000 ml of m aeruginosa cultures the initial m aeruginosa concentration was diluted with deionized water to 1 106 cells ml m aeruginosa solution temperature 18 7 c ph 7 26 turbidity 17 7 ntu polyaluminium ferric chloride pafc was used as the coagulant in this experiment after pafc and n tio2 were simultaneously added the m aeruginosa solution was stirred at 250 rpm for 1 min and 40 rpm for another 20 min the n tio2 doses in m aeruginosa solution were 0 50 100 200 and 400 mg l as the optimal dose of pafc was 15 mg l for treating 106 cells ml of m aeruginosa cells jin et al 2017 we used half the optimal dose 7 5 mg l in each system to identify the enhancement of cyanobacterial coagulation by n tio2 algal removal efficiencies were measured for both the coagulation and the sedimentation process samples collected from 2 cm below the surface were characterised by od680 using a spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan that could calculate the algal cell density in supernatant all the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results are presented as the mean values and standard deviations 2 3 photocatalytic purification of cyanobacteria containing sludge in the system with 200 mg l n tio2 after coagulation and sedimentation 930 ml supernatant was removed leaving 70 ml of lab simulated cyanobacteria containing sludge the same volume of sludge was transferred to 3 kinds of cylindrical quartzose beakers a low beaker l beaker diameter height 7 cm 5 cm a medium height beaker m beaker diameter height 5 cm 6 cm and a high beaker h beaker diameter height 4 cm 8 cm these were then covered with thin transparent film the sludge in these beakers was held at the intended temperature 25 c and irradiated with a 55 w led lamp fsl co china positioned above the surface of the sludge the distance between the sludge surface and the led lamp was 2 cm and the light intensity was 30 000 lux the cyanobacteria containing sludge was magnetically stirred

standard deviation sd 2 4 the reuse of purified cyanobacteria containing sludge after visible light irradiation for 32 h the purified cyanobacteria containing sludge in the l beaker was directly added to 1 l of 1 106 cells ml raw m aeruginosa solution in this technology adding only the purified sludge could not satisfactorily coagulate all algal cells thus 0 6 mg l pafc was also dosed with the appropriate pafc dose all algal cells were aggregated to flocs and settled next a 930 ml volume of supernatant was removed and the remaining 70 ml of cyanobacteria containing sludge was treated with the photocatalytic treatment mentioned above this constituted the first time reuse the purified sludge in the first time reuse was collected and the procedure above was repeated for that material which then constituted the second time reuse the experiment was performed in triplicate and the data is expressed as the respective mean standard deviation sd 2 5 analysis methods 2 5 1 residual n tio2 after coagulation the residual n tio2 in supernatant was measured at 30 60 90 and 120 min into the sedimentation process in each system 100 ml supernatant was sampled and heated to evaporate the solution to about 10 ml then the condensed solution was centrifuged at 11 000 g for 10 min discarding the supernatant and retaining the remaining white solid the white solid was washed 3 times and dried at 60 c for 24 h yielding pure n tio2 powder lastly the n tio2 powder was weighed and the concentration of residual n tio2 in the supernatant could thus be calculated 2 5 2 chlorophyll a to

software version 16 0 and the statistical significance bands were defined as 0 01 p 0 05 and p 0 01 all statistical analyses were carried out using origin 9 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 ballasted coagulation of cyanobacterial cells with photocatalyst powder fig 1 shows that photocatalyst containing algal flocs were able to gradually settle during the slow stirring period of the coagulation operation not just during the sedimentation operation this indicates that with increasing of the floc mass by use of photocatalyst powder the sedimentation of flocs was remarkably improved and many algal flocs could rapidly settle after they had just formed therefore many m aeruginosa cells could be removed from the supernatant during the coagulation process alone in systems of 200 and 400 mg l n tio2 dose 80 85 of the m aeruginosa cells were able to be separated from the supernatant during the coagulation process after coagulation the remaining algal cells were able to be removed within only 10 min and the removal efficiency was as high as 97 the satisfactory result is attributed to the excellent sedimentation of the algal flocs systems with 50 and 100 mg l n tio2 had lower algal removal efficiencies during coagulation 40 and 54 and in the sedimentation process 95 of algal cells were removed after 60 min which indicates that these algal cells had a lower settling velocity without n tio2 increasing the floc mass few algal cells settled during the coagulation process these algal cells began to settle during the sedimentation process and could not be satisfactorily removed during 120 min sedimentation manifesting the worst algal removal efficiency the ballasted flocs settling velocity was impacted by the degree to which the ballast medium was incorporated into the flocs mathieu and benoit 2016 this could explain the various algal removal efficiencies with different doses of photocatalyst with 200 and 400 mg l n tio2 sufficient ballast medium was incorporated into algal flocs and the floc masses were greatly increased resulting in a rapid settling velocity for 50 and 100 mg l n tio2 with less ballasting agent some insufficiently ballasted and non ballasted flocs were formed as this fraction of the flocs had a low settling velocity it would reduce the overall performance of the process thus with 7 5 mg l pafc and 200 400 mg l n tio2 all algal cells in the m aeruginosa solution 1 106 cells ml can be rapidly removed as the optimal dose of pafc was 15 mg l in our previous study with conventional treatment this technology can decrease pafc consumption by 50 besides that benefit it also reduced the treatment time due to the rapid settling velocity of flocs which can allow the hydraulic retention time hrt in drinking water treatment to be decreased however there was an issue that should be considered when applying photocatalyst as ballast particles after coagulation was there any residual photocatalyst powder in the supernatant many researchers have reported cytotoxic genotoxic and haemolytic effects of tio2 nanoparticles manosij et al 2013 canesi et al 2010 as a derivative of tio2 n tio2 might have similar toxic effects so when applying it in drinking water treatment the residual dose of n tio2 in supernatant must be controlled to guarantee the safety of water quality fig s3 shows the residual n tio2 in the supernatant during the sedimentation process it can be seen that when adding 50 200 mg l n tio2 the residual levels of n tio2 in supernatant were about 5 8 mg l which are relatively low concentrations as the supernatant would subsequently be treated by filtration in a drinking water plant the level of residual n tio2 in treated water can be well controlled on the other hand when adding 400 mg l n tio2 nearly 100 mg l remained in the supernatant after coagulation and only a small proportion settled during the sedimentation process this implies that the 400 mg l dose of ballasting agent exceeded the capacity of the algal flocs and the residual ballast material being mostly small particles tended to remain suspended in the supernatant the residual n tio2 would not only threaten the water quality but also significantly increase the filtration load of a drinking water treatment plant in general an excess dose of photocatalyst would not further enhance the coagulation and sedimentation of algal cells but would increase the residual photocatalyst in the supernatant therefore in this study 200 mg l n tio2 was the optimal dose in coagulation and sedimentation which would achieve high algal removal efficiency rapid floc settling velocity and low residual concentration of photocatalyst in the supernatant 3 2 self purification of cyanobacteria containing sludge after coagulation and sedimentation the photocatalyst ballasted algal flocs are consolidated into cyanobacteria containing sludge at the bottom of the sedimentation tank a feature of this technology is that the sludge can be self purified without adding other substances during the storage period this process is based on the reactive species produced by n tio2 under visible light which can degrade algal cells and the metabolites in sludge in this part of the research the self purification of cyanobacteria containing sludge formed by 7 5 mg l pafc and 200 mg l n tio2 powder was studied during the storage period in this process different shapes of sludge containers may influence the utilization of visible light and thereby affect the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation thus identical volumes of cyanobacteria containing sludge were added to three kinds of beakers with different heights and diameters to simulate the influence of vessel shape in drinking water plants as shown in fig 2 a chlorophyll a levels were measured to analyze the destruction of m aeruginosa cells during photocatalytic treatment of cyanobacteria containing sludge due to the attack of the reactive species formed on the surface of the photocatalyst pinho et al 2015 all m aeruginosa cells in the l beaker m beaker and h beaker were destroyed within 8 h 12 h and 16 h respectively cells in the l beaker had the greatest photocatalytic destruction efficiency and this was attributed to two causes one was that the same volume of sludge in the l beaker would have a large area of free surface which increases the area of sludge exposed to visible light and thereby captures more optical energy the other one was that the low height of the l beaker mitigated light attenuation in the cyanobacteria containing sludge devlin et al 2008 and photocatalyst at the bottom of the l beaker were also able to achieve adequate irradiation in short sludge in the l beaker had the best utilization of optical energy by contrast cells in the h beaker had the worst photocatalytic destruction efficiency due to the small exposed surface area and the tall profile which led to a low efficiency utilization of optical energy fig 2b compares the cyanobacteria containing sludge before treatment and after 32 h photocatalytic treatment in the l beaker it can be seen that the green cyanobacterial cells in the sludge had been completely destroyed while the remaining white photocatalyst powder formed flocs settled at the bottom which demonstrates satisfactory results although most cyanobacterial cells were able to be destroyed after 8 16 h in the three beakers the released mcs and other organic matter in sludges need more time to be degraded the changes in mc levels during the photocatalytic treatment of cyanobacteria containing sludge are shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the initial sludge presents high intracellular 152 μg l and low extracellular 3 25 μg l mc concentrations which means that until this moment most m aeruginosa cells were intact pinho et al 2015 the photocatalytic degradation of mcs in the l beaker was better than in the m beaker or h beaker which was due to the more effective utilization of optical energy after the 32 h treatment nearly 99 of total mcs in the sludge were able to be degraded in the l beaker and the final concentration was below the guideline value of 1 μg l for drinking water world health organization 2011 in this process a large increase in extracellular mc concentration was observed during the initial stages which is correlated to the marked decrease in the number of live cells fig 2 this indicates that in the first few hours more mcs were released from cells than were degraded by reactive species formed on the photocatalyst during 8 12 h as most m aeruginosa cells had already lysed fig 2 and there would be little ongoing release of mcs the concentration of extracellular mc reached a maximum further photocatalytic treatment time led to a substantial reduction of total mcs finally decreasing the concentration to a safe level for the sludge in the m beaker and the h beaker the photocatalytic mc degradation efficiencies were 97 and 95 respectively after 32 h treatment slightly lower than in the l beaker the corresponding final concentrations of total mc in the m beaker and the h beaker were 4 27 μg l and 7 64 μg l which are above the safe level for drinking water 1 μg l the relatively unsatisfactory degradation results might be due to the low efficiency utilization of optical energy which led to inadequate formation of reactive species in addition the inadequate generation of reactive species caused the complete cell lysis and release of most intracellular mcs in those two beakers to occur only after 12 16 h which was later than in the l beaker furthermore the degradation rate during the subsequent photocatalytic treatment time was relatively low too cod content is also an important indicator to identify whether the cyanobacteria containing sludges were effectively purified the changes in tcod and scod during the photocatalytic treatment can reflect the degradation and solubilization of organic matter jonathan et al 2015 from fig 4 most cod in the initial sludge was insoluble and the tcod was nearly 73 mg l far beyond the environmental quality standards for level iii surface water in china 20 mg l gb 3838 2002 which is the maximum threshold value for cod in drinking water sources national environmental protection agency of china 2002 after 32 h treatment the final tcod contents in the three beakers were all below 20 mg l thus the organic matter contents of the sludges were reduced to safe levels even more impressively the final tcod contents of sludges in the l beaker and the m beaker were both below 15 mg l meeting the environmental quality standards for level ii surface water in china gb 3838 2002 which represents a high quality for drinking water national environmental protection agency of china 2002 in the process the degradation efficiencies in the l beaker m beaker and h beaker were respectively 84 79 and 73 similar to mcs organic matter within the sludge in the l beaker was able to be degraded more effectively and at a higher rate than in the m beaker or the h beaker during the photocatalysis the increase in scod concentration during the initial stage indicated a significant disruption of cyanobacterial cells in the sludge and the release of intracellular biopolymers proteins and sugars from sludge flocs into the soluble phase which led to the solubilization of organic matter tyagi and lo 2013 according to fig 4 the maximum scod levels of sludges in the l beaker m beaker and h beaker occurred at 8 h 12 h and 16 h respectively which correlates with the time of m aeruginosa cell destruction after that the soluble organic matter concentration rapidly reduced to a low level greatly increasing the water quality interestingly at the end of treatment most of the remaining cod was insoluble cod while the scod was able to be rapidly degraded in the final stage the insoluble cod decreased slowly there are two possible reasons one is that most of the remaining organics might be non degradable matter such as humic acid the other is that after treatment some organic matter was still contained in the photocatalyst flocs fig 2b and was difficult to release into the soluble phase due to the binding within the flocs however this would not alter the satisfactory result achieved for reduction of cod therefore the photocatalytic treatment of cyanobacteria containing sludge resulted in simultaneous solubilization of the organics and the oxidation of the solubilized organic components of the sludge as realized by a decrease in both the tcod and scod values fig 5 shows the mlvss content in cyanobacteria containing sludge before and after the photocatalytic degradation the treatment caused reductions of 80 85 in sludge mlvss and the reduction in the l beaker was slightly better than in the other beakers as mlvss can stand for solid organics or biomass concentration the changes in mlvss concentrations directly reflect the degradation of cyanobacterial cells and their metabolites in this research thus these observations indicate that most of the biomass in sludge was degraded during the sludge self purification period which corresponds to the above results for degradation of cyanobacterial cells mcs and cod photocatalysis can non selectively degrade target pollutants through reactive species attack leading to mineralization of pollutants to non harmful end products fotiou et al 2015 to assess the mineralization degree of pollutants in sludge the percentage ratios of released nh4 no3 no2 to tn and po4 3 to tp were measured to reflect the mineralization of n containing and p containing organic matter respectively as shown in fig 6 a after 32 h irradiation the proportion of nh4 tn was 39 in the l beaker while the results in the m beaker and h beaker were 34 and 27 respectively unlike the case for nh4 the percentage ratios of released no3 to tn in the three beakers were not distinct during the photocatalytic treatment no3 tn in the three beakers were12 14 lower than the proportion of nh4 to tn fig 6b it can be seen that more nh4 ions were produced than no3 ions in the degradation process for n containing organic matter the reason was that during illumination the organic nitrogen was first transformed to nh4 and then the formed nh4 was photo oxidised to no3 in the aqueous phase rosana et al 2001 this was a relatively slow process and the conversion yield of nh4 to no3 was low as well rosana et al 2001 in contrast to no3 and nh4 the no2 content did not increase during the mineralization some no2 content was detected in the initial sludge but it rapidly vanished with increasing irradiation time fig 6c it is possible that the no2 ions are oxidized rapidly into no3 ions during the photocatalytic process rosana et al 2001 therefore in the aqueous phase the mineralization percent of n containing organics were about 40 50 and most of the converted inorganic ions were nh4 and no3 some n containing organics might still remain in sludge which correspond to the 16 27 of residual cod after treatment fig 4 other n containing organics might be converted into oxides of nitrogen no x species in the gas phase from the oxidation of these organics by reactive species which can explain the losses of nitrogen in the mass balances sergi et al 2017 for the mineralization of p containing organic matter the percentage ratio of released po4 3 to tp increased from 10 to about 47 in the three beakers fig 6d the degree of tp mineralization was similar to that for tn thus after 32 h photocatalytic treatment the mineralization percent of organic matter in cyanobacteria containing sludge was more than 40 50 3 3 direct reuse of purified cyanobacteria containing sludge for coagulation and photocatalytic degradation the above measurements indicated that all cyanobacterial cells in the sludge were destroyed and that the organics and mc contents in the sludge were at safe levels after treatment which mean that the purified sludge met the stringent quality requirements for drinking water and can be directly added to raw water in the feed to a drinking water treatment plant however can the coagulant and photocatalyst in purified sludge be effectively reused to purify the cyanobacteria contaminated water and the cyanobacterial sludge again to test this possibility the purified sludge was directly added to 1 l of 1 106 cells ml raw m aeruginosa solution the same as in the initial treatment to repeat the coagulation and photocatalysis process above for two times as shown in fig 7 with dosing purified sludge only 70 of the algal cells were removed from the supernatant in the two times reuse treatments after adding 3 4 5 mg l pafc almost all cells could be removed and the flocs that formed can be settled at the bottom as the dose of pafc in the initial treatment was 7 5 mg l this observation implies that nearly 50 of the pafc added in coagulation can be reused after the purification of cyanobacteria containing sludge however as half of the dosed pafc in coagulation can be reused where is the lost pafc in this technology to investigate this question the concentrations of al and fe were measured during the coagulation and photocatalytic degradation processes these measurements revealed that when 7 5 mg l pafc was dosed into the cyanobacteria contaminated water 1060 46 μg al and 276 54 μg fe were present in solution table 1 after coagulation nearly one third of the dosed pafc remained in the 930 ml supernatant when the 70 ml of cyanobacteria containing sludge was separated from the supernatant only about 70 of dosed coagulant remained in the sludge in the present technology the coagulant in supernatant cannot be reused which is one of the reasons for the lost pafc another reason for the loss of coagulant might be the hydrolysis of pafc in the coagulation and photocatalytic degradation processes the hydrolysis of pafc will cause some of the al and fe ions to form hydroxide precipitates cheng 2002 and lose the ability to neutralize electronegative m aeruginosa although the hydrolysis rate of polymeric coagulant such as pafc is much slower cheng 2002 there will inevitably be some al and fe ion hydrolyzing in sludge during the long time stirring an interesting phenomenon evident in table 1 is that the contents of al and fe in the soluble phase of purified sludge were very low that s because after the destruction of algal cells the dissolved al and fe ions in sludge will rapidly coagulate the n tio2 powder thereby forming the photocatalyst flocs and completely settling at the bottom fig 2b thus most of the reused coagulant might be contained in the photocatalyst flocs not in the interstitial sludge water when the treated sludge is added to raw water the reused photocatalyst flocs will be broken up by the rapid mixing phase of the coagulation process flocs would then form again from the al and fe ions n tio2 powder and m aeruginosa cells during the slow stirring period of the coagulation process in the sludge reuse treatments the water quality of supernatant after coagulation was measured table 2 with about half the coagulant dose of the initial treatment the turbidities of supernatant in the two times reuse treatments had no significant differences from the initial treatment which was a satisfactory result however the concentration of inorganic ions including no3 nh4 and po4 3 increased when reusing the purified sludge which was due to the mineralization of organic matter during photocatalytic degradation corresponding to fig 6 the inorganic ions produced through mineralization will be directly added to the raw m aeruginosa solution with the reuse of sludge as these inorganic ions cannot be thoroughly coagulated their concentrations in supernatant will rise in the sludge reuse treatments fortunately after sludge reuse treatments the inorganic ions concentrations in the supernatant were still at safe levels according to the environmental quality standards for level iii surface water in china gb 3838 2002 and the guidelines for drinking water quality of world health organization national environmental protection agency of china 2002 world health organization 2011 even so this potential issue with the technology should be heeded to solve this problem the sludge reuse time must be carefully controlled or less mass of purified sludge should be added after several iterations of reuse the photocatalytic degradation of cyanobacteria containing sludge formed in the initial and reuse treatments were studied and compared as shown in table 3 after 32 h photocatalysis all algal cells were destroyed in the two times sludge reuse treatments and the concentrations of scod in the reuse treatments were similar to that in the initial treatment however the removal efficiencies of tcod reduced from 84 to about 78 although the degradation efficiency of organic matter slightly decreased the cod content in sludge still met the above mentioned level iii surface water standard the degradation efficiency of mcs in the reuse treatments was nearly 97 which had no significant difference from the initial treatment 99 but as the initial concentration of mcs is too high the mc content in sludge still exceeded the guideline value of 1 μg l for drinking water however in this technology when mixing approximately 70 ml of treated sludge with 1 l of raw water the mc content in the resulting solution can be below 1 μg l which is still a safe level for drinking water thus although the degradation efficiencies of organic matter and mcs by the photocatalyst were slightly reduced the sludge formed in each of the two reuse treatments can still be satisfactorily self purified 3 4 implications the proposed technology combines ballasted coagulation and photocatalysis to solve the poor sedimentation of cyanobacteria and enable the formed cyanobacteria containing sludge to be self purified simultaneously the photocatalyst water and some of the coagulant in the purified sludge can be directly reused in this technology fig 8 illustrates the mechanism and application of this technology in drinking water plants by adding coagulant and photocatalyst powder to enhance coagulation the required coagulant dose can be reduced while also yielding an excellent algal removal efficiency in addition due to the incorporation of photocatalyst powder into algal flocs the flocs masses are greatly increased leading to the rapid sedimentation of those ballasted algal flocs after sedimentation the treated water is separated off leaving the coagulated cyanobacteria containing sludge during the sludge storage period the reactive species will be formed on the surface of the photocatalyst that is contained in sludge due to the incidence of visible light and this would lead to the sludge being self purified to a safe level in this process due to the attack of reactive species cyanobacterial cells in sludge break up releasing the intracellular organic matter and cyanotoxins and then the released pollutants are degraded by photocatalysis when the treatment is finished the concentrations of organic matter and mcs in sludge have met the quality requirement for drinking water and the remaining photocatalyst powders in flocs will settle at the bottom when the purified sludge is directly added to the raw cyanobacteria contaminated water for reuse all algal cells can be removed with only half the coagulant dose of the initial ballasted coagulation and without dosing any additional high cost photocatalyst besides with reuse of the photocatalyst the sludge formed in the reuse treatments can also be purified to a safe level and the purified sludge might hence continue to be reused several times thus there are many advantages for the application of this technology in drinking water plants 1 all the algal cells can be rapidly and completely removed by the ballasted coagulation in conventional drinking water treatment algal cells are difficult to settle and some cells would remain in the supernatant and cause filter clogging and the production of disinfection byproducts fig s4 on the other hand the rapid sedimentation of algal cells would decrease the hrt in the drinking water plant and hence increase the efficiency of water treatment 2 half of the required coagulant dose can be reduced by through reuse of the purified sludge formed by photocatalyst ballasted coagulation cutting the required coagulant consumption not only decreases the expenditure on coagulant but also reduces the quantity of metal ions released into water which can cause secondary pollution 3 the cyanobacteria containing sludge can be self purified and directly reused the reuse of the high cost photocatalyst will remarkably reduce the cost of this technology and increase the feasibility in practical drinking water treatment plant furthermore the reuse of purified water will help address the shortage of water in some developing countries with the sludge reuse no pollutant will be discharged with this technology which satisfies the requirements of green technology however some potential issues associated with this technology should be heeded as well the reuse of purified sludge might cause the accumulation of inorganic ions due to the mineralization of organic matter and the degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst will gradually reduce with the perpetuation of reuse to solve these potential issues repeated reuse of the same sludge must be carefully controlled and the mixing proportion between treated sludge and raw water should be appropriately adjusted in drinking water treatment photocatalyst used in this study should be improved as well although n tio2 can thoroughly degrade the high concentration of algal cells and metabolites in sludge the relatively long treatment time would limit its application in drinking water treatment plants thus other photocatalysts with more intensive photocatalytic efficiency under visible light irradiation should be used in the future in addition the technology was applied for the treatment of unicellular m aeruginosa in this experiment however is there the possibility of some problems if it were used for filamentous cyanobacteria because the physiology and morphology of filamentous cyanobacteria are different from the unicellular cyanobacteria the behaviors of the cyanobacterial coagulation and degradation might be different in this technology on one hand unicellular m aeruginosa can be enveloped into flocs which can protect cells against the nasty attack from outside whereas filamentous cyanobacteria with long filaments is hard to be wrapped and prone to suffering physical damage and releasing cyanotoxins during coagulation li et al 2018 on the other hand the metabolites produced by filamentous cyanobacteria are different from m aeruginosa such as 2 methylisoborneol geosmin and cylindrospermopsin compared to mcs the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of these metabolites might be lower pelaez et al 2012 in the future we will study the behaviors of filamentous cyanobacteria during the process to verify our concerns and solve the possible problems of filamentous cyanobacteria 4 conclusion cyanobacterial cells 1 106 cells ml can be thoroughly removed by dosing 7 5 mg l pafc and 200 mg l n tio2 powder in this process all the algal cells were able to rapidly settle within only 10 min after coagulation and the removal efficiency was as high as 97 compared to conventional drinking water treatment the required pafc dose was reduced to about half after coagulation and sedimentation the cyanobacteria containing sludge that is formed can be self purified under visible light due to the photocatalyst powder incorporated into cyanobacterial flocs by ballasted coagulation during this period sludge in containers with large free surface area and low height l beaker can be most effectively purified through photocatalysis due to the high efficiency utilization of optical energy in the l beaker most cyanobacterial cells in sludge can be destroyed within 8 h 99 of total mcs 84 of tcod and 85 of mlvss can be degraded within 32 h and their final contents were reduced to safe levels which permits direct reuse for drinking water production when the purified sludge was directly added to raw cyanobacteria contaminated water nearly half of the dosed coagulant in the initial treatment was still active on the other hand the reused photocatalyst can still effectively purify the newly formed cyanobacteria containing sludge to a safe condition and the photocatalytic efficiency was just slightly lower than the initial treatment thus the combination of photocatalyst ballasted coagulation with reuse of sludge for further water treatment is a cost effective and environmentally beneficial technology to simultaneously purify cyanobacteria contaminated water and the produced cyanobacterial sludge in drinking water treatment acknowledgements this work was supported by the natural science foundation of china 51478251
