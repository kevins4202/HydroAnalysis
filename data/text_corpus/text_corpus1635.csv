8175,study region the study was conducted in the northern atlantic coastal plain aquifer system eastern usa an important water supply in a densely populated region study focus manganese mn an emerging health concern and common nuisance contaminant in drinking water is mapped and modeled using the xgboost machine learning method predictions of ph and redox conditions from previous models and other explanatory variables that describe the groundwater flow system and surface characteristics methods to address the imbalanced occurrence of elevated and low mn concentrations are compared and used to more accurately predict concentrations of interest for human health and drinking water quality new hydrological insights for the region elevated mn concentrations were more likely in shallow groundwater close to recharge areas and in topographically low areas where soil or unsaturated processes influence groundwater quality predicted concentrations greater than the health threshold of 300 micrograms per liter extended across 17 of the surficial aquifer area but across 1 of the areas of underlying aquifers ph and variables related to flow system position and near surface processes were more important predictors than the probability of low dissolved oxygen do mapped variable influence shap values showed that both ph and do variables were related to hydrogeologic conditions class weights which improved the predictive ability for elevated mn without altering the data was the preferred method to address class imbalance keywords manganese groundwater quality machine learning xgboost class imbalance classification prediction drinking water contaminants 1 introduction manganese mn in drinking water is an emerging health concern and a common nuisance contaminant it is ubiquitous in geologic materials and is one of the most frequently detected trace elements in groundwater u s environmental protection agency 2004 cannon et al 2017 although an essential nutrient mn is a neurotoxin at high doses agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 2012 increasingly mn in drinking water is a health concern because of many recent studies that link elevated mn concentrations in drinking water to adverse cognitive memory attention and or behavioral effects in children ljung and vahter 2007 frisbie et al 2012 bouchard et al 2011 khan et al 2011 2012 oulhote et al 2014 o neal and zheng 2015 bjorklund et al 2017 as a nuisance contaminant mn degrades the quality of drinking water supplies by causing an unpleasant taste visible turbidity and color by staining laundry and plumbing fixtures and by accumulating in distribution systems and appliances gerke et al 2016 world health organization 2017 these aesthetic and nuisance issues add to water treatment costs and can undermine public confidence in water safety if untreated kohl and medlar 2006 tobiason et al 2016 although mn has not been as frequently studied as other groundwater contaminants concentrations greater than health guidelines are widespread frisbie et al 2012 for example 6 6 32 of sampled wells in national scale studies in the united states us bangladesh new zealand scotland and sweden exceeded national or world health organization who guidelines of 300 500 micrograms per liter μg l daughney 2003 ljung and vahter 2007 hasan and ali 2010 homoncik et al 2010 desimone et al 2014 mcmahon et al 2019 concentrations exceeding aesthetic or nuisance guidelines 50 100 μg l were reported to range from 23 to 74 of sampled wells in these studies groundwater supplies about 40 of the water used for public and domestic supply in the us and provides a similar fraction of drinking water globally world water assessment programme 2009 dieter et al 2018 where treatment for mn removal is not applied or is ineffective large populations could be consuming groundwater with elevated manganese concentrations the population potentially consuming water with elevated manganese supplied by private household well water which is much less likely to be treated or tested than public or centralized water supplies is estimated for the conterminous us at 2 6 million people mcmahon et al 2019 the northern atlantic coastal plain nacp a complex layered system of 10 regional aquifers is an important water supply in the eastern us it is ranked 5th among 66 us principal aquifers in groundwater withdrawals for public supply and ranked 4th in groundwater withdrawals by privately owned domestic wells lovelace et al 2020 the aquifer system supplies drinking water to more than 20 million people masterson et al 2016a mn is the most frequently occurring geogenic contaminant in the nacp exceeding the us health guideline of 300 μg l in 4 5 of wells and the aesthetic guideline of 50 μg l in 39 44 of wells sampled in 3 of the 10 regional aquifers in the system denver et al 2014 desimone et al 2014 physical and geochemical processes influencing geogenic contaminants like mn have been well studied in the nacp knobel et al 1998 denver et al 2014 masterson et al 2016a brown et al 2019 degnan et al 2020 but detailed information on the 3 dimensional distribution of mn concentrations relevant to human health or drinking water quality is not available much is known about the processes and factors controlling mn in groundwater but the distribution of elevated mn concentrations in aquifers remains difficult to delineate the ubiquitous distribution of mn in soil and aquifer materials means that potential sources are widespread concentrations are influenced by redox conditions and ph because mn oxidation states differ greatly in solubility and stability and mn readily sorbs to redox and ph sensitive oxides hydroxides gilkes and mckenzie 1988 langmuir 1997 kohl and medlar 2006 agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 2012 numerous studies have identified redox condition and ph as the primary factors explaining differences in groundwater mn at national regional and local scales bourg and bertin 1994 homoncik et al 2010 farnsworth and hering 2011 de meyer et al 2017 bondu et al 2018 brown et al 2019 mcmahon et al 2019 hamer et al 2020 hou et al 2020 however these conditions can be difficult to define geographically without understanding groundwater flow patterns and residence times and can vary at small scales lovely and goodwin 1988 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 champ et al 1979 redox and ph conditions also vary in aquifers at multiple scales because of the heterogeneous distribution of dissolved organic carbon and other electron donors the origin of infiltrating groundwater recharge and surface water and anthropogenic influences such as waste disposal urban sources and agricultural practices lee and bennett 1998 christensen et al 2001 clague et al 2019 munz et al 2019 weathering history of soil and aquifer materials also can affect the present day distribution of elevated mn in aquifers gillispie et al 2016 machine learning methods are advantageous for mapping heterogeneous complex phenomena such as mn concentrations in groundwater because they can accurately model the complex non linear relations between contaminant concentrations and explanatory factors without explicit knowledge of the underlying processes hastie et al 2009 kuhn and johnson 2013 machine learning methods have been found superior to more traditional linear modeling methods for predicting groundwater quality including salinity and concentrations of arsenic and nitrate nolan et al 2015 ayotte et al 2016 knoll et al 2019 sahour et al 2020 recent applications demonstrate their use to map mn concentrations in the central valley california rosecrans et al 2017 and the glacial aquifer of the northern us erickson et al 2021 in this study we use extreme gradient boosting xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 a machine learning method to map mn concentration in the nacp system mn concentration is predicted in four classes relevant to drinking water quality below detection in this study 10 μg l detected but less than the us aesthetic guideline of 50 μg l greater than the aesthetic guideline but less than the us health guideline of 300 μg l and greater than the health guideline xgboost is an ensemble tree machine learning method in which predictive models are built from many simple decision trees chen and guestrin 2016 decision trees are added sequentially while minimizing a loss function and each new tree is fit to the residuals of the previous predictions a process known as gradient boosting friedman 2001 elith et al 2008 thus the modeling increasingly focuses on the data instances that are difficult to predict james et al 2013 xgboost uses stochastic gradient boosting which increases model robustness by building each tree on a random subset of the data friedman 2002 gradient boosting methods have been successfully applied to predict groundwater quality in a variety of aquifer settings wang et al 2016 ransom et al 2017 rosecrans et al 2017 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 knoll et al 2019 kneirim et al 2020 stackelberg et al 2020 sahour et al 2020 xgboost is highly accurate efficient and widely used chen and guestrin 2016 the xgboost algorithm also includes regularization terms that penalize model complexity and can thereby counteract overfitting which is a disadvantage of ensemble tree methods chen and guestrin 2016 like many drinking water contaminants in groundwater mn concentrations greater than its health guideline occur much less frequently than concentrations below guidelines imbalanced data sets such as these can pose challenges to modeling applications models tend to be biased toward the more frequently occurring concentrations or concentration class and the classes of greatest interest are typically the least frequent krawczyk 2016 previous predictive modeling approaches in the hydrological sciences have successfully addressed class imbalance by applying resampling techniques which rebalance the response variable messier et al 2019 al abadi and alsamaani 2020 bedi et al 2020 pennino et al 2020 wilson et al 2020 or by post processing the model predictions to encourage fairness podgorski and berg 2020 erickson et al 2021 kneirim et al 2020 other techniques for addressing imbalanced data can be applied within the modeling algorithm sun et al 2009 branco et al 2015 class imbalance in multi class modeling is a particularly complex problem krawczyk 2016 bi and zhang 2018 and not amenable to post processing approaches mn at the high concentration relatively low frequency levels is of the most interest for groundwater quality and human health and so maximizing model accuracy in these classes is beneficial this study has two objectives 1 to map the 3 dimensional distribution of mn concentrations in the nacp aquifer system and 2 to evaluate several common easily applied approaches for dealing with class imbalanced data a novel aspect of the study is the incorporation of previously determined estimates of redox conditions and ph desimone et al 2020 desimone and pope 2020 as predictors of mn occurrence the sensitivity of mn predictions to these variables is assessed at the regional scale using multiple methods including maps of variable importance in summary the study provides a detailed and interpretable 3 dimensional representation of mn at concentrations relevant to human health and drinking water quality across an important us water supply system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 extends along the eastern us coast from long island new york through northeastern north carolina an area of approximately 76 000 km2 square kilometers that encompasses nearly all of the nacp aquifer system it includes such major us cities as new york philadelphia baltimore washington d c and richmond virginia masterson et al 2016a much of the area is forested but agriculture occupies about one third of the study area overall and is predominant in some regions such as the delmarva peninsula denver et al 2014 masterson et al 2016a densely populated urban areas are prevalent on long island and near the major cities along the western edge of the study area the land surface is flat to gently rolling maximum elevation about 150 m and is dissected by major river valleys that are flooded at the coast the climate is temperate and humid ator et al 2005 the aquifer system is a complex stack of fluvial deltaic glacial and marine sediments forming 10 regional aquifers and 9 interlayered confining units table 1 masterson et al 2016a pope et al 2016 the shallowest aquifer at the top of the layered stack is an unconfined surficial aquifer generally 5 50 m meters in thickness the underlying aquifers dip and thicken eastwards towards the coast where they reach a combined thickness of more than 1 000 m offshore fig 1 the underlying aquifers are mostly confined except near their western edge an area called the fall zone where they outcrop or subcrop or beneath incised river valleys maps of the 10 regional aquifers and their confined areas when present are provided in desimone et al 2020 the nacp aquifer system is vulnerable to both anthropogenic and geogenic drinking water contaminants agricultural sources wastewater disposal and diverse industries in urban areas contribute nutrients pesticides and volatile organic compounds primarily to the unconfined permeable surficial aquifer denver et al 2014 geogenic contaminants including mn other trace elements and radioactive constituents are present throughout and exceed anthropogenic contaminants in the underlying aquifers lindsey and belitz 2016 degnan et al 2020 additional information about the hydrogeology water quality and geochemistry of the regional aquifers is available by back 1966 knobel et al 1998 ator 2008 mcfarland 2010 denver et al 2014 and masterson et al 2016a and references cited in these studies 2 2 data 2 2 1 response variable mn concentration class was the response variable model output predicted by the models the classes were bounded by concentration thresholds relevant to drinking water quality specifically the us aesthetic and health guidelines as described previously section 1 mn concentration class in groundwater samples from 4 492 wells was used to train and test the models fig 1 the well data were split into 80 training and 20 testing subsets table 2 that maintained the relative proportion of observations within classes using the createdatapartition function of the r caret package v 6 0 86 kuhn 2019 the well data were mostly from a national aggregation of groundwater quality data erickson et al 2019 from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system database 76 of data u s geological survey 2019 the u s environmental protection agency safe drinking water information system 13 of data u s environmental protection agency 2013 and several state agencies 1 of data all data used in this study are available in an accompanying data release desimone and ransom 2021 data from the national aggregation were from samples collected between 1988 and 2018 for heterogeneous purposes from various well types data from the national aggregation were augmented on long island ny by data from the suffolk county water authority scwa 11 of data scwa data were collected primarily from public supply wells and all were from samples collected in 2002 overall the data set consisted of 50 supply wells 36 public 10 domestic 4 other supply 47 monitoring wells and 3 wells of other or unknown type all samples were untreated groundwater and were reported as dissolved concentrations except for the 8 samples from the state agency source for which the sample fraction was not reported 2 2 2 explanatory variables twenty seven explanatory variables were provided as input to the machine learning models table 3 these included descriptors of well location in the hydrologic system groundwater flow and aquifer characteristics surface conditions such as soil texture predicted ph and the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen explanatory variables were attributed to well locations for model training and testing for mn prediction across the study area the variables were attributed to the central points of the 1 km2 grid prediction locations subsurface variables at prediction locations varied by regional aquifer and were defined by depth whereas surface variables were the same for all 10 regional aquifers predictions were made for the freshwater to brackish 10 000 milligrams per liter mg l of chloride parts of the regional aquifers as delineated by pope et al 2016 summary descriptions of the explanatory variables are provided in this section maps of selected explanatory variables are provided in the supplementary information si 7 detailed information about their derivation and sources as well as data values at the well and prediction locations is available in desimone and ransom 2021 2 2 2 1 surface variables explanatory variables describing position on the land surface included distance from the fall zone land surface elevation and the multi order hydrologic position mohp variables table 3 distance from the fall zone was the linear distance from the western study area boundary except on long island ny where it represented distance from a line delineating the maximum water table height of como et al 2015 land surface elevation is derived by point extraction from a 30 m2 scale digital data layer pope et al 2016 mohp variables describe position on the landscape with respect to streams of various orders and their watersheds these were derived by point extraction from 30 m2 digital data layers belitz et al 2019 moore et al 2019 additional variables describing land surface features included soil texture wetlands and land surface nitrogen input table 3 the soil texture variables of percent sand percent silt and percent clay were area and depth weighted averages of ssurgo soil characteristics wieczorek 2014 the wetlands variable was the areal percentage of estuarine riverine and freshwater emergent shrub and forested wetlands from u s fish and wildlife 2019 land surface nitrogen input from fertilizer nolan and hitt 2006 was included because of the potential for nitrogen input to alter geochemical conditions in the shallow surficial aquifer denver et al 2014 the soil texture wetlands and land surface nitrogen input variables were aggregated area weighted averages within 500 m circular buffer areas around well and prediction locations long term mean annual baseflow index evapotranspiration and effective recharge were from 800 m2 scale evapotranspiration and recharge or 1 km2 scale baseflow index national data layers wolock 2003 reitz et al 2017a b these hydrologic variables also were aggregated with 500 m2 circular buffer areas around well and prediction locations 2 2 2 2 subsurface variables explanatory variables describing characteristics in 3 dimensions included those describing the groundwater flow system groundwater age and predicted ph and redox condition table 3 variables describing the groundwater flow system including groundwater flux head and others were output from a 3 dimensional finite difference flow model masterson et al 2016b flow model output was natively gridded horizontally at a 1 6 km2 scale and vertically in sloping layers that corresponded to the 10 regional aquifers these flow model based variables were attributed to wells based on horizontal location of the well within the 1 6 km2 grid cells and on the vertical location of the well screen interval relative to the aquifer layers the variables were set to missing for wells that could not be unambiguously located within a single aquifer layer based on available well screen information the flow model based variables were attributed to prediction locations as area weighted averages within the 1 km2 prediction grid cells desimone and ransom 2021 explanatory variables describing groundwater age were also based on the groundwater flow model based on the 1 6 km2 flow model grid and were similarly attributed to well and prediction locations the groundwater age variables were the 10th percentile median and 90th percentile of simulated groundwater age as described in pope et al 2020 and desimone et al 2020 variables describing predicted ph and the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen were natively gridded using the same 1 km2 grid as used in the present study for mn prediction the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen was represented by the modeled threshold of 2 mg l this level chosen from the three previously modeled thresholds 0 05 1 and 2 mg l desimone et al 2020 was based on the conceptual model of brown et al 2019 for mn in coastal aquifer systems including the nacp two explanatory variables well depth and elevation of the well screen bottom described vertical location in the aquifer system for wells these variables were obtained from the data sources described previously in section 2 2 1 for prediction locations the well depth and well screen bottom elevation variables were set to the vertical midpoints of the regional aquifers at the prediction location thus predictions for the regional aquifers corresponded to sloping surfaces that increased in depth from west to east across the study area except for the surficial aquifer the vertical location of predictions for the surficial aquifer was a relatively flat lying surface defined as the midpoint between the water table and the aquifer bottom 2 3 modeling manganese concentration class modeling mn concentration class in the nacp aquifer system was a two step process first an initial set of xgboost models was built to compare methods for addressing class imbalance second a final model was built to predict mn concentrations throughout the study area using the selected class imbalance method both steps involved building many models to select the best set of xgboost hyperparameters for the given modeling objective all of the models were built using the 80 training subset of response and explanatory data at wells and 10 fold cross validation cv to train the model in this study the process of building a single model by fitting the well data is called model training and the process of evaluating multiple models that differ in terms of xgboost hyperparameters is called model tuning model performance for the final model was evaluated by comparing predicted and observed values from the 20 testing subset of the well data which were data not used in model training or tuning model performance for the class imbalance models was evaluated using the cross validation holdout fit statistics which are based on the training data cv hold out as explained in section 2 3 2 cv holdout fit statistics also were used to tune the models as explained in section 2 3 1 modeling was performed in the r computing environment v 3 6 1 r core team 2018 on the usgs tallgrass supercomputer usgs advanced research computing 2020 once a final model was built it was applied to explanatory variables at prediction locations to predict mn concentration class across the study area a schematic diagram illustration the modeling and prediction process is provided in the supplementary information si 2 2 3 1 xgboost model training and tuning xgboost model training and tuning was done using the caret classification and regression training v 6 0 86 kuhn 2019 and xgboost v 1 1 1 1 chen et al 2020 r packages the xgboost algorithm was run to generate tree based models general parameter booster gbtree and the loss function was specified to return the probability of class membership for multiclass classification learning parameter objective multi softprob a predicted class was assigned to each data point as the class with the highest probability hyperparameters xgboost booster parameters were determined using a grid search a large grid n 19440 including multiple values for each hyperparameter was tested seven hyperparameters were adjusted nrounds the maximum number of iterations eta which controls the learning rate or the contribution of each subsequent tree max depth the maximum allowed tree depth min child weight the minimum number of instances observations allowed in a tree leaf col subsample bytree the proportion of total features used to construct each tree subsample the proportion of the total training data observations used to build each tree and gamma a regularization parameter chen et al 2020 the range of values in the grid were as follows nrounds 100 2300 varying by 200 eta 0 005 0 2 5 values max depth 3 7 varying by 2 min child weight 3 9 varying by 3 colsample bytree 0 5 0 9 varying by 0 2 subsample 0 5 0 9 varying by 2 and gamma 0 2 varying by 1 optimal xgboost hyperparameters were selected for a given modeling objective using the results of stratified 10 fold cv applied to the 80 training subset of the data an example of a modeling objective is to determine a model that best fits the training data for one of the class imbalance approaches in 10 fold cv the data set is split into 10 subsets folds of which 9 are used to build the model and the held out 10th is used to evaluate the model this splitting and model building is repeated 10 times the optimized model performance metric is averaged across the 10 cv holdout folds the createfolds function of caret was used to split the data into 10 stratified folds using random sampling within the class levels of the response variable so that each cv training and testing fold was representative of the original distribution of data among the 4 mn classes the same folds were used for the tuning and evaluation of all models so that differences in cv fold splits was not a source of variability in model comparisons 2 3 2 testing and comparison of imbalanced data methods four commonly used approaches for addressing class imbalance were investigated over sampling under sampling synthetic minority oversampling technique smote chawla et al 2002 and class weights in over sampling instances of the minority classes are randomly replicated so that they are equal in number to the majority class in under sampling instances of the majority classes are randomly removed so they are equal in number to the minority class in smote the majority class is under sampled and synthetic instances of the minority class are created by interpolation between existing k nearest neighbor minority instances in feature space the class weights approach is a type of cost sensitive learning sun et al 2009 weights are applied by class so that the misclassification of data points in the more highly weighted class es contributes more to the minimized error function than misclassification of data in the lower weighted class es multiple models were tested for the smote and class weights methods and a best model using performance metrics was selected to represent the method for comparison among all four imbalance techniques optimal smote parameters for the percent over sampling perc over and under sampling perc under parameters are expected to vary by data set chawla et al 2002 kuhn 2008 the tested values of perc over and perc under ranged from 100 to 600 and were determined by trial and error using the default parameters in the r caret package kuhn 2019 of 200 as a starting point the default value of 5 for k the number of nearest neighbors included in the minority class data interpolation chawla et al 2002 was used for all tests alternatives were initially tested but did not lead to performance improvements eight parameter combinations were tested for smote class weights were set initially equal to the inverse proportions of class frequency such that the weight applied to instances of each class was equal to the class frequencies divided by the frequency of the least prevalent class 7 44 in the 300 μg l category for the entire data set models using this base case set of weights overestimated the 300 μg l category so weight sets tested subsequently were reduced proportionately in magnitude while maintaining their relative proportions fig 2 fourteen uniformly varying weight sets not shown also were investigated a total of 19 sets of weights were tested for the class weights approach the class imbalance methods were applied within the caret package which performs the over sampling under sampling or smote modifications to the data prior to cv testing but after separation of the data into folds figure si 2 of the supplementary information only the training data folds were modified with over sampling under sampling or smote the models were tested on unmodified data kuhn 2019 weights similarly were applied only during model training this approach ensures that model performance metrics are not overly optimistic as the result of testing on artificially balanced versions of the data the models compared to evaluate the four class imbalance methods were each the result of caret tuning as described previously and built with the optimal hyperparameters identified by the grid search and 10 fold cv 2 3 3 model performance metrics model performance was evaluated using sensitivity specificity positive predictive value negative predictive value and kappa sensitivity also known as recall is the percentage of true positive instances correctly predicted positive predictive value ppv also known as precision is the percentage of positively predicted instances that are true positives sensitivity and ppv are similar but sensitivity is a measure of how accurately the model identifies positive values whereas ppv is a measure of confidence in values that are predicted as positive specificity is the percentage of true negative instances correctly predicted negative predictive value npv is the percentage of negatively predicted instances that are true negatives sensitivity specificity ppv and npv were computed by class by comparing prediction rates in the class of interest against prediction rates in all other classes combined a one versus all approach kuhn 2008 mean sensitivity mean specificity mean ppv and mean npv per model were calculated as the averages of the four by class metrics these provide overall performance measures for the entire model across all classes kappa is a measure of agreement between observed and predicted value that takes into account the degree of agreement that would be due to chance kuhn and johnson 2013 it is a single metric per model representing predictions in all four classes mean sensitivity was the metric used to select optimal model hyperparameters mean sensitivity and by class sensitivity were used to compare the models developed with the class imbalance methods and select a final model mean sensitivity provides an overall balanced measure of a model s success in correctly classifying data points and by class sensitivity provides information on the degree to which data points in the higher concentration classes which are of greater interest for water quality are correctly identified 2 4 interpreting the models the influence of explanatory variables in models was investigated in three ways to provide insight into the patterns of occurrence learned by the model and help interpret model results relative variable importance calculated as the normalized total information gain provided by variables in the model was used to rank the explanatory variables in terms of influence chen et al 2020 partial dependence plots pdps were used to investigate the relations between individual explanatory variables and model predictions pdps show the relation between an explanatory variable and the predicted probability of class membership when all other variables are held at their observed values greenwell 2017 and are based on the observations training well data used to build the model spatial patterns in variable importance were investigated using shap values shapley additive explanation values lundberg and lee 2017 shap values quantify the contribution of each variable to each individual prediction made by the model for example at wells or prediction locations numerically the shap values for all variables for an individual prediction sum to the difference between the prediction and a base predicted value where the base value is the result that would be determined for example like an average value with no information from explanatory variables thus the absolute magnitude of mapped shap values depicts where individual features are more or less important across the study area the sign positive or negative of the shap values indicates whether the variable contributed an increase or decrease to the predicted value relative to the base value shap values were calculated separately for each class using the functionality within the xgboost r package chen et al 2020 3 results 3 1 manganese concentrations in wells manganese concentrations ranged from 10 to 75 100 μg l with a median value of 18 μg l 17 of the concentrations were less than laboratory reporting limits concentrations were inversely related to well depth distance from the fall zone and dissolved oxygen concentration mn detections 10 μg l were mostly in samples of ph 7 5 see supplementary information si 1 the shallow unconfined surficial aquifer had both the largest number of samples and the largest percentage of mn concentrations greater than 50 or 300 μg l compared to underlying confined aquifers fig 1 wells in close geographic proximity neighboring can vary substantially in depth and be completed in different regional aquifers this is one reason for the variability observed in concentration in map view fig 1 relations with well depth and distance from the fall zone si 1 reflect the greater prevalence of elevated mn in the surficial aquifer and shallow unconfined parts of the underlying aquifers fig 1 overall 7 4 of wells had concentrations greater than the health guideline of 300 μg l and 29 4 of wells had concentrations greater than the aesthetic guideline of 50 μg l table 2 rates comparable to those found nationally in the us desimone et al 2014 mcmahon et al 2019 the well data and additional information about data processing are available in an accompanying data release desimone and ransom 2021 3 2 model selection and performance 3 2 1 class imbalance models performance metrics for models built with the original unmodified and unweighted data called here the unmodified data model and with the four class imbalance methods are shown in figs 3 overall model and 4 by class metrics the parameters used in the selected smote model were perc over 200 perc under 600 and k 5 the selected model for the class weights approach used weights that were based on the inverse proportions of class frequency but reduced by 60 in magnitude set d fig 2 imbalance method parameters weights xgboost hyperparameters and performance metric values for all models tested for the class imbalance comparison are provided in table si 3 of the supplementary information performance metrics described in this section are means of values from the cv holdout subsets the unmodified data model had a cv holdout mean sensitivity of 0 555 fig 3 and a kappa of 0 420 by class sensitivity for the unmodified data model ranged from 0 714 for the lowest concentration highest frequency class concentrations 10 μg l class 1 representing non detects to 0 433 for the highest concentration lowest frequency class concentrations greater 300 μg l class 4 representing concentrations greater than the health guideline fig 4 a this was an expected result because of the imbalanced distribution of data among classes the unmodified data model also underpredicted the percent of data points in class 4 and in class 2 fig 4a all four methods of addressing the class imbalance yielded models that were more successful at prediction in the highest concentration lowest frequency class 4 than the unmodified data model fig 4a by class sensitivity for class 4 increased from 0 433 for the unmodified data model to 0 541 0 698 for the models made with class imbalance methods under sampling yielded the greatest increase in class 4 sensitivity 0 698 fig 4c but also resulted in the largest decreases in overall model fit as measured by kappa 0 333 mean sensitivity mean specificity mean ppv and mean npv class 4 sensitivity in the smote model increased to 0 579 fig 4d but like under sampling the smote approach resulted in decreased kappa 0 387 in contrast both over sampling and class weights increased by class sensitivity for class 4 while only very slightly decreasing kappa 0 410 and 0 408 respectively fig 4b and e the over sampling and class weights also produced the most equitable sensitivities for the four classes and better matched the percentage of data points in the high class 4 we selected the class weights approach as the method most suited for predicting mn concentrations in the nacp study area although results from over sampling and class weights were similar the class weights predictions fig 4e more closely matched the percentage of observed data points in the high concentration category than the over sampling approach fig 4b the class weights approach also was preferred because within each class it gives equal consideration to each training data point in the over sampling method random resampling has the effect of unequally weighting some data points in the minority class those that are replicated more frequently than others thus the unmodified data set was represented most closely using the class weights approach 3 2 2 final model a single final model was built using the class weights approach by applying the xgboost algorithm to the entire training data set using the selected weights set and the optimal hyperparameters hyperparameters weights and model performance metrics for this model are provided in table 4 application of the final model to the testing data set yielded model performance metrics of 0 588 for mean sensitivity and 0 459 for kappa by class sensitivity ranged from 0 515 to 0 717 still greatest in class 1 but relatively equitable among classes 1 3 the percentage of observations was slightly overpredicted for class 4 and slightly underpredicted for class 1 model performance metrics for the final model applied to the testing data subset were similar to those from the 10 fold cv for the class weights model table si 3 which is an expected result because like the testing data subset the cv holdout folds also are independent measures of model performance relative to the cv training data sets model performance measures such as sensitivity specificity ppv npv and kappa tabulate correct classifications which are based on the class with the maximum predicted probability among the four classes in the model the class probabilities also provide information about relative model performance among classes fig 5 shows the probability of the predicted class for all correctly predicted observations wells the probability of the predicted class was generally higher for the lowest class 1 and highest class 4 concentration classes than for the intermediate concentration classes 2 and 3 suggesting that it was more difficult for the model to distinguish these intermediate concentration classes 3 3 mapped manganese concentrations predictions of mn concentration class and class probabilities are shown for the top 4 regional aquifers in terms of water supply withdrawals fig 6 maps for all 10 aquifers are provided in the supplementary information si 4 areas likely to have mn concentrations greater than the health guideline of 300 μg l class 4 are primarily in the surficial aquifer areas where class 4 was predicted which occupied 17 of the onshore surficial aquifer area were along the western boundary of the study area along coastal boundaries and in parts of eastern virginia and north carolina in several of the underlying aquifers including the potomac patapsco there also are scattered areas where class 4 is predicted along the upland western boundary of the study area where the aquifers outcrop and or are unconfined throughout most of the underlying aquifers however the areal extent of predicted class 4 was 1 predicted mn concentrations greater than the aesthetic guideline of 50 μg l but less than the health guideline class 3 were more widespread than predictions in class 4 about half 55 of the surficial aquifer was predicted in class 3 by combining the areas predicted in class 3 and in class 4 72 of the surficial aquifer area was predicted to have mn concentrations greater than the aesthetic guideline in the underlying aquifers areas predicted in class 3 like class 4 areas are along the western boundary of the study area in the magothy and potomac patapsco aquifers areas in class 3 also are predicted in southeastern maryland southeastern virginia and eastern north carolina there are few wells in the data set in these deep aquifers in these areas and so predictions in the deep aquifers may be more uncertain however these results are consistent with the patterns described by mcfarland 2010 in the deeper aquifers of the nacp coastal plain of virginia of high concentrations in the west along the fall zone lower concentrations in a central band and high concentrations in the east near the fresh saltwater transition zone mn concentrations in class 1 less than the detection limit of 10 μg l were predicted in the surficial aquifer only on long island ny but class 1 was the predicted class in broad areas of the underlying aquifers class 1 was predicted throughout most of the eastern lower chesapeake piney point and aquia aquifers aquifer layers 5 7 and 9 and in central parts of the monmouth mt laurel matawan magothy and potomac patapsco aquifers layers 11 13 15 and 17 the probability of the class 1 predictions exceeded 0 5 on average in most of these aquifers reflecting the relative ease of predicting where mn is absent as opposed to predicting a specific concentration class as discussed previously section 3 1 in the context of predictions at wells the accuracy of the maps at individual point locations is described by the model performance statistics for testing well data specifically by the overall mean sensitivity of 0 588 and mean specificity of 0 867 table 4 maps of incorrectly and correctly classified wells showed that there was no spatial bias in the distribution of model error supplementary information si 8 the proximity of incorrectly classified wells to mapped areas of the correct observed class is another qualitative indicator of map accuracy in the testing data set 74 of incorrectly classified wells in the testing data set were within 5 km of a prediction location that was mapped as the correct observed class for the well thus although not always accurate at the scale of individual well or point locations the model successfully identified regional patterns of occurrence of the mn concentration classes 3 4 importance of ph low dissolved oxygen and other explanatory variables 3 4 1 overall variable importance and partial dependence plots predicted ph pred ph was the top ranked variable in terms of importance and the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen concentration 2 mg l pred do2 was ranked 10th fig 7 pdps show that the probability of mn class 1 membership mn 10 μg l non detections fig 8 a increases with increasing pred ph and decreases with increasing pred do2 fig 8j thus the likelihood of mn below detection is higher in alkaline water and lower in anoxic groundwater as expected from the geochemistry of mn in groundwater in addition the class 1 pdp for pred ph identifies the ph range of 7 8 as a threshold for distinguishing the absence of detectable mn from its presence which conforms well to the finding by brown et al 2019 of ph 7 5 as a threshold between low and elevated 150 μg l mn concentrations in several atlantic coastal plain aquifers the relations shown by the pdps for class 4 membership mn 300 μg l for pred ph and pred do2 are more complex than those for class 1 and are not monotonic the influences of pred ph and pred do2 on the probability of class 4 also are smaller than their influence on class 1 probability note the differences in y axis scale range between the class 1 and class 4 pdps the pdp for pred ph shows that the probability of mn class 4 is low when ph 5 increases from ph 5 to 6 and generally decreases again from ph 6 to 8 these trends also may be explained by the co occurrence of ph and dissolved oxygen redox conditions in the aquifers as represented by well data for training the model observations wells in the ph range 5 were mostly oxygenated measured dissolved oxygen 2 mg l in 82 of observations as compared to observations in the ph range 6 which were mostly anoxic dissolved oxygen 2 mg l in 77 of observations thus although the ph range 6 is geochemically favorable for elevated mn these ph conditions did not typically co occur with reducing conditions in the nacp aquifer system as represented by the study data set well depth welldepth distance from the fall zone dist fallzone and groundwater age age 90th pct ranked 3rd 8th and 9th are simple measures of flow path distance from recharge areas in the aquifer system pdp plots fig 8c show that with increasing welldepth up to 70 m the probability of class 1 membership mn 10 μg l increases and the probability of class 4 membership mn 300 μg l decreases indicating that shallower parts of the aquifer system over this depth range are more likely to have detectable and elevated mn concentrations thereafter the predicted probability is relatively constant until about 200 m after which it decreases again for class 1 and increases for class 4 reflecting the possible presence of detectable and elevated mn at great depths however this depth range includes less than 10 of the well data making the relations in these regions less certain similarly with increasing dist fallzone class 1 probability generally increases after an initial decrease for dist fallzone 10 km and class 4 probability decreases fig 8h indicating that overall parts of the aquifer closer to fall zone are more likely to have detectable and elevated mn concentrations the age variable age 90th pctl the 90th percentile of simulated groundwater residence time in the aquifer layer in which the well is screened is a measure of flow path distance in time rather than in space the pdps for age 90th pctl fig 8i show an inflection point at about 100 years and indicate that elevated mn class 4 mn 300 μg l is less likely to be present in old groundwater as measured by this variable thus pdps for welldepth dist fallzone and age 90th pctl all show that the model is capturing patterns of higher mn closer to aquifer recharge locations or the water table and decreasing mn along flow paths land surface elevation ls elev the percent of silt in soil soil silt pct and base flow index bfi also among the top 10 variables influence predicted mn class probability in ways that suggest the importance of near surface processes the relations of mn class 1 and class 4 probability with ls elev in pdps fig 8f show that detectable and elevated mn are more likely in groundwater beneath low lying areas low lying areas in the study area are extensive in the coastal lowlands of eastern north carolina southern virginia and the southern delmarva peninsula and also occur along coastal margins in northern parts of the study area see supplementary information si 7 for maps of ls elev in southern coastal lowlands which include the most extensive areas where mn class 4 is predicted sediments are fine grained and organic rich wetlands are prevalent groundwater is shallow and surface drainage is poor these conditions lead to anoxic groundwater at shallow depths in the surficial aquifer ator et al 2005 pdps for soil silt pct fig 8g show that higher soil silt content a characteristic of poorly drained soils was associated with a higher probability of elevated mn class 4 and a lower probability of non detectable mn class 1 low bfi which is the estimated contribution of groundwater to streamflow groundwater discharge wolock 2003 was associated with a higher probability of elevated mn class 4 fig 8b bfi is low throughout the poorly drained coastal lowlands but bfi also is low in upland areas along parts of the fall zone thus patterns in bfi could be related to mn class probability because they help define low lying areas but also because patterns in bfi help define distance from recharge areas the multi order hydrologic position variables dsd9 and dsd5 fig 8d e which are measures of position on the landscape with respect to streams and watershed divides belitz et al 2019 similarly capture information both about flow path distance from the fall zone and the location of the low lying areas in the southern parts of the study area the relations shown by pdps for ls elev soil silt pct bfi dsd9 and dsd5 point to the importance of near surface or unsaturated zone processes on mn concentrations these relations also suggest interactions among variables which were not specifically assessed in this study 3 4 2 spatial patterns in variable importance for predicted ph and the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen although predicted ph the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen and the other variables discussed were the most important variables overall they were not equally important everywhere mapped shap values across the study area fig 9 show how pred ph and pred do2 contributed to model predictions in the uppermost surficial aquifer and in the underlying aquifers using the magothy aquifer to provide an example for the underlying aquifers the pred ph and pred do2 variables were used for the illustration to further investigate the importance of these variables in the model the values in fig 9 represent the shap values of model predictions made at the prediction locations fig 6 for two of the four mn classes class 1 representing non detects mn 10 μg l and class 4 representing values greater than the health threshold mn 300 μg l as described in section 2 4 shap values quantify the contribution of individual variables to each individual prediction the magnitude of shap value indicates how much a variable contributes to an individual prediction the sign positive or negative of the shap values indicates the direction of influence whether the variable increased or decreased the individual predicted value relative to a no information prediction for the response variable at the prediction location in the surficial aquifer shap values for pred ph were relatively large in magnitude and negative in sign for mn class 1 indicating that pred ph contributed negatively to the predicted probability of mn membership in class 1 throughout the surficial aquifer fig 9a in other words the pred ph values in the surficial aquifer where ph was generally acidic desimone et al 2020 reduced the predicted probability of class 1 membership reducing the probability of undetectable mn and thus more likely that mn would be predicted as detected in the surficial aquifer shap values for pred ph and mn class 1 in the underlying magothy aquifer varied from large and negative near the fall zone to large and positive away from the fall zone fig 9c thus pred ph contributed negatively to mn class 1 membership predictions near the fall zone area where ph was generally acidic like in the surficial aquifer and positively to mn class 1 membership predictions away from the fall zone where ph was generally alkaline in other words the pred ph values increased the predicted probability of class 1 membership near the fall zone in the magothy aquifer and decreased it away from the fall zone the pred ph variable also contributed positively to mn class 4 membership mn 300 μg l predictions in the surficial aquifer in the distal and low lying parts of the study area fig 9b the magnitude of shap values for pred do2 fig 9e h was generally lower than shap values for pred ph fig 9a d as expected from the lower importance of pred do2 as compared to pred ph described previously however although its importance was relatively low in much of the aquifer area shown its spatial patterns are meaningful where pred do2 contributes positively to class 1 membership predictions it generally contributes negatively to class 4 membership predictions the spatial patterns in variable importance shown by the shap values can be related more directly to groundwater flow system characteristics in the northeastern part of the study area on long island ny figs 1 and 10 on long island the unconfined surficial aquifer directly overlies the magothy aquifer the intervening aquifers are absent and the magothy aquifer is unconfined except along the southern edge of the island pope et al 2016 groundwater flows north and south from recharge areas in the center of the island towards discharge areas along the coasts fig 10 i como et al 2015 predicted ph is low pred ph 6 5 throughout both aquifers the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen also is low groundwater is oxic throughout both aquifers except in the magothy aquifer where the aquifer is confined along the southern island edge see the supplementary information si 7 patterns in shap values for pred ph generally are similar to study area wide patterns fig 10a d shap values for pred do2 fig 10e h also are similar to study area wide patterns but also clearly show the influence of groundwater flow and recharge patterns especially in the magothy aquifer fig 10g h in the unconfined areas of the magothy aquifer where recharge can occur pred do2 is low groundwater is unlikely to be anoxic that is groundwater is oxic and this variable contributes positively to the prediction of class 1 membership undetectable mn fig 10g in the confined areas pred do2 is high groundwater is likely anoxic and the variable contributes negatively to the predictions of class 1 membership fig 10g the contributions of pred do2 to predictions of class 4 membership mn greater than health thresholds are similar in extent but opposite in direction fig 10h thus patterns of variable influence demonstrate that the model used the pred ph and pred do2 variables in ways that are interpretable and consistent with flow system controls on groundwater geochemistry 4 discussion maps such as those produced with the machine learning model for mn concentration class in this study are a way of translating onto the landscape the patterns of occurrence contained within groundwater quality data sets the aquifers and areas in the nacp aquifer system that are identified as areas of elevated mn concentrations are consistent with the distribution of mn concentrations reported in nacp aquifers in virginia by mcfarland 2010 and with the chemical characteristics in nacp groundwater described by back and barnes 1965 champ et al 1979 chapelle and knobel 1983 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 and others these previous studies describe a regional progression along flow paths resulting from mineral dissolution cation exchange and biological reactions in which major ion chemistry changes dissolved solids increase ph increases from 5 to 8 and redox conditions progress from oxidizing to methanogenic relations of mn concentration class probability with predicted ph and with the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen were consistent with geochemical controls on mn mobility in groundwater generally and with the dissolved oxygen ph framework presented by brown et al 2019 for atlantic coastal plain aquifers the present study extends the geographic representation of the patterns documented in these previous studies and provides a greater level of detail in 3 dimensions of their effects on mn concentrations in addition the importance of variables describing soil texture and proximity to low lying areas with shallow groundwater to mn prediction in the nacp is supported by recent studies that associated greater mn concentrations with soils shallow sediments and hyporheic zones where mn oxides accumulate at the redox interface and undergo reductive dissolution gillispie et al 2016 clague et al 2019 mcmahon et al 2019 and by the finding of high manganese concentrations at near water table shallow depths in several unconsolidated aquifers ying et al 2017 the superior importance of ph and other variables relative to the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen was surprising given the important role of redox condition in influencing mn mobility in groundwater however ph and the other variables describing flow path position and near surface hydrologic conditions may have been better predictors in this study of mn concentration class than the probability of low dissolved oxygen for several reasons the presence of dissolved oxygen is an important control on mineral dissolution precipitation and sorption processes involving mn but once dissolved oxygen and nitrate is depleted as it is in much of the nacp aquifer system other factors become more important moreover reductive dissolution is a source of dissolved mn to groundwater only where the oxidized mn typically in the form of mn oxides hydroxides in the nacp aquifer system is present to serve as the preferred electron acceptor once mn oxides hydroxides are depleted further along flow paths where groundwater is older and more reduced dissolved mn concentrations are again low ying et al 2017 brown et al 2019 the relative importance of the pred ph and pred do2 variables in the nacp mn model is consistent with findings of brown et al 2019 for coastal plain aquifers that although elevated mn was more frequently present in water samples categorized as mn reducing sulfate reducing or methanogenic than in oxic or suboxic samples mn concentrations were correlated with ph but not with dissolved oxygen a more comprehensive and finely detailed measure of redox condition which could capture the extent along flow paths of mn reducing conditions might have been a more effective predictor than dissolved oxygen in the mn model across the nacp aquifer system where redox processes beyond oxygen reduction are extensive on long island ny where the range from oxic to anoxic redox condition extends broadly across multiple aquifers the influence of the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen was clearly apparent in the spatial patterns in the variables contribution of model predictions scale effects may also have been a factor more important for the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen than for predicted ph based on their studies of mn in several unconsolidated aquifers ying et al 2017 and hamer et al 2020 suggested that the small scale heterogeneity in redox conditions found in soil and sediments may obscure the relation between redox condition and groundwater mn when redox is characterized by bulk measurements from wells in the nacp aquifer system the presence of organic rich lignite layers leading to heterogeneous redox conditions were found by back and barnes 1965 in nacp aquifers in maryland such effects are not well characterized by regional measures of dissolved oxygen concentration in addition although neither the ph or dissolved oxygen explanatory variable described vertical variation within aquifers this may have been more consequential for dissolved oxygen because redox conditions can occur in steep vertical gradients in groundwater especially near lithologic boundaries like those between aquifers and confining units pucci et al 1992 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 at a regional scale of the mn classification model factors that varied widely across the entire study area like ph and the flow system position variables may have been more effective predictors than the probability of low dissolved oxygen this may have been because the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen varied significantly across only part of the study area or was not sufficiently sensitive to capture relevant variation in redox condition at smaller local scales 5 conclusions a machine learning model was developed to predict the 3 dimensional distribution of elevated mn concentrations in the nacp aquifer system the model on average correctly identified membership in 4 concentration classes mean sensitivity of 0 588 when generalized to new testing data elevated mn concentrations were predicted to be more prevalent in shallow groundwater close to recharge areas and in topographically low areas where soil or unsaturated processes influence groundwater quality these also are areas of low ph and low probability of anoxic conditions and the study demonstrated that 3 dimensional representations of these geochemical conditions were important predictors of mn concentration seventeen percent of the surficial aquifer area was predicted to have mn concentrations exceeding the us health guideline of 300 μg l and an additional 55 of the surficial aquifer area was predicted to exceed the us aesthetic for drinking water of 50 μg l elevated mn concentrations in deep groundwater were much less prevalent estimating values that occur infrequently such as mn concentrations greater than the health guideline is challenging for predictive models such as the one developed in this study two methods for addressing class imbalance class weights and smote similarly improved the models ability to estimate elevated mn concentrations while minimally decreasing overall model performance class weights was identified as the preferred approach because it did not alter the data as is required by the smote and the other approaches tested mn concentrations above health and aesthetic guidelines remain challenging to predict even when class imbalance is addressed however in part because the health and aesthetic levels important for drinking water quality are not necessarily geochemically meaningful thresholds a limitation of the machine learning models such as the one developed in this study is that the complexity of the model makes it difficult to understand how predictions are derived from explanatory variables variable importance ranking pdps and mapped shap values provided insight into how the nacp mn model used explanatory variables to make predictions of mn class membership for many of the high ranked variables relations with model predictions were interpretable and consistent with prior understanding of their influence this consistency specifically for process based variables such as those describing ph redox conditions and groundwater flow provides confidence in the mapped predictions of mn throughout the nacp aquifer system these tools for interpreting model results also provided insight into the relative importance spatial extent and scales at which the ph and redox condition variables influenced model predictions ph was a substantially more influential predictor than redox condition as represented in the model the extent to which more sensitive and detailed measures of redox condition could improve predictions of mn concentration in the nacp aquifer system is a potential area of future investigation suggested by the study results the machine learning model developed in this study captured regional patterns of mn above health and aesthetic thresholds and can be used at this scale to identify areas at greatest risk for mn contamination in the nacp aquifer system more broadly the study findings also illustrated how methods to address class imbalance easily can be used to improve model predictions of mn and other drinking water contaminants in aquifer systems in addition the relations between elevated mn concentrations and explanatory variables learned by the model for the nacp aquifer system can help inform investigations

8175,study region the study was conducted in the northern atlantic coastal plain aquifer system eastern usa an important water supply in a densely populated region study focus manganese mn an emerging health concern and common nuisance contaminant in drinking water is mapped and modeled using the xgboost machine learning method predictions of ph and redox conditions from previous models and other explanatory variables that describe the groundwater flow system and surface characteristics methods to address the imbalanced occurrence of elevated and low mn concentrations are compared and used to more accurately predict concentrations of interest for human health and drinking water quality new hydrological insights for the region elevated mn concentrations were more likely in shallow groundwater close to recharge areas and in topographically low areas where soil or unsaturated processes influence groundwater quality predicted concentrations greater than the health threshold of 300 micrograms per liter extended across 17 of the surficial aquifer area but across 1 of the areas of underlying aquifers ph and variables related to flow system position and near surface processes were more important predictors than the probability of low dissolved oxygen do mapped variable influence shap values showed that both ph and do variables were related to hydrogeologic conditions class weights which improved the predictive ability for elevated mn without altering the data was the preferred method to address class imbalance keywords manganese groundwater quality machine learning xgboost class imbalance classification prediction drinking water contaminants 1 introduction manganese mn in drinking water is an emerging health concern and a common nuisance contaminant it is ubiquitous in geologic materials and is one of the most frequently detected trace elements in groundwater u s environmental protection agency 2004 cannon et al 2017 although an essential nutrient mn is a neurotoxin at high doses agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 2012 increasingly mn in drinking water is a health concern because of many recent studies that link elevated mn concentrations in drinking water to adverse cognitive memory attention and or behavioral effects in children ljung and vahter 2007 frisbie et al 2012 bouchard et al 2011 khan et al 2011 2012 oulhote et al 2014 o neal and zheng 2015 bjorklund et al 2017 as a nuisance contaminant mn degrades the quality of drinking water supplies by causing an unpleasant taste visible turbidity and color by staining laundry and plumbing fixtures and by accumulating in distribution systems and appliances gerke et al 2016 world health organization 2017 these aesthetic and nuisance issues add to water treatment costs and can undermine public confidence in water safety if untreated kohl and medlar 2006 tobiason et al 2016 although mn has not been as frequently studied as other groundwater contaminants concentrations greater than health guidelines are widespread frisbie et al 2012 for example 6 6 32 of sampled wells in national scale studies in the united states us bangladesh new zealand scotland and sweden exceeded national or world health organization who guidelines of 300 500 micrograms per liter μg l daughney 2003 ljung and vahter 2007 hasan and ali 2010 homoncik et al 2010 desimone et al 2014 mcmahon et al 2019 concentrations exceeding aesthetic or nuisance guidelines 50 100 μg l were reported to range from 23 to 74 of sampled wells in these studies groundwater supplies about 40 of the water used for public and domestic supply in the us and provides a similar fraction of drinking water globally world water assessment programme 2009 dieter et al 2018 where treatment for mn removal is not applied or is ineffective large populations could be consuming groundwater with elevated manganese concentrations the population potentially consuming water with elevated manganese supplied by private household well water which is much less likely to be treated or tested than public or centralized water supplies is estimated for the conterminous us at 2 6 million people mcmahon et al 2019 the northern atlantic coastal plain nacp a complex layered system of 10 regional aquifers is an important water supply in the eastern us it is ranked 5th among 66 us principal aquifers in groundwater withdrawals for public supply and ranked 4th in groundwater withdrawals by privately owned domestic wells lovelace et al 2020 the aquifer system supplies drinking water to more than 20 million people masterson et al 2016a mn is the most frequently occurring geogenic contaminant in the nacp exceeding the us health guideline of 300 μg l in 4 5 of wells and the aesthetic guideline of 50 μg l in 39 44 of wells sampled in 3 of the 10 regional aquifers in the system denver et al 2014 desimone et al 2014 physical and geochemical processes influencing geogenic contaminants like mn have been well studied in the nacp knobel et al 1998 denver et al 2014 masterson et al 2016a brown et al 2019 degnan et al 2020 but detailed information on the 3 dimensional distribution of mn concentrations relevant to human health or drinking water quality is not available much is known about the processes and factors controlling mn in groundwater but the distribution of elevated mn concentrations in aquifers remains difficult to delineate the ubiquitous distribution of mn in soil and aquifer materials means that potential sources are widespread concentrations are influenced by redox conditions and ph because mn oxidation states differ greatly in solubility and stability and mn readily sorbs to redox and ph sensitive oxides hydroxides gilkes and mckenzie 1988 langmuir 1997 kohl and medlar 2006 agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 2012 numerous studies have identified redox condition and ph as the primary factors explaining differences in groundwater mn at national regional and local scales bourg and bertin 1994 homoncik et al 2010 farnsworth and hering 2011 de meyer et al 2017 bondu et al 2018 brown et al 2019 mcmahon et al 2019 hamer et al 2020 hou et al 2020 however these conditions can be difficult to define geographically without understanding groundwater flow patterns and residence times and can vary at small scales lovely and goodwin 1988 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 champ et al 1979 redox and ph conditions also vary in aquifers at multiple scales because of the heterogeneous distribution of dissolved organic carbon and other electron donors the origin of infiltrating groundwater recharge and surface water and anthropogenic influences such as waste disposal urban sources and agricultural practices lee and bennett 1998 christensen et al 2001 clague et al 2019 munz et al 2019 weathering history of soil and aquifer materials also can affect the present day distribution of elevated mn in aquifers gillispie et al 2016 machine learning methods are advantageous for mapping heterogeneous complex phenomena such as mn concentrations in groundwater because they can accurately model the complex non linear relations between contaminant concentrations and explanatory factors without explicit knowledge of the underlying processes hastie et al 2009 kuhn and johnson 2013 machine learning methods have been found superior to more traditional linear modeling methods for predicting groundwater quality including salinity and concentrations of arsenic and nitrate nolan et al 2015 ayotte et al 2016 knoll et al 2019 sahour et al 2020 recent applications demonstrate their use to map mn concentrations in the central valley california rosecrans et al 2017 and the glacial aquifer of the northern us erickson et al 2021 in this study we use extreme gradient boosting xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 a machine learning method to map mn concentration in the nacp system mn concentration is predicted in four classes relevant to drinking water quality below detection in this study 10 μg l detected but less than the us aesthetic guideline of 50 μg l greater than the aesthetic guideline but less than the us health guideline of 300 μg l and greater than the health guideline xgboost is an ensemble tree machine learning method in which predictive models are built from many simple decision trees chen and guestrin 2016 decision trees are added sequentially while minimizing a loss function and each new tree is fit to the residuals of the previous predictions a process known as gradient boosting friedman 2001 elith et al 2008 thus the modeling increasingly focuses on the data instances that are difficult to predict james et al 2013 xgboost uses stochastic gradient boosting which increases model robustness by building each tree on a random subset of the data friedman 2002 gradient boosting methods have been successfully applied to predict groundwater quality in a variety of aquifer settings wang et al 2016 ransom et al 2017 rosecrans et al 2017 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 knoll et al 2019 kneirim et al 2020 stackelberg et al 2020 sahour et al 2020 xgboost is highly accurate efficient and widely used chen and guestrin 2016 the xgboost algorithm also includes regularization terms that penalize model complexity and can thereby counteract overfitting which is a disadvantage of ensemble tree methods chen and guestrin 2016 like many drinking water contaminants in groundwater mn concentrations greater than its health guideline occur much less frequently than concentrations below guidelines imbalanced data sets such as these can pose challenges to modeling applications models tend to be biased toward the more frequently occurring concentrations or concentration class and the classes of greatest interest are typically the least frequent krawczyk 2016 previous predictive modeling approaches in the hydrological sciences have successfully addressed class imbalance by applying resampling techniques which rebalance the response variable messier et al 2019 al abadi and alsamaani 2020 bedi et al 2020 pennino et al 2020 wilson et al 2020 or by post processing the model predictions to encourage fairness podgorski and berg 2020 erickson et al 2021 kneirim et al 2020 other techniques for addressing imbalanced data can be applied within the modeling algorithm sun et al 2009 branco et al 2015 class imbalance in multi class modeling is a particularly complex problem krawczyk 2016 bi and zhang 2018 and not amenable to post processing approaches mn at the high concentration relatively low frequency levels is of the most interest for groundwater quality and human health and so maximizing model accuracy in these classes is beneficial this study has two objectives 1 to map the 3 dimensional distribution of mn concentrations in the nacp aquifer system and 2 to evaluate several common easily applied approaches for dealing with class imbalanced data a novel aspect of the study is the incorporation of previously determined estimates of redox conditions and ph desimone et al 2020 desimone and pope 2020 as predictors of mn occurrence the sensitivity of mn predictions to these variables is assessed at the regional scale using multiple methods including maps of variable importance in summary the study provides a detailed and interpretable 3 dimensional representation of mn at concentrations relevant to human health and drinking water quality across an important us water supply system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 extends along the eastern us coast from long island new york through northeastern north carolina an area of approximately 76 000 km2 square kilometers that encompasses nearly all of the nacp aquifer system it includes such major us cities as new york philadelphia baltimore washington d c and richmond virginia masterson et al 2016a much of the area is forested but agriculture occupies about one third of the study area overall and is predominant in some regions such as the delmarva peninsula denver et al 2014 masterson et al 2016a densely populated urban areas are prevalent on long island and near the major cities along the western edge of the study area the land surface is flat to gently rolling maximum elevation about 150 m and is dissected by major river valleys that are flooded at the coast the climate is temperate and humid ator et al 2005 the aquifer system is a complex stack of fluvial deltaic glacial and marine sediments forming 10 regional aquifers and 9 interlayered confining units table 1

thicken eastwards towards the coast where they reach a combined thickness of more than 1 000 m offshore fig 1 the underlying aquifers are mostly confined except near their western edge an area called the fall zone where they outcrop or subcrop or beneath incised river valleys maps of the 10 regional aquifers and their confined areas when present are provided in desimone et al 2020 the nacp aquifer system is vulnerable to both anthropogenic and geogenic drinking water contaminants agricultural sources wastewater disposal and diverse industries in urban areas contribute nutrients pesticides and volatile organic compounds primarily to the unconfined permeable surficial aquifer denver et al 2014 geogenic contaminants including mn other trace elements and radioactive constituents are present throughout and exceed anthropogenic contaminants in the underlying aquifers lindsey and belitz 2016 degnan et al 2020 additional information about the hydrogeology water quality and geochemistry of the regional aquifers is available by back 1966 knobel et al 1998 ator 2008 mcfarland 2010 denver et al 2014 and masterson et al 2016a and references cited in these studies 2 2 data 2 2 1 response variable mn concentration class was the response variable model output predicted by the models the classes were bounded by concentration thresholds relevant to drinking water quality specifically the us aesthetic and health guidelines as described previously section 1 mn concentration class in groundwater samples from 4 492 wells was used to train and test the models fig 1 the well data were split into 80 training and 20 testing subsets table 2 that maintained the relative proportion of observations within classes using the createdatapartition function of the r caret package v 6 0 86 kuhn 2019 the well data were mostly from a national aggregation of groundwater quality data erickson et al 2019 from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system database 76 of data u s geological survey 2019 the u s environmental protection agency safe drinking water information system 13 of data u s environmental protection agency 2013 and several state agencies 1 of data all data used in this study are available in an accompanying data release desimone and ransom 2021 data from the national aggregation were from samples collected between 1988 and 2018 for heterogeneous purposes from various well types data from the national aggregation were augmented on long island ny by data from the suffolk county water authority scwa 11 of data scwa data were collected primarily from public supply wells and all were from samples collected in 2002 overall the data set consisted of 50 supply wells 36 public 10 domestic 4 other supply 47 monitoring wells and 3 wells of other or unknown type all samples were untreated groundwater and were reported as dissolved concentrations except for the 8 samples from the state agency source for which the sample fraction was not reported 2 2 2 explanatory variables twenty seven explanatory variables were provided as input to the machine learning models table 3 these included descriptors of well location in the hydrologic system groundwater flow and aquifer characteristics surface conditions such as soil texture predicted ph and the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen explanatory variables were attributed to well locations for model training and testing for mn prediction across the study area the variables were attributed to the central points of the 1 km2 grid prediction locations subsurface variables at prediction locations varied by regional aquifer and were defined by depth whereas surface variables were the same for all 10 regional aquifers predictions were made for the freshwater to brackish 10 000 milligrams per liter mg l of chloride parts of the regional aquifers as delineated by pope et al 2016 summary descriptions of the explanatory variables are provided in this section maps of selected explanatory variables are provided in the supplementary information si 7 detailed information about their derivation and sources as well as data values at the well and prediction locations is available in desimone and ransom 2021 2 2 2 1 surface variables explanatory variables describing position on the land surface included distance from the fall zone land surface elevation and the multi order hydrologic position mohp variables table 3 distance from the fall zone was the linear distance from the western study area boundary except on long island ny where it represented distance from a line delineating the maximum water table height of como et al 2015 land surface elevation is derived by point extraction from a 30 m2 scale digital data layer pope et al 2016 mohp variables describe position on the landscape with respect to streams of various orders and their watersheds these were derived by point extraction from 30 m2 digital data layers belitz et al 2019 moore et al 2019 additional variables describing land surface features included soil texture wetlands and land surface nitrogen input table 3 the soil texture variables of percent sand percent silt and percent clay were area and depth weighted averages of ssurgo soil characteristics wieczorek 2014 the wetlands variable was the areal percentage of estuarine riverine and freshwater emergent shrub and forested wetlands from u s fish and wildlife 2019 land surface nitrogen input from fertilizer nolan and hitt 2006 was included because of the potential for nitrogen input to alter geochemical conditions in the shallow surficial aquifer denver et al 2014 the soil texture wetlands and land surface nitrogen input variables were aggregated area weighted averages within 500 m circular buffer areas around well and prediction locations long term mean annual baseflow index evapotranspiration and effective recharge were from 800 m2 scale evapotranspiration and recharge or 1 km2 scale baseflow index national data layers wolock 2003 reitz et al 2017a b these hydrologic variables also were aggregated with 500 m2 circular buffer areas around well and prediction locations 2 2 2 2 subsurface variables explanatory variables describing characteristics in 3 dimensions included those describing the groundwater flow system groundwater age and predicted ph and redox condition table 3 variables describing the groundwater flow system including groundwater flux head and others were output from a 3 dimensional finite difference flow model masterson et al 2016b flow model output was natively gridded horizontally at a 1 6 km2 scale and vertically in sloping layers that corresponded to the 10 regional aquifers these flow model based variables were attributed to wells based on horizontal location of the well within the 1 6 km2 grid cells and on the vertical location of the well screen interval relative to the aquifer layers the variables were set to missing for wells that could not be unambiguously located within a single aquifer layer based on available well screen information the flow model based variables were attributed to prediction locations as area weighted averages within the 1 km2 prediction grid cells desimone and ransom 2021 explanatory variables describing groundwater age were also based on the groundwater flow model based on the 1 6 km2 flow model grid and were similarly attributed to well and prediction locations the groundwater age variables were the 10th percentile median and 90th percentile of simulated groundwater age as described in pope et al 2020 and desimone et al 2020 variables describing predicted ph and the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen were natively gridded using the same 1 km2 grid as used in the present study for mn prediction the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen was represented by the modeled threshold of 2 mg l this level chosen from the three previously modeled thresholds 0 05 1 and 2 mg l desimone et al 2020 was based on the conceptual model of brown et al 2019 for mn in coastal aquifer systems including the nacp two explanatory variables well depth and elevation of the well screen bottom described vertical location in the aquifer system for wells these variables were obtained from the data sources described previously in section 2 2 1 for prediction locations the well depth and well screen bottom elevation variables were set to the vertical midpoints of the regional aquifers at the prediction location thus predictions for the regional aquifers corresponded to sloping surfaces that increased in depth from west to east across the study area except for the surficial aquifer the vertical location of predictions for the surficial aquifer was a relatively flat lying surface defined as the midpoint between the water table and the aquifer bottom 2 3 modeling manganese concentration class modeling mn concentration class in the nacp aquifer system was a two step process first an initial set of xgboost models was built to compare methods for addressing class imbalance second a final model was built to predict mn concentrations throughout the study area using the selected class imbalance method both steps involved building many models to select the best set of xgboost hyperparameters for the given modeling objective all of the models were built using the 80 training subset of response and explanatory data at wells and 10 fold cross validation cv to train the model in this study the process of building a single model by fitting the well data is called model training and the process of evaluating multiple models that differ in terms of xgboost hyperparameters is called model tuning model performance for the final model was evaluated by comparing predicted and observed values from the 20 testing subset of the well data which were data not used in model training or tuning model performance for the class imbalance models was evaluated using the cross validation holdout fit statistics which are based on the training data cv hold out as explained in section 2 3 2 cv holdout fit statistics also were used to tune the models as explained in section 2 3 1 modeling was performed in the r computing environment v 3 6 1 r core team 2018 on the usgs tallgrass supercomputer usgs advanced research computing 2020 once a final model was built it was applied to explanatory variables at prediction locations to predict mn concentration class across the study area a schematic diagram illustration the modeling and prediction process is provided in the supplementary information si 2 2 3 1 xgboost model training and tuning xgboost model training and tuning was done using the caret classification and regression training v 6 0 86 kuhn 2019 and xgboost v 1 1 1 1 chen et al 2020 r packages the xgboost algorithm was run to generate tree based models general parameter booster gbtree and the loss function was specified to return the probability of class membership for multiclass classification learning parameter objective multi softprob a predicted class was assigned to each data point as the class with the highest probability hyperparameters xgboost booster parameters were determined using a grid search a large grid n 19440 including multiple values for each hyperparameter was tested seven hyperparameters were adjusted nrounds the maximum number of iterations eta which controls the learning rate or the contribution of each subsequent tree max depth the maximum allowed tree depth min child weight the minimum number of instances observations allowed in a tree leaf col subsample bytree the proportion of total features used to construct each tree subsample the proportion of the total training data observations used to build each tree and gamma a regularization parameter chen et al 2020 the range of values in the grid were as follows nrounds 100 2300 varying by 200 eta 0 005 0 2 5 values max depth 3 7 varying by 2 min child weight 3 9 varying by 3 colsample bytree 0 5 0 9 varying by 0 2 subsample 0 5 0 9 varying by 2 and gamma 0 2 varying by 1 optimal xgboost hyperparameters were selected for a given modeling objective using the results of stratified 10 fold cv applied to the 80 training subset of the data an example of a modeling objective is to determine a model that best fits the training data for one of the class imbalance approaches in 10 fold cv the data set is split into 10 subsets folds of which 9 are used to build the model and the held out 10th is used to evaluate the model this splitting and model building is repeated 10 times the optimized model performance metric is averaged across the 10 cv holdout folds the createfolds function of caret was used to split the data into 10 stratified folds using random sampling within the class levels of the response variable so that each cv training and testing fold was representative of the original distribution of data among the 4 mn classes the same folds were used for the tuning and evaluation of all models so that differences in cv fold splits was not a source of variability in model comparisons 2 3 2 testing and comparison of imbalanced data methods four commonly used approaches for addressing class imbalance were investigated over sampling under sampling synthetic minority oversampling technique smote chawla et al 2002 and class weights in over sampling instances of the minority classes are randomly replicated so that they are equal in number to the majority class in under sampling instances of the majority classes are randomly removed so they are equal in number to the minority class in smote the majority class is under sampled and synthetic instances of the minority class are created by interpolation between existing k nearest neighbor minority instances in feature space the class weights approach is a type of cost sensitive learning sun et al 2009 weights are applied by class so that the misclassification of data points in the more highly weighted class es contributes more to the minimized error function than misclassification of data in the lower weighted class es multiple models were tested for the smote and class weights methods and a best model using performance metrics was selected to represent the method for comparison among all four imbalance techniques optimal smote parameters for the percent over sampling perc over and under sampling perc under parameters are expected to vary by data set chawla et al 2002 kuhn 2008 the tested values of perc over and perc under ranged from 100 to 600 and were determined by trial and error using the default parameters in the r caret package kuhn 2019 of 200 as a starting point the default value of 5 for k the number of nearest neighbors included in the minority class data interpolation chawla et al 2002 was used for all tests alternatives were initially tested but did not lead to performance improvements eight parameter combinations were tested for smote class weights were set initially equal to the inverse proportions of class frequency such that the weight applied to instances of each class was equal to the class frequencies divided by the frequency of the least prevalent class 7 44 in the 300 μg l category for the entire data set models using this base case set of weights overestimated the 300 μg l category so weight sets tested subsequently were reduced proportionately in magnitude while maintaining their relative proportions fig 2 fourteen uniformly varying weight sets not shown also were investigated a total of 19 sets of weights were tested for the class weights approach the class imbalance methods were applied within the caret package which performs the over sampling under sampling or smote modifications to the data prior to cv testing but after separation of the data into folds figure si 2 of the supplementary information only the training data folds were modified with over sampling under sampling or smote the models were tested on unmodified data kuhn 2019 weights similarly were applied only during model training this approach ensures that model performance metrics are not overly optimistic as the result of testing on artificially balanced versions of the data the models compared to evaluate the four class imbalance methods were each the result of caret tuning as described previously and built with the optimal hyperparameters identified by the grid search and 10 fold cv 2 3 3 model performance metrics model performance was evaluated using sensitivity specificity positive predictive value negative predictive value and kappa sensitivity also known as recall is the percentage of true positive instances correctly predicted positive predictive value ppv also known as precision is the percentage of positively predicted instances that are true positives sensitivity and ppv are similar but sensitivity is a measure of how accurately the model identifies positive values whereas ppv is a measure of confidence in values that are predicted as positive specificity is the percentage of true negative instances correctly predicted negative predictive value npv is the percentage of negatively predicted instances that are true negatives sensitivity specificity ppv and npv were computed by class by comparing prediction rates in the class of interest against prediction rates in all other classes combined a one versus all approach kuhn 2008 mean sensitivity mean specificity mean ppv and mean npv per model were calculated as the averages of the four by class metrics these provide overall performance measures for the entire model across all classes kappa is a measure of agreement between observed and predicted value that takes into account the degree of agreement that would be due to chance kuhn and johnson 2013 it is a single metric per model representing predictions in all four classes mean sensitivity was the metric used to select optimal model hyperparameters mean sensitivity and by class sensitivity were used to compare the models developed with the class imbalance methods and select a final model mean sensitivity provides an overall balanced measure of a model s success in correctly classifying data points and by class sensitivity provides information on the degree to which data points in the higher concentration classes which are of greater interest for water quality are correctly identified 2 4 interpreting the models the influence of explanatory variables in models was investigated in three ways to provide insight into the patterns of occurrence learned by the model and help interpret model results relative variable importance calculated as the normalized total information gain provided by variables in the model was used to rank the explanatory variables in terms of influence chen et al 2020 partial dependence plots pdps were used to investigate the relations between individual explanatory variables and model predictions pdps show the relation between an explanatory variable and the predicted probability of class membership when all other variables are held at their observed values greenwell 2017 and are based on the observations training well data used to build the model spatial patterns in variable importance were investigated using shap values shapley additive explanation values lundberg and lee 2017 shap values quantify the contribution of each variable to each individual prediction made by the model for example at wells or prediction locations numerically the shap values for all variables for an individual prediction sum to the difference between the prediction and a base predicted value where the base value is the result that would be determined for example like an average value with no information from explanatory variables thus the absolute magnitude of mapped shap values depicts where individual features are more or less important across the study area the sign positive or negative of the shap values indicates whether the variable contributed an increase or decrease to the predicted value relative to the base value shap values were calculated separately for each class using the functionality within the xgboost r package chen et al 2020 3 results 3 1 manganese concentrations in wells manganese concentrations ranged from 10 to 75 100 μg l with a median value of 18 μg l 17 of the concentrations were less than laboratory reporting limits concentrations were inversely related to well depth distance from the fall zone and dissolved oxygen concentration mn detections 10 μg l were mostly in samples of ph 7 5 see supplementary information si 1 the shallow unconfined surficial aquifer had both the largest number of samples and the largest percentage of mn concentrations greater than 50 or 300 μg l compared to underlying confined aquifers fig 1 wells in close geographic proximity neighboring can vary substantially in depth and be completed in different regional aquifers this is one reason for the variability observed in concentration in map view fig 1 relations with well depth and distance from the fall zone si 1 reflect the greater prevalence of elevated mn in the surficial aquifer and shallow unconfined parts of the underlying aquifers fig 1 overall 7 4 of wells had concentrations greater than the health guideline of 300 μg l and 29 4 of wells had concentrations greater than the aesthetic guideline of 50 μg l table 2 rates comparable to those found nationally in the us desimone et al 2014 mcmahon et al 2019 the well data and additional information about data processing are available in an accompanying data release desimone and ransom 2021 3 2 model selection and performance 3 2 1 class imbalance models performance metrics for models built with the original unmodified and unweighted data called here the unmodified data model and with the four class imbalance methods are shown in figs 3 overall model and 4 by class metrics the parameters used in the selected smote model were perc over 200 perc under 600 and k 5 the selected model for the class weights approach used weights that were based on the inverse proportions of class frequency but reduced by 60 in magnitude set d fig 2 imbalance method parameters weights xgboost hyperparameters and performance metric values for all models tested for the class imbalance comparison are provided in table si 3 of the supplementary information performance metrics described in this section are means of values from the cv holdout subsets the unmodified data model had a cv holdout mean sensitivity of 0 555 fig 3 and a kappa of 0 420 by class sensitivity for the unmodified data model ranged from 0 714 for the lowest concentration highest frequency class concentrations 10 μg l class 1 representing non detects to 0 433 for the highest concentration lowest frequency class concentrations greater 300 μg l class 4 representing concentrations greater than the health guideline fig 4 a this was an expected result because of the imbalanced distribution of data among classes the unmodified data model also underpredicted the percent of data points in class 4 and in class 2 fig 4a all four methods of addressing the class imbalance yielded models that were more successful at prediction in the highest concentration lowest frequency class 4 than the unmodified data model fig 4a by class sensitivity for class 4 increased from 0 433 for the unmodified data model to 0 541 0 698 for the models made with class imbalance methods under sampling yielded the greatest increase in class 4 sensitivity 0 698 fig 4c but also resulted in the largest decreases in overall model fit as measured by kappa 0 333 mean sensitivity mean specificity mean ppv and mean npv class 4 sensitivity in the smote model increased to 0 579 fig 4d but like under sampling the smote approach resulted in decreased kappa 0 387 in contrast both over sampling and class weights increased by class sensitivity for class 4 while only very slightly decreasing kappa 0 410 and 0 408 respectively fig 4b and e the over sampling and class weights also produced the most equitable sensitivities for the four classes and better matched the percentage of data points in the high class 4 we selected the class weights approach as the method most suited for predicting mn concentrations in the nacp study area although results from over sampling and class weights were similar the class weights predictions fig 4e more closely matched the percentage of observed data points in the high concentration category than the over sampling approach fig 4b the class weights approach also was preferred because within each class it gives equal consideration to each training data point in the over sampling method random resampling has the effect of unequally weighting some data points in the minority class those that are replicated more frequently than others thus the unmodified data set was represented most closely using the class weights approach 3 2 2 final model a single final model was built using the class weights approach by applying the xgboost algorithm to the entire training data set using the selected weights set and the optimal hyperparameters hyperparameters weights and model performance metrics for this model are provided in table 4 application of the final model to the testing data set yielded model performance metrics of 0 588 for mean sensitivity and 0 459 for kappa by class sensitivity ranged from 0 515 to 0 717 still greatest in class 1 but relatively equitable among classes 1 3 the percentage of observations was slightly overpredicted for class 4 and slightly underpredicted for class 1 model performance metrics for the final model applied to the testing data subset were similar to those from the 10 fold cv for the class weights model table si 3 which is an expected result because like the testing data subset the cv holdout folds also are independent measures of model performance relative to the cv training data sets model performance measures such as sensitivity specificity ppv npv and kappa tabulate correct classifications which are based on the class with the maximum predicted probability among the four classes in the model the class probabilities also provide information about relative model performance among classes fig 5 shows the probability of the predicted class for all correctly predicted observations wells the probability of the predicted class was generally higher for the lowest class 1 and highest class 4 concentration classes than for the intermediate concentration classes 2 and 3 suggesting that it was more difficult for the model to distinguish these intermediate concentration classes 3 3 mapped manganese concentrations predictions of mn concentration class and class probabilities are shown for the top 4 regional aquifers in terms of water supply withdrawals fig 6 maps for all 10 aquifers are provided in the supplementary information si 4 areas likely to have mn concentrations greater than the health guideline of 300 μg l class 4 are primarily in the surficial aquifer areas where class 4 was predicted which occupied 17 of the onshore surficial aquifer area were along the western boundary of the study area along coastal boundaries and in parts of eastern virginia and north carolina in several of the underlying aquifers including the potomac patapsco there also are scattered areas where class 4 is predicted along the upland western boundary of the study area where the aquifers outcrop and or are unconfined throughout most of the underlying aquifers however the areal extent of predicted class 4 was 1 predicted mn concentrations greater than the aesthetic guideline of 50 μg l but less than the health guideline class 3 were more widespread than predictions in class 4 about half 55 of the surficial aquifer was predicted in class 3 by combining the areas predicted in class 3 and in class 4 72 of the surficial aquifer area was predicted to have mn concentrations greater than the aesthetic guideline in the underlying aquifers areas predicted in class 3 like class 4 areas are along the western boundary of the study area in the magothy and potomac patapsco aquifers areas in class 3 also are predicted in southeastern maryland southeastern virginia and eastern north carolina there are few wells in the data set in these deep aquifers in these areas and so predictions in the deep aquifers may be more uncertain however these results are consistent with the patterns described by mcfarland 2010 in the deeper aquifers of the nacp coastal plain of virginia of high concentrations in the west along the fall zone lower concentrations in a central band and high concentrations in the east near the fresh saltwater transition zone mn concentrations in class 1 less than the detection limit of 10 μg l were predicted in the surficial aquifer only on long island ny but class 1 was the predicted class in broad areas of the underlying aquifers class 1 was predicted throughout most of the eastern lower chesapeake piney point and aquia aquifers aquifer layers 5 7 and 9 and in central parts of the monmouth mt laurel matawan magothy and potomac patapsco aquifers layers 11 13 15 and 17 the probability of the class 1 predictions exceeded 0 5 on average in most of these aquifers reflecting the relative ease of predicting where mn is absent as opposed to predicting a specific concentration class as discussed previously section 3 1 in the context of predictions at wells the accuracy of the maps at individual point locations is described by the model performance statistics for testing well data specifically by the overall mean sensitivity of 0 588 and mean specificity of 0 867 table 4 maps of incorrectly and correctly classified wells showed that there was no spatial bias in the distribution of model error supplementary information si 8 the proximity of incorrectly classified wells to mapped areas of the correct observed class is another qualitative indicator of map accuracy in the testing data set 74 of incorrectly classified wells in the testing data set were within 5 km of a prediction location that was mapped as the correct observed class for the well thus although not always accurate at the scale of individual well or point locations the model successfully identified regional patterns of occurrence of the mn concentration classes 3 4 importance of ph low dissolved oxygen and other explanatory variables 3 4 1 overall variable importance and partial dependence plots predicted ph pred ph was the top ranked variable in terms of importance and the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen concentration 2 mg l pred do2 was ranked 10th fig 7 pdps show that the probability of mn class 1 membership mn 10 μg l non detections fig 8 a increases with increasing pred ph and decreases with increasing pred do2 fig 8j thus the likelihood of mn below detection is higher in alkaline water and lower in anoxic groundwater as expected from the geochemistry of mn in groundwater in addition the class 1 pdp for pred ph identifies the ph range of 7 8 as a threshold for distinguishing the absence of detectable mn from its presence which conforms well to the finding by brown et al 2019 of ph 7 5 as a threshold between low and elevated 150 μg l mn concentrations in several atlantic coastal plain aquifers the relations shown by the pdps for class 4 membership mn 300 μg l for pred ph and pred do2 are more complex than those for class 1 and are not monotonic the influences of pred ph and pred do2 on the probability of class 4 also are smaller than their influence on class 1 probability note the differences in y axis scale range between the class 1 and class 4 pdps the pdp for pred ph shows that the probability of mn class 4 is low when ph 5 increases from ph 5 to 6 and generally decreases again from ph 6 to 8 these trends also may be explained by the co occurrence of ph and dissolved oxygen redox conditions in the aquifers as represented by well data for training the model observations wells in the ph range 5 were mostly oxygenated measured dissolved oxygen 2 mg l in 82 of observations as compared to observations in the ph range 6 which were mostly anoxic dissolved oxygen 2 mg l in 77 of observations thus although the ph range 6 is geochemically favorable for elevated mn these ph conditions did not typically co occur with reducing conditions in the nacp aquifer system as represented by the study data set well depth welldepth distance from the fall zone dist fallzone and groundwater age age 90th pct ranked 3rd 8th and 9th are simple measures of flow path distance from recharge areas in the aquifer system pdp plots fig 8c show that with increasing welldepth up to 70 m the probability of class 1 membership mn 10 μg l increases and the probability of class 4 membership mn 300 μg l decreases indicating that shallower parts of the aquifer system over this depth range are more likely to have detectable and elevated mn concentrations thereafter the predicted probability is relatively constant until about 200 m after which it decreases again for class 1 and increases for class 4 reflecting the possible presence of detectable and elevated mn at great depths however this depth range includes less than 10 of the well data making the relations in these regions less certain similarly with increasing dist fallzone class 1 probability generally increases after an initial decrease for dist fallzone 10 km and class 4 probability decreases fig 8h indicating that overall parts of the aquifer closer to fall zone are more likely to have detectable and elevated mn concentrations the age variable age 90th pctl the 90th percentile of simulated groundwater residence time in the aquifer layer in which the well is screened is a measure of flow path distance in time rather than in space the pdps for age 90th pctl fig 8i show an inflection point at about 100 years and indicate that elevated mn class 4 mn 300 μg l is less likely to be present in old groundwater as measured by this variable thus pdps for welldepth dist fallzone and age 90th pctl all show that the model is capturing patterns of higher mn closer to aquifer recharge locations or the water table and decreasing mn along flow paths land surface elevation ls elev the percent of silt in soil soil silt pct and base flow index bfi also among the top 10 variables influence predicted mn class probability in ways that suggest the importance of near surface processes the relations of mn class 1 and class 4 probability with ls elev in pdps fig 8f show that detectable and elevated mn are more likely in groundwater beneath low lying areas low lying areas in the study area are extensive in the coastal lowlands of eastern north carolina southern virginia and the southern delmarva peninsula and also occur along coastal margins in northern parts of the study area see supplementary information si 7 for maps of ls elev in southern coastal lowlands which include the most extensive areas where mn class 4 is predicted sediments are fine grained and organic rich wetlands are prevalent groundwater is shallow and surface drainage is poor these conditions lead to anoxic groundwater at shallow depths in the surficial aquifer ator et al 2005 pdps for soil silt pct fig 8g show that higher soil silt content a characteristic of poorly drained soils was associated with a higher probability of elevated mn class 4 and a lower probability of non detectable mn class 1 low bfi which is the estimated contribution of groundwater to streamflow groundwater discharge wolock 2003 was associated with a higher probability of elevated mn class 4 fig 8b bfi is low throughout the poorly drained coastal lowlands but bfi also is low in upland areas along parts of the fall zone thus patterns in bfi could be related to mn class probability because they help define low lying areas but also because patterns in bfi help define distance from recharge areas the multi order hydrologic position variables dsd9 and dsd5 fig 8d e which are measures of position on the landscape with respect to streams and watershed divides belitz et al 2019 similarly capture information both about flow path distance from the fall zone and the location of the low lying areas in the southern parts of the study area the relations shown by pdps for ls elev soil silt pct bfi dsd9 and dsd5 point to the importance of near surface or unsaturated zone processes on mn concentrations these relations also suggest interactions among variables which were not specifically assessed in this study 3 4 2 spatial patterns in variable importance for predicted ph and the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen although predicted ph the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen and the other variables discussed were the most important variables overall they were not equally important everywhere mapped shap values across the study area fig 9 show how pred ph and pred do2 contributed to model predictions in the uppermost surficial aquifer and in the underlying aquifers using the magothy aquifer to provide an example for the underlying aquifers the pred ph and pred do2 variables were used for the illustration to further investigate the importance of these variables in the model the values in fig 9 represent the shap values of model predictions made at the prediction locations fig 6 for two of the four mn classes class 1 representing non detects mn 10 μg l and class 4 representing values greater than the health threshold mn 300 μg l as described in section 2 4 shap values quantify the contribution of individual variables to each individual prediction the magnitude of shap value indicates how much a variable contributes to an individual prediction the sign positive or negative of the shap values indicates the direction of influence whether the variable increased or decreased the individual predicted value relative to a no information prediction for the response variable at the prediction location in the surficial aquifer shap values for pred ph were relatively large in magnitude and negative in sign for mn class 1 indicating that pred ph contributed negatively to the predicted probability of mn membership in class 1 throughout the surficial aquifer fig 9a in other words the pred ph values in the surficial aquifer where ph was generally acidic desimone et al 2020 reduced the predicted probability of class 1 membership reducing the probability of undetectable mn and thus more likely that mn would be predicted as detected in the surficial aquifer shap values for pred ph and mn class 1 in the underlying magothy aquifer varied from large and negative near the fall zone to large and positive away from the fall zone fig 9c thus pred ph contributed negatively to mn class 1 membership predictions near the fall zone area where ph was generally acidic like in the surficial aquifer and positively to mn class 1 membership predictions away from the fall zone where ph was generally alkaline in other words the pred ph values increased the predicted probability of class 1 membership near the fall zone in the magothy aquifer and decreased it away from the fall zone the pred ph variable also contributed positively to mn class 4 membership mn 300 μg l predictions in the surficial aquifer in the distal and low lying parts of the study area fig 9b the magnitude of shap values for pred do2 fig 9e h was generally lower than shap values for pred ph fig 9a d as expected from the lower importance of pred do2 as compared to pred ph described previously however although its importance was relatively low in much of the aquifer area shown its spatial patterns are meaningful where pred do2 contributes positively to class 1 membership predictions it generally contributes negatively to class 4 membership predictions the spatial patterns in variable importance shown by the shap values can be related more directly to groundwater flow system characteristics in the northeastern part of the study area on long island ny figs 1 and 10 on long island the unconfined surficial aquifer directly overlies the magothy aquifer the intervening aquifers are absent and the magothy aquifer is unconfined except along the southern edge of the island pope et al 2016 groundwater flows north and south from recharge areas in the center of the island towards discharge areas along the coasts fig 10 i como et al 2015 predicted ph is low pred ph 6 5 throughout both aquifers the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen also is low groundwater is oxic throughout both aquifers except in the magothy aquifer where the aquifer is confined along the southern island edge see the supplementary information si 7 patterns in shap values for pred ph generally are similar to study area wide patterns fig 10a d shap values for pred do2 fig 10e h also are similar to study area wide patterns but also clearly show the influence of groundwater flow and recharge patterns especially in the magothy aquifer fig 10g h in the unconfined areas of the magothy aquifer where recharge can occur pred do2 is low groundwater is unlikely to be anoxic that is groundwater is oxic and this variable contributes positively to the prediction of class 1 membership undetectable mn fig 10g in the confined areas pred do2 is high groundwater is likely anoxic and the variable contributes negatively to the predictions of class 1 membership fig 10g the contributions of pred do2 to predictions of class 4 membership mn greater than health thresholds are similar in extent but opposite in direction fig 10h thus patterns of variable influence demonstrate that the model used the pred ph and pred do2 variables in ways that are interpretable and consistent with flow system controls on groundwater geochemistry 4 discussion maps such as those produced with the machine learning model for mn concentration class in this study are a way of translating onto the landscape the patterns of occurrence contained within groundwater quality data sets the aquifers and areas in the nacp aquifer system that are identified as areas of elevated mn concentrations are consistent with the distribution of mn concentrations reported in nacp aquifers in virginia by mcfarland 2010 and with the chemical characteristics in nacp groundwater described by back and barnes 1965 champ et al 1979 chapelle and knobel 1983 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 and others these previous studies describe a regional progression along flow paths resulting from mineral dissolution cation exchange and biological reactions in which major ion chemistry changes dissolved solids increase ph increases from 5 to 8 and redox conditions progress from oxidizing to methanogenic relations of mn concentration class probability with predicted ph and with the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen were consistent with geochemical controls on mn mobility in groundwater generally and with the dissolved oxygen ph framework presented by brown et al 2019 for atlantic coastal plain aquifers the present study extends the geographic representation of the patterns documented in these previous studies and provides a greater level of detail in 3 dimensions of their effects on mn concentrations in addition the importance of variables describing soil texture and proximity to low lying areas with shallow groundwater to mn prediction in the nacp is supported by recent studies that associated greater mn concentrations with soils shallow sediments and hyporheic zones where mn oxides accumulate at the redox interface and undergo reductive dissolution gillispie et al 2016 clague et al 2019 mcmahon et al 2019 and by the finding of high manganese concentrations at near water table shallow depths in several unconsolidated aquifers ying et al 2017 the superior importance of ph and other variables relative to the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen was surprising given the important role of redox condition in influencing mn mobility in groundwater however ph and the other variables describing flow path position and near surface hydrologic conditions may have been better predictors in this study of mn concentration class than the probability of low dissolved oxygen for several reasons the presence of dissolved oxygen is an important control on mineral dissolution precipitation and sorption processes involving mn but once dissolved oxygen and nitrate is depleted as it is in much of the nacp aquifer system other factors become more important moreover reductive dissolution is a source of dissolved mn to groundwater only where the oxidized mn typically in the form of mn oxides hydroxides in the nacp aquifer system is present to serve as the preferred electron acceptor once mn oxides hydroxides are depleted further along flow paths where groundwater is older and more reduced dissolved mn concentrations are again low ying et al 2017 brown et al 2019 the relative importance of the pred ph and pred do2 variables in the nacp mn model is consistent with findings of brown et al 2019 for coastal plain aquifers that although elevated mn was more frequently present in water samples categorized as mn reducing sulfate reducing or methanogenic than in oxic or suboxic samples mn concentrations were correlated with ph but not with dissolved oxygen a more comprehensive and finely detailed measure of redox condition which could capture the extent along flow paths of mn reducing conditions might have been a more effective predictor than dissolved oxygen in the mn model across the nacp aquifer system where redox processes beyond oxygen reduction are extensive on long island ny where the range from oxic to anoxic redox condition extends broadly across multiple aquifers the influence of the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen was clearly apparent in the spatial patterns in the variables contribution of model predictions scale effects may also have been a factor more important for the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen than for predicted ph based on their studies of mn in several unconsolidated aquifers ying et al 2017 and hamer et al 2020 suggested that the small scale heterogeneity in redox conditions found in soil and sediments may obscure the relation between redox condition and groundwater mn when redox is characterized by bulk measurements from wells in the nacp aquifer system the presence of organic rich lignite layers leading to heterogeneous redox conditions were found by back and barnes 1965 in nacp aquifers in maryland such effects are not well characterized by regional measures of dissolved oxygen concentration in addition although neither the ph or dissolved oxygen explanatory variable described vertical variation within aquifers this may have been more consequential for dissolved oxygen because redox conditions can occur in steep vertical gradients in groundwater especially near lithologic boundaries like those between aquifers and confining units pucci et al 1992 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 at a regional scale of the mn classification model factors that varied widely across the entire study area like ph and the flow system position variables may have been more effective predictors than the probability of low dissolved oxygen this may have been because the predicted probability of low dissolved oxygen varied significantly across only part of the study area or was not sufficiently sensitive to capture relevant variation in redox condition at smaller local scales 5 conclusions a machine learning model was developed to predict the 3 dimensional distribution of elevated mn concentrations in the nacp aquifer system the model on average correctly identified membership in 4 concentration classes mean sensitivity of 0 588 when generalized to new testing data elevated mn concentrations were predicted to be more prevalent in shallow groundwater close to recharge areas and in topographically low areas where soil or unsaturated processes influence groundwater quality these also are areas of low ph and low probability of anoxic conditions and the study demonstrated that 3 dimensional representations of these geochemical conditions were important predictors of mn concentration seventeen percent of the surficial aquifer area was predicted to have mn concentrations exceeding the us health guideline of 300 μg l and an additional 55 of the surficial aquifer area was predicted to exceed the us aesthetic for drinking water of 50 μg l elevated mn concentrations in deep groundwater were much less prevalent estimating values that occur infrequently such as mn concentrations greater than the health guideline is challenging for predictive models such as the one developed in this study two methods for addressing class imbalance class weights and smote similarly improved the models ability to estimate elevated mn concentrations while minimally decreasing overall model performance class weights was identified as the preferred approach because it did not alter the data as is required by the smote and the other approaches tested mn concentrations above health and aesthetic guidelines remain challenging to predict even when class imbalance is addressed however in part because the health and aesthetic levels important for drinking water quality are not necessarily geochemically meaningful thresholds a limitation of the machine learning models such as the one developed in this study is that the complexity of the model makes it difficult to understand how predictions are derived from explanatory variables variable importance ranking pdps and mapped shap values provided insight into how the nacp mn model used explanatory variables to make predictions of mn class membership for many of the high ranked variables relations with model predictions were interpretable and consistent with prior understanding of their influence this consistency specifically for process based variables such as those describing ph redox conditions and groundwater flow provides confidence in the mapped predictions of mn throughout the nacp aquifer system these tools for interpreting model results also provided insight into the relative importance spatial extent and scales at which the ph and redox condition variables influenced model predictions ph was a substantially more influential predictor than redox condition as represented in the model the extent to which more sensitive and detailed measures of redox condition could improve predictions of mn concentration in the nacp aquifer system is a potential area of future investigation suggested by the study results the machine learning model developed in this study captured regional patterns of mn above health and aesthetic thresholds and can be used at this scale to identify areas at greatest risk for mn contamination in the nacp aquifer system more broadly the study findings also illustrated how methods to address class imbalance easily can be used to improve model predictions of mn and other drinking water contaminants in aquifer systems in addition the relations between elevated mn concentrations and explanatory variables learned by the model for the nacp aquifer system can help inform investigations of mn a contaminant of emerging health concern globally in other regional aquifers author statement leslie desimone conceptualization methodology software investigation data curation writing original

resolution or the implementation of improved model physics doblas reyes et al 2005 saha et al 2006 wanders and wood 2016 yuan et al 2015 were achieved consequently these findings could be integrated into hydrological applications where long range climate forecasts providing information about future atmospheric conditions averaged over periods of one to three months are then used for generating

economic benefit of energy production forecasts and iii the comparison of hydrological modelling results with alternative machine learning techniques this paper summarizes the findings of research question i the hydrological forecasting performance based on the case study area of the danube basin upstream of vienna austria the research questions ii and iii could be a motivation for further studies the danube river basin is europe s second largest river basin with a total drainage area of 801 463 km2 more than 80 million people from 19 countries share the danube catchment area making it the world s most international river basin the economic value of the danube river is immense it is a vital resource for water supply sustaining biodiversity agriculture industry fishing recreation tourism power generation and navigation icpdr 2020 the upper danube basin representing the headwater domain of the entire basin is characterized by complex topography dominated by the alps with numerous rivers steep sloped drainage systems and high precipitation sums although the share of the alpine space in relation to the overall catchment is only around 10 for the danube the alps contribute 26 to the total discharge wesemann et al 2018 large gradients in combination with high runoff volumes provide an ideal setting for hydropower production the hydropower sector therefore also plays an important role for electricity production whereas the contribution to the overall electrical energy production is about 55 65 in single countries like austria or switzerland batzing 1999 wesemann et al 2018 hydrological forecasting models can provide valuable and objective information for the planning of the energy production but also reservoir management short term hydrological forecasting models with typical lead times of 48 h to 14 days into the future are already frequently used with the aim of hydropower production optimisation e g hamlet et al 2002 schulz et al 2016 stanzel et al 2008 wesemann et al 2018 a reliable seasonal discharge forecasting system e g with a lead time up to 3 6 months could bring an important improvement in the long term optimization of the

forecasts in the field of hydropower production information on the expected status of water resources generated by a seasonal forecasting system would benefit many different areas including river navigation thermal power plant operation or drought risk management in the last years all over the world several seasonal discharge forecast systems have been developed for different purposes schepen et al 2016b yuan et al 2013 following arnal et al 2018 the most important advances related to seasonal discharge forecast in the last century are briefly cited below already at the beginning of the last century the first seasonal discharge forecasting method was developed in united states the expected summer discharge was thereby estimated by the status of the snowpack in winter and spring which was used as initial conditions in the estimations church 1935 over the years acquired understanding of streamflow generation processes and developments in the computational and simulation sector enabled the use of more sophisticated techniques for developing seasonal forecasting systems the most relevant developments were on one side the creation of the first hydrological models and on the other side the recording of longer observed meteorological series the first operational model based seasonal streamflow forecasting system was developed by the united states national weather system nws in the 1970s day 1985 twedt et al 1977 this forecast system was named extended streamflow prediction or ensemble streamflow prediction esp depending on the literature reviewed day 1985 wood et al 2002 the esp forecasts were generated by means of a hydrological model driven by resampled observed meteorology of the past where the current initial hydrologic conditions ihc were updated with near real time observed meteorological time series in basins where meteorological forcings dominate the predictability of the downstream hydrology the lack of information on the future climate is a significant limitation of the esp the better scientific understanding of ocean atmosphere land interactions allowed the identification of large scale climate patterns which are important in the predictability of different meteorological and hydrological events goddard et al 2001 troccoli 2010 this fact together with the increase in computing resources allowed to perform global scale dynamically coupled circulation models at high temporal and spatial resolution doblas reyes et al 2013 nevertheless the spatial resolution of seasonal forecasts is coarse compared to the finer resolution of hydrological models established for predictions on a more regional scale in consequence different downscaling algorithms were developed over the last years benestad 2004 fowler et al 2007 von storch et al 1993 one of the most recent downscaling algorithms was implemented to generate the climate data provided in this study kreienkamp et al 2019 several discharge forecasting systems have been developed in europe e g for the united kingdom bell et al 2017 prudhomme et al 2017 france ćeron et al 2010 crochemore et al 2016 singla et al 2011 or central europe demirel et al 2015 meißner et al 2017 on the european level the european flood awareness system efas is one of the most relevant services providing an operational pan european hydrological forecasting system smith et al 2016 in other parts of the world there has been relatively more seasonal discharge forecasting systems analyzed in part due to the reason that other areas around the world have a better seasonal predictability compared to europe that is the case of australia united states and africa bennett et al 2017 hansen et al 2011 mendoza et al 2017 the aim of this study is to analyze the state and skill of current seasonal discharge forecasts for the upper danube basin upstream of vienna and to better understand the limitations of seasonal discharge forecasting systems in central europe the estimation of the initial states of the catchment e g soil moisture levels snow cover or snow water equivalent distribution play a significant role especially in alpine areas where discharge exhibits a pronounced seasonality due to snow accumulation and snow melt processes errors in the estimation of the initial conditions could lead to a lower quality of the seasonal discharge forecasts therefore two different datasets for the calculation of the initial conditions of the hydrological model are assessed apart from the initial conditions the skill of the seasonal climate forecast used to force the hydrological model also have a relevant control over the skill of the seasonal discharge forecasts the better the seasonal climate forecast is the higher are the chances to get a successful seasonal discharge forecast the current paper describes the development of the seasonal discharge forecasting system for the upper danube basin section 2 paying attention to the available meteorological data section 3 and to the role of the hydrological model section 4 and to evaluate the seasonal discharge forecasting system section 5 the evaluations and analysis consider the whole danube basin upstream of vienna as well one smaller sub catchment within the inn sub basin finally section 6 summarizes the different findings and conclusions 2 study area the study area consists of the danube basin upstream of vienna covering an area of 101 810 km² see fig 1 the danube in vienna has a mean annual discharge of 1923 m³ s for the period 1961 1990 the southern part of the basin is dominated by the alps in the northern low land valleys expand over large areas the main tributaries at least regarding the runoff contribution to the danube are located in the alpine areas from west to east the main southern tributaries are the rivers lech isar inn salzach traun and enns the largest tributary by runoff volume is the inn which has a larger mean annual discharge compared to the danube at the confluence in the northern part of the basin the naab tributary coming from bavarian forest has some relevance the hydrological regime is driven by the alps which is characterized by low winter temperatures snow accumulation and melt processes several hydropower dams and reservoirs exist which influence the runoff regime the inn subcatchment upstream of wasserburg with an area of 12 209 km² fig 1 is considered in this study as an example of alpine dominated catchment in central europe 3 meteorological and hydrological datasets different meteorological datasets provided by the germany s national meteorological services the deutscher wetterdienst dwd are used temperature and precipitation are needed to drive the hydrological model for simulating discharge generally meteorological data are needed for i model parameter calibration and validation ii calculating the initial system states for the forecast model warm up and iii calculating seasonal forecast the characteristics of each meteorological dataset together with its role in this study are explained in the following section table 1 offers an overview of the meteorological datasets used in this study also fig 2 shows examples of the mean temperature and precipitation conditions for the spring season of the years 2001 2015 for the different meteorological dataset used the influence of the spatial resolution on the spatial patterns of the meteorological parameters is clearly reflected in the precipitation charts additionally river discharge time series at each gauging station located in the catchment are needed generally data in a daily resolution are used 3 1 meteorological datasets 3 1 1 reanalysis data reanalysis data in our case cosmo rea6 with a spatial resolution of 0 055 6 km is used for model calibration and validation and for model warm up the high resolution reanalysis system cosmo rea6 was developed based on the nwp numerical weather prediction model cosmo consortium for small scale modelling bollmeyer et al 2015 the regional reanalysis system for europe matches the domain of the cordex euro 11 specifications albeit at a higher spatial resolution of 6 km it comprises the assimilation of observational data using the existing nudging scheme of cosmo complemented by snow parameters sea surface temperature sst and soil moisture cosmo rea6 uses era interim data as lateral boundary conditions it offers a retrospective high resolution analysis re analysis of climate over europe in this study daily deterministic reanalysis of temperature and precipitation are used for calibration and validation of the hydrological model the data are also used for calculating the system states of the hydrological model at the beginning of the seasonal forecast simulation the data cover the period 1995 2015 3 1 2 assimilation data to run a climate model several steps are needed before starting any forecast a process called data assimilation is carried out in this process the model is combined with observational based data resulting in the starting conditions for the meteorological forecast data assimilation is typically a sequential time stepping procedure in which the previous model forecast is compared with newly received observations the seasonal climate forecast produced at dwd by german climate forecast system gcfs2 0 baehr et al 2014 uses data assimilation processes to estimate initial conditions of the atmosphere land ocean and cryosphere the temperature and precipitation assimilation data used by the gcfs2 0 to generate the seasonal forecast is provided for our study the horizontal resolution is approximately 100 km these assimilation datasets in the same way as the reanalysis datasets cosmo rea6 were used for model initialization initial hydrological states 3 1 3 seasonal forecast data the seasonal climate data provided by the gcfs2 0 are used to generate the seasonal discharge forecast the technical aspects of this climate model are well explained by fröhlich et al 2021 the climate model is also used to produce a multitude of retrospective historical forecasts hindcasts generally the seasonal forecasts are computed with slightly varying initial conditions to generate an ensemble of forecasts the forecast ensemble enables to capture the uncertainties in the forecasts caused by the non linear behavior of the climate system the seasonal climate forecasts have a coarse spatial resolution of around 100 km before the seasonal forecasts are provided for our study these data need to be made suitable regarding the spatial resolution for our catchment for achieving this the colleagues from dwd downscaled the model output from the coarse spatial resolution provided by the model 100 km to a higher spatial resolution 6 km using a statistical dynamical downscaling method called episodes kreienkamp et al 2019 for each year 4 forecasts are provided one for each season with the following initialization months february spring seasonal forecast may summer seasonal forecast august autumn seasonal forecast and november winter seasonal forecast these historical forecasts hindcasts consist of daily ensemble datasets 30 ensemble members for years before year 2018 and 50 ensemble members afterwards of temperature and precipitation for 6 months ahead in this study 60 historical forecasts hindcast dates for the period 2001 2015 are used in order to get an ex post estimation of the total performance of our operational system of discharge forecast in the danube upstream of vienna 3 2 hydrological datasets 3 2 1 discharge data long term daily time series of river discharge are available from the website ehyd http ehyd gv at of the central hydrographical office of austria hydrographisches zentralbüro hzb and from the bavarian state office for environment http www gkd bayern de in total data from 55 gauging station were used for calibration and validation of the hydrological model additionally they are used for validating the seasonal discharge hindcast the long term mean of monthly observed discharge is used as the hydroclimatic discharge and is considered as the main reference for applying a post processing correction to the raw seasonal discharge forecasts i e bias correction 4 methodology the hydrological model cosero is briefly described in section 4 1 in section 4 2 an overview of the operational seasonal discharge forecast system based on the hydrological model as the main tool is given section 4 3 describes how tercile probability forecasts are built and finally section 4 4 make a short introduction to different metrics and strategies for assessing the performance of the forecasting system 4 1 hydrological model this study uses the hydrological model cosero continuous semidistributed runoff model eder et al 2005 herrnegger et al 2018 2015 2012 kling et al 2015a kling and nachtnebel 2009 nachtnebel et al 1993 wesemann et al 2018 the concept of this model is similar to the well known hbv model bergström 1995 the required inputs are timeseries of precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration for this study potential evapotranspiration is calculated according to the thornthwaite method thornthwaite and mather 1957 which uses daily air temperature data internally cosero accounts for different hydrological processes including snow accumulation and melt frey and holzmann 2015 glacier melt hock 1999 nachtnebel et al 2009 interception storage soil water storage evapotranspiration percolation and surface and sub surface runoff formation the model determines rainfall and snowfall from precipitation and temperature data snowmelt is simulated with a modified temperature index approach actual evapotranspiration is a function of potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture further components of actual evapotranspiration are interception losses and sublimation from snow runoff generation due to rainfall and snow and glacier melt water is a non linear function of soil moisture the generated runoff is split into three components representing surface flow interflow and baseflow by means of linear reservoir a detailed description of the model including some previous application and model equations can be found in kling et al 2015a for the current study the cosero model is applied with a semi distributed spatial discretization with hydrological response units hrus kling et al 2006 nachtnebel et al 1993 the hrus are delineated considering elevation bands dufourmont et al 2014 land use cole et al 2018 soil texture fao unesco 1970 1980 and boundaries of 65 subbasins the spatial resolution of these layers are 25 m 100 m and 100 m respectively subbasins defined by the drainage areas of the corresponding discharge gauge network the mean size of the defined subbasins is 1561 57 km² in total 3377 hrus were obtained were the minimum mean and maximum area of the hrus is 5 03 km² 30 06 km² 482 63 km² respectively a temporal resolution of 24 h is issued for the simulations and is consistent with the temporal resolution of the meteorological input data for the outlet of each subbasin the model computes a simulated discharge where the hrus are the basic spatial modelling units each hru has a set of parameters receives an input and simulates an output within the subbasins the outflow of the hrus is routed to the basin outlet and accumulates to the total subbasin runoff this subbasin runoff is then routed downstream once the model is set up a calibration and validation of the model parameters is necessary the period 2002 2011 is used for parameter calibration with the first year as spin up while the period 2012 2015 is used for validation of the model performance as start point for the parameter calibration a default parameter set was defined based on values from previous cosero applications e g kling et al 2006 schulz et al 2016 stanzel et al 2008 wesemann et al 2018 most of the default parameter fields are spatially distributed and are based on the characteristics of the 3377 hru modeling zones in order to optimize these parameters a numerical parameter optimization was performed using dds method dynamically dimensioned search see tolson and shoemaker 2007 each initial parameter field was adjusted uniformly with one multiplicative factor for the whole catchment this allows us to maintain the original spatial pattern of the parameter values following the approach carried out by burgholzer 2017 and wesemann et al 2018 a multi objective approach was applied in order to identify an appropriate parameter set in the optimization procedure the multi criteria approach used a combination of i the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 with a weight of 70 ii the logarithm of the nash sutcliffe efficiency with a weight of 10 in order to consider low flow regimes and iii the peak difference coefficient wesemann et al 2018 with a weight of 20 in order to consider high flow events 4 2 seasonal forecast system in this study discharge predictions are generated by forcing the calibrated hydrological model cosero with downscaled seasonal climate hindcasts see section 3 1 3 the hindcast dataset consists of an ensemble of 30 members providing daily temperature and precipitation with a lead time of 6 months forecasts are calculated starting with december march june and september the general procedure is schematically shown in fig 3 firstly the initial hydrological state of the catchment is determined by forcing the same model by recent historical meteorological data for a warm up period of two years two different meteorological datasets are used here to estimate the initial state conditions to gain consistency to the operational mode of the forecast application the assimilation dataset is used as input despite to its coarse resolution additionally more suitable for the finer spatially resolved hydrological model the cosmo rea6 reanalysis dataset is also used for model initializations however its application is limited to 2 3 years before the current seasonal forecasts were generated this limitation does not allow to use cosmo rea6 for model warm up when simulating the current seasonal forecasts they can however be used for the model warm up in the hindcast period this allows to quantify the loss or differences in the skill in the seasonal forecast system depending on the two different meteorological datasets used for model warm up once the initial hydrological state of the catchment is available the hydrological model is forced with the downscaled daily temperature and precipitation forecasts for the corresponding season the data is then aggregated for analysis resulting in an estimation of the seasonal discharge forecast for each of the subbasins in the study area the comparison of simulated and observed discharge distribution mostly showed an over estimation in the forecasts in most of the subbasins in the hindcast period this fact suggested to perform a bias correction over the forecasts to adjust for systematic biases and to match with the historical discharge observations for doing that the linear scaling method was applied which consists in implementing a constant correction factor that is estimated considering the ratio between the mean monthly observed discharge and the monthly forecasted discharge thereby using the ensemble mean this procedure was repeated for each subbasin within the catchment the factors are estimated over the hindcast period 2001 2015 and then applied as a multiplicative factor to correct the raw monthly ensemble discharge forecasts this obtained bias corrected seasonal discharge forecast forms the final product of our seasonal forecast system 4 3 tercile forecast probability there are different ways to present a probability forecast stemming from ensemble modelling for example anomaly charts and percentile or shaded charts see fig 4 a are very common in climatological long term predictions both are easy to interpret giving a first clear intuition of the direction of the forecasts compared to the historical values however another option for displaying the results is the tercile forecast chart see fig 4 this format has the capacity to compact the probability forecasts into three categories taking into account the direction of the ensemble members compared to the distribution of the historical forecasts to compute the lower and upper tercile percentile 33 and 66 respectively for each month each ensemble realization is considered as an individual forecast over the whole historical period in this way a historical forecast distribution is available for each month and the mentioned percentiles of the distribution can be calculated the lower and upper tercile act as a threshold to classify each forecast in one of the three defined categories above normal wet near normal and below normal dry for example fig 4b shows that in spring 2012 the forecast showed a higher probability to be wet than dry or normal with 50 of the ensembles for the months of march april and may indicating a value of discharge over the upper tercile at the same time the probability of having a dry spring season is very low since only 11 of the ensemble members show this direction 4 4 performance statistics 4 4 1 calibration and validation of the hydrological model the hydrological model performance is evaluated by comparing observed and simulated daily discharge two different metrics are calculated for both the calibration and the validation periods namely the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the relative error re the nse is used to evaluate the ability of the hydrological model to capture daily discharge dynamics it was calculated using eq 1 1 n s e 1 t 1 t t q s i m t q o b s t 2 t 1 t t q o b s t q o b s 2 the relative error re is used to assess the long term water balance and follows 2 r e q s i m q o b s q o b s where q o b s and q s i m are the observed and simulated discharges respectively q o b s and q s i m represent the mean values of the observed and simulated discharges over the respective time periods and t is the length of the time series since we are interested in seasonal forecast the two above mentioned performance metrics are further evaluated for each season 4 4 2 seasonal forecast verification four metrics are used in this study to assess the overall performance of the forecasts three of them are directly related to the skill of the forecast and are calculated considering the three categories provided by the tercile forecast described above and the fourth is related to analyse the spread of the ensemble one of the more popular metric used is called heidke skill score hss heidke 1926 o lenic et al 2008 the hss is based on the heidke hit proportion which is the proportion of forecast cases in which the forecast category assigned the highest probability is later observed 3 h s s h i t s e x p e c t e d h i t s t o t a l f o r e c a s t s e x p e c t e d h i t s with the number of expected hits given by 4 e x p e c t e d h i t s t o t a l f o r e c a s t s n u m b e r o f c a t e g o r i e s the range of the hss is to 1 any score 0 means the forecast was better than a random guess however the hss ignores probabilities since it just considers the category with the highest forecast probability while seasonal discharge forecasts show different probabilities for each category dry near normal and wet therefore an additional metric is used not just taking into account the hits but also the forecast probabilities that accompany each seasonal forecast for that we used the metric ranked probability skill score rpss bradley and schwartz 2011 the rpss measures cumulative squared error between categorical forecast probabilities and the observed categorical probabilities r p s f o r e c a s t relative to a reference forecast r p s r e f e r e n c e 5 r p s s 1 r p s f o r e c a s t r p s r e f e r e n c e the rps measures the cumulative squared errors or residuals between categorical forecasts probabilities and the observed categorical probabilities relative to a reference forecast 6 r p s c a t 1 n c a t p c u m f c a t p c u m o c a t 2 where ncat 3 for tercile forecasts dry near normal and wet the cum implies that the summation is done first for cat 1 then cat 1 and cat 2 then cat 1 2 and 3 the higher the rps the poorer the forecast rps 0 means that the probability given to the category that was observed was 100 a rpss less than 0 would mean the forecast is worse than the reference forecast the rpss is a simple metric to evaluate probabilistic outlooks however having the disadvantage to lose information useful for forecasters users for instance the rpss does not actually tell you how accurate forecasts probabilities are to compensate for this lack of information we therefore use the reliability diagram peng et al 2012 the reliability diagram compares the forecasted probabilities x axis to what actually happened over the hindcast period y axis ideally a perfect forecast would fall along a diagonal line where the x axis and y axis values are the same lastly for probabilistic ensemble based forecasts it is necessary to evaluate how well the ensemble spread represents uncertainty of the predictions the properties of the ensemble spread are evaluated using rank histogram diagrams the rank histogram is based on the n ensemble members in our case 30 members for the hindcast period and the observation ranked from lowest to highest at each time step this leads to n 1 possible bins that the observation could fall into a large number of forecasts and observations is necessary to obtain a representative rank histogram of the forecast system since the height of each bin represent the number of observations that fell in that position for the whole period assessed 5 results 5 1 calibration and validation results the hydrological model was calibrated and validated by comparing the daily simulated and observed discharge for each gauged subbasin in the catchment fig 5 exemplarily shows the simulated and observed hydrographs obtained for the calibration and validation period for subbasin 23 gauge wasserburg and subbasin 65 gauge korneuburg just by visual comparison between simulated and observed hydrograph it is possible to get a first idea about the performance of the hydrological model in these subbasins to evaluate the model performance the nse and re statistic criteria described in section 4 3 were computed for both calibration 2002 2011 and validation 2012 2015 periods the spatial patterns of the performances of the subbasins are shown in fig 6 a and b the nse for the calibration period ranges between 0 5 and 0 8 for most of the subbasins and of 0 71 and 0 67 for the above mentioned subasins 23 and 65 repectively while the nse for the validation period shows more variability between subbasins but also with several of them exceeding 0 5 as is the case of subbasin 23 and 65 with a nse of 0 6 and 0 58 respectively the median nse for the calibration and validation period is 0 66 and 0 56 respectively the lower nse values for the validation period compared to the calibration are a direct consequence of the hydro climatic variability of the four years that make up the validation period in these four years there were two exceptional extreme years 2013 showed an exceptionally rainy spring and 2014 is characterized for being one of the years with low precipitation sums and warmer temperatures in the whole catchment therefore having a big impact on soil moisture content and snow melt and snow accumulation processes the re shows values around 0 for most of the subbasins in both calibration and validation periods in particular subbasin 23 has a re of 0 036 and 0 041 while subbasin 65 has a value of 0 053 and 0 016 for calibration and validation respectively in general larger re are found in subbasins with a smaller area in the catchment one reason to explain these deficits is the difficulty to estimate the areal precipitation on small scales which is necessary in these small catchments this is especially the case since we use re analysis data as inputs a further analysis of the nse for the calibration period was done for each season this analysis is necessary since we are providing seasonal discharge forecasts and these forecasts also depend on the skill of the hydrological model for single seasons the distribution of the nse values over all analysed subbasins are summarized in table 2 and table a1 in appendix a for the calibration period the median of the nse values ranges from 0 41 in winter up to 0 65 in spring indicating that in general the model shows difficulties in simulating discharge for the winter season while spring has the highest agreement between observed and simulated discharge while for the validation period the lower nse values are achieved in spring with a median of 0 18 due to the exceptional years mentioned before 5 2 evaluation of the hindcasts the seasonal discharge forecasts are assessed for the hindcast period 2001 2015 considering the results obtained from the calibration of the hydrological model subbasins with a nse lower than 0 5 are not considered and are not included in the following assessment this nse threshold is not surpassed by a total of 8 subbasins therefore from 55 gauged subbasins the seasonal discharge forecasts are provided for a total of 47 as described in section 4 4 four different verification metrics were chosen to evaluate the overall performance of the seasonal discharge forecasting system these all single metrics separately give us too less information about the total skill of the forecasts but when combining all of them a better conclusion about the performance can be achieved to compute the different metrics we used monthly values the hss rpss and reliability diagram take into account the monthly values corresponding to months 2 3 and 4 for each season forecasted while the rank histogram takes all the monthly forecasted values i e months 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 fig 7 shows the hss computed for the seasonal forecasts for the whole hindcast period fig 7a shows the hss obtained when initializing the seasonal forecasts with the assimilation data ad while fig 7b shows the scores when using reanalysis data rd for initializing the hydrological states any score larger than 0 means that the forecast was better than a random guess higher hss values are found when initializing the forecasts with reanalysis data in this case almost all assessed subbasins shown a positive hss the highest skill for both approaches is found for the inn basin the hss was calculated also by season and the results listed in table 3 the gained hss of the contributing subbasins is spatially averaged for all subbasins upstream of korneuburg and also for the upstream subbasins within the inn basin above wasserburg autumn shows lower hss scores while spring and summer reach the highest ones in general the hss values are higher for all seasons when initializing with reanalysis data another verification metric used in this study is the ranked probability skill score rpss rpss considers the forecast probabilities for each category dry near normal or wet the procedure followed to assess this score is the same as we did for the hss the maps are created by averaging rpss over the time for each subbasin see fig 8 in this case the rpss lies under zero for most of the subbasins meaning that using the mean hydro climatology would be in many cases more appropriate than the provided seasonal forecast only when initializing the seasonal forecasts with reanalysis data we obtained a positive score in some subbasins the positive rpss values are located in some alpine subbasins table 3 shows the rpss values for different seasons it is visible that the inn a strongly alpine dominated tributary shows positive values this fact indicates that for this subbasins the seasonal forecast improves the random guess estimation when displaying the forecasts as three probability categories the rpss is a simple way to assess probabilistic outlooks but it does not give information about how accurate the probabilities are for answering this question three reliability diagrams are shown in fig 9 one for each forecasted category dry near normal and wet at each forecasted time the tercile forecast provide a probability to each category this probability ranges from 0 to 100 and the sum of the probabilities of the three categories should be 100 for each time step to assess each of the categories separately we used the reliability diagram tool for example to create the reliability diagram for the dry category we take in account all forecast probabilities assigned to this category at each time step within the hindcast period therefore as we have 15 years with 12 forecasts per year 3 forecasted monthly values each season for 47 subbasins a total of 7740 probability forecasts are considered these 7740 probabilities are classified into 11 equally separated classes ranging from 0 to 1 0 100 the number of forecasts falling in each category gives an idea about the forecast distribution on the other hand we need to build the observed frequency to do that for each forecast probability class we counted how many times the observation occurred in other words if we have 100 probability forecasts falling in the class 0 1 we expect that only for 10 of the cases the observation to fall in the dry category in the same way if we have 100 probability forecasts falling in class 0 6 we expect that 60 of the observation to fall in the dry category hence a perfectly reliable forecast would fall along a diagonal line where x axis and y axis values are exactly the same the procedure explained here for the dry category was followed as well for near normal and wet categories fig 9 summarizes some properties of the forecasts first we see that most of the forecasts fall between probabilities of 20 and 40 secondly we observe that forecast probabilities under 40 have no resolution as the observed frequency is always close to the hydro climatological mean 33 and third for higher forecast probabilities some reliability is achieved in the dry category in contrast for the wet category and even clearer for the near normal category no reliability is reached in general the wet category shows no resolution for forecast probabilities under 80 while the normal category has no resolution over the whole range of forecast probabilities finally fig 10 shows the rank histograms computed for each season they allow to have a better idea about the quality of the ensembles in capturing the forecast uncertainties the rank histogram is generated for each season considering the 15 forecast dates years within each forecast date 6 forecasted months are considered hence when using all assessed subbasins a total of 3870 forecasted months are available to build the histogram for one single season in many cases and in all seasons the observation lies outside the lower boundary of the ensemble rank one in the histograms more specifically 19 77 of the cases in winter 14 97 of the cases in spring 12 86 of the cases in summer and 16 31 of the cases in autumn are not captured by the ensemble spread also some observations approx 10 for spring winter and autumn and 5 for summer lie above the maximum value of the ensemble in conclusion depending on the season the observed value lay outside the ensemble spread between 20 and 30 of the cases these results suggest that the ensemble spread is in general to narrow to capture the uncertainties 6 discussion a calibrated hydrological model cosero acts as a fundamental component in the seasonal discharge forecasting system presented in this paper the performance of the forecasts will rely on the quality of the hydrological model in general the cosero model is a well known widely used hydrological model which was already used in several studies with successful applications in hydrological studies and operational short term runoff forecasting wesemann et al 2018 due to the characteristics of the catchment it was attempted to integrate into the model the reservoirs and dams but since not sufficient data on operational rules was available they were not considered three important factors stemming from storage hydropower plants hpp influence the hydrology of the catchment first annual storages in the alps lead to transfer or shift of water from one year to another second short term energy production leads to hydropeaking in the rivers below storage hydropower plants and third pumped storage power plants additionally influence downstream flows run of the river power plants do not have noteworthy storage capacities and the inflow corresponds to the outflow and thus do not affect the runoff water balance possible impacts on flow velocities and flood propagation times are implicitly considered in the model calibration procedure storage hydropower plants effect the downstream runoff by intermittently driven storage and release operation longer term shifts in the water balance are also implicitly considered in the model calibration procedure the storage hydropower plants are located in the headwater areas which showed comparatively higher nse values in the calibration validation this shows that despite not directly considering storage and release rules the model partially intrinsically considered the power plants the current study tested the applicability for seasonal forecasting which could potentially widen the benefit for operational applications the forecast system integrates two main working steps in order to provide an ensemble of seasonal discharge forecasts the first step consists in calculating the initial hydrological states of the catchment providing the basis for the seasonal forecast two different meteorological data sets are used to run the calibrated hydrological model which allow to understand better the impact of spatial resolution when computing the initial state ad assimilation data 100 km vs rd reanalysis data 6 km once the hydrological initial states are updated in the model the calibrated hydrological model is run with daily ensemble seasonal forecasts the final output of the model at each time step is an ensemble of 30 50 members considered equally likely of discharge the forecasts are provided up to 6 months ahead the daily discharge forecasts are aggregated to mean monthly discharge and a bias correction was performed applying the linear scaling method in a next step more sophisticated bias correction methods e g quantile mapping and their impact on the seasonal forecasting system should be analysed the ensemble discharge members were splitted into three pre defined categories namely dry near normal and wet resulting in a tercile forecast in our opinion tercile forecast charts can help end users decision makers or stakeholders among others to gain relevant information about the seasonal forecast the seasonal discharge forecasting system is analysed using the available meteorological hindcast data instead of computing the current seasonal forecasts we look at the past seasonal forecasts to check the outcomes with the historical observations this step is necessary in order to assign a value to the above mentioned forecast system many verification metrics are available in literature and only some of them were used in this paper to give different points of view about the overall performance of the seasonal forecast system this analysis allows the user to consider by himself if he could get some benefit of this forecasts compared to other existing products or strategies skill scores give condensed information since they compare the generated forecasts against a reference forecasts e g a forecast based on a random guess in our case as we have three categories each category has a 33 of probabilities to occur by random chance two interesting verification skill scores are evaluated in this paper the heidke skill score hss and the ranked probability skill score rpss in general the hss showed that there is an improvement when using the seasonal forecasting system compared to the random guess however the assessment for the rpss showed the opposite direction i e that most of the assessed subbasins and seasons has a negative rpss meaning that the provided seasonal discharge forecast does not improve the hydro climatological random guess this fact shows the importance of evaluating different verification metrics in this case hss considers that the category forecasted with the highest probability is deterministic i e it has 100 chances to occur while the other two categories have 0 therefore when ignoring probabilities we could get some benefit from the forecasts compared to the random guess conversely rpss takes in account the percentage assigned to each category and this fact penalized the forecast skill only some subbasins especially when initializing the seasonal forecast system with reanalysis data showed positive rpss in these located areas both hss and rpss are larger than zero hence the use of seasonal discharge forecast in these regions could bring some benefit in other water activities directly related to discharge e g hydropower production finally the reliability diagrams also showed that when considering only forecasts pointing to a dry season some benefit could be achieved when such forecasts overpass a probability of 50 this is again even more clear when verifying the seasonal forecast system initialized with the reanalysis data but we need to be careful because it is possible that this better skill when forecasting dry season could be partly due to the known tendency to have more dry years and seasons in the future as consequence of climate change the threshold defined by the selected percentage of ensemble forecasts that point to one particular category dry normal or wet influences the reliability assessment of the seasonal forecasts in general the higher the percentage of ensemble forecasts that fall into one category the better the skill however the cases where forecasts showed a clear direction e g over 60 are very few different interpretations about the skill of the seasonal discharge forecasting system are present just based on the fact of using different verification metrics however there was a clear fact observed when comparing how the system behaves whether it is initialized with assimilation data or reanalysis data for all metrics in almost all the analysed circumstances the seasonal discharge forecasting system performed better with the finer meteorological data i e initializing with reanalysis data therefore it is a challenge on one side to reduce the spatial resolution of the meteorological variables as much as possible and on the other side to make it available up to date in order to be able to use it for providing the current seasonal discharge forecasts lastly the results obtained from the rank histogram suggested that the ensemble spread provided by the seasonal discharge forecasting system is too narrow and therefore the forecasts have huge difficulties in capturing the real uncertainty as mentioned before one possible solution would be to apply different methodologies to correct the bias and analyse its impact over the variability of the ensembles 7 summary and conclusions the hydrological model cosero set up for the upper danube basin upstream of vienna with 65 subbasins is calibrated and validated using the 55 gauged subbasins the model shows a good performance for most of the subbasins according to that 47 of them are considered in further steps then the cosero is driven by ensembles of seasonal meteorological forecasts generating the ensembles of seasonal discharge forecasts finally a multiplicative scale factor bias correction is applied to these forecasts the skill of the discharge forecasts is evaluated with the hindcasts seasonal forecasts for the period 2001 2015 in general the seasonal forecasts show low skill exception are some alpine basins middle high elevated subbasins located at inn salzach and enns sub catchments also a general better performance is found for dry conditions especially when many ensemble members show this tendency nevertheless skill also depends on which metric is used we also tested ad assimilation data and rd reanalysis data for model initialization when using rd the seasonal discharge forecasts clearly show higher skill therefore in operational mode up to date reanalysis data for model initialization is necessary in order to get the maximum benefit from the current seasonal discharge forecasting system further steps to improve the performance of the seasonal forecast system could go in the direction of using more sophisticated bias correction methods e g by using quantile mapping and with the inclusion of hydropower reservoir and operational rules into the hydrological model different options to do this e g following koch et al 2011 or to adopt regional bias

using a dynamical approach running the hydrological model cosero with forecasted climate inputs provided by germany s national meteorological service deutscher wetterdienst dwd the seasonal climate

aggregation of these daily values to monthly and seasonal values new hydrological insights for the region downscaled historical forecasts hindcasts and historical discharge observations over the last 15 years are used to assess the skill of the seasonal forecast in several alpine basins in general the results show a limited skill therefore the seasonal discharge forecasting system in this region is still not sufficient to incorporate the results into water resources decision support systems keywords seasonal forecasts hydrological model reanalysis data data assimilation discharge bias correction 1 introduction during the last decade remarkable advances in climate research such as the development of coupled atmosphere ocean land general circulation models increases in spatial resolution or the implementation of improved model physics doblas reyes et al 2005 saha et al 2006 wanders and wood 2016 yuan et al 2015 were achieved consequently these findings could be integrated into hydrological applications where long range climate forecasts providing information about future atmospheric conditions averaged over periods of one to three months are then used for generating hydrological forecasts from monthly to seasonal time scales a reliable forecast at these forecast horizons can be beneficial for incorporating them into decision support systems e g river navigation power plant operation or drought risk management many of these studies crochemore et al 2017 hamlet et al 2002 meißner et al 2017 schepen et al 2016a turner et al 2017 yuan et al 2013 have been performed within the framework of climate services climate services aim to connect climate data with other fields and models e g hydrological models renewable energy sources power simulations tools energy systems and electricity models in the frame of an european project clim2power 2020 the authors were involved in the development of such kind of climate service with the focus on the forecast of seasonal energy production of renewable resources the following research questions were addressed i test of the reliability of the hydrological forecast model results ii potential estimation of the economic benefit of energy production forecasts and iii the comparison of hydrological modelling results with alternative machine learning techniques this paper summarizes the findings of research question i the hydrological forecasting performance based on the case study area of the danube basin upstream of vienna austria the research questions ii and iii could be a motivation for further studies the danube river basin is europe s second largest river basin with a total drainage area of 801 463 km2 more than 80 million people from 19 countries share the danube catchment area making it the world s most international river basin the economic value of the danube river is immense it is a vital resource for water supply sustaining biodiversity agriculture industry fishing recreation tourism power generation and navigation icpdr 2020 the upper danube basin representing the headwater domain of the entire basin is characterized by complex topography dominated by the alps with numerous rivers steep sloped drainage systems and high precipitation sums although the share of the alpine space in relation to the overall catchment is only around 10 for the danube the alps contribute 26 to the total discharge wesemann et al 2018 large gradients in combination with high runoff volumes provide an ideal setting for hydropower production the hydropower sector therefore also plays an important role for electricity production whereas the contribution to the overall electrical energy production is about 55 65 in single countries like austria or switzerland batzing 1999 wesemann et al 2018 hydrological forecasting models can provide valuable and objective information for the planning of the energy production but also reservoir management short term hydrological forecasting models with typical lead times of 48 h to 14 days into the future are already frequently used with the aim of hydropower production optimisation e g hamlet et al 2002 schulz et al 2016 stanzel et al 2008 wesemann et al 2018 a reliable seasonal discharge forecasting system e g with a lead time up to 3 6 months could bring an important improvement in the long term optimization of the energy production since the hydropower reservoir management heavily depends on the expected seasonal hydrological characteristics e g the snow pack development secondly the knowledge of future seasonal energy production and demands form a valuable assets in the dispatching strategies at the european energy stock market this exemplifies the potential benefits of seasonal hydrological forecasts in the field of hydropower production information on the expected status of water resources generated by a seasonal forecasting system would benefit many different areas including river navigation thermal power plant operation or drought risk management in the last years all over the world several seasonal discharge forecast systems have been developed for different purposes schepen et al 2016b yuan et al 2013 following arnal et al 2018 the most important advances related to seasonal discharge forecast in the last century are briefly cited below already at the beginning of the last century the first seasonal discharge forecasting method was developed in united states the expected summer discharge was thereby estimated by the status of the snowpack in winter and spring which was used as initial conditions in the estimations church 1935 over the years acquired understanding of streamflow generation processes and developments in the computational and simulation sector enabled the use of more sophisticated techniques for developing seasonal forecasting systems the most relevant developments were on one side the creation of the first hydrological models and on the other side the recording of longer observed meteorological series the first operational model based seasonal streamflow forecasting system was developed by the united states national weather system nws in the 1970s day 1985 twedt et al 1977 this forecast system was named extended streamflow prediction or ensemble streamflow prediction esp depending on the literature reviewed day 1985 wood et al 2002 the esp forecasts were generated by means of a hydrological model driven by resampled observed meteorology of the past where the current initial hydrologic conditions ihc were updated with near real time observed meteorological time series in basins where meteorological forcings dominate the predictability of the downstream hydrology the lack of information on the future climate is a significant limitation of the esp the better scientific understanding of ocean atmosphere land interactions allowed the identification of large scale climate patterns which are important in the predictability of different meteorological and hydrological events goddard et al 2001 troccoli 2010 this fact together with the increase in computing resources allowed to perform global scale dynamically coupled circulation models at high temporal and spatial resolution doblas reyes et al 2013 nevertheless the spatial resolution of seasonal forecasts is coarse compared to the finer resolution of hydrological models established for predictions on a more regional scale in consequence different downscaling algorithms were developed over the last years benestad 2004 fowler et al 2007 von storch et al 1993 one of the most recent downscaling algorithms was implemented to generate the climate data provided in this study kreienkamp et al 2019 several discharge forecasting systems have been developed in europe e g for the united kingdom bell et al 2017 prudhomme et al 2017 france ćeron et al 2010 crochemore et al 2016 singla et al 2011 or central europe demirel et al 2015 meißner et al 2017 on the european level the european flood awareness system efas is one of the most relevant services providing an operational pan european hydrological forecasting system smith et al 2016 in other parts of the world there has been relatively more seasonal discharge forecasting systems analyzed in part due to the reason that other areas around the world have a better seasonal predictability compared to europe that is the case of australia united states and africa bennett et al 2017 hansen et al 2011 mendoza et al 2017 the aim of this study is to analyze the state and skill of current seasonal discharge forecasts for the upper danube basin upstream of vienna and to better understand the limitations of seasonal discharge forecasting systems in central europe the estimation of the initial states of the catchment e g soil moisture levels snow cover or snow water equivalent distribution play a significant role especially in alpine areas where discharge exhibits a pronounced seasonality due to snow accumulation and snow melt processes errors in the estimation of the initial conditions could lead to a lower quality of the seasonal discharge forecasts therefore two different datasets for the calculation of the initial conditions of the hydrological model are assessed apart from the initial conditions the skill of the seasonal climate forecast used to force the hydrological model also have a relevant control over the skill of the seasonal discharge forecasts the better the seasonal climate forecast is the higher are the chances to get a successful seasonal discharge forecast the current paper describes the development of the seasonal discharge forecasting system for the upper danube basin section 2 paying attention to the available meteorological data section 3 and to the role of the hydrological model section 4 and to evaluate the seasonal discharge forecasting system section 5 the evaluations and analysis consider the whole danube basin upstream of vienna as well one smaller sub catchment within the inn sub basin finally section 6 summarizes the different findings and conclusions 2 study area the study area consists of the danube basin upstream of vienna covering an area of 101 810 km² see fig 1 the danube in vienna has a mean annual discharge of 1923 m³ s for the period 1961 1990 the southern part of the basin is dominated by the alps in the northern low land valleys expand over large areas the main tributaries at least regarding the runoff contribution to the danube are located in the alpine areas from west to east the main southern tributaries are the rivers lech isar inn salzach traun and enns the largest tributary by runoff volume is the inn which has a larger mean annual discharge compared to the danube at the confluence in the northern part of the basin the naab tributary coming from bavarian forest has some relevance the hydrological regime is driven by the alps which is characterized by low winter temperatures snow accumulation and melt processes several hydropower dams and reservoirs exist which influence the runoff regime the inn subcatchment upstream of wasserburg with an area of 12 209 km² fig 1 is considered in this study as an example of alpine dominated catchment in central europe 3 meteorological and hydrological datasets different meteorological datasets provided by the germany s national meteorological services the deutscher wetterdienst dwd are used temperature and precipitation are needed to drive the hydrological model for simulating discharge generally meteorological data are needed for i model parameter calibration and validation ii calculating the initial system states for the forecast model warm up and iii calculating seasonal forecast the characteristics of each meteorological dataset together with its role in this study are explained in the following section table 1 offers an overview of the meteorological datasets used in this study also fig 2 shows examples of the mean temperature and precipitation conditions for the spring season of the years 2001 2015 for the different meteorological dataset used the influence of the spatial resolution on the spatial patterns of the meteorological parameters is clearly reflected in the precipitation charts additionally river discharge time series at each gauging station located in the catchment are needed generally data in a daily resolution are used 3 1 meteorological datasets 3 1 1 reanalysis data reanalysis data in our case cosmo rea6 with a spatial resolution of 0 055 6 km is used for model calibration and validation and for model warm up the high resolution reanalysis system cosmo rea6 was developed based on the nwp numerical weather prediction model cosmo consortium for small scale modelling bollmeyer et al 2015 the regional reanalysis system for europe matches the domain of the cordex euro 11 specifications albeit at a higher spatial resolution of 6 km it comprises the assimilation of observational data using the existing nudging scheme of cosmo complemented by snow parameters sea surface temperature sst and soil moisture cosmo rea6 uses era interim data as lateral boundary conditions it offers a retrospective high resolution analysis re analysis of climate over europe in this study daily deterministic reanalysis of temperature and precipitation are used for calibration and validation of the hydrological model the data are also used for calculating the system states of the hydrological model at the beginning of the seasonal forecast simulation the data cover the period 1995 2015 3 1 2 assimilation data to run a climate model several steps are needed before starting any forecast a process called data assimilation is carried out in this process the model is combined with observational based data resulting in the starting conditions for the meteorological forecast data assimilation is typically a sequential time stepping procedure in which the previous model forecast is compared with newly received observations the seasonal climate forecast produced at dwd by german climate forecast system gcfs2 0 baehr et al 2014 uses data assimilation processes to estimate initial conditions of the atmosphere land ocean and cryosphere the temperature and precipitation assimilation data used by the gcfs2 0 to generate the seasonal forecast is provided for our study the horizontal resolution is approximately 100 km these assimilation datasets in the same way as the reanalysis datasets cosmo rea6 were used for model initialization initial hydrological states 3 1 3 seasonal forecast data the seasonal climate data provided by the gcfs2 0 are used to generate the seasonal discharge forecast the technical aspects of this climate model are well explained by fröhlich et al 2021 the climate model is also used to produce a multitude of retrospective historical forecasts hindcasts generally the seasonal forecasts are computed with slightly varying initial conditions to generate an ensemble of forecasts the forecast ensemble enables to capture the uncertainties in the forecasts caused by the non linear behavior of the climate system the seasonal climate forecasts have a coarse spatial resolution of around 100 km before the seasonal forecasts are provided for our study these data need to be made suitable regarding the spatial resolution for our catchment for achieving this the colleagues from dwd downscaled the model output from the coarse spatial resolution provided by the model 100 km to a higher spatial resolution 6 km using a statistical dynamical downscaling method called episodes kreienkamp et al 2019 for each year 4 forecasts are provided one for each season with the following initialization months february spring seasonal forecast may summer seasonal forecast august autumn seasonal forecast and november winter seasonal forecast these historical forecasts hindcasts consist of daily ensemble datasets 30 ensemble members for years before year 2018 and 50 ensemble members afterwards of temperature and precipitation for 6 months ahead in this study 60 historical forecasts hindcast dates for the period 2001 2015 are used in order to get an ex post estimation of the total performance of our operational system of discharge forecast in the danube upstream of vienna 3 2 hydrological datasets 3 2 1 discharge data long term daily time series of river discharge are available from the website ehyd http ehyd gv at of the central hydrographical office of austria hydrographisches zentralbüro hzb and from the bavarian state office for environment http www gkd bayern de in total data from 55 gauging station were used for calibration and validation of the hydrological model additionally they are used for validating the seasonal discharge hindcast the long term mean of monthly observed discharge is used as the hydroclimatic discharge and is considered as the main reference for applying a post processing correction to the raw seasonal discharge forecasts i e bias correction 4 methodology the hydrological model cosero is briefly described in section 4 1 in section 4 2 an overview of the operational seasonal discharge forecast system based on the hydrological model as the main tool is given section 4 3 describes how tercile probability forecasts are built and finally section 4 4 make a short introduction to different metrics and strategies for assessing the performance of the forecasting system 4 1 hydrological model this study uses the hydrological model cosero continuous semidistributed runoff model eder et al 2005 herrnegger et al 2018 2015 2012 kling et al 2015a kling and nachtnebel 2009 nachtnebel et al 1993 wesemann et al 2018 the concept of this model is similar to the well known hbv model bergström 1995 the required inputs are timeseries of precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration for this study potential evapotranspiration is calculated according to the thornthwaite method thornthwaite and mather 1957 which uses daily air temperature data internally cosero accounts for different hydrological processes including snow accumulation and melt frey and holzmann 2015 glacier melt hock 1999 nachtnebel et al 2009 interception storage soil water storage evapotranspiration percolation and surface and sub surface runoff formation the model determines rainfall and snowfall from precipitation and temperature data snowmelt is simulated with a modified temperature index approach actual evapotranspiration is a function of potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture further components of actual evapotranspiration are interception losses and sublimation from snow runoff generation due to rainfall and snow and glacier melt water is a non linear function of soil moisture the generated runoff is split into three components representing surface flow interflow and baseflow by means of linear reservoir a detailed description of the model including some previous application and model equations can be found in kling et al 2015a for the current study the cosero model is applied with a semi distributed spatial discretization with hydrological response units hrus kling et al 2006 nachtnebel et al 1993 the hrus are delineated considering elevation bands dufourmont et al 2014 land use cole et al 2018 soil texture fao unesco 1970 1980 and boundaries of 65 subbasins the spatial resolution of these layers are 25 m 100 m and 100 m respectively subbasins defined by the drainage areas of the corresponding discharge gauge network the mean size of the defined subbasins is 1561 57 km² in total 3377 hrus were obtained were the minimum mean and maximum area of the hrus is 5 03 km² 30 06 km² 482 63 km² respectively a temporal resolution of 24 h is issued for the simulations and is consistent with the temporal resolution of the meteorological input data for the outlet of each subbasin the model computes a simulated discharge where the hrus are the basic spatial modelling units each hru has a set of parameters receives an input and simulates an output within the subbasins the outflow of the hrus is routed to the basin outlet and accumulates to the total subbasin runoff this subbasin runoff is then routed downstream once the model is set up a calibration and validation of the model parameters is necessary the period 2002 2011 is used for parameter calibration with the first year as spin up while the period 2012 2015 is used for validation of the model performance as start point for the parameter calibration a default parameter set was defined based on values from previous cosero applications e g kling et al 2006 schulz et al 2016 stanzel et al 2008 wesemann et al 2018 most of the default parameter fields are spatially distributed and are based on the characteristics of the 3377 hru modeling zones in order to optimize these parameters a numerical parameter optimization was performed using dds method dynamically dimensioned search see tolson and shoemaker 2007 each initial parameter field was adjusted uniformly with one multiplicative factor for the whole catchment this allows us to maintain the original spatial pattern of the parameter values following the approach carried out by burgholzer 2017 and wesemann et al 2018 a multi objective approach was applied in order to identify an appropriate parameter set in the optimization procedure the multi criteria approach used a combination of i the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 with a weight of 70 ii the logarithm of the nash sutcliffe efficiency with a weight of 10 in order to consider low flow regimes and iii the peak difference coefficient wesemann et al 2018 with a weight of 20 in order to consider high flow events 4 2 seasonal forecast system in this study discharge predictions are generated by forcing the calibrated hydrological model cosero with downscaled seasonal climate hindcasts see section 3 1 3 the hindcast dataset consists of an ensemble of 30 members providing daily temperature and precipitation with a lead time of 6 months forecasts are calculated starting with december march june and september the general procedure is schematically shown in fig 3 firstly the initial hydrological state of the catchment is determined by forcing the same model by recent historical meteorological data for a warm up period of two years two different meteorological datasets are used here to estimate the initial state conditions to gain consistency to the operational mode of the forecast application the assimilation dataset is used as input despite to its coarse resolution additionally more suitable for the finer spatially resolved hydrological model the cosmo rea6 reanalysis dataset is also used for model initializations however its application is limited to 2 3 years before the current seasonal forecasts were generated this limitation does not allow to use cosmo rea6 for model warm up when simulating the current seasonal forecasts they can however be used for the model warm up in the hindcast period this allows to quantify the loss or differences in the skill in the seasonal forecast system depending on the two different meteorological datasets used for model warm up once the initial hydrological state of the catchment is available the hydrological model is forced with the downscaled daily temperature and precipitation forecasts for the corresponding season the data is then aggregated for analysis resulting in an estimation of the seasonal discharge forecast for each of the subbasins in the study area the comparison of simulated and observed discharge distribution mostly showed an over estimation in the forecasts in most of the subbasins in the hindcast period this fact suggested to perform a bias correction over the forecasts to adjust for systematic biases and to match with the historical discharge observations for doing that the linear scaling method was applied which consists in implementing a constant correction factor that is estimated considering the ratio between the mean monthly observed discharge and the monthly forecasted discharge thereby using the ensemble mean this procedure was repeated for each subbasin within the catchment the factors are estimated over the hindcast period 2001 2015 and then applied as a multiplicative factor to correct the raw monthly ensemble discharge forecasts this obtained bias corrected seasonal discharge forecast forms the final product of our seasonal forecast system 4 3 tercile forecast probability there are different ways to present a probability forecast stemming from ensemble modelling for example anomaly charts and percentile or shaded charts see fig 4 a are very common in climatological long term predictions both are easy to interpret giving a first clear intuition of the direction of the forecasts compared to the historical values however another option for displaying the results is the tercile forecast chart see fig 4 this format has the capacity to compact the probability forecasts into three categories taking into account the direction of the ensemble members compared to the distribution of the historical forecasts to compute the lower and upper tercile percentile 33 and 66 respectively for each month each ensemble realization is considered as an individual forecast over the whole historical period in this way a historical forecast distribution is available for each month and the mentioned percentiles of the distribution can be calculated the lower and upper tercile act as a threshold to classify each forecast in one of the three defined categories above normal wet near normal and below normal dry for example fig 4b shows that in spring 2012 the forecast showed a higher probability to be wet than dry or normal with 50 of the ensembles for the months of march april and may indicating a value of discharge over the upper tercile at the same time the probability of having a dry spring season is very low since only 11 of the ensemble members show this direction 4 4 performance statistics 4 4 1 calibration and validation of the hydrological model the hydrological model performance is evaluated by comparing observed and simulated daily discharge two different metrics are calculated for both the calibration and the validation periods namely the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the relative error re the nse is used to evaluate the ability of the hydrological model to capture daily discharge dynamics it was calculated using eq 1 1 n s e 1 t 1 t t q s i m t q o b s t 2 t 1 t t q o b s t q o b s 2 the relative error re is used to assess the long term water balance and follows 2 r e q s i m q o b s q o b s where q o b s and q s i m are the observed and simulated discharges respectively q o b s and q s i m represent the mean values of the observed and simulated discharges over the respective time periods and t is the length of the time series since we are interested in seasonal forecast the two above mentioned performance metrics are further evaluated for each season 4 4 2 seasonal forecast verification four metrics are used in this study to assess the overall performance of the forecasts three of them are directly related to the skill of the forecast and are calculated considering the three categories provided by the tercile forecast described above and the fourth is related to analyse the spread of the ensemble one of the more popular metric used is called heidke skill score hss heidke 1926 o lenic et al 2008 the hss is based on the heidke hit proportion which is the proportion of forecast cases in which the forecast category assigned the highest probability is later observed 3 h s s h i t s e x p e c t e d h i t s t o t a l f o r e c a s t s e x p e c t e d h i t s with the number of expected hits given by 4 e x p e c t e d h i t s t o t a l f o r e c a s t s n u m b e r o f c a t e g o r i e s the range of the hss is to 1 any score 0 means the forecast was better than a random guess however the hss ignores probabilities since it just considers the category with the highest forecast probability while seasonal discharge forecasts show different probabilities for each category dry near normal and wet therefore an additional metric is used not just taking into account the hits but also the forecast probabilities that accompany each seasonal forecast for that we used the metric ranked probability skill score rpss bradley and schwartz 2011 the rpss measures cumulative squared error between categorical forecast probabilities and the observed categorical probabilities r p s f o r e c a s t relative to a reference forecast r p s r e f e r e n c e 5 r p s s 1 r p s f o r e c a s t r p s r e f e r e n c e the rps measures the cumulative squared errors or residuals between categorical forecasts probabilities and the observed categorical probabilities relative to a reference forecast 6 r p s c a t 1 n c a t p c u m f c a t p c u m o c a t 2 where ncat 3 for tercile forecasts dry near normal and wet the cum implies that the summation is done first for cat 1 then cat 1 and cat 2 then cat 1 2 and 3 the higher the rps the poorer the forecast rps 0 means that the probability given to the category that was observed was 100 a rpss less than 0 would mean the forecast is worse than the reference forecast the rpss is a simple metric to evaluate probabilistic outlooks however having the disadvantage to lose information useful for forecasters users for instance the rpss does not actually tell you how accurate forecasts probabilities are to compensate for this lack of information we therefore use the reliability diagram peng et al 2012 the reliability diagram compares the forecasted probabilities x axis to what actually happened over the hindcast period y axis ideally a perfect forecast would fall along a diagonal line where the x axis and y axis values are the same lastly for probabilistic ensemble based forecasts it is necessary to evaluate how well the ensemble spread represents uncertainty of the predictions the properties of the ensemble spread are evaluated using rank histogram diagrams the rank histogram is based on the n ensemble members in our case 30 members for the hindcast period and the observation ranked from lowest to highest at each time step this leads to n 1 possible bins that the observation could fall into a large number of forecasts and observations is necessary to obtain a representative rank histogram of the forecast system since the height of each bin represent the number of observations that fell in that position for the whole period assessed 5 results 5 1 calibration and validation results the hydrological model was calibrated and validated by comparing the daily simulated and observed discharge for each gauged subbasin in the catchment fig 5 exemplarily shows the simulated and observed hydrographs obtained for the calibration and validation period for subbasin 23 gauge wasserburg and subbasin 65 gauge korneuburg just by visual comparison between simulated and observed hydrograph it is possible to get a first idea about the performance of the hydrological model in these subbasins to evaluate the model performance the nse and re statistic criteria described in section 4 3 were computed for both calibration 2002 2011 and validation 2012 2015 periods the spatial patterns of the performances of the subbasins are shown in fig 6 a and b the nse for the calibration period ranges between 0 5 and 0 8 for most of the subbasins and of 0 71 and 0 67 for the above mentioned subasins 23 and 65 repectively while the nse for the validation period shows more variability between subbasins but also with several of them exceeding 0 5 as is the case of subbasin 23 and 65 with a nse of 0 6 and 0 58 respectively the median nse for the calibration and validation period is 0 66 and 0 56 respectively the lower nse values for the validation period compared to the calibration are a direct consequence of the hydro climatic variability of the four years that make up the validation period in these four years there were two exceptional extreme years 2013 showed an exceptionally rainy spring and 2014 is characterized for being one of the years with low precipitation sums and warmer temperatures in the whole catchment therefore having a big impact on soil moisture content and snow melt and snow accumulation processes the re shows values around 0 for most of the subbasins in both calibration and validation periods in particular subbasin 23 has a re of 0 036 and 0 041 while subbasin 65 has a value of 0 053 and 0 016 for calibration and validation respectively in general larger re are found in subbasins with a smaller area in the catchment one reason to explain these deficits is the difficulty to estimate the areal precipitation on small scales which is necessary in these small catchments this is especially the case since we use re analysis data as inputs a further analysis of the nse for the calibration period was done for each season this analysis is necessary since we are providing seasonal discharge forecasts and these forecasts also depend on the skill of the hydrological model for single seasons the distribution of the nse values over all analysed subbasins are summarized in table 2 and table a1 in appendix a for the calibration period the median of the nse values ranges from 0 41 in winter up to 0 65 in spring indicating that in general the model shows difficulties in simulating discharge for the winter season while spring has the highest agreement between observed and simulated discharge while for the validation period the lower nse values are achieved in spring with a median of 0 18 due to the exceptional years mentioned before 5 2 evaluation of the hindcasts the seasonal discharge forecasts are assessed for the hindcast period 2001 2015 considering the results obtained from the calibration of the hydrological model subbasins with a nse lower than 0 5 are not considered and are not included in the following assessment this nse threshold is not surpassed by a total of 8 subbasins therefore from 55 gauged subbasins the seasonal discharge forecasts are provided for a total of 47 as described in section 4 4 four different verification metrics were chosen to evaluate the overall performance of the seasonal discharge forecasting system these all single metrics separately give us too less information about the total skill of the forecasts but when combining all of them a better conclusion about the performance can be achieved to compute the different metrics we used monthly values the hss rpss and reliability diagram take into account the monthly values corresponding to months 2 3 and 4 for each season forecasted while the rank histogram takes all the monthly forecasted values i e months 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 fig 7 shows the hss computed for the seasonal forecasts for the whole hindcast period fig 7a shows the hss obtained when initializing the seasonal forecasts with the assimilation data ad while fig 7b shows the scores when using reanalysis data rd for initializing the hydrological states any score larger than 0 means that the forecast was better than a random guess higher hss values are found when initializing the forecasts with reanalysis data in this case almost all assessed subbasins shown a positive hss the highest skill for both approaches is found for the inn basin the hss was calculated also by season and the results listed in table 3 the gained hss of the contributing subbasins is spatially averaged for all subbasins upstream of korneuburg and also for the upstream subbasins within the inn basin above wasserburg autumn shows lower hss scores while spring and summer reach the highest ones in general the hss values are higher for all seasons when initializing with reanalysis data another verification metric used in this study is the ranked probability skill score rpss rpss considers the forecast probabilities for each category dry near normal or wet the procedure followed to assess this score is the same as we did for the hss the maps are created by averaging rpss over the time for each subbasin see fig 8 in this case the rpss lies under zero for most of the subbasins meaning that using the mean hydro climatology would be in many cases more appropriate than the provided seasonal forecast only when initializing the seasonal forecasts with reanalysis data we obtained a positive score in some subbasins the positive rpss values are located in some alpine subbasins table 3 shows the rpss values for different seasons it is visible that the inn a strongly alpine dominated tributary shows positive values this fact indicates that for this subbasins the seasonal forecast improves the random guess estimation when displaying the forecasts as three probability categories the rpss is a simple way to assess probabilistic outlooks but it does not give information about how accurate the probabilities are for answering this question three reliability diagrams are shown in fig 9 one for each forecasted category dry near normal and wet at each forecasted time the tercile forecast provide a probability to each category this probability ranges from 0 to 100 and the sum of the probabilities of the three categories should be 100 for each time step to assess each of the categories separately we used the reliability diagram tool for example to create the reliability diagram for the dry category we take in account all forecast probabilities assigned to this category at each time step within the hindcast period therefore as we have 15 years with 12 forecasts per year 3 forecasted monthly values each season for 47 subbasins a total of 7740 probability forecasts are considered these 7740 probabilities are classified into 11 equally separated classes ranging from 0 to 1 0 100 the number of forecasts falling in each category gives an idea about the forecast distribution on the other hand we need to build the observed frequency to do that for each forecast probability class we counted how many times the observation occurred in other words if we have 100 probability forecasts falling in the class 0 1 we expect that only for 10 of the cases the observation to fall in the dry category in the same way if we have 100 probability forecasts falling in class 0 6 we expect that 60 of the observation to fall in the dry category hence a perfectly reliable forecast would fall along a diagonal line where x axis and y axis values are exactly the same the procedure explained here for the dry category was followed as well for near normal and wet categories fig 9 summarizes some properties of the forecasts first we see that most of the forecasts fall between probabilities of 20 and 40 secondly we observe that forecast probabilities under 40 have no resolution as the observed frequency is always close to the hydro climatological mean 33 and third for higher forecast probabilities some reliability is achieved in the dry category in contrast for the wet category and even clearer for the near normal category no reliability is reached in general the wet category shows no resolution for forecast probabilities under 80 while the normal category has no resolution over the whole range of forecast probabilities finally fig 10 shows the rank histograms computed for each season they allow to have a better idea about the quality of the ensembles in capturing the forecast uncertainties the rank histogram is generated for each season considering the 15 forecast dates years within each forecast date 6 forecasted months are considered hence when using all assessed subbasins a total of 3870 forecasted months are available to build the histogram for one single season in many cases and in all seasons the observation lies outside the lower boundary of the ensemble rank one in the histograms more specifically 19 77 of the cases in winter 14 97 of the cases in spring 12 86 of the cases in summer and 16 31 of the cases in autumn are not captured by the ensemble spread also some observations approx 10 for spring winter and autumn and 5 for summer lie above the maximum value of the ensemble in conclusion depending on the season the observed value lay outside the ensemble spread between 20 and 30 of the cases these results suggest that the ensemble spread is in general to narrow to capture the uncertainties 6 discussion a calibrated hydrological model cosero acts as a fundamental component in the seasonal discharge forecasting system presented in this paper the performance of the forecasts will rely on the quality of the hydrological model in general the cosero model is a well known widely used hydrological model which was already used in several studies with successful applications in hydrological studies and operational short term runoff forecasting wesemann et al 2018 due to the characteristics of the catchment it was attempted to integrate into the model the reservoirs and dams but since not sufficient data on operational rules was available they were not considered three important factors stemming from storage hydropower plants hpp influence the hydrology of the catchment first annual storages in the alps lead to transfer or shift of water from one year to another second short term energy production leads to hydropeaking in the rivers below storage hydropower plants and third pumped storage power plants additionally influence downstream flows run of the river power plants do not have noteworthy storage capacities and the inflow corresponds to the outflow and thus do not affect the runoff water balance possible impacts on flow velocities and flood propagation times are implicitly considered in the model calibration procedure storage hydropower plants effect the downstream runoff by intermittently driven storage and release operation longer term shifts in the water balance are also implicitly considered in the model calibration procedure the storage hydropower plants are located in the headwater areas which showed comparatively higher nse values in the calibration validation this shows that despite not directly considering storage and release rules the model partially intrinsically considered the power plants the current study tested the applicability for seasonal forecasting which could potentially widen the benefit for operational applications the forecast system integrates two main working steps in order to provide an ensemble of seasonal discharge forecasts the first step consists in calculating the initial hydrological states of the catchment providing the basis for the seasonal forecast two different meteorological data sets are used to run the calibrated hydrological model which allow to understand better the impact of spatial resolution when computing the initial state ad assimilation data 100 km vs rd reanalysis data 6 km once the hydrological initial states are updated in the model the calibrated hydrological model is run with daily ensemble seasonal forecasts the final output of the model at each time step is an ensemble of 30 50 members considered equally likely of discharge the forecasts are provided up to 6 months ahead the daily discharge forecasts are aggregated to mean monthly discharge and a bias correction was performed applying the linear scaling method in a next step more sophisticated bias correction methods e g quantile mapping and their impact on the seasonal forecasting system should be analysed the ensemble discharge members were splitted into three pre defined categories namely dry near normal and wet resulting in a tercile forecast in our opinion tercile forecast charts can help end users decision makers or stakeholders among others to gain relevant information about the seasonal forecast the seasonal discharge forecasting system is analysed using the available meteorological hindcast data instead of computing the current seasonal forecasts we look at the past seasonal forecasts to check the outcomes with the historical observations this step is necessary in order to assign a value to the above mentioned forecast system many verification metrics are available in literature and only some of them were used in this paper to give different points of view about the overall performance of the seasonal forecast system this analysis allows the user to consider by himself if he could get some benefit of this forecasts compared to other existing products or strategies skill scores give condensed information since they compare the generated forecasts against a reference forecasts e g a forecast based on a random guess in our case as we have three categories each category has a 33 of probabilities to occur by random chance two interesting verification skill scores are evaluated in this paper the heidke skill score hss and the ranked probability skill score rpss in general the hss showed that there is an improvement when using the seasonal forecasting system compared to the random guess however the assessment for the rpss showed the opposite direction i e that most of the assessed subbasins and seasons has a negative rpss meaning that the provided seasonal discharge forecast does not improve the hydro climatological random guess this fact shows the importance of evaluating different verification metrics in this case hss considers that the category forecasted with the highest probability is deterministic i e it has 100 chances to occur while the other two categories have 0 therefore when ignoring probabilities we could get some benefit from the forecasts compared to the random guess conversely rpss takes in account the percentage assigned to each category and this fact penalized the forecast skill only some subbasins especially when initializing the seasonal forecast system with reanalysis data showed positive rpss in these located areas both hss and rpss are larger than zero hence the use of seasonal discharge forecast in these regions could bring some benefit in other water activities directly related to discharge e g hydropower production finally the reliability diagrams also showed that when considering only forecasts pointing to a dry season some benefit could be achieved when such forecasts overpass a probability of 50 this is again even more clear when verifying the seasonal forecast system initialized with the reanalysis data but we need to be careful because it is possible that this better skill when forecasting dry season could be partly due to the known tendency to have more dry years and seasons in the future as consequence of climate change the threshold defined by the selected percentage of ensemble forecasts that point to one particular category dry normal or wet influences the reliability assessment of the seasonal forecasts in general the higher the percentage of ensemble forecasts that fall into one category the better the skill however the cases where forecasts showed a clear direction e g over 60 are very few different interpretations about the skill of the seasonal discharge forecasting system are present just based on the fact of using different verification metrics however there was a clear fact observed when comparing how the system behaves whether it is initialized with assimilation data or reanalysis data for all metrics in almost all the analysed circumstances the seasonal discharge forecasting system performed better with the finer meteorological data i e initializing with reanalysis data therefore it is a challenge on one side to reduce the spatial resolution of the meteorological variables as much as possible and on the other side to make it available up to date in order to be able to use it for providing the current seasonal discharge forecasts lastly the results obtained from the rank histogram suggested that the ensemble spread provided by the seasonal discharge forecasting system is too narrow and therefore the forecasts have huge difficulties in capturing the real uncertainty as mentioned before one possible solution would be to apply different methodologies to correct the bias and analyse its impact over the variability of the ensembles 7 summary and conclusions the hydrological model cosero set up for the upper danube basin upstream of vienna with 65 subbasins is calibrated and validated using the 55 gauged subbasins the model shows a good performance for most of the subbasins according to that 47 of them are considered in further steps then the cosero is driven by ensembles of seasonal meteorological forecasts generating the ensembles of seasonal discharge forecasts finally a multiplicative scale factor bias correction is applied to these forecasts the skill of the discharge forecasts is evaluated with the hindcasts seasonal forecasts for the period 2001 2015 in general the seasonal forecasts show low skill exception are some alpine basins middle high elevated subbasins located at inn salzach and enns sub catchments also a general better performance is found for dry conditions especially when many ensemble members show this tendency nevertheless skill also depends on which metric is used we also tested ad assimilation data and rd reanalysis data for model initialization when using rd the seasonal discharge forecasts clearly show higher skill therefore in operational mode up to date reanalysis data for model initialization is necessary in order to get the maximum benefit from the current seasonal discharge forecasting system further steps to improve the performance of the seasonal forecast system could go in the direction of using more sophisticated bias correction methods e g by using quantile mapping and with the inclusion of hydropower reservoir and operational rules into the hydrological model different options to do this e g following koch et al 2011 or to adopt regional bias

8177,study region gujwa watershed jeju island south korea study focus in this study we investigated whether basin scale hydraulic properties can be inversely estimated using groundwater level fluctuation data a geostatistical principal component adaptation evolution strategy was proposed as the inverse analysis method it was applied to the gujwa basin in jeju island for the hypothetical case the inverse simulation results accurately estimated the distribution and spatial structure of the hydraulic conductivity values the quality of prior information insignificantly affected the proposed method thus it could be used as a critical reference method for groundwater management over a basin scale area new hydrological insight for the region the hydraulic characteristics of an actual aquifer can be characterized over an entire small watershed on the basis of the time series data of the groundwater level fluctuation due to precipitation the hydraulic properties estimated for this area correspond well to the geological features of the area that were not incorporated into the inverse analysis watershed scale aquifer characterization is the most critical step in managing groundwater under the concept of watershed management owing to the reliability of the analysis the estimates of aquifer hydraulic properties obtained from the proposed method can be used for various practical purposes including establishing water resource management plans such as quantitative water resource management and groundwater pollution prevention keywords basin scale aquifer characterization geostatistical principal component adaptation evolution strategy inverse analysis groundwater management jeju island 1 introduction spatial estimation of hydraulic properties of large scale aquifers is critical technique for the sustainable management of groundwater resources regionally graymore et al 2008 yeh et al 2008 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 gorelick and zheng 2015 liu et al 2020 this information can be used for locating promising areas for large scale groundwater development within a watershed or use in designs that regulate the transport of contaminants in aquifers furthermore the large scale information of hydraulic properties can be adopted to determine high level radioactive waste disposal sites or locations of the geological carbon dioxide storage site despite this importance only a handful of direct or indirect data are available for subsurface characterization of hydraulic properties therefore active research is still underway to increase estimation accuracy and reduce uncertainty under information constraints regional groundwater sustainability is demanding in areas where water resources are scarce or where freshwater sources are less diverse for example in areas with insufficient surface water resources on volcanic islands such as jeju island south korea groundwater serves as the sole source of domestic water supply won et al 2005 el kadi et al 2014 and severe damage can occur if the groundwater resources are depleted or contaminated recently reports showed that some groundwater resources in jeju island were extremely contaminated with nitrate caused by waste from agriculture and livestock industry and that freshwater resources in coastal zones are threatened because of saltwater intrusion additionally in many areas of jeju island a recession in the groundwater level is evident because of the increase in using groundwater resources and the continuous population growth and industrial development therefore it is critical to secure water resources for sustainable development this problem is not limited to jeju island but is also frequently encountered in other islands holding et al 2016 post et al 2018 and areas facing groundwater resilience problems richey et al 2015 a well designed water resource planning monitoring and management system is the only way to mitigate this problem and therefore it is critical to understand the spatial distribution of basin scale aquifer hydraulic properties if sufficient data on the aquifer were accumulated systematically over the years reliable characterization of the entire aquifer could be possible however such cases are rare systematic aquifer data collection has not been performed or there are little data for aquifers understanding the spatial distribution of aquifers hydraulic properties over a large area is an underdetermined problem and ill posed kitanidis 2015 therefore various techniques have been devised and have adopted a geostatistics concept that relies on the distance based spatial covariance and gaussian process kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 kitanidis 1995 based on this theory hydraulic tomography has been proposed to understand in detail the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties in the small portion of the aquifer yeh and liu 2000 however because of the spatial limitation of artificially caused hydraulic stress the extent of such estimates is limited therefore several scientists have suggested that hydraulic property estimation using natural hydraulic stimulation can be used to characterize basin wide aquifers yeh et al 2008 2009 d oria and zanini 2019 liu et al 2020 the first advantage of using natural hydraulic stimulation in characterization is determining aquifers hydraulic properties over a large area inverse characterization using natural hydraulic stimulation can also be applied to aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity a few hundred to thousand m day and specific storage coefficient aquifers having such high transmissivity with large storage include lava tubes karst caverns coarse gravel layers or highly fractured crystalline rocks to conduct conventional aquifer tests a change in groundwater level is induced through artificial hydraulic stimulation pumping or injection and the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer are obtained by analyzing the results however in an aquifer having an extremely large hydraulic conductivity it is challenging to induce such a groundwater level depression or mounding artificially in the worst case collecting only the results of measurable wells using conventional methods to obtain a representative hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer can seriously underestimate the actual hydraulic conductivity a natural hydraulic stimulation is incomparably greater in scale and range than artificially induced hydraulic stress groundwater recharge from precipitation for example induces a rise in the groundwater level over most affected areas park and parker 2008 and is not costly for expensive tomographic setups therefore in places where many groundwater level observations are available through existing wells they can be incorporated in the inverse hydraulic characterization this study shows the possibility of characterizing basin scale aquifers using inverse hydraulic characterization based on groundwater recharge from precipitation a case study was conducted on gujwa basin jeju island as far as the authors are aware no real world examples of jointly estimating the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield distributions in a basin scale aquifer using natural stimuli in actual regions exist besides a few synthetic case studies for basin scale hydraulic characterization this study applied the geostatistical principal component adaptation gpca evolution strategy es gpca es recently developed by park 2020 the first part of this study briefly explains the gpca es theory and introduces the metrics for evaluating the estimation results next the gujwa basin in jeju island the inverse analysis target is described focusing on the hydrogeological aspect an inverse analysis is applied to the synthetic field to demonstrate the applied method s suitability followed by an estimation using actual data finally various advantages and limitations are discussed based on the estimation results through the inverse analysis 2 methods 2 1 gpca es this study adopted and used the gpca es as the principal technique of inverse analysis the gpca es combines geostatistics with an evolution strategy as a global optimization technique by imposing spatially correlated structures and regularizing the estimates the ill posedness inherent in the hydrogeological inverse problem can be alleviated to some extent particularly in gpca es development park 2020 improved the slow convergence of the global optimization was by applying the local optimization methods ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2003 along with the es the inverse analysis method used in this study is based on the existing gpca es technique but major theoretical modifications have been implemented to improve computational efficiency in this theoretical improvement the gpca es directly updates principal components omitting the cumbersome process of obtaining principal components from the covariance matrix therefore this study contains only a brief introduction to the revised theory for readers interested in more detailed theories beyond those in this study see park 2020 and park and lee 2021 refer to hansen et al 2003 for a more in depth understanding of the es in the revised gpca es technique the equation for sampling spatial state vectors such as hydraulic conductivity given for a particular estimation stage generation g 1 is given by 1 y i g 1 m g σ g u g s g z where i 1 λ and g 0 1 g max in eq 1 y i g 1 n u 1 is the state vector with n u unknown values as the elements i indicates the i th individual estimate where the population is λ and g max is the maximum number of generations the mean state vector at generation g i e m g n u 1 is determined from the weighted mean up to the μ th best of λ based on the fitness as follows 2 m g 1 1 2 j 1 μ ω j y j λ g m kf where ω j is the unbiased positive weight coefficient ω j log μ 1 2 log j μ log μ 1 2 log i 1 μ i y j λ g 1 is the j th best fitted state vector among the population λ and m kf is the ensemble mean from the enkf method park 2020 eq 27 in this study half of the population was used as the selection number μ λ 2 and λ was set to 20 in eq 1 u g n u k and s g k k include singular vectors and square roots of singular values of reduced order k that is much smaller than the number of unknowns k n u for example in this study the dimension of u g is 20 172 12 notably a significant computational advantage can be obtained by reducing the number of principal components however there is a possibility that the representation of the spatial detail of the hydraulic conductivity structure may degrade accordingly in the initial generation u 0 s 0 u 0 s 0 t c 0 holds because the initial covariance matrix c 0 is symmetric and positive semi definite furthermore since c 0 is obtained through sparse covariance matrix sampling not the entire covariance matrix the computational efficiency of obtaining the initial principal components is higher than that of the existing method in the sampling the same covariance function as park 2020 was used if the spatial correlation of unknowns follows the gaussian process in eq 1 σ g is the step size and z k 1 is an uncorrelated gaussian random vector following n 0 1 in this study empirically determined 0 5 was used consistently as the σ g value park 2020 adopted a method for updating the covariance matrix which was limited because it requires many computational resources when solving a problem with numerous unknowns to overcome this limitation this study revised the intergenerational updating method to directly adapt the principal components so that the gpca es technique relies only on the principal components therefore the principal components of the generation g u g and s g were updated using 3 u g u u g p c g y g y g and 4 σ g u 1 c 1 c kf σ g 0 0 0 c 1 0 0 0 c kf λ 1 i λ λ in eqs 3 and 4 an arrow represents substitution for which singular value decomposition svd was used to obtain the left hand values from the right in these equations the superscript u denotes the updated matrix σ g s g s g t p c g n u 1 is a vector directed toward the evolution path hansen et al 2003 y g n u μ is a collection of the selected state vector y g y 1 λ g y μ λ g y g n u μ is a matrix with μ times replication of the mean vector of y g c 1 is the cumulation coefficient multiplied to p c g and c kf is the cumulation coefficient multiplied to y g y g for c 1 and c kf empirically determined values of 1 20 log n u 1 and 1 2 log n u 1 were used respectively after the above updates the principal components of subsequent generations the generation g 1 were determined using 5 u g 1 σ g 1 v g 1 t u g u σ g u where v g 1 is the right singular vector of decomposed u g u σ g u obtained via svd and 6 s g 1 σ g 1 1 2 notably this adaptation is a critical process for determining spatial covariance relationships and estimation uncertainty for unknown values therefore in the gpca es technique no other process is required for estimating the parameters of spatial variability the average of the root mean squared error rmse from all monitoring wells was used as an objective function for the gpca es technique to reduce for asymptotic estimation improvement over generations 7 j 1 n well i 1 n well 1 n obs i j 1 n obs i h ij o h ij e 2 where h ij o and h ij e are the observed and

basin in jeju island jeju island is the largest island in korea and is located 80 km from the southern coast of korea fig 1 the island is oval and 73 km east west and 41 km north south the study area the gujwa basin is 24 km east west and 17 km north south and the north and east sides are adjacent to the ocean the gujwa basin is one of the largest of 16 basins that make up jeju island and is located on the east side of jeju island and belongs to jeju city on the southwest side of the gujwa basin the elevation gradually decreases radially outward from halla mountain peak at 1950 m above mean sea level hereafter all altitudes are based on mean sea level the highest altitude of the study area is 300 m jeju island was created by multiple volcanic eruptions during the cenozoic era the main aquifer s geological medium s depth in jeju island seogwipo formation is predominantly composed of hyaloclastite and clinker associated with basaltic lava flow therefore the groundwater flow is more likely to be a preferential flow governed by local influences rather than isotropically outward throughout the domain underneath the seogwipo formation a thick confining layer u formation exists composed of welded unconsolidated clay of marine origin the average depth of u formation in the eastern watershed of jeju island including the study area was reported to be about 150 m el koh et al 2008 most of jeju island s surface is covered with a highly permeable medium originating from lava flows or pyroclastic sediment deposits which facilitate the infiltration of precipitation based on the statistics from 2010 to 2019 the average annual precipitation of the area is 2143 3 mm and the average temperature is 15 7 c because of the maritime climate jeju island receives rain frequently and relatively evenly throughout the year with the highest rainfall of 297 9 mm month in august and the least in january 55 9 mm month on average where the standard deviation of the annual precipitation is 69 3 mm month of the precipitation more than 40 recharges groundwater annually hahn et al 1997 hamm et al 2005 won et al 2006 taking the previous observations and reports together with a consideration of high infiltration capacity of the targeted watershed a constant 0 42 was used as the recharge ratio to precipitation if the unsaturated zones maintain similar humidity throughout the year however for an area that does not have high surface permeability applying a constant ratio similar to this study may be inappropriate for the hydraulic property estimation via inverse analysis precipitation data from may 1 to october 31 2019 184 days were used in this study many aquifers in jeju island have extremely high hydraulic conductivity over a few hundred meters per day making it challenging to apply conventional well testing methods i e pumping and slug tests for obtaining hydraulic properties those aquifers are predominantly composed of highly permeable volcanic pyroclastic layers clinker layers and lava tubes originating from volcanic eruptions and lava flows consequently despite numerous monitoring wells in jeju island only a few hydraulic conductivity values are available a few studies have reported that the transmissivity value of aquifers in jeju island ranges from thousands hamm et al 2005 to tens of thousands m2 per day hahn et al 1997 won et al 2005 in the gujwa basin the jeju special self governing province monitors 15 monitoring wells fig 2 and table 1 but none have measured hydraulic conductivity values the hydraulic gradient observed in most monitoring wells is also less than 0 001 park et al 2011 obtained the monitoring wells transmissivities in the gujwa basin using hydrographs of the time series data from the monitoring wells and the estimated values range from 5000 to 33 000 m2 per day however since these estimates are pointwise values with sparse spatial distribution it is challenging to interpret the spatial distribution of permeability or aquifer connectivity across the gujwa basin based on the values because of the high hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer there is no hydraulic interference caused by artificial activities therefore the only factor that can change in the groundwater level across the watershed within a limited period in the study area is groundwater recharge because of precipitation in most monitoring wells whose data were used in this study fig 2 note that the groundwater level fluctuations occurred within one day of precipitation despite the considerable depth from the surface to the water table in the monitoring well average 83 3 m this rapid response of the water table to precipitation suggests that most of the unsaturated zones of the study area are highly permeable 2 3 groundwater flow model and case developments the model domain was set to the entire account basin discretized by 164 123 ew or x and ns or y therefore the numerical domain is 20 172 grid cells unknowns with 146 3 146 3 m dimensions of which 8412 cells are inactive all computations in this study were made for active cells only because the object to be estimated in this study is transmissivity the aquifer thickness was determined to 150 m with reference to koh et al 2008 and the aquifer was set as a water table aquifer in addition referring to park et al s 2011 study the storativity of the entire aquifer was uniformly determined to be 0 063 specific yield 0 06 specific storage coefficient 2 10 5 m 1 in general the distribution of precipitation or recharge rate is spatially heterogeneous however there is no prior analysis or measurement for this in the study area therefore the ratio of recharge from precipitation was set to 0 42 park et al 2011 uniformly over the study area because the aquifer thickness was minor compared to the horizontal scale of the basin the model domain was assumed to be a two dimensional region in the numerical model the domain boundary between the basin and ocean was set as a fixed head boundary condition and a no flow boundary condition was assigned for the boundary contacting the adjacent basin in this study the inverse analysis was performed to estimate the transmissivity of the entire domain using daily groundwater level data for 184 days may 1 october 31 2019 obtained for each monitoring well and daily precipitation records for that area thus in the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique 2760 head data were used and no transmissivity measurements were assimilated in the estimation the initial conditions for the groundwater flow simulation were formed by obtaining the initial groundwater level by performing steady state simulation by entering 4 93 10 3 m d the average recharge rate value a transient flow simulation over 184 days was performed to obtain the change in groundwater level over time using daily precipitation data and time stepping of one day the observed groundwater levels in the monitoring wells were compared with the estimated levels by obtaining the transient groundwater levels from the grid corresponding to the monitoring wells before using the actual groundwater level data from the observation wells several estimates were performed using hypothetical level data based on a synthetic aquifer to demonstrate the estimation performance of the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique since the empirical hydraulic conductivity distribution is unavailable for the study area it is appropriate to determine whether the applied inverse analysis has a reasonable estimation capability in this synthetic case the hypothetical hydraulic conductivity field was realized using an unconditional sequential gaussian simulation sgsim deutsch and journel 1992 the groundwater level for 184 days was computed at each monitoring well using the hydraulic conductivity field as an input parameter for the groundwater flow model which was used as the reference groundwater level in the estimation only the groundwater level data obtained from each observation well were used as input data for the inverse analysis it was assumed that the statistics of the hydraulic conductivity field including spatial statistics spatial correlation scales were unknown thus inaccurate statistics were used as the basis for the estimation as such not having prior information on the hydraulic conductivity field is commonplace in practice erdal and cirpka 2016 in the empirical data case time series data obtained from monitoring wells in the gujwa basin were directly applied to the inverse analysis in the overall estimation a computation system with a 2 5 ghz 28 core intel xeon w cpu and 768 gb of memory was used the operating system was mac os 11 and matlab 2020a with the parallel computing toolbox to create the inverse analysis code of this study since the forward model running in each generation was independent the computational efficiency through parallel computation using a 28 cores could be increased as a forward groundwater flow simulator modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 compiled for mac os was used without invasive code modification 2 4 performance metrics for estimates the model performance for each estimation was quantified by applying three metrics of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsec nash and sutcliffe 1970 rmse correlation coefficient cc and structural similarity index ssim wang et al 2004 among the metrics cc and ssim were only used when evaluating a synthetic case and were not used for estimation based on actual groundwater levels for which no estimation target exists the nsec was used to measure the fitness between the observed and estimated values defined as 8 nsec 1 1 n well i 1 n well j 1 n obs i h ij e h ij o 2 j 1 n obs i h ij o h i o 2 where h i o is the mean value of the observed groundwater levels in the i th monitoring well the nsec ranges from to 1 and nsec 1 indicates that the estimated groundwater levels are identical to the actual levels bounds of the models that indicate sufficient quality are given between 0 5 nsec 0 65 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 cc measured the grid based similarity of the pattern between the synthetic true and estimated hydraulic properties because the rmse and cc are limited in representing the degree of structural similarity ssim was adopted as an additional metric to quantify the similarity in the structural pattern between the empirical and estimated log hydraulic conductivity fields sánchez león et al 2020 the formulation of the ssim is given by 9 ssim 2 μ t μ e c 1 2 σ te c 2 μ t 2 μ e 2 c 1 σ t 2 σ e 2 c 2 where μ t and μ e are the means of the true and estimated log transformed hydraulic conductivity fields respectively σ t 2 and σ e 2 are the variances of the true and estimated hydraulic conductivity fields respectively and σ te is the covariance between the true and estimated fields for c 1 and c 2 of eq 9 an extremely small number of 2 22 10 16 was used 3 results 3 1 data used for inverse analysis in the study area 15 monitoring wells are available for inversely estimating the entire aquifer s transmissivity table 1 includes information about the monitoring wells and fig 2 shows the locations fig 3 a shows the groundwater hydrographs from the monitoring wells the mean static groundwater level observed at the monitoring wells is 1 32 m in terms of base level indicating the lowest groundwater levels during the observation period the maximum was observed at jdhd 4 with 4 23 m 12 of fig 3 a and the minimum was at jdhd 1 with 0 56 m 3 of fig 3 a the distance from the shoreline table 1 affects the base level of each monitoring well but not necessarily the groundwater level fluctuation characteristics in each observation well are different depending on the distance from the ground surface to the water table and hydraulic characteristics of the constituting medium among these wells jdhd 4 12 of fig 3 a and jdjd 5 15 of fig 3 a showed the most obviously observed delays in infiltration recharge since there are no empirical measurements of hydraulic conductivities available for the monitoring wells of the study area the analytical solution developed by park et al 2011 was modified and applied to estimate the log transformed hydraulic conductivity values which are included in table 1 their mean value was 6 46 and the range was approximately 5 9 7 1 however since these values were calculated based on a 1d assumption that limits the dimension of groundwater flow the actual hydraulic conductivity was probably overestimated therefore these values were used only as reference data they were not used to construct prior information for the inverse analysis 3 2 results of inverse analysis 3 2 1 synthetic aquifer case for the synthetic case a hydraulic conductivity field was synthesized using unconditional sgsim groundwater flow modeling was performed using the hydraulic conductivity distribution as input data to generate the groundwater level changes for 184 days at each monitoring well location for the sgsim realization the spatial correlation distance is 5 85 km in the x and y directions and the mean and variance of the log transformed hydraulic conductivity field are 5 222 185 3 m day and 1 586 respectively recharge to precipitation ratio rpr and storativity were 0 42 and 0 063 park et al 2011 in both the synthetic and actual cases of this study respectively whereas the impact of the uncertain rpr value was analyzed fig 3 b shows the groundwater level fluctuations at each monitoring well from the realization which were used as input information for the gpca es inverse analysis in this study the entire transient groundwater level history and not simply the temporal moment or the steady state water level was used for inverse analysis therefore more detailed aquifer hydraulic properties can be realized as the wells locate upstream within the basin the base level of groundwater and the maximum fluctuation of the groundwater level gradually increases in estimating hydraulic conductivity of synthetic aquifers it was assumed that prior information was insufficient due to limited investigations of the watershed and the values used to generate the synthetic aquifer were deliberately avoided thus the spatial correlation distance was arbitrarily set to be 1 2 km for the x and y directions and the log transformed hydraulic conductivity was assumed to be 2 7 39 m day fig 4 shows the reference and estimated log transformed hydraulic conductivity field and the corresponding groundwater level distributions at the end of the simulation where estimates were obtained from the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique using the groundwater level data in fig 3 b when visually compared the estimated and reference hydraulic conductivity fields are significantly similar the mean and variance of the log transformed estimated hydraulic conductivity field were 5 17 176 44 m day and 1 343 respectively the reduction in the standard deviation was attributed to the smoothing observed in the inverse analysis using parabolic partial differential equations the computation time required to obtain the inverse analysis result over 30 generations was 118 9 s and 237 modflow 2005 simulations were performed of this computation time 60 5 s were spent executing the forward model for grid by grid comparisons between the log transformed reference and estimated hydraulic conductivity fields the rmse was 1 129 and the cc was 0 715 the nsec value between the reference and estimated groundwater levels at the monitoring wells was 0 928 the results are shown in fig s1 in supplementary material i these results can also be visually confirmed through scatterplots in supplementary material i fig s2a is a scatterplot comparing log transformed hydraulic conductivity values in fig 4 a and b whereas fig s2b compares the groundwater levels in fig 4 c and d although there are some over or underestimations the reference and estimated groundwater levels at each monitoring correlate well although reasonable fitting of groundwater levels at the monitoring wells was achieved the estimated hydraulic conductivity distribution showed a more diffusive pattern than the reference this is a general limitation in inverse analysis using the groundwater flow model similar limitations can be observed in the inverse analysis of most diffusion problems kitanidis 2015 among the hydrographs fig s1 in supplementary material i the reference and estimated groundwater levels discrepancy is most evident for monitoring wells near the coast a nearby specified head boundary can produce estimation results less sensitive to parameter changes in an inverse analysis and limit the hydraulic information that can be obtained from groundwater level fluctuations in a monitoring well for the permeability spatial structure the ssim was 0 705 suggesting that the estimate and reference have excellent structural similarity note that the estimation quality is reasonable even though the hydraulic conductivity field s expected mean and spatial correlation scales used as prior information were significantly different from those of the reference in conventional inverse analysis relying on the local optimization method prior information about the correlation scales sensitively affects the estimation quality mu et al 2020 whereas in the gpca es inverse analysis based on global optimization estimation quality is less dependent on prior information s quality for areas that have not been extensively investigated no prior information applies to the inverse analysis therefore the observations in this case study indicate that the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique can be used in realistic situations where prior information is unavailable or inaccurate fig 5 shows some of the initial and final principal components that make up initial and final estimates ordered from the largest to smallest singular value from pcs 1 8 the initial principal components were obtained from the covariance function used for composing the initial covariance matrix whereas the final principal components were the results of their adaptation over 30 generations to the information provided observed hydrographs at monitoring wells since the gpca es technique seeks principal components that can reproduce an optimal state within a highly parametrized state dimension using conditioning information the principal components especially pc 1 of the final principal components have greater similarity to the reference and estimated hydraulic conductivity fields than the initial principal components principal components with large singular values change through adaptation over generations and show different structures than the initial since this adaptation of principal components is already contained within the algorithm gpca es does not require a separate process to estimate spatial variability parameters such as correlation scales and their orientations fig 6 shows the changes of estimation uncertainty after estimation over 30 generations the uncertainty maps were obtained by extracting the diagonal components of the normalized covariance matrix using computation based on the initial and final pcs representing a relative uncertainty distribution rather than an absolute distribution this relative uncertainty indicates the potential for an estimation to be inaccurate the initial relative uncertainty map is based on the employed covariance function and has a relatively even value distribution throughout the domain the final uncertainty map is a distribution of relative values obtained from estimations over 30 generations and unlike the initial distribution high values are concentrated in some locations in fig 6 b the relatively high values in the northwestern part of the domain have a shape similar to the high hydraulic conductivity structure estimated in fig 4 b the pcs of the final generation determine this final relative uncertainty which is determined from the interrelationships of spatial information and location of the monitoring well providing constraining information if monitoring wells and observed groundwater level data exist in the center of the high value part in fig 6 b and are reflected in the inverse analysis the high relative uncertainty can be reduced therefore the relative uncertainty distribution map as fig 6 could determine the additional wells within the domain notably the estimation uncertainty distribution evaluated by gpca es slightly differed from the existing bayesian regression based uncertainty distribution uncertainties evaluated by bayesian regression methods are sensitive to the data density whereas the uncertainty of gcpa es was sensitive to the difference between the initially provided prior information and the final estimate because several factors affecting the permeability of the surface and unsaturated zones can affect groundwater recharge because of precipitation obtaining a representative value over a large area might involve a large amount of uncertainty although the spatial variation of the groundwater recharge amount might not be large in the study area because of the flat topography with a constant slope to the shoreline the homogeneous surface and unsaturated zone medium and the absence of surface covering could produce inaccurately estimated recharge amounts therefore an attempt was made to determine the changed recharge amount s impact on the hydraulic conductivity estimation by increasing or decreasing the amount of groundwater recharge applied to the inverse analysis by 25 fig 7 shows the results of the inverse analyses by changing the rpr to 0 315 fig 7 a for hydraulic conductivity and fig 7 c for hydraulic head distributions and 0 525 fig 7 b and d where the reference rpr value is 0 42 for the case with an rpr of 0 315 the ssim between the reference and estimated hydraulic conductivity fields was 0 677 and for an rpr of 0 525 the ssim was 0 662 considering that the ssim was 0 705 for the estimation result using the correct rpr the ssims of both cases were decreased however the amount of ssim value reductions were insignificant also when visually comparing fig 7 a and b to fig 4 a respectively the change is not obvious with the critical structures high and low hydraulic conductivity being observed in both figures with the changed rpr values therefore the experiments of estimation by varying rpr values indicate that if the spatial rpr change is insignificant the inaccuracy within a certain range of the applied rpr does not significantly affect the structural estimation of the hydraulic conductivity field this finding confirms that groundwater level fluctuations can be used in estimating the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity at the basin scale by inverse analysis using the gpca es technique under situations similar to that in this study however after comparing figs 4 and 7 the uncertainty of the recharge rate can be said to significantly affect the local hydraulic conductivity estimation but not the regional structure estimation 3 2 2 empirical data the case study in section 3 2 1 confirmed that the hydraulic conductivity distribution of the basin scale domain could be reasonably estimated through inverse analysis using the gpca es technique in this section the distribution of hydraulic conductivity across the basin was inversely estimated using groundwater level data obtained from the monitoring wells in the gujwa basin since a groundwater flow model for the domain has already been established no significant change in this real estimation exists except for replacing the synthetic groundwater level time series data corresponding to each monitoring well location with actual data all other parameters were the same as in the previous case in the actual case the estimation consistency was shown by performing five estimations except for one estimate the remaining four estimates were included in supplementary material ii figs s3 through s6 to save space in this manuscript because of the stochastic nature of the gpca es technique each estimate shows general similarities in the overall spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity but has some differences in detail fig 8 shows the hydraulic conductivity and groundwater level distributions in the domain estimated by applying the groundwater hydrographs in fig 3 a unlike the previous case convergence reached earlier in the actual case and estimations were made over 15 generations in total 64 3 s were spent to obtain the estimation of fig 8 of which 32 7 s were spent for forward model execution with 125 model runs the prior information used for the estimation is the same as in the previous synthetic case by combining the results of fig 8 and supplementary material i figs s1 through s4 high hydraulic conductivity distribution appears in the central north and southeast domain and a low hydraulic conductivity distribution is concentrated in the west domain fig 8a accordingly the groundwater level contour shows a sparser distribution in areas with high hydraulic conductivity and dense distribution in areas with low hydraulic conductivity fig 8b because of the estimation the mean and variance of the domain s log transformed hydraulic conductivity were 5 44 230 4 m day and 1 51 respectively and the values are at least 2 92 18 5 m day and at most 8 23 3751 8 m day when comparing the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity calculated in table 1 the value obtained from the inverse analysis was approximately 1 5 lower in terms of the log transformed hydraulic conductivity in addition the hydraulic conductivity obtained by applying a 1d analytical solution for individual monitoring wells can significantly underestimate the actual hydraulic conductivity considering that the aquifer s thickness is assumed to be 150 m uniformly the mean transmissivity of the domain corresponds to 10 56 38 300 m2 day according to park et al 2011 the log transformed transmissivity of the eastern part of jeju island including the gujwa basin was 9 3 which was obtained from the values of each monitoring well in the area although both estimates rely on different methods the mean log transformed transmissivity estimated in this study is similar to the value in park et al 2011 that was based on the hydrograph of each monitoring well recalling that the estimated range between the minimum and maximum values underestimates the actual range because of the smoothing effect confirmed in the synthetic case the range of the actual hydraulic conductivity values should be larger than the estimated range 27 8 5664 6 m day in the real estimation unlike the previous synthetic case a limitation exists showing the observed and estimated groundwater levels consistency is the only way to represent the estimation results appropriateness quantitatively fig 9 compares the observed and estimated groundwater levels the nsec value obtained by combining the groundwater levels of all monitoring wells was 0 794 indicating that the estimated groundwater levels correlate well with the actual furthermore the rmse and cc between the observed and estimated groundwater levels were 0 93 m and 0 9 respectively considering that the standard deviation of the observed groundwater level is 2 06 m these values indicate high accuracy of the estimated groundwater levels overall estimation metrics indicate that the observed groundwater levels in the monitoring wells were well reflected in the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique however because the unsaturated zone is generally thick in the gujwa basin some monitoring wells have a time delay from precipitation to groundwater recharge fig 3 a hydrographs showing the observed groundwater level with rounded peaks in fig 9 are mostly where delays occur fig 10 shows the estimation results relative uncertainty the final relative uncertainty shows a higher distribution in the central north and southeast domain which roughly agrees with the estimated location of high hydraulic conductivity values therefore in planning an additional monitoring well in the gujwa basin it is expected that if monitoring wells are installed at locations with higher relative uncertainty the estimation accuracy can be improved through further inverse analysis using the gpca es technique based on the additional data since there is a limit to the method for quantitatively verifying the estimated results qualitative verification was performed using reports on geological features of the area that could be related to the aquifer s hydraulic properties previous explorations confirmed that the central north domain has a higher population of lava tubes than any other areas on jeju island among them the representative lava tubes are manjanggul and yongcheongul fig 11 shows the locations of the area s lava tubes and the interior of manjanggul although the information related to lava tubes was not reflected in the inverse analysis the location of lava tubes coincides with the higher hydraulic conductivity location in the central north of the model domain in fig 8 based on geophysical studies shon 2009 manjanggul should be interconnected with several lava tubes found in the downgradient direction of the groundwater flow groundwater floods some sections of these lava tubes near the shoreline therefore it contributes to facilitating the groundwater flow in this area also since the rocks that make up the aquifer s depth are the same as the rocks that make up the lava tubes more lava tubes in the aquifer s depth that has not been found could exist lava tubes are critical in regulating the hydraulic head in coastal areas furthermore since these lava tubes are critical for the intrusion of saltwater into inland aquifers it is critical to understand their distribution and spatial connectivity 3 2 3 incorporating the directional features in the spatial correlation structure although efforts have already been made to obtain the spatial distribution of the gujwa basin s hydraulic conductivity in section 3 2 2 no estimation has been made reflecting the orientation of critical geological features associated with the hydrogeological phenomenon of the domain the most representative geological features are the potentially interconnected lava tubes direction in the central north domain and the trachy basaltic lava flow s direction in the cenozoic quaternary period through the center of the domain toward the coast fig 11 from the north the lava tube is 41 6 clockwise and the trachy basalt lava flow is 51 1 clockwise from the north this information indicates that the major axis of the spatial correlation structure of the gujwa basin s hydraulic conductivity structure potential is 46 4 clockwise from the north reflecting this feature the initial principal components were constructed and the inverse analysis using the gpca es was performed to obtain the spatial hydraulic conductivity distribution of the domain s aquifer although the arbitrary determination of the correlation scales along the major and minor axes is similar as section 3 2 2 this section assumes that the major axis is longer than the minor axis and that the structure is oriented in a particular direction thus the major axis of the spatial correlation distance is assumed to be 7 31 km long lying 46 4 degrees clockwise from the north and the minor axis is perpendicular to the major axis with a length of 5 85 km where 7 31 km is 1 25 times of 5 85 km here the correlation scales given to the major and minor axes are arbitrarily determined to reflect anisotropy and does not accurately reflect those of the actual area except for the correlation structure all other parameters including prior information on hydraulic conductivity are identical to section 3 2 2 fig 12 shows an estimate of the hydraulic conductivity field and groundwater level distributions for the estimation similar prior information other than the spatial correlation structure was used in the inverse analysis and the time and number of forward model runs for estimation were similar to those in section 3 2 2 as shown in fig 12 the distribution of the estimated hydraulic conductivity field because of applying the correlation scale structure with an oblique angle is similar to the result of the previous section with no rotation in the spatial correlation structure however slight improvements occur in the estimation quality metrics and nsec value obtained by combining the groundwater levels of all monitoring wells 0 803 furthermore the rmse and cc between the observed and estimated groundwater levels were 0 91 m and 0 906 respectively this observation indicates that the actual groundwater level estimation performance slightly improved by incorporating the oblique correlation structure in the inverse analysis but the improvement degree was insignificant however visual comparison of the estimated spatial characteristics of the hydraulic conductivity field with fig 8 reveals that there are some structural differences the mean and standard deviation of the domain s log transformed hydraulic conductivity were 5 14 170 7 m day and 1 62 respectively and the values are at least 0 45 1 57 m day and at most 7 76 2345 m day considering that the aquifer s thickness is assumed to be 150 m uniformly the mean transmissivity of the domain corresponds to 10 16 25 783 m2 day the application shows that if the anisotropy of the spatial correlation structure of the hydraulic conductivity field is roughly informed through various geological features this information can be conveniently reflected in the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique however the addition of further prior information insignificantly improved the estimation quality because such an adaptation to the spatial structure of the estimation object was already included in the algorithm 3 2 4 joint estimation of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield in the previous cases it was assumed that the storativity has a constant value of 0 063 which is uniform for the entire domain for a geological medium with large porosity the local spatial variability of storativity has been reported to be smaller than that of the transmissivity meier et al 1998 thus applying the constant storativity reported in previous studies to the entire domain is reasonable however for a more sophisticated estimate it is better to assume that both transmissivity and storativity vary spatially franssen et al 1999 castagna et al 2011 therefore in the third case using actual data it was assumed that the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield had independent spatial distributions and were jointly estimated all parameters and assumptions used for this estimation are the same as those in subsection 3 2 3 except that storativity can vary spatially the principal components of generation 0 were assumed to be the same for both hydraulic conductivity and specific yield and they have different evolution pathways during the adaptation over generations meanwhile it was assumed that the specific storage coefficient was maintained as a constant value 2 10 5 m 1 throughout the entire domain the initial value used to estimate the specific yield was 0 08 and the range was 0 02 0 1 fig 13 shows the inversely estimated hydraulic conductivity and specific yield fields using gpca es in the joint estimation convergence reached 17 generations lasting for 115 6 s of which 52 s was spent for forward model execution and the number of model runs was 162 the increased estimation time compared to the previous estimations was due to an increase in the number of unknowns when compared visually the distribution of hydraulic conductivity was almost to the same as those of the two previous cases the mean and variance of the log transformed hydraulic conductivity of the domain were 5 36 212 7 m day and 1 93 respectively the values were in the range of 2 38 10 8 m day to 7 74 2298 6 m day the mean and variance of the log transformed specific yield were 2 78 0 062 and 0 149 respectively the values were in the range of 3 88 0 02 to 2 4 0 09 the mean specific yield obtained as a result of the inverse estimation was close to a previously reported value for this region 0 06 park et al 2011 the nsec value obtained by combining the groundwater levels of all monitoring wells was 0 817 and the rmse and cc between the observed and estimated groundwater levels were 0 88 m and 0 906 respectively these metrics indicated that the estimation quality improved compared to the previous cases but the degree of improvement was insignificant as in the previous case there was a tendency that the locations where many lava tubes were distributed in the central northern part of the domain fig 11a and also had high specific yields fig 13b despite the assumption of independence of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield in the estimation the distributions of two parameters in fig 13 show similar characteristics the estimated log transformed hydraulic conductivity and specific yield showed a high cc of 0 88 this observation indicated that the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the gujwa basin were regulated by the porosity 4 discussion and limitations of the proposed method the main message from this study is that the proposed method can determine the hydraulic characteristics of a basin scale aquifer using the time series data of the groundwater level furthermore it is the first study to characterize basin scale aquifers in realistic not synthetic regions through inverse analysis using natural stimuli of groundwater recharge most of the related study conducted so far was restricted to a synthetic aquifer using only the actual basin s geometry because of various limitations such as limited information on historical information on artificially imposed hydraulic stresses liu et al 2020 in this study basin scale aquifer characterization based on actual groundwater level data can be achieved because of the jeju island aquifer s characteristics which are hardly affected by manmade hydraulic interference the gpca es technique for inverse analysis in this study reduced the sensitivity of estimation quality to prior information using a global optimization technique and conducted estimations on the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties across a basin scale aquifer within a small computational time these features have practical advantages in characterizing basin scale aquifers using natural stimuli it is rare for large basins to be detailed enough to obtain accurate prior information to use in the inverse analysis it is challenging to exclude dependence on prior information but the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique used in this study has great significance in demonstrating reasonable estimations of large scale hydraulic property distributions even if the prior information is unavailable or largely inaccurate to further increase using the proposed method the gpca es technique is must extend to three dimensional spaces nevertheless since this study characterizes basin scale aquifers based on limited information the two dimensional gpca es technique can be sufficiently used the storativity was assumed to be uniform throughout the study area also the recharge rate was assumed to be uniform because of limited information when comparing estimated and actual groundwater levels the recharge rate probably varied locally and was mainly attributed to the unsaturated zone thickness and permeability in the empirical data case time delays between precipitation and groundwater level responses were observed in most monitoring wells these time lags were due to delayed drainage through the unsaturated zone in this study the impact of the unsaturated zone could not be considered because delayed groundwater recharge was not accounted for to incorporate the impact of the unsaturated zones into inverse analysis the calibrated richard s equation based groundwater flow model suk and park 2019 or darcy groundwater flow model combined with a delayed recharge flux model park et al 2021 should be adopted as a forward model which is beyond the scope of this study and will be considered in future studies although not covered in this study it is crucial to estimate groundwater recharge and hydraulic conductivity simultaneously several studies have been conducted on this subject franssen et al 2004 erdal and cirpka 2016 5 summary and conclusions this study investigated whether the hydraulic property distribution of a basin scale aquifer can be estimated inversely based on the groundwater level fluctuations caused by groundwater recharge therefore the gpca es developed by park 2020 was modified and applied as an inverse analysis method for basin scale hydraulic characterization the target area was the gujwa basin in jeju island and an inverse analysis was performed using groundwater level data from 15 monitoring wells in the area because of the limitations of the verification method for estimated results that might occur in the actual application this study first applied the method to synthetic data and estimated hydraulic property consequently it was confirmed that reasonable estimation could be made using the proposed method then the proposed method was used to estimate the aquifer s hydraulic property using the observed groundwater level obtained from the actual monitoring well although it was impossible to verify the estimated results similar to the synthetic case it is encouraging that the results corresponded to geological features that were not used as prior information furthermore the estimated values correspond to the distribution of the previously reported values the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties especially the interconnectivity of spatial structures can be for deriving potential locations of groundwater development or for planning groundwater remediation by optimizing the design of regulating contaminant migration in the aquifer therefore the hydraulic property estimation using the method proposed in this study can be used in managing groundwater over a large area furthermore it can be effectively applied to fields requiring large scale aquifer characterization such as oil and gas exploration and development determining locations of high level radioactive waste disposal sites and designing geological storage of carbon dioxide which could require replacing the forward model if the forward model is replaced with a simulator modeling physical phenomena based on petrophysical characteristics of the subsurface media the technique proposed in this study could be extended to geophysical inverse analysis and subsurface property estimation in this extended application developing a three dimensional gpca es technique is essential as confirmed in the actual groundwater level data note that the role of unsaturated zones delayed recharge flux can significantly affect the groundwater level fluctuations park and lee 2021 when using a forward model that cannot reasonably represent this phenomenon inaccuracies and uncertainties in the estimated aquifer s hydraulic properties are inevitable therefore in this study basin scale hydraulic property estimations using inverse analysis have limitations this limitation could be overcome by performing an inverse analysis based on the gpca es technique using a forward model incorporating the hydraulic role of an unsaturated zone and a study is currently being conducted for this purpose the method proposed in this study is directly applicable to groundwater basins where anthropogenic hydraulic interference is insignificant and continuous groundwater levels are observed through several monitoring wells such as the study area however for regions where the anthropogenic interference is critical the history of hydraulic stresses must be incorporated to estimate the hydraulic property correctly using the proposed method funding this research was supported by the national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea government msit nrf 2020r1a2c2013606 this

8177,study region gujwa watershed jeju island south korea study focus in this study we investigated whether basin scale hydraulic properties can be inversely estimated using groundwater level fluctuation data a geostatistical principal component adaptation evolution strategy was proposed as the inverse analysis method it was applied to the gujwa basin in jeju island for the hypothetical case the inverse simulation results accurately estimated the distribution and spatial structure of the hydraulic conductivity values the quality of prior information insignificantly affected the proposed method thus it could be used as a critical reference method for groundwater management over a basin scale area new hydrological insight for the region the hydraulic characteristics of an actual aquifer can be characterized over an entire small watershed on the basis of the time series data of the groundwater level fluctuation due to precipitation the hydraulic properties estimated for this area correspond well to the geological features of the area that were not incorporated into the inverse analysis watershed scale aquifer characterization is the most critical step in managing groundwater under the concept of watershed management owing to the reliability of the analysis the estimates of aquifer hydraulic properties obtained from the proposed method can be used for various practical purposes including establishing water resource management plans such as quantitative water resource management and groundwater pollution prevention keywords basin scale aquifer characterization geostatistical principal component adaptation evolution strategy inverse analysis groundwater management jeju island 1 introduction spatial estimation of hydraulic properties of large scale aquifers is critical technique for the sustainable management of groundwater resources regionally graymore et al 2008 yeh et al 2008 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 gorelick and zheng 2015 liu et al 2020 this information can be used for locating promising areas for large scale groundwater development within a watershed or use in designs that regulate the transport of contaminants in aquifers furthermore the large scale information of hydraulic properties can be adopted to determine high level radioactive waste disposal sites or locations of the geological carbon dioxide storage site despite this importance only a handful of direct or indirect data are available for subsurface characterization of hydraulic properties therefore active research is still underway to increase estimation accuracy and reduce uncertainty under information constraints regional groundwater sustainability is demanding in areas where water resources are scarce or where freshwater sources are less diverse for example in areas with insufficient surface water resources on volcanic islands such as jeju island south korea groundwater serves as the sole source of domestic water supply won et al 2005 el kadi et al 2014 and severe damage can occur if the groundwater resources are depleted or contaminated recently reports showed that some groundwater resources in jeju island were extremely contaminated with nitrate caused by waste from agriculture and livestock industry and that freshwater resources in coastal zones are threatened because of saltwater intrusion additionally in many areas of jeju island a recession in the groundwater level is evident because of the increase in using groundwater resources and the continuous population growth and industrial development therefore it is critical to secure water resources for sustainable development this problem is not limited to jeju island but is also frequently encountered in other islands holding et al 2016 post et al 2018 and areas facing groundwater resilience problems richey et al 2015 a well designed water resource planning monitoring and management system is the only way to mitigate this problem and therefore it is critical to understand the spatial distribution of basin scale aquifer hydraulic properties if sufficient data on the aquifer were accumulated systematically over the years reliable characterization of the entire aquifer could be possible however such cases are rare systematic aquifer data collection has not been performed or there are little data for aquifers understanding the spatial distribution of aquifers hydraulic properties over a large area is an underdetermined problem and ill posed kitanidis 2015 therefore various techniques have been devised and have adopted a geostatistics concept that relies on the distance based spatial covariance and gaussian process kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 kitanidis 1995 based on this theory hydraulic tomography has been proposed to understand in detail the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties in the small portion of the aquifer yeh and liu 2000 however because of the spatial limitation of artificially caused hydraulic stress the extent of such estimates is limited therefore several scientists have suggested that hydraulic property estimation using natural hydraulic stimulation can be used to characterize basin wide aquifers yeh et al 2008 2009 d oria and zanini 2019 liu et al 2020 the first advantage of using natural hydraulic stimulation in characterization is determining aquifers hydraulic properties over a large area inverse characterization using natural hydraulic stimulation can also be applied to aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity a few hundred to thousand m day and specific storage coefficient aquifers having such high transmissivity with large storage include lava tubes karst caverns coarse gravel layers or highly fractured crystalline rocks to conduct conventional aquifer tests a change in groundwater level is induced through artificial hydraulic stimulation pumping or injection and the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer are obtained by analyzing the results however in an aquifer having an extremely large hydraulic conductivity it is challenging to induce such a groundwater level depression or mounding artificially in the worst case collecting only the results of measurable wells using conventional methods to obtain a representative hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer can seriously underestimate the actual hydraulic conductivity a natural hydraulic stimulation is incomparably greater in scale and range than artificially induced hydraulic stress groundwater recharge from precipitation for example induces a rise in the groundwater level over most affected areas park and parker 2008 and is not costly for expensive tomographic setups therefore in places where many groundwater level observations are available through existing wells they can be incorporated in the inverse hydraulic characterization this study shows the possibility of characterizing basin scale aquifers using inverse hydraulic characterization based on groundwater recharge from precipitation a case study was conducted on gujwa basin jeju island as far as the authors are aware no real world examples of jointly estimating the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield distributions in a basin scale aquifer using natural stimuli in actual regions exist besides a few synthetic case studies for basin scale hydraulic characterization this study applied the geostatistical principal component adaptation gpca evolution strategy es gpca es recently developed by park 2020 the first part of this study briefly explains the gpca es theory and introduces the metrics for evaluating the estimation results next the gujwa basin in jeju island the inverse analysis target is described focusing on the hydrogeological aspect an inverse analysis is applied to the synthetic field to demonstrate the applied method s suitability followed by an estimation using actual data finally various advantages and limitations are discussed based on the estimation results through the inverse analysis 2 methods 2 1 gpca es this study adopted and used the gpca es as the principal technique of inverse analysis the gpca es combines geostatistics with an evolution strategy as a global optimization technique by imposing spatially correlated structures and regularizing the estimates the ill posedness inherent in the hydrogeological inverse problem can be alleviated to some extent particularly in gpca es development park 2020 improved the slow convergence of the global optimization was by applying the local optimization methods ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2003 along with the es the inverse analysis method used in this study is based on the existing gpca es technique but major theoretical modifications have been implemented to improve computational efficiency in this theoretical improvement the gpca es directly updates principal components omitting the cumbersome process of obtaining principal components from the covariance matrix therefore this study contains only a brief introduction to the revised theory for readers interested in more detailed theories beyond those in this study see park 2020 and park and lee 2021 refer to hansen et al 2003 for a more in depth understanding of the es in the revised gpca es technique the equation for sampling spatial state vectors such as hydraulic conductivity given for a particular estimation stage generation g 1 is given by 1 y i g 1 m g σ g u g s g z where i 1 λ and g 0 1 g max in eq 1 y i g 1 n u 1 is the state vector with n u unknown values as the elements i indicates the i th individual estimate where the population is λ and g max is the maximum number of generations the mean state vector at generation g i e m g n u 1 is determined from the weighted mean up to the μ th best of λ based on the fitness as follows 2 m g 1 1 2 j 1 μ ω j y j λ g m kf where ω j is the unbiased positive weight coefficient ω j log μ 1 2 log j μ log μ 1 2 log i 1 μ i y j λ g 1 is the j th best fitted state vector among the population λ and m kf is the ensemble mean from the enkf method park 2020 eq 27 in this study half of the population was used as the selection number μ λ 2 and λ was set to 20 in eq 1 u g n u k and s g k k include singular vectors and square roots of singular values of reduced order k that is much smaller than the number of unknowns k n u for example in this study the dimension of u g is 20 172 12 notably a significant computational advantage can be obtained by reducing the number of principal components however there is a possibility that the representation of the spatial detail of the hydraulic conductivity structure may degrade accordingly in the initial generation u 0 s 0 u 0 s 0 t c 0 holds because the initial covariance matrix c 0 is symmetric and positive semi definite furthermore since c 0 is obtained through sparse covariance matrix sampling not the entire covariance matrix the computational efficiency of obtaining the initial principal components is higher than that of the existing method in the sampling the same covariance function as park 2020 was used if the spatial correlation of unknowns follows the gaussian process in eq 1 σ g is the step size and z k 1 is an uncorrelated gaussian random vector following n 0 1 in this study empirically determined 0 5 was used consistently as the σ g value park 2020 adopted a method for updating the covariance matrix which was limited because it requires many computational resources when solving a problem with numerous unknowns to overcome this limitation this study revised the intergenerational updating method to directly adapt the principal components so that the gpca es technique relies only on the principal components therefore the principal components of the generation g u g and s g were updated using 3 u g u u g p c g y g y g and 4 σ g u 1 c 1 c kf σ g 0 0 0 c 1 0 0 0 c kf λ 1 i λ λ in eqs 3 and 4 an arrow represents substitution for which singular value decomposition svd was used to obtain the left hand values from the right in these equations the superscript u denotes the updated matrix σ g s g s g t p c g n u 1 is a vector directed toward the evolution path hansen et al 2003 y g n u μ is a collection of the selected state vector y g y 1 λ g y μ λ g y g n u μ is a matrix with μ times replication of the mean vector of y g c 1 is the cumulation coefficient multiplied to p c g and c kf is the cumulation coefficient multiplied to y g y g for c 1 and c kf empirically determined values of 1 20 log n u 1 and 1 2 log n u 1 were used respectively after the above updates the principal components of subsequent generations the generation g 1 were determined using 5 u g 1 σ g 1 v g 1 t u g u σ g u where v g 1 is the right singular vector of decomposed u g u σ g u obtained via svd and 6 s g 1 σ g 1 1 2 notably this adaptation is a critical process for determining spatial covariance relationships and estimation uncertainty for unknown values therefore in the gpca es technique no other process is required for estimating the parameters of spatial variability the average of the root mean squared error rmse from all monitoring wells was used as an objective function for the gpca es technique to reduce for asymptotic estimation improvement over generations 7 j 1 n well i 1 n well 1 n obs i j 1 n obs i h ij o h ij e 2 where h ij o and h ij e are the observed and estimated hydraulic head of the j th observed data at the i th monitoring well n obs i is the number of observed data in the i th monitoring well and n well is the number of wells 2 2 study area gujwa basin in jeju island jeju island is the largest island in korea and is located 80 km from the southern coast of korea fig 1 the island is oval and 73 km east west and 41 km north south the study area the gujwa basin is 24 km east west and 17 km north south and the north and east sides are adjacent to the ocean the gujwa basin is one of the largest of 16 basins that make up jeju island and is located on the east side of jeju island and belongs to jeju city on the southwest side of the gujwa basin the elevation gradually decreases radially outward from halla mountain peak at 1950 m above mean sea level hereafter all altitudes are based on mean sea level the highest altitude of the study area is 300 m jeju island was created by multiple volcanic eruptions during the cenozoic era the main aquifer s geological medium s depth in jeju island seogwipo formation is predominantly composed of hyaloclastite and clinker associated with basaltic lava flow therefore the groundwater flow is more likely to be a preferential flow governed by local influences rather than isotropically outward throughout the domain underneath the seogwipo formation a thick confining layer u formation exists composed of welded unconsolidated clay of marine origin the average depth of u formation in the eastern watershed of jeju island including the study area was reported to be about 150 m el koh et al 2008 most of jeju island s surface is covered with a highly permeable medium originating from lava flows or pyroclastic sediment deposits which facilitate the infiltration of precipitation based on the statistics from 2010 to 2019 the average annual precipitation of the area is 2143 3 mm and the average temperature is 15 7 c because of the maritime climate jeju island receives rain frequently and relatively evenly throughout the year with the highest rainfall of 297 9 mm month in august and the least in january 55 9 mm month on average where the standard deviation of the annual precipitation is 69 3 mm month of the precipitation more than 40 recharges groundwater annually hahn et al 1997 hamm et al 2005 won et al 2006 taking the previous observations and reports together with a consideration of high infiltration capacity of the targeted watershed a constant 0 42 was used as the recharge ratio to precipitation if the unsaturated zones maintain similar humidity throughout the year however for an area that does not have high surface permeability applying a constant ratio similar to this study may be inappropriate for the hydraulic property estimation via inverse analysis precipitation data from may 1 to october 31 2019 184 days were used in this study many aquifers in jeju island have extremely high hydraulic conductivity over a few hundred meters per day making it challenging to apply conventional well testing methods i e pumping and slug tests for obtaining hydraulic properties those aquifers are predominantly composed of highly permeable volcanic pyroclastic layers clinker layers and lava tubes originating from volcanic eruptions and lava flows consequently despite numerous monitoring wells in jeju island only a few hydraulic conductivity values are available a few studies have reported that the transmissivity value of aquifers in jeju island ranges from thousands hamm et al 2005 to tens of thousands m2 per day hahn et al 1997 won et al 2005 in the gujwa basin the jeju special self governing province monitors 15 monitoring wells fig 2 and table 1 but none have measured hydraulic conductivity values the hydraulic gradient observed in most monitoring wells is also less than 0 001 park et al 2011 obtained the monitoring wells transmissivities in the gujwa basin using hydrographs of the time series data from the monitoring wells and the estimated values range from 5000 to 33 000 m2 per day however since these estimates are pointwise values with sparse spatial distribution it is challenging to interpret the spatial distribution of permeability or aquifer connectivity across the gujwa basin based on the values because of the high hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer there is no hydraulic interference caused by artificial activities therefore the only factor that can change in the groundwater level across the watershed within a limited period in the study area is groundwater recharge because of precipitation in most monitoring wells whose data were used in this study fig 2 note that the groundwater level fluctuations occurred within one day of precipitation despite the considerable depth from the surface to the water table in the monitoring well average 83 3 m this rapid response of the water table to precipitation suggests that most of the unsaturated zones of the study area are highly permeable 2 3 groundwater flow model and case developments the model domain was set to the entire account basin discretized by 164 123 ew or x and ns or y therefore the numerical domain is 20 172 grid cells unknowns with 146 3 146 3 m dimensions of which 8412 cells are inactive all computations in this study were made for active cells only because the object to be estimated in this study is transmissivity the aquifer thickness was determined to 150 m with reference to koh et al 2008 and the aquifer was set as a water table aquifer in addition referring to park et al s 2011 study the storativity of the entire aquifer was uniformly determined to be 0 063 specific yield 0 06 specific storage coefficient 2 10 5 m 1 in general the distribution of precipitation or recharge rate is spatially heterogeneous however there is no prior analysis or measurement for this in the study area therefore the ratio of recharge from precipitation was set to 0 42 park et al 2011 uniformly over the study area because the aquifer thickness was minor compared to the horizontal scale of the basin the model domain was assumed to be a two dimensional region in the numerical model the domain boundary between the basin and ocean was set as a fixed head boundary condition and a no flow boundary condition was assigned for the boundary contacting the adjacent basin in this study the inverse analysis was performed to estimate the transmissivity of the entire domain using daily groundwater level data for 184 days may 1 october 31 2019 obtained for each monitoring well and daily precipitation records for that area thus in the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique 2760 head data were used and no transmissivity measurements were assimilated in the estimation the initial conditions for the groundwater flow simulation were formed by obtaining the initial groundwater level by performing steady state simulation by entering 4 93 10 3 m d the average recharge rate value a transient flow simulation over 184 days was performed to obtain the change in groundwater level over time using daily precipitation data and time stepping of one day the observed groundwater levels in the monitoring wells were compared with the estimated levels by obtaining the transient groundwater levels from the grid corresponding to the monitoring wells before using the actual groundwater level data from the observation wells several estimates were performed using hypothetical level data based on a synthetic aquifer to demonstrate the estimation performance of the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique since the empirical hydraulic conductivity distribution is unavailable for the study area it is appropriate to determine whether the applied inverse analysis has a reasonable estimation capability in this synthetic case the hypothetical hydraulic conductivity field was realized using an unconditional sequential gaussian simulation sgsim deutsch and journel 1992 the groundwater level for 184 days was computed at each monitoring well using the hydraulic conductivity field as an input parameter for the groundwater flow model which was used as the reference groundwater level in the estimation only the groundwater level data obtained from each observation well were used as input data for the inverse analysis it was assumed that the statistics of the hydraulic conductivity field including spatial statistics spatial correlation scales were unknown thus inaccurate statistics were used as the basis for the estimation as such not having prior information on the hydraulic conductivity field is commonplace in practice erdal and cirpka 2016 in the empirical data case time series data obtained from monitoring wells in the gujwa basin were directly applied to the inverse analysis in the overall estimation a computation system with a 2 5 ghz 28 core intel xeon w cpu and 768 gb of memory was used the operating system was mac os 11 and matlab 2020a with the parallel computing toolbox to create the inverse analysis code of this study since the forward model running in each generation was independent the computational efficiency through parallel computation using a 28 cores could be increased as a forward groundwater flow simulator modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 compiled for mac os was used without invasive code modification 2 4 performance metrics for estimates the model performance for each estimation was quantified by applying three metrics of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsec nash and sutcliffe 1970 rmse correlation coefficient cc and structural similarity index ssim wang et al 2004 among the metrics cc and ssim were only used when evaluating a synthetic case and were not used for estimation based on actual groundwater levels for which no estimation target exists the nsec was used to measure the fitness between the observed and estimated values defined as 8 nsec 1 1 n well i 1 n well j 1 n obs i h ij e h ij o 2 j 1 n obs i h ij o h i o 2 where h i o is the mean value of the observed groundwater levels in the i th monitoring well the nsec ranges from to 1 and nsec 1 indicates that the estimated groundwater levels are identical to the actual levels bounds of the models that indicate sufficient quality are given between 0 5 nsec 0 65 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 cc measured the grid based similarity of the pattern between the synthetic true and estimated hydraulic properties because the rmse and cc are limited in representing the degree of structural similarity ssim was adopted as an additional metric to quantify the similarity in the structural pattern between the empirical and estimated log hydraulic conductivity fields sánchez león et al 2020 the formulation of the ssim is given by 9 ssim 2 μ t μ e c 1 2 σ te c 2 μ t 2 μ e 2 c 1 σ t 2 σ e 2 c 2 where μ t and μ e are the means of the true and estimated log transformed hydraulic conductivity fields respectively σ t 2 and σ e 2 are the variances of the true and estimated hydraulic conductivity fields respectively and σ te is the covariance between the true and estimated fields for c 1 and c 2 of eq 9 an extremely small number of 2 22 10 16 was used 3 results 3 1 data used for inverse analysis in the study area 15 monitoring wells are available for inversely estimating the entire aquifer s transmissivity table 1 includes information about the monitoring wells and fig 2 shows the locations fig 3 a shows the groundwater hydrographs from the monitoring wells the mean static groundwater level observed at the monitoring wells is 1 32 m in terms of base level indicating the lowest groundwater levels during the observation period the maximum was observed at jdhd 4 with 4 23 m 12 of fig 3 a and the minimum was at jdhd 1 with 0 56 m 3 of fig 3 a the distance from the shoreline table 1 affects the base level of each monitoring well but not necessarily the groundwater level fluctuation characteristics in each observation well are different depending on the distance from the ground surface to the water table and hydraulic characteristics of the constituting medium among these wells jdhd 4 12 of fig 3 a and jdjd 5 15 of fig 3 a showed the most obviously observed delays in infiltration recharge since there are no empirical measurements of hydraulic conductivities available for the monitoring wells of the study area the analytical solution developed by park et al 2011 was modified and applied to estimate the log transformed hydraulic conductivity values which are included in table 1 their mean value was 6 46 and the range was approximately 5 9 7 1 however since these values were calculated based on a 1d assumption that limits the dimension of groundwater flow the actual hydraulic conductivity was probably overestimated therefore these values were used only as reference data they were not used to construct prior information for the inverse analysis 3 2 results of inverse analysis 3 2 1 synthetic aquifer case for the synthetic case a hydraulic conductivity field was synthesized using unconditional sgsim groundwater flow modeling was performed using the hydraulic conductivity distribution as input data to generate the groundwater level changes for 184 days at each monitoring well location for the sgsim realization the spatial correlation distance is 5 85 km in the x and y directions and the mean and variance of the log transformed hydraulic conductivity field are 5 222 185 3 m day and 1 586 respectively recharge to precipitation ratio rpr and storativity were 0 42 and 0 063 park et al 2011 in both the synthetic and actual cases of this study respectively whereas the impact of the uncertain rpr value was analyzed fig 3 b shows the groundwater level fluctuations at each monitoring well from the realization which were used as input information for the gpca es inverse analysis in this study the entire transient groundwater level history and not simply the temporal moment or the steady state water level was used for inverse analysis therefore more detailed aquifer hydraulic properties can be realized as the wells locate upstream within the basin the base level of groundwater and the maximum fluctuation of the groundwater level gradually increases in estimating hydraulic conductivity of synthetic aquifers it was assumed that prior information was insufficient due to limited investigations of the watershed and the values used to generate the synthetic aquifer were deliberately avoided thus the spatial correlation distance was arbitrarily set to be 1 2 km for the x and y directions and the log transformed hydraulic conductivity was assumed to be 2 7 39 m day fig 4 shows the reference and estimated log transformed hydraulic conductivity field and the corresponding groundwater level distributions at the end of the simulation where estimates were obtained from the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique using the groundwater level data in fig 3 b when visually compared the estimated and reference hydraulic conductivity fields are significantly similar the mean and variance of the log transformed estimated hydraulic conductivity field were 5 17 176 44 m day and 1 343 respectively the reduction in the standard deviation was attributed to the smoothing observed in the inverse analysis using parabolic partial differential equations the computation time required to obtain the inverse analysis result over 30 generations was 118 9 s and 237 modflow 2005 simulations were performed of this computation time 60 5 s were spent executing the forward model for grid by grid comparisons between the log transformed reference and estimated hydraulic conductivity fields the rmse was 1 129 and the cc was 0 715 the nsec value between the reference and estimated groundwater levels at the monitoring wells was 0 928 the results are shown in fig s1 in supplementary material i these results can also be visually confirmed through scatterplots in supplementary material i fig s2a is a scatterplot comparing log transformed hydraulic conductivity values in fig 4 a and b whereas fig s2b compares the groundwater levels in fig 4 c and d although there are some over or underestimations the reference and estimated groundwater levels at each monitoring correlate well although reasonable fitting of groundwater levels at the monitoring wells was achieved the estimated hydraulic conductivity distribution showed a more diffusive pattern than the reference this is a general limitation in inverse analysis using the groundwater flow model similar limitations can be observed in the inverse analysis of most diffusion problems kitanidis 2015 among the hydrographs fig s1 in supplementary material i the reference and estimated groundwater levels discrepancy is most evident for monitoring wells near the coast a nearby specified head boundary can produce estimation results less sensitive to parameter changes in an inverse analysis and limit the hydraulic information that can be obtained from groundwater level fluctuations in a monitoring well for the permeability spatial structure the ssim was 0 705 suggesting that the estimate and reference have excellent structural similarity note that the estimation quality is reasonable even though the hydraulic conductivity field s expected mean and spatial correlation scales used as prior information were significantly different from those of the reference in conventional inverse analysis relying on the local optimization method prior information about the correlation scales sensitively affects the estimation quality mu et al 2020 whereas in the gpca es inverse analysis based on global optimization estimation quality is less dependent on prior information s quality for areas that have not been extensively investigated no prior information applies to the inverse analysis therefore the observations in this case study indicate that the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique can be used in realistic situations where prior information is unavailable or inaccurate fig 5 shows some of the initial and final principal components that make up initial and final estimates ordered from the largest to smallest singular value from pcs 1 8 the initial principal components were obtained from the covariance function used for composing the initial covariance matrix whereas the final principal components were the results of their adaptation over 30 generations to the information provided observed hydrographs at monitoring wells since the gpca es technique seeks principal components that can reproduce an optimal state within a highly parametrized state dimension using conditioning information the principal components especially pc 1 of the final principal components have greater similarity to the reference and estimated hydraulic conductivity fields than the initial principal components principal components with large singular values change through adaptation over generations and show different structures than the initial since this adaptation of principal components is already contained within the algorithm gpca es does not require a separate process to estimate spatial variability parameters such as correlation scales and their orientations fig 6 shows the changes of estimation uncertainty after estimation over 30 generations the uncertainty maps were obtained by extracting the diagonal components of the normalized covariance matrix using computation based on the initial and final pcs representing a relative uncertainty distribution rather than an absolute distribution this relative uncertainty indicates the potential for an estimation to be inaccurate the initial relative uncertainty map is based on the employed covariance function and has a relatively even value distribution throughout the domain the final uncertainty map is a distribution of relative values obtained from estimations over 30 generations and unlike the initial distribution high values are concentrated in some locations in fig 6 b the relatively high values in the northwestern part of the domain have a shape similar to the high hydraulic conductivity structure estimated in fig 4 b the pcs of the final generation determine this final relative uncertainty which is determined from the interrelationships of spatial information and location of the monitoring well providing constraining information if monitoring wells and observed groundwater level data exist in the center of the high value part in fig 6 b and are reflected in the inverse analysis the high relative uncertainty can be reduced therefore the relative uncertainty distribution map as fig 6 could determine the additional wells within the domain notably the estimation uncertainty distribution evaluated by gpca es slightly differed from the existing bayesian regression based uncertainty distribution uncertainties evaluated by bayesian regression methods are sensitive to the data density whereas the uncertainty of gcpa es was sensitive to the difference between the initially provided prior information and the final estimate because several factors affecting the permeability of the surface and unsaturated zones can affect groundwater recharge because of precipitation obtaining a representative value over a large area might involve a large amount of uncertainty although the spatial variation of the groundwater recharge amount might not be large in the study area because of the flat topography with a constant slope to the shoreline the homogeneous surface and unsaturated zone medium and the absence of surface covering could produce inaccurately estimated recharge amounts therefore an attempt was made to determine the changed recharge amount s impact on the hydraulic conductivity estimation by increasing or decreasing the amount of groundwater recharge applied to the inverse analysis by 25 fig 7 shows the results of the inverse analyses by changing the rpr to 0 315 fig 7 a for hydraulic conductivity and fig 7 c for hydraulic head distributions and 0 525 fig 7 b and d where the reference rpr value is 0 42 for the case with an rpr of 0 315 the ssim between the reference and estimated hydraulic conductivity fields was 0 677 and for an rpr of 0 525 the ssim was 0 662 considering that the ssim was 0 705 for the estimation result using the correct rpr the ssims of both cases were decreased however the amount of ssim value reductions were insignificant also when visually comparing fig 7 a and b to fig 4 a respectively the change is not obvious with the critical structures high and low hydraulic conductivity being observed in both figures with the changed rpr values therefore the experiments of estimation by varying rpr values indicate that if the spatial rpr change is insignificant the inaccuracy within a certain range of the applied rpr does not significantly affect the structural estimation of the hydraulic conductivity field this finding confirms that groundwater level fluctuations can be used in estimating the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity at the basin scale by inverse analysis using the gpca es technique under situations similar to that in this study however after comparing figs 4 and 7 the uncertainty of the recharge rate can be said to significantly affect the local hydraulic conductivity estimation but not the regional structure estimation 3 2 2 empirical data the case study in section 3 2 1 confirmed that the hydraulic conductivity distribution of the basin scale domain could be reasonably estimated through inverse analysis using the gpca es technique in this section the distribution of hydraulic conductivity across the basin was inversely estimated using groundwater level data obtained from the monitoring wells in the gujwa basin since a groundwater flow model for the domain has already been established no significant change in this real estimation exists except for replacing the synthetic groundwater level time series data corresponding to each monitoring well location with actual data all other parameters were the same as in the previous case in the actual case the estimation consistency was shown by performing five estimations except for one estimate the remaining four estimates were included in supplementary material ii figs s3 through s6 to save space in this manuscript because of the stochastic nature of the gpca es technique each estimate shows general similarities in the overall spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity but has some differences in detail fig 8 shows the hydraulic conductivity and groundwater level distributions in the domain estimated by applying the groundwater hydrographs in fig 3 a unlike the previous case convergence reached earlier in the actual case and estimations were made over 15 generations in total 64 3 s were spent to obtain the estimation of fig 8 of which 32 7 s were spent for forward model execution with 125 model runs the prior information used for the estimation is the same as in the previous synthetic case by combining the results of fig 8 and supplementary material i figs s1 through s4 high hydraulic conductivity distribution appears in the central north and southeast domain and a low hydraulic conductivity distribution is concentrated in the west domain fig 8a accordingly the groundwater level contour shows a sparser distribution in areas with high hydraulic conductivity and dense distribution in areas with low hydraulic conductivity fig 8b because of the estimation the mean and variance of the domain s log transformed hydraulic conductivity were 5 44 230 4 m day and 1 51 respectively and the values are at least 2 92 18 5 m day and at most 8 23 3751 8 m day when comparing the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity calculated in table 1 the value obtained from the inverse analysis was approximately 1 5 lower in terms of the log transformed hydraulic conductivity in addition the hydraulic conductivity obtained by applying a 1d analytical solution for individual monitoring wells can significantly underestimate the actual hydraulic conductivity considering that the aquifer s thickness is assumed to be 150 m uniformly the mean transmissivity of the domain corresponds to 10 56 38 300 m2 day according to park et al 2011 the log transformed transmissivity of the eastern part of jeju island including the gujwa basin was 9 3 which was obtained from the values of each monitoring well in the area although both estimates rely on different methods the mean log transformed transmissivity estimated in this study is similar to the value in park et al 2011 that was based on the hydrograph of each monitoring well recalling that the estimated range between the minimum and maximum values underestimates the actual range because of the smoothing effect confirmed in the synthetic case the range of the actual hydraulic conductivity values should be larger than the estimated range 27 8 5664 6 m day in the real estimation unlike the previous synthetic case a limitation exists showing the observed and estimated groundwater levels consistency is the only way to represent the estimation results appropriateness quantitatively fig 9 compares the observed and estimated groundwater levels the nsec value obtained by combining the groundwater levels of all monitoring wells was 0 794 indicating that the estimated groundwater levels correlate well with the actual furthermore the rmse and cc between the observed and estimated groundwater levels were 0 93 m and 0 9 respectively considering that the standard deviation of the observed groundwater level is 2 06 m these values indicate high accuracy of the estimated groundwater levels overall estimation metrics indicate that the observed groundwater levels in the monitoring wells were well reflected in the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique however because the unsaturated zone is generally thick in the gujwa basin some monitoring wells have a time delay from precipitation to groundwater recharge fig 3 a hydrographs showing the observed groundwater level with rounded peaks in fig 9 are mostly where delays occur fig 10 shows the estimation results relative uncertainty the final relative uncertainty shows a higher distribution in the central north and southeast domain which roughly agrees with the estimated location of high hydraulic conductivity values therefore in planning an additional monitoring well in the gujwa basin it is expected that if monitoring wells are installed at locations with higher relative uncertainty the estimation accuracy can be improved through further inverse analysis using the gpca es technique based on the additional data since there is a limit to the method for quantitatively verifying the estimated results qualitative verification was performed using reports on geological features of the area that could be related to the aquifer s hydraulic properties previous explorations confirmed that the central north domain has a higher population of lava tubes than any other areas on jeju island among them the representative lava tubes are manjanggul and yongcheongul fig 11 shows the locations of the area s lava tubes and the interior of manjanggul although the information related to lava tubes was not reflected in the inverse analysis the location of lava tubes coincides with the higher hydraulic conductivity location in the central north of the model domain in fig 8 based on geophysical studies shon 2009 manjanggul should be interconnected with several lava tubes found in the downgradient direction of the groundwater flow groundwater floods some sections of these lava tubes near the shoreline therefore it contributes to facilitating the groundwater flow in this area also since the rocks that make up the aquifer s depth are the same as the rocks that make up the lava tubes more lava tubes in the aquifer s depth that has not been found could exist lava tubes are critical in regulating the hydraulic head in coastal areas furthermore since these lava tubes are critical for the intrusion of saltwater into inland aquifers it is critical to understand their distribution and spatial connectivity 3 2 3 incorporating the directional features in the spatial correlation structure although efforts have already been made to obtain the spatial distribution of the gujwa basin s hydraulic conductivity in section 3 2 2 no estimation has been made reflecting the orientation of critical geological features associated with the hydrogeological phenomenon of the domain the most representative geological features are the potentially interconnected lava tubes direction in the central north domain and the trachy basaltic lava flow s direction in the cenozoic quaternary period through the center of the domain toward the coast fig 11 from the north the lava tube is 41 6 clockwise and the trachy basalt lava flow is 51 1 clockwise from the north this information indicates that the major axis of the spatial correlation structure of the gujwa basin s hydraulic conductivity structure potential is 46 4 clockwise from the north reflecting this feature the initial principal components were constructed and the inverse analysis using the gpca es was performed to obtain the spatial hydraulic conductivity distribution of the domain s aquifer although the arbitrary determination of the correlation scales along the major and minor axes is similar as section 3 2 2 this section assumes that the major axis is longer than the minor axis and that the structure is oriented in a particular direction thus the major axis of the spatial correlation distance is assumed to be 7 31 km long lying 46 4 degrees clockwise from the north and the minor axis is perpendicular to the major axis with a length of 5 85 km where 7 31 km is 1 25 times of 5 85 km here the correlation scales given to the major and minor axes are arbitrarily determined to reflect anisotropy and does not accurately reflect those of the actual area except for the correlation structure all other parameters including prior information on hydraulic conductivity are identical to section 3 2 2 fig 12 shows an estimate of the hydraulic conductivity field and groundwater level distributions for the estimation similar prior information other than the spatial correlation structure was used in the inverse analysis and the time and number of forward model runs for estimation were similar to those in section 3 2 2 as shown in fig 12 the distribution of the estimated hydraulic conductivity field because of applying the correlation scale structure with an oblique angle is similar to the result of the previous section with no rotation in the spatial correlation structure however slight improvements occur in the estimation quality metrics and nsec value obtained by combining the groundwater levels of all monitoring wells 0 803 furthermore the rmse and cc between the observed and estimated groundwater levels were 0 91 m and 0 906 respectively this observation indicates that the actual groundwater level estimation performance slightly improved by incorporating the oblique correlation structure in the inverse analysis but the improvement degree was insignificant however visual comparison of the estimated spatial characteristics of the hydraulic conductivity field with fig 8 reveals that there are some structural differences the mean and standard deviation of the domain s log transformed hydraulic conductivity were 5 14 170 7 m day and 1 62 respectively and the values are at least 0 45 1 57 m day and at most 7 76 2345 m day considering that the aquifer s thickness is assumed to be 150 m uniformly the mean transmissivity of the domain corresponds to 10 16 25 783 m2 day the application shows that if the anisotropy of the spatial correlation structure of the hydraulic conductivity field is roughly informed through various geological features this information can be conveniently reflected in the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique however the addition of further prior information insignificantly improved the estimation quality because such an adaptation to the spatial structure of the estimation object was already included in the algorithm 3 2 4 joint estimation of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield in the previous cases it was assumed that the storativity has a constant value of 0 063 which is uniform for the entire domain for a geological medium with large porosity the local spatial variability of storativity has been reported to be smaller than that of the transmissivity meier et al 1998 thus applying the constant storativity reported in previous studies to the entire domain is reasonable however for a more sophisticated estimate it is better to assume that both transmissivity and storativity vary spatially franssen et al 1999 castagna et al 2011 therefore in the third case using actual data it was assumed that the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield had independent spatial distributions and were jointly estimated all parameters and assumptions used for this estimation are the same as those in subsection 3 2 3 except that storativity can vary spatially the principal components of generation 0 were assumed to be the same for both hydraulic conductivity and specific yield and they have different evolution pathways during the adaptation over generations meanwhile it was assumed that the specific storage coefficient was maintained as a constant value 2 10 5 m 1 throughout the entire domain the initial value used to estimate the specific yield was 0 08 and the range was 0 02 0 1 fig 13 shows the inversely estimated hydraulic conductivity and specific yield fields using gpca es in the joint estimation convergence reached 17 generations lasting for 115 6 s of which 52 s was spent for forward model execution and the number of model runs was 162 the increased estimation time compared to the previous estimations was due to an increase in the number of unknowns when compared visually the distribution of hydraulic conductivity was almost to the same as those of the two previous cases the mean and variance of the log transformed hydraulic conductivity of the domain were 5 36 212 7 m day and 1 93 respectively the values were in the range of 2 38 10 8 m day to 7 74 2298 6 m day the mean and variance of the log transformed specific yield were 2 78 0 062 and 0 149 respectively the values were in the range of 3 88 0 02 to 2 4 0 09 the mean specific yield obtained as a result of the inverse estimation was close to a previously reported value for this region 0 06 park et al 2011 the nsec value obtained by combining the groundwater levels of all monitoring wells was 0 817 and the rmse and cc between the observed and estimated groundwater levels were 0 88 m and 0 906 respectively these metrics indicated that the estimation quality improved compared to the previous cases but the degree of improvement was insignificant as in the previous case there was a tendency that the locations where many lava tubes were distributed in the central northern part of the domain fig 11a and also had high specific yields fig 13b despite the assumption of independence of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield in the estimation the distributions of two parameters in fig 13 show similar characteristics the estimated log transformed hydraulic conductivity and specific yield showed a high cc of 0 88 this observation indicated that the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the gujwa basin were regulated by the porosity 4 discussion and limitations of the proposed method the main message from this study is that the proposed method can determine the hydraulic characteristics of a basin scale aquifer using the time series data of the groundwater level furthermore it is the first study to characterize basin scale aquifers in realistic not synthetic regions through inverse analysis using natural stimuli of groundwater recharge most of the related study conducted so far was restricted to a synthetic aquifer using only the actual basin s geometry because of various limitations such as limited information on historical information on artificially imposed hydraulic stresses liu et al 2020 in this study basin scale aquifer characterization based on actual groundwater level data can be achieved because of the jeju island aquifer s characteristics which are hardly affected by manmade hydraulic interference the gpca es technique for inverse analysis in this study reduced the sensitivity of estimation quality to prior information using a global optimization technique and conducted estimations on the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties across a basin scale aquifer within a small computational time these features have practical advantages in characterizing basin scale aquifers using natural stimuli it is rare for large basins to be detailed enough to obtain accurate prior information to use in the inverse analysis it is challenging to exclude dependence on prior information but the inverse analysis using the gpca es technique used in this study has great significance in demonstrating reasonable estimations of large scale hydraulic property distributions even if the prior information is unavailable or largely inaccurate to further increase using the proposed method the gpca es technique is must extend to three dimensional spaces nevertheless since this study characterizes basin scale aquifers based on limited information the two dimensional gpca es technique can be sufficiently used the storativity was assumed to be uniform throughout the study area also the recharge rate was assumed to be uniform because of limited information when comparing estimated and actual groundwater levels the recharge rate probably varied locally and was mainly attributed to the unsaturated zone thickness and permeability in the empirical data case time delays between precipitation and groundwater level responses were observed in most monitoring wells these time lags were due to delayed drainage through the unsaturated zone in this study the impact of the unsaturated zone could not be considered because delayed groundwater recharge was not accounted for to incorporate the impact of the unsaturated zones into inverse analysis the calibrated richard s equation based groundwater flow model suk and park 2019 or darcy groundwater flow model combined with a delayed recharge flux model park et al 2021 should be adopted as a forward model which is beyond the scope of this study and will be considered in future studies although not covered in this study it is crucial to estimate groundwater recharge and hydraulic conductivity simultaneously several studies have been conducted on this subject franssen et al 2004 erdal and cirpka 2016 5 summary and conclusions this study investigated whether the hydraulic property distribution of a basin scale aquifer can be estimated inversely based on the groundwater level fluctuations caused by groundwater recharge therefore the gpca es developed by park 2020 was modified and applied as an inverse analysis method for basin scale hydraulic characterization the target area was the gujwa basin in jeju island and an inverse analysis was performed using groundwater level data from 15 monitoring wells in the area because of the limitations of the verification method for estimated results that might occur in the actual application this study first applied the method to synthetic data and estimated hydraulic property consequently it was confirmed that reasonable estimation could be made using the proposed method then the proposed method was used to estimate the aquifer s hydraulic property using the observed groundwater level obtained from the actual monitoring well although it was impossible to verify the estimated results similar to the synthetic case it is encouraging that the results corresponded to geological features that were not used as prior information furthermore the estimated values correspond to the distribution of the previously reported values the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties especially the interconnectivity of spatial structures can be for deriving potential locations of groundwater development or for planning groundwater remediation by optimizing the design of regulating contaminant migration in the aquifer therefore the hydraulic property estimation using the method proposed in this study can be used in managing groundwater over a large area furthermore it can be effectively applied to fields requiring large scale aquifer characterization such as oil and gas exploration and development determining locations of high level radioactive waste disposal sites and designing geological storage of carbon dioxide which could require replacing the forward model if the forward model is replaced with a simulator modeling physical phenomena based on petrophysical characteristics of the subsurface media the technique proposed in this study could be extended to geophysical inverse analysis and subsurface property estimation in this extended application developing a three dimensional gpca es technique is essential as confirmed in the actual groundwater level data note that the role of unsaturated zones delayed recharge flux can significantly affect the groundwater level fluctuations park and lee 2021 when using a forward model that cannot reasonably represent this phenomenon inaccuracies and uncertainties in the estimated aquifer s hydraulic properties are inevitable therefore in this study basin scale hydraulic property estimations using inverse analysis have limitations this limitation could be overcome by performing an inverse analysis based on the gpca es technique using a forward model incorporating the hydraulic role of an unsaturated zone and a study is currently being conducted for this purpose the method proposed in this study is directly applicable to groundwater basins where anthropogenic hydraulic interference is insignificant and continuous groundwater levels are observed through several monitoring wells such as the study area however for regions where the anthropogenic interference is critical the history of hydraulic stresses must be incorporated to estimate the hydraulic property correctly using the proposed method funding this research was supported by the national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea government msit nrf 2020r1a2c2013606 this

8178,study region sarawak malaysia study focus this paper presents a framework hyfflow designed to provide a systematic characterisation of river flow regimes hyfflow consists of four packages together yielding information on rainfall and flow patterns they include analyses to identify and characterise different types of high flow event based on their magnitude shape and duration and assessment of the timing and duration of periods of high and low flow hyfflow also includes assessment of temporal patterns seasonality and long term trends in rainfall and flow the characterisation provides a comprehensive baseline against which future changes can be assessed new hydrologic insights for the region hyfflow analyses indicated subtle and complex changes to long term hydro climatological conditions in the baleh catchment malaysia i analyses of the hydrograph indicated that there have been reductions in flow in the wet season but not at other times of the year and ii while there is no evidence of long term trends in precipitation across the catchment no change in monthly rainfall values over a 51 year period there has been an increase in the number of days each month with no rainfall in some sub catchments hyfflow analyses also identified four main types of high flow event in the baleh whose functional roles need to be assessed as part of future geomorphic and ecological studies keywords river discharge tropical rivers hydrograph shape functional flows dams 1 introduction maintaining natural flow variability has become a central tenet of the science related to sustainable river and catchment management and to environmental flows e flows this science can be traced back several decades from the early work on compensation and minimum maintained flows undertaken on the river tees in uk armitage 1977 through phabsim milhous et al 1984 and related habitat models such as meso habsim parasiewicz 2001 to the more holistic tools now used to support flow management in regulated rivers e g drift king et al 2003 benchmarking arthington 1998 the development of the natural flow paradigm richter et al 1997 has been pivotal to the evolution of this science with flow variability now seen as critical for maintaining both the physical and ecological integrity of streams and rivers the last few years have seen the emergence of so called functional flows ffs within the e flows literature yarnell et al 2015 the ideas that are central to ffs have been around for some time but their formalisation has helped crystalise the notion that specific flows are needed to support specific functions whether related to ecology e g upstream movement of salmonids during the pre spawning season malcolm et al 2012 geomorphic processes e g batalla and vericat 2009 meitzen et al 2013 or for socio economic purposes e g richter 2010 bruwer et al 1996 barbier and thompson 1998 postel and richter 2012 the fundamental ideas related to e flows and ffs are applicable to any river system but the challenges of developing them vary significantly from place to place to date ffs have been developed largely in regions with marked seasonal patterns of flow variability which have resulted in strong temporal rhythms to species life cycles and ecosystem processes e g palmer and ruhi 2019 hayes et al 2018 yarnell et al 2015 in mediterranean regions for example rivers may have very little or even no flow during the dry summer months garcia et al 2017 this seasonal rhythm influences the timing of sediment transport and associated channel change church 1995 as well as species phenologies alvarez and pardo 2005 in contrast tropical rivers are strongly monsoon driven their hydrological regimes reflect patterns of rainfall magnitude and timing that differ from those in temperate and mediterranean regions but also the much higher runoff coefficients of tropical catchments chong et al 2021 comprehensive ways of interrogating river flow data are of great value for helping to understand fluvial and ecological dynamics but are especially important in the tropics to help tease out any subtle or complex temporal rhythms that exist e g lázaro vázquez et al 2018 wohl et al 2012 ghosh and guchhait 2016 and to provide the comprehensive descriptions of baseline conditions that are needed as the starting point for setting e flows and ffs a number of approaches and indices for hydrological characterisation exist these were recently reviewed by jumani et al 2020 who separated indices into those which are descriptive and those which are prescriptive descriptive indices provide a characterisation of the flow regime while prescriptive ones focus on recommending specific flows or flow regimes as part e flows or ffs most existing approaches are prescriptive jumani et al 2020 and while the descriptive ones that exist are useful they each tend to focus only on one or two aspects of the hydrograph e g variability rather than multiple traits simultaneously thus there remains scope for more comprehensive ways of analysing flow series bringing together features of several existing indices and approaches to improve characterisation of hydrological regimes this paper presents a structured framework to help understand multiple aspects of river hydrological regimes and support flow management in regulated rivers the framework hydrological characterisation to support functional flows hyfflow yields a characterisation of flows over several timescales and brings together a variety of complementary analytical methods and descriptors many of the descriptors used within hyfflow have been found to be ecologically relevant e g multiples of the median flow that influence invertebrate community structure gibbins et al 2001 and or are recognised as being important for geomorphological processes e g the shape and magnitude of high flow events thus while on its own hyfflow cannot be used to set e flows or ffs i e it cannot assess ecological or geomorphological functions or needs it provides a description of the flow regime that is based on traits known to influence physical and ecological processes therefore hyfflow can be used in two ways i to provide a holistic characterisation of the flow regime against which future changes can be assessed ii to identify particular aspects of the hydrograph whose specific ecological and or geomorphic function needs to be assessed to support development of functional flows hyfflow is applied here to the river baleh a meso scale catchment on the island of borneo malaysia a hydroelectric dam is currently being constructed on the baleh due for completion in 2026 but like many tropical rivers limited ecologic and geomorphic data exist comprehensive analysis of existing flow data is therefore important to understand pre dam baseline conditions in as much detail as possible and specifically to provide information on flow traits whose functional significance can become the focus of subsequent geomorphic and ecological studies the paper illustrates the value of hyfflow for providing this information while it is applied here to the baleh it is considered a generic approach applicable to any river 2 hyfflow framework and work packages 2 1 overview hyfflow is based on analysis of existing discharge and rainfall data thus as with all approaches to characterisation e g indicators of hydrological alteration confidence in conclusions drawn from the various analyses that make up hyfflow depend on the duration of the data record ideally long data time series decadal of hourly or daily values are available depending on data availability it may be inappropriate to apply some of the analyses hyfflow provides a way to understand flow characteristics over several timescales i the event scale based on the traits of individual events ii seasonal scale and iii annual and interannual scales flow variability over these timescales is known to influence ecological geomorphic and bio geochemical processes in riverine systems yarnell et al 2015 and so maintaining natural patterns of this variability is important for maintaining river integrity when flows are altered or modified a specific focus of hyfflow is the statistical identification and characterisation of different types of hydrological event and assessment of their frequency and timing the framework is divided into 4 packages fig 1 each consisting of a number of analyses designed to yield information on different aspects of the flow regime the following sections provide details of the rationale and analyses that form respective packages these are followed by an example to show how it has been applied to the river baleh fig 2 application of the framework leads to the production of a large number of plots and data tables for brevity only a small number of these are presented here the remainder are given in the appendix section package 1 fundamentals of the flow regime package 1 provides fundamental information on the river flow regime as well as the links between rainfall and flow magnitude this package is largely descriptive with most of the outputs being plots designed to represent fundamental information on the regime they include basic time series plots flow duration curves flood frequency plots and assessment of the magnitude of and seasonal variation in baseflow baseflows are calculated using bfi 3 of hydrooffice 2010 software which uses the local minimum method gregor 2010 the analysis of rainfall includes some formal statistical tests to assess rainfall runoff relationships and when data for multiple stations are available tests to assess variation in rainfall and rainfall runoff relations package 2 flow metrics this package uses a variety of metrics to represent key aspects of the regime quantitatively it uses the indicators of hydrological alteration iha software developed by the nature conservancy tnc 2007 to compute a range of flow metrics these metrics are based on work by poff and ward 1989 the metrics capture aspects of the flow regime s magnitude as well as the timing and duration of certain flow events application of the iha software yields a simple table of metric values that identify key aspects of the regime for example q90 90th percentile is used in iha to define low flow and q95 95th percentile to define extreme low flow iha also provides a simple classification of high flow events based on standard flow percentiles and recurrence intervals what are termed high flows are events whose magnitude exceeds 75 of all daily flow values in the record the small flood threshold is the 2 year recurrence interval while large floods have a 10 year recurrence interval the iha statistics are a useful way of describing a river s flow regime in ways that have been shown to be ecological relevant richter et al 1996 for instance extreme low flows e g flows equalled or exceeded 95 of the time q95 enable recruitment of certain floodplain species and may concentrate prey into limited areas to benefit predators the nature conservancy 2009 such flows will expose sediment on gravel and sand bars habitat that is important for many rare species sadler et al 2004 conversely the magnitude and timing of high flows can be important as such events can act as disturbances that influence community structure gibbins et al 2001 or the timing of life cycle events lytle and poff 2004 overbank flows are recognised ff components that support a broad suite of physical and ecological processes including the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity in space and time controlling patterns of riparian succession and providing cues for fish reproduction and migration yarnell et al 2020 for hyfflow statistics representing high and low flow magnitude timing and duration form the starting point for a more sophisticated analysis of hydrograph shape undertaken as part of package 3 the final analysis included in package 2 involves computing colwell s index colwell 1974 this quantifies the predictability of a flow regime and is particularly useful within the context of seasonality e g highly seasonal regimes such as found in mediterranean regions may be highly predictable predictability p has two separable components constancy c and contingency m which have profoundly different implications for the ecology and evolution of biological systems fretwell 1972 macarthur 1972 colwell 1974 maximum predictability can be attained as a consequence of either complete constancy complete contingency or a combination of constancy and contingency with respect to time colwell 1974 when used in the analysis of streamflow c is a measure of the degree to which streamflow is the same constant and m is a measure of the degree to which the annual pattern of flow repeats milhous 2012 these elements of predictability can be compared to other rivers colwell s index can be computed using the r package hydrostats r core team 2013 package 3 hydrograph shape larger events serve important geomorphic functions by initiating sediment transport and topographic change in river reaches church 2002 and may also be ecologically important death et al 2015 benda et al 2004 the focus of package 3 is the statistical identification and characterisation of these larger events potentially important event traits are their peak magnitude duration and rates of change on the rising and falling limbs as well as their timing package 3 involves identifying all events within the iha high flow event classes i e high flows small floods and large floods over the data period and then using a sample of these for a full analysis of their traits depending on the user and focal river additional high flow classes may be delineated and included in the analysis for example flows of a lower magnitude than iha defined high flows may still serve important geomorphic or ecological functions so such events may need to be included similarly it may not be operationally possible to create managed flows from dams at the magnitude of the default three iha high flow classes so additional smaller classes may be developed to ensure inclusion of events small enough to be released from the dam for instance in the case of the baleh a fourth class was created to allow inclusion of events greater than the median flow but less than the iha high flow threshold see section 3 2 package 3 requires a large enough number of events across all classes to allow meaningful analysis of their traits a minimum sample size of approximately 100 events is suggested for this in the baleh for example there was a total of 1949 events within the four high flow classes over the 51 year data period a stratified random method was used to select a sample of events from this total designed to yield a frequency of events of each class in the sample that matched that in the full data record events chosen to represent each class were selected randomly from all events belonging to that class fig a1 appendix a shows the breakdown of the sample by event class for the baleh the analysis of the event shapes uses multivariate methods proposed by hannah et al 2000 and fong et al 2016 these methods involve characterising each event using the discharge values from their start to end points thus shape is defined using the discharge time series that captures their rising limb peak time at peak falling limb and duration ideally hourly discharge data are used for this analysis but in some cases only mean daily values may be available availability of only mean daily values creates some problems for analysis of shorter events e g events of just one or two days duration cannot be analysed meaningfully in this way careful judgement is needed about inclusion of shorter events when mean daily values are used for example in the case of the baleh events less than 5 days were excluded from the multivariate analyses and characterised differently further details below the analysis of shape has three stages first for each sample event discharge magnitude for each time interval over its duration is used as the input for an agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc this clustering identifies events of similar shape objectively with these clusters becoming the event types second simple envelope plots of each type identified by the ahc are then produced to produce these plots hydrographs for all events within a given type are plotted together with non linear generalised additive models gams fitted to the upper and lower bounds 10th and 90th quantiles to create a smoothed curve that defines the limits of each type so as to not loose any short events omitted from the clustering these are plotted together in an additional diagram with gams then fitted to model upper and lower bounds of the scatter on this diagram gams can be fitted in the mgcv package within r wood 2011 or a number of other software packages finally following hannah et al 2000 and fong et al 2016 principal components analysis pca is applied to the same data and format used for the ahc i e discharge at each time interval over the duration of each event from this pca factor loadings on the most useful pca components highest explanatory power are plotted to provide a complementary insight into event shape this allows assessment of the key ways in which event types differ package 4 long term trends in flow and rainfall regimes this package is focussed on looking for evidence of any changes in rainfall and hydrological regime it provides an objective analysis of inter annual and long term trends the package produces 2 main outputs a assessment of trends in flow and rainfall magnitude and frequency b assessment of change in the whole hydrological regime discharge and rainfall data are required daily or monthly a uses standard statistical tools mann kendall test to look for evidence of linear and monotonical trends in flow and rainfall at monthly and seasonal scales seasonal mann kendall test allows for time series within which there may be seasonal rhythms nested within any longer term directional linear change this test is applied to monthly discharge and rainfall values over the available time series standard mann kendall tests are also applied for seasons of interest these seasons depend on location for instance in the case of the baleh theywere defined using wet and dry periods connected to the monsoon and so the analyses assessed long term changes in mean discharge for the wet and dry seasons b uses pca to characterise and compare the regime of each year each year is characterised using a variety of flow metrics with the pca of these metric values allowing assessment of the similarity of each year as well as the identification of the most useful metric s for such comparisons termed key metrics as they are the features of the regime that vary most between the years gams are then used to look for evidence of long term trends in i the annual values of each key metric and ii the annual regime overall using pca component 1 scores for each year standard metrics that represent various aspects of flow magnitude frequency duration timing variability and rate of change are used for b a large number of potential metrics exist e g see olden and poff 2003 so a subset of these can be chosen to reflect the particular purposeor focus of the study once metrics are chosen and computed an initial pca is used to identify and remove redundant and correlated metrics the pca is then re run with the remaining subset of metrics for instance in the case of the baleh 17 of the initial 26 metrics were used in the final pca ahc is then used to identify groups of years with similar regimes with these groups then differentiated on the final pca the gams fitted to the pca component 1 scores for each year e g in the case of the baleh 51 years pick out evidence of rhythms cycles or linear trends in the annual regime gams are also applied to the annual values of the key metrics metrics with the longest vectors on the pca these gams provide insights into whether values of any of the metrics e g q90 are changing over time the degrees of freedom edf in the gams were allowed to vary to allow the models to find the best shape to represent any temporal pattern over the data period 3 hyfflow application to the river baleh 3 1 the baleh catchment the baleh fig 2 is one of two main sub catchments within the rajang basin and has a catchment area of 5 625 km2 the rajang basin is approximately 50 000 km2 with elevations exceeding 2000 m asl floodplains when present are of limited area staub and gastaldo 2000 geology consists of sandstone and shale from the belaga and nyalau formations ling et al 2016 soils are mainly red yellow podzols based on the sarawak classification system tie 1982 landcover in the baleh catchment is predominantly hill forest comprising mixed dipterocarp and secondary forest annual total rainfall is among the highest in sarawak exceeding 5000 mm in most years there is usually an average of around 250 days of measurable precipitation per year temperature is high throughout the year with a mean annual daily maximum temperature of 33 c flow data from the telok buing gauging station are used to illustrate hyfflow the data record commences in 1967 and extends until 2017 to complement discharge data seven weather stations provide information on rainfall though for varying periods and durations the locations of gauging and weather stations along with respective data are shown in fig 2 3 2 hyfflow outputs in this section we present some of the key outputs from each package and use these to illustrate the characteristics patterns and trends evident in the flow and rainfall data for the baleh these findings are discussed within the context of climate and landcover change as well as the operation of baleh dam in section 4 package 1 fig a2 supplementary material shows the basic discharge data for telok buing along with rainfall for the closest upstream weather station nanga entawau figs 3 5 and figs a3 a5 give the hyfflow outputs used to represent the fundamental aspects of the flow regime while fig a6 shows rainfall runoff relations degree of seasonality plots of median monthly discharge and rainfall data figs 3 and a3 show that the baleh has a monsoonal tropical regime rather than a seasonal tropical one with the wet months being november to march and dry months may to august the strength of seasonality is quantified further in package 2 using colwell s index for which see below baseflows vary considerably in the baleh figs 4 and a4 but typically are less than 500 m3 s in the dry months and 500 800 m3 s in wet months flow duration and flood frequency curves flow duration curves for each year of record are shown in fig 5 a with the inset showing the long term values each year is plotted to help visualise interannual variation in the flow regime the long term median flow for the baleh is 873 m3 s with a 90th percentile of 376 m3 s and a 10th percentile of 1915 m3 s there is however significant variability in the annual flow duration curves with e g q50 varying from around 900 m3 s to 2000 m3 s for the period of record 1970 and 2014 represent extreme high and low flow years respectively the flow value corresponding to a 5 year return period event for baleh river is approximately 4200 m3 s with the exceedance probability being 20 with a 10 year return period event being equal to approximately 5000 m3 s with the exceedance probability being 10 fig 5 b rainfall runoff relations rainfall in the baleh varies significantly between the weather stations included in the analysis anova df 6 2476 f 13 773 p 0 05 results from post hoc tests show that nanga merit and kapit new headworks sites differ from the other five locations but the others do not differ from each other fig a5 these two drier stations are the most westerly ones and both sit just outside the baleh sub catchment but within the rajang fig 2 rainfall runoff plots indicate similar relations between discharge at telok buing and precipitation at various points in the catchment table 1 and fig a6 thus there is no evidence that rainfall magnitude in different parts of the catchment produces a different response in discharge at telok buing package 2 iha metrics table 2 shows a subset of the iha flow metric values for the baleh this subset includes the timing of the two low flow percentiles defined using the days that respective lowest flow events occur on e g the day that the lowest flow event below q95 occurred on these flows are on julian day 216 august and 212 july both of which are in the dry part of the year however it is evident from the hydrograph fig 4 that flows drop below q95 and q90 throughout the year and from both the hydrograph and table 2 that such periods are short lived i e only 2 3 days in duration in general the river is rain driven and does not experience extended periods at low or baseflow at a particular time of the year colwell s index fig 6 shows the predictability of the baleh flow regime relative to other rivers the baleh has an overall predictability of p 0 5 similar to the other tropical monsoonal river included in the plot lower mekong p 0 32 the other tropical rivers in the plot are seasonal ones while the remainder are temperate rivers the baleh predictability is in upper quartile of the tropical rivers but is dominated by constancy i e it has very low contingency this shows that the baleh has a greater degree of similar streamflow c and lower degree of repeated annual pattern m note that only a few calculations of predictability have been published for mediterranean rivers average p is 0 55 and none of these papers reported the two elements separately package 3 event types and their shapes the ahc fig a7 of the 86 individual events analysed generated 5 high flow event types consisting of 3 main groups and 2 single events that did not fit within the main groups these event types are also shown in the pca fig a8 the envelope plots fig 7 of these event types help illustrate key differences in respective magnitudes durations and rates of change type a represents events that rise sharply peaking at around 7 9 days at between 100 900 m3 s above respective time baseflow levels and lasting for around 20 days type b represents very similar events to type a in terms of duration but which have higher peaks up to around 2500 m3 s above baseflow that rise and fall more rapidly type c events are rather similar in magnitude to type b but are longer up to 30 days and more pointed than the dome shape that characterises type b the single events shown in fig 7 d e do not fit the other classes because of their complex shape event d has a double peak while e rises sharply but takes some time to return to baseflow the short events 5 days not included in the formal ahc and pca analyses are also shown as an envelope plot in the fig 7 f these short events vary in magnitude from less than 100 to 500 m3 s above baseflow and can be considered as being a set of low magnitude short lived events most 68 of the variability in the sampled baleh hydrographs could be represented on the first four components of the pca fig 7 g j shows the factor loadings for these four components with values on each day d indicating the main ways that events differ f1 fig 7 g is the major gradient in the data pca the maximum loading on f1 is from d19 d24 this means that the main way in which events differ is in their magnitude at days 19 24 in effect while some events are still going on beyond 19 24 days by this time others have ended and have dropped back to baseflow thus the primary division of events separates those shorter than and those longer than 19 24 days this division is evident from the envelope plots fig 7 a f fig 7 b shows event types shorter than 19 24 days while fig 7 c e show those longer than this maximum loading on f2 the next most important dimension is around day 9 this separates events according to their flow discharge on day 9 11 and clearly helps separate event types a and b in fig 7 with a having a lower discharge on this day fig 8 shows seasonal patterns in the occurrence of events belonging to each of the four event types described above the two single events are omitted event types a and f show the clearest seasonal patterns type a is bimodal with peaks of occurrence in weeks 21 25 late may to early june and then 47 52 november and december while type f occurs most frequently during weeks 22 31 late may to late june the other types have more variable less clear seasonal patterns though type b events tend to occur more commonly towards the end of the year type c the higher magnitude events occur mainly in the final third of the year week 31 onwards and much less commonly in the dry months of may to september weeks 19 40 package 4 trends in rainfall and flow there were no significant trends in monthly mean or maximum monthly rainfall at any of the 7 rainfall stations tables 3 and 4 hence there was no evidence of gross long term changes in rainfall magnitude across the catchment as a whole at the seasonal level there were no significant trends in rainfall in either the wet or dry periods at any of the weather stations more recent rainfall data were available for nanga entawau but analysis of data for this station indicated there was also no evidence of any change over the longer period 1970 2019 p 0 455 nevertheless a change in rainfall frequency was evident though this varied spatially across the baleh for the 4 stations located in the west of the catchment there was a decrease in the number of days each month with no rainfall whereas for the easterly nanga entawau station there was an increase in the number of no rainfall days table 4 there was a significant decrease p 0 05 in discharge in the baleh over the 51 year period fig a9 however this varied seasonally with a significant decrease evident in the wet months but not the dry months fig a10 change in the whole hydrological regime table a1 shows the full set of flow metrics produced for analysis of long term trends in the hydrological regime these were all computed from the long term discharge time series for the baleh then analysed using ahc and pca fig 9 the three classes of year identified by the ahc are colour coded in fig 9 a class 1 represents years with lower flows sitting at the negative extreme of several flow magnitude metrics annual q50 annual max q annual q16 and number of times flow exceeds q16 classes 2 and 3 are generally higher flow years the difference between these related to flow variability class 2 is more variable sitting towards positive end of the vectors for flow cv and sd the direction of the vectors in fig 9 b indicates how the classes differ most of the vectors were of similar length with only those for aspects of timing tq 5 tq 16 tq 84 tq 90 short and hence less important pca factor 1 scores fig 10 for each year showed a significant linear trend over time p 0 05 edf in gams of 1 table 5 this shows that there has been a change in the flow regime of the baleh over the last 51 years factor 1 scores have reduced over time indicating a shift to a lower flow regime this multivariate analysis of the whole regime therefore corroborates the mann kendall test results applied to the raw discharge magnitude data significant trends were evident in the values of ycv and anmmax fig 10 and table 5 the high edf values indicate non linear cyclical patterns rather than linear or directional trends thus the models indicate that there were intra annual differences in terms of flow variability and magnitude with cycles of wet and dry years no significant patterns were evident in nq90 or nq50 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 hyfflow a systematic amalgamation of tools and metrics hyfflow is a framework designed to provide a comprehensive description of the flow regime of a river it represents a systematic amalgamation of what were previously separate ways of analysing hydrological time series while developed initially to provide a baseline characterisation of the tropical river baleh prior to dam construction hyfflow can be applied to any river type and can be useful within other contexts e g understanding baseline conditions prior to deforestation extracting as much information as possible from existing data may be particularly important in data scarce regions such as in tropical countries where human pressures on river systems are great jumani et al 2020 hyfflow consists of a set of packages that characterise various components of the flow regime including objective identification of event types whose functional significance either for geomorphic or ecological processes can be investigated as part of targeted follow up studies this structured approach to characterisation complements and or could be used as part of existing holistic frameworks such as eloha poff et al 2010 hyfflow includes an assessment of change while some existing approaches allow explicitly for this e g ecodeficit ecosurplus concept dundee hydrological regime alteration method annual proportional flow deviation gehrke et al 1995 black et al 2005 vogel et al 2007 hyfflow differs in its approach it uses a combination of time series analysis to assess trends in flow magnitude but notably also uses multivariate analyses to assess changes to the whole regime and determine which aspects of the regime have changed 4 2 hydrology of the river baleh time series analyses package 4 indicated long term changes in flow in the baleh with reductions in discharge during the wet months of the year this is broadly consistent with patterns reported by sa adi et al 2017a who studied a number of catchments across borneo including the upper rajang the cause s of this long term trend in the baleh are unclear there was no change in rainfall magnitude over the same period though there was some change in rainfall frequency indicated by increases in the number of days with no rainfall of the catchments modelled by sa adi et al 2017b the baleh was predicted to experience the least change in rainfall 1 1 1 9 by the end of this century there has been no major change in landcover in the baleh with forest cover being reduced by less than 4 over the last 20 years lum unpublished mres thesis thus neither rainfall nor landcover change provide a clear explanation for the hydrological change sarawak is however experiencing an increase in temperature in the range of 0 1 0 15 c decade sa adi et al 2017a and the increase in evapotranspiration associated with this might help explain the long term reduction in flows in the wet season in the baleh flows in the baleh vary considerably over shorter timescales there is marked inter annual variability in discharge with q50 for example varying from 1000 m3 s to more than 2000 m3 s between years the baleh has a monsoonal tropical climate rather than a seasonal one with wet months of november to march and dry months of may to september baseflows are somewhat higher in the wet periods approx 700 m3 s than dry periods approx 500 m3 s periods of low flow q90 and q95 occur throughout the year and tend to be very short lived lasting only 2 3 days four main types of high flow event occur in the baleh as well as some idiosyncratic events that do not fit any of these main types the main types differ in terms of their magnitude and duration event types a and f respectively those up to approximately 1000 m3 s above baseflow and lasting approximately 3 weeks and those up to 500 m3 s above baseflow lasting up to five days have quite consistent patterns of timing during the year the other two event types are larger up to 2500 m3 s above baseflow and differ mainly in their duration and shape slope of rising and recession limbs type b are around 20 days duration and type c around 30 days the long term data indicate that the timing of these sustained periods of high flow is rather less consistent than types a and f flow predictability p of the baleh computed using colwell s index is moderate and within the range of other tropical rivers notably though it has a low value of contingency indicating that temporal rhythms are not strong this reflects the fact that seasonality in the baleh while evident to some degree is not marked and that both high and low flows occur at any time during the year 4 3 functional flows and dam operation in the baleh the dam currently being constructed on the baleh is scheduled for completion in 2026 detailed information on species flow requirements and life cycles is missing for the baleh a common problem in tropical regions so it is not currently possible to apply habitat models e g phabsim bovee 1985 to develop operational regimes based directly on ecological criteria similarly knowledge of fluvial processes in the baleh is insufficient to identify flows that serve important habitat forming functions and which therefore need to be maintained in order to support geomorphic integrity the insights into the hydrological regime of the baleh provided by hyfflow are therefore important as they provide a clear focus for geomorphic and ecological studies most notably a key task for the baleh is now to undertake work to understand the functional roles of each of the main event types identified e g how they influence scour sediment transport and associated changes in habitat bed sedimentary and topographic conditions the hyfflow outputs showing the timing of occurrence of these events provide a clear template for scheduling dam releases to mimic those events which prove to have important functions the largest natural events in the baleh those greater than 2000 m3 s event types b and c exceed the combined release capacity of the dam turbines 885 m3 s so may be lost post impoundment unless they are generated by rainfall in the lower parts of the catchment event types a and f however could be simulated by artificial releases designed to mimic their shape as per fig 7 these two types unlike the larger ones have rather clear seasonal patterns of occurrence so releases could potentially be made to mimic their timing as well as shape the hyfflow analyses also provide some insights into operational rules for managing lower flows the timing of monsoon periods in the baleh gives rise to lower mean monthly flows on the months may to august inclusive with somewhat lower baseflows during these months than the remainder of the year while the lowest absolute flows also tend to occur during this period it is evident from the hydrograph fig 4 that flows drop below q95 and q90 throughout the year such periods tend to be short lived with durations of 2 3 days and the river does not experience extended periods at low or baseflow at any particular time of the year thus sustained periods releasing only compensation flow from the dam or operating only one turbine 177 m3 s would create a very unnatural hydrograph one possible constraint on flow management in the baleh is that the observed long term trends in flow may impact water storage and hence the capacity for making ff releases even if water is available to deliver a set of designed ffs providing these in a fixed form magnitude shape may be problematic if geomorphically the river is adjusting to a slow directional change in flows similarly as landcover change affects runoff and fine sediment loads such change may alter the geomorphic effectiveness of specific magnitude ff events that were initially designed under different rainfall runoff relations thus the effects of any ffs would need to be monitored to ensure they continue to provide the functions intended 5 conclusions river systems globally face multiple pressures so ways of characterising flow regimes are important for helping to understand these pressures and developing management programmes recent research hayes et al 2018 shows that multiple elements of the natural annual hydrograph are necessary to maintain the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems and their related components i e river channel riparian areas floodplain and groundwater water management must therefore ensure that all flow regime components e g mean flows flow pulses floods occur in a correctly timed fashion with the right frequency and duration and rate of change between flow seasons yarnell et al 2015 hyfflow provides a comprehensive characterisation of flow regimes and of any changes to these it does not provide management prescriptions but rather is a system that allows for characterisation and quantification in ways that are likely relevant to geomorphic processes and ecological integrity the work presented here for the baleh is the starting point for post impoundment flow management designed to maintain physical and ecological integrity hyfflow identified distinct flow types and seasonal patterns to their occurrence with for instance short periods of low flows happening throughout the year and events of moderate size types a and f occurring in the middle and end months of the year this insight helps set a clear suite of research questions for more focussed process based studies that are needed to help design an operational regime for the dam credit authorship contribution statement xin yi chong conceptualization

8178,study region sarawak malaysia study focus this paper presents a framework hyfflow designed to provide a systematic characterisation of river flow regimes hyfflow consists of four packages together yielding information on rainfall and flow patterns they include analyses to identify and characterise different types of high flow event based on their magnitude shape and duration and assessment of the timing and duration of periods of high and low flow hyfflow also includes assessment of temporal patterns seasonality and long term trends in rainfall and flow the characterisation provides a comprehensive baseline against which future changes can be assessed new hydrologic insights for the region hyfflow analyses indicated subtle and complex changes to long term hydro climatological conditions in the baleh catchment malaysia i analyses of the hydrograph indicated that there have been reductions in flow in the wet season but not at other times of the year and ii while there is no evidence of long term trends in precipitation across the catchment no change in monthly rainfall values over a 51 year period there has been an increase in the number of days each month with no rainfall in some sub catchments hyfflow analyses also identified four main types of high flow event in the baleh whose functional roles need to be assessed as part of future geomorphic and ecological studies keywords river discharge tropical rivers hydrograph shape functional flows dams 1 introduction maintaining natural flow variability has become a central tenet of the science related to sustainable river and catchment management and to environmental flows e flows this science can be traced back several decades from the early work on compensation and minimum maintained flows undertaken on the river tees in uk armitage 1977 through phabsim milhous et al 1984 and related habitat models such as meso habsim parasiewicz 2001 to the more holistic tools now used to support flow management in regulated rivers e g drift king et al 2003 benchmarking arthington 1998 the development of the natural flow paradigm richter et al 1997 has been pivotal to the evolution of this science with flow variability now seen as critical for maintaining both the physical and ecological integrity of streams and rivers the last few years have seen the emergence of so called functional flows ffs within the e flows literature yarnell et al 2015 the ideas that are central to ffs have been around for some time but their formalisation has helped crystalise the notion that specific flows are needed to support specific functions whether related to ecology e g upstream movement of salmonids during the pre spawning season malcolm et al 2012 geomorphic processes e g batalla and vericat 2009 meitzen et al 2013 or for socio economic purposes e g richter 2010 bruwer et al 1996 barbier and thompson 1998 postel and richter 2012 the fundamental ideas related to e flows and ffs are applicable to any river system but the challenges of developing them vary significantly from place to place to date ffs have been developed largely in regions with marked seasonal patterns of flow variability which have resulted in strong temporal rhythms to species life cycles and ecosystem processes e g palmer and ruhi 2019 hayes et al 2018 yarnell et al 2015 in mediterranean regions for example rivers may have very little or even no flow during the dry summer months garcia et al 2017 this seasonal rhythm influences the timing of sediment transport and associated channel change church 1995 as well as species phenologies alvarez and pardo 2005 in contrast tropical rivers are strongly monsoon driven their hydrological regimes reflect patterns of rainfall magnitude and timing that differ from those in temperate and mediterranean regions but also the much higher runoff coefficients of tropical catchments chong et al 2021 comprehensive ways of interrogating river flow data are of great value for helping to understand fluvial and ecological dynamics but are especially important in the tropics to help tease out any subtle or complex temporal rhythms that exist e g lázaro vázquez et al 2018 wohl et al 2012 ghosh and guchhait 2016 and to provide the comprehensive descriptions of baseline conditions that are needed as the starting point for setting e flows and ffs a number of approaches and indices for hydrological characterisation exist these were recently reviewed by jumani et al 2020 who separated indices into those which are descriptive and those which are prescriptive descriptive indices provide a characterisation of the flow regime while prescriptive ones focus on recommending specific flows or flow regimes as part e flows or ffs most existing approaches are prescriptive jumani et al 2020 and while the descriptive ones that exist are useful they each tend to focus only on one or two aspects of the hydrograph e g variability rather than multiple traits simultaneously thus there remains scope for more comprehensive ways of analysing flow series bringing together features of several existing indices and approaches to improve characterisation of hydrological regimes this paper presents a structured framework to help understand multiple aspects of river hydrological regimes and support flow management in regulated rivers the framework hydrological characterisation to support functional flows hyfflow yields a characterisation of flows over several timescales and brings together a variety of complementary analytical methods and descriptors many of the descriptors used within hyfflow have been found to be ecologically relevant e g multiples of the median flow that influence invertebrate community structure gibbins et al 2001 and or are recognised as being important for geomorphological processes e g the shape and magnitude of high flow events thus while on its own hyfflow cannot be used to set e flows or ffs i e it cannot assess ecological or geomorphological functions or needs it provides a description of the flow regime that is based on traits known to influence physical and ecological processes therefore hyfflow can be used in two ways i to provide a holistic characterisation of the flow regime against which future changes can be assessed ii to identify particular aspects of the hydrograph whose specific ecological and or geomorphic function needs to be assessed to support development of functional flows hyfflow is applied here to the river baleh a meso scale catchment on the island of borneo malaysia a hydroelectric dam is currently being constructed on the baleh due for completion in 2026 but like many tropical rivers limited ecologic and geomorphic data exist comprehensive analysis of existing flow data is therefore important to understand pre dam baseline conditions in as much detail as possible and specifically to provide information on flow traits whose functional significance can become the focus of subsequent geomorphic and ecological studies the paper illustrates the value of hyfflow for providing this information while it is applied here to the baleh it is considered a generic approach applicable to any river 2 hyfflow framework and work packages 2 1 overview hyfflow is based on analysis of existing discharge and rainfall data thus as with all approaches to characterisation e g indicators of hydrological alteration confidence in conclusions drawn from the various analyses that make up hyfflow depend on the duration of the data record ideally long data time series decadal of hourly or daily values are available depending on data availability it may be inappropriate to apply some of the analyses hyfflow provides a way to understand flow characteristics over several timescales i the event scale based on the traits of individual events ii seasonal scale and iii annual and interannual scales flow variability over these timescales is known to influence ecological geomorphic and bio geochemical processes in riverine systems yarnell et al 2015 and so maintaining natural patterns of this variability is important for maintaining river integrity when flows are altered or modified a specific focus of hyfflow is the statistical identification and characterisation of different types of hydrological event and assessment of their frequency and timing the framework is divided into 4 packages fig 1 each consisting of a number of analyses designed to yield information on different aspects of the flow regime the following sections provide details of the rationale and analyses that form respective packages these are followed by an example to show how it has been applied to the river baleh fig 2 application of the framework leads to the production of a large number of plots and data tables for brevity only a small number of these are presented here the remainder are given in the appendix section package 1 fundamentals of the flow regime package 1 provides fundamental information on the river flow regime as well as the links between rainfall and flow magnitude this package is largely descriptive with most of the outputs being plots designed to represent fundamental information on the regime they include basic time series plots flow duration curves flood frequency plots and assessment of the magnitude of and seasonal variation in baseflow baseflows are calculated using bfi 3 of hydrooffice 2010 software which uses the local minimum method gregor 2010 the analysis of rainfall includes some formal statistical tests to assess rainfall runoff relationships and when data for multiple stations are available tests to assess variation in rainfall and rainfall runoff relations package 2 flow metrics this package uses a variety of metrics to represent key aspects of the regime quantitatively it uses the indicators of hydrological alteration iha software developed by the nature conservancy tnc 2007 to compute a range of flow metrics these metrics are based on work by poff and ward 1989 the metrics capture aspects of the flow regime s magnitude as well as the timing and duration of certain flow events application of the iha software yields a simple table of metric values that identify key aspects of the regime for example q90 90th percentile is used in iha to define low flow and q95 95th percentile to define extreme low flow iha also provides a simple classification of high flow events based on standard flow percentiles and recurrence intervals what are termed high flows are events whose magnitude exceeds 75 of all daily flow values in the record the small flood threshold is the 2 year recurrence interval while large floods have a 10 year recurrence interval the iha statistics are a useful way of describing a river s flow regime in ways that have been shown to be ecological relevant richter et al 1996 for instance extreme low flows e g flows equalled or exceeded 95 of the time q95 enable recruitment of certain floodplain species and may concentrate prey into limited areas to benefit predators the nature conservancy 2009 such flows will expose sediment on gravel and sand bars habitat that is important for many rare species sadler et al 2004 conversely the magnitude and timing of high flows can be important as such events can act as disturbances that influence community structure gibbins et al 2001 or the timing of life cycle events lytle and poff 2004 overbank flows are recognised ff components that support a broad suite of physical and ecological processes including the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity in space and time controlling patterns of riparian succession and providing cues for fish reproduction and migration yarnell et al 2020 for hyfflow statistics representing high and low flow magnitude timing and duration form the starting point for a more sophisticated analysis of hydrograph shape undertaken as part of package 3 the final analysis included in package 2 involves computing colwell s index colwell 1974 this quantifies the predictability of a flow regime and is particularly useful within the context of seasonality e g highly seasonal regimes such as found in mediterranean regions may be highly predictable predictability p has two separable components constancy c and contingency m which have profoundly different implications for the ecology and evolution of biological systems fretwell 1972 macarthur 1972 colwell 1974 maximum predictability can be attained as a consequence of either complete constancy complete contingency or a combination of constancy and contingency with respect to time colwell 1974 when used in the analysis of streamflow c is a measure of the degree to which streamflow is the same constant and m is a measure of the degree to which the annual pattern of flow repeats milhous 2012 these elements of predictability can be compared to other rivers colwell s index can be computed using the r package hydrostats r core team 2013 package 3 hydrograph shape larger events serve important geomorphic functions by initiating sediment transport and topographic change in river reaches church 2002 and may also be ecologically important death et al 2015 benda et al 2004 the focus of package 3 is the statistical identification and characterisation of these larger events potentially important event traits are their peak magnitude duration and rates of change on the rising and falling limbs as well as their timing package 3 involves identifying all events within the iha high flow event classes i e high flows small floods and large floods over the data period and then using a sample of these for a full analysis of their traits depending on the user and focal river additional high flow classes may be delineated and included in the analysis for example flows of a lower magnitude than iha defined high flows may still serve important geomorphic or ecological functions so such events may need to be included similarly it may not be operationally possible to create managed flows from dams at the magnitude of the default three iha high flow classes so additional smaller classes may be developed to ensure inclusion of events small enough to be released from the dam for instance in the case of the baleh a fourth class was created to allow inclusion of events greater than the median flow but less than the iha high flow threshold see section 3 2 package 3 requires a large enough number of events across all classes to allow meaningful analysis of their traits a minimum sample size of approximately 100 events is suggested for this in the baleh for example there was a total of 1949 events within the four high flow classes over the 51 year data period a stratified random method was used to select a sample of events from this total designed to yield a frequency of events of each class in the sample that matched that in the full data record events chosen to represent each class were selected randomly from all events belonging to that class fig a1 appendix a shows the breakdown of the sample by event class for the baleh the analysis of the event shapes uses multivariate methods proposed by hannah et al 2000 and fong et al 2016 these methods involve characterising each event using the discharge values from their start to end points thus shape is defined using the discharge time series that captures their rising limb peak time at peak falling limb and duration ideally hourly discharge data are used for this analysis but in some cases only mean daily values may be available availability of only mean daily values creates some problems for analysis of shorter events e g events of just one or two days duration cannot be analysed meaningfully in this way careful judgement is needed about inclusion of shorter events when mean daily values are used for example in the case of the baleh events less than 5 days were excluded from the multivariate analyses and characterised differently further details below the analysis of shape has three stages first for each sample event discharge magnitude for each time interval over its duration is used as the input for an agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc this clustering identifies events of similar shape objectively with these clusters becoming the event types second simple envelope plots of each type identified by the ahc are then produced to produce these plots hydrographs for all events within a given type are plotted together with non linear generalised additive models gams fitted to the upper and lower bounds 10th and 90th quantiles to create a smoothed curve that defines the limits of each type so as to not loose any short events omitted from the clustering these are plotted together in an additional diagram with gams then fitted to model upper and lower bounds of the scatter on this diagram gams can be fitted in the mgcv package within r wood 2011 or a number of other software packages finally following hannah et al 2000 and fong et al 2016 principal components analysis pca is applied to the same data and format used for the ahc i e discharge at each time interval over the duration of each event from this pca factor loadings on the most useful pca components highest explanatory power are plotted to provide a complementary insight into event shape this allows assessment of the key ways in which event types differ package 4 long term trends in flow and rainfall regimes this package is focussed on looking for evidence of any changes in rainfall and hydrological regime it provides an objective analysis of inter annual and long term trends the package produces 2 main outputs a assessment of trends in flow and rainfall magnitude and frequency b assessment of change in the whole hydrological regime discharge and rainfall data are required daily or monthly a uses standard statistical tools mann kendall test to look for evidence of linear and monotonical trends in flow and rainfall at monthly and seasonal scales seasonal mann kendall test allows for time series within which there may be seasonal rhythms nested within any longer term directional linear change this test is applied to monthly discharge and rainfall values over the available time series standard mann kendall tests are also applied for seasons of interest these seasons depend on location for instance in the case of the baleh theywere defined using wet and dry periods connected to the monsoon and so the analyses assessed long term changes in mean discharge for the wet and dry seasons b uses pca to characterise and compare the regime of each year each year is characterised using a variety of flow metrics with the pca of these metric values allowing assessment of the similarity of each year as well as the identification of the most useful metric s for such comparisons termed key metrics as they are the features of the regime that vary most between the years gams are then used to look for evidence of long term trends in i the annual values of each key metric and ii the annual regime overall using pca component 1 scores for each year standard metrics that represent various aspects of flow magnitude frequency duration timing variability and rate of change are used for b a large number of potential metrics exist e g see olden and poff 2003 so a subset of these can be chosen to reflect the particular purposeor focus of the study once metrics are chosen and computed an initial pca is used to identify and remove redundant and correlated metrics the pca is then re run with the remaining subset of metrics for instance in the case of the baleh 17 of the initial 26 metrics were used in the final pca ahc is then used to identify groups of years with similar regimes with these groups then differentiated on the final pca the gams fitted to the pca component 1 scores for each year e g in the case of the baleh 51 years pick out evidence of rhythms cycles or linear trends in the annual regime gams are also applied to the annual values of the key metrics metrics with the longest vectors on the pca these gams provide insights into whether values of any of the metrics e g q90 are changing over time the degrees of freedom edf in the gams were allowed to vary to allow the models to find the best shape to represent any temporal pattern over the data period 3 hyfflow application to the river baleh 3 1 the baleh catchment the baleh fig 2 is one of two main sub catchments within the rajang basin and has a catchment area of 5 625 km2 the rajang basin is approximately 50 000 km2 with elevations exceeding 2000 m asl floodplains when present are of limited area staub and gastaldo 2000 geology consists of sandstone and shale from the belaga and nyalau formations ling et al 2016 soils are mainly red yellow podzols based on the sarawak classification system tie 1982 landcover in the baleh catchment is predominantly hill forest comprising mixed dipterocarp and secondary forest annual total rainfall is among the highest in sarawak exceeding 5000 mm in most years there is usually an average of around 250 days of measurable precipitation per year temperature is high throughout the year with a mean annual daily maximum temperature of 33 c flow data from the telok buing gauging station are used to illustrate hyfflow the data record commences in 1967 and extends until 2017 to complement discharge data seven weather stations provide information on rainfall though for varying periods and durations the locations of gauging and weather stations along with respective data are shown in fig 2 3 2 hyfflow outputs in this section we present some of the key outputs from each package and use these to illustrate the characteristics patterns and trends evident in the flow and rainfall data for the baleh these findings are discussed within the context of climate and landcover change as well as the operation of baleh dam in section 4 package 1 fig a2 supplementary material shows the basic discharge data for telok buing along with rainfall for the closest upstream weather station nanga entawau figs 3 5 and figs a3 a5 give the hyfflow outputs used to represent the fundamental aspects of the flow regime while fig a6 shows rainfall runoff relations degree of seasonality plots of median monthly discharge and rainfall data figs 3 and a3 show that the baleh has a monsoonal tropical regime rather than a seasonal tropical one with the wet months being november to march and dry months may to august the strength of seasonality is quantified further in package 2 using colwell s index for which see below baseflows vary considerably in the baleh figs 4 and a4 but typically are less than 500 m3 s in the dry months and 500 800 m3 s in wet months flow duration and flood frequency curves flow duration curves for each year of record are shown in fig 5 a with the inset showing the long term values each year is plotted to help visualise interannual variation in the flow regime the long term median flow for the baleh is 873 m3 s with a 90th percentile of 376 m3 s and a 10th percentile of 1915 m3 s there is however significant variability in the annual flow duration curves with e g q50 varying from around 900 m3 s to 2000 m3 s for the period of record 1970 and 2014 represent extreme high and low flow years respectively the flow value corresponding to a 5 year return period event for baleh river is approximately 4200 m3 s with the exceedance probability being 20 with a 10 year return period event being equal to approximately 5000 m3 s with the exceedance probability being 10 fig 5 b rainfall runoff relations rainfall in the baleh varies significantly between the weather stations included in the analysis anova df 6 2476 f 13 773 p 0 05 results from post hoc tests show that nanga merit and kapit new headworks sites differ from the other five locations but the others do not differ from each other fig a5 these two drier stations are the most westerly ones and both sit just outside the baleh sub catchment but within the rajang fig 2 rainfall runoff plots indicate similar relations between discharge at telok buing and precipitation at various points in the catchment table 1 and fig a6 thus there is no evidence that rainfall magnitude in different parts of the catchment produces a different response in discharge at telok buing package 2 iha metrics table 2 shows a subset of the iha flow metric values for the baleh this subset includes the timing of the two low flow percentiles defined using the days that respective lowest flow events occur on e g the day that the lowest flow event below q95 occurred on these flows are on julian day 216 august and 212 july both of which are in the dry part of the year however it is evident from the hydrograph fig 4 that flows drop below q95 and q90 throughout the year and from both the hydrograph and table 2 that such periods are short lived i e only 2 3 days in duration in general the river is rain driven and does not experience extended periods at low or baseflow at a particular time of the year colwell s index fig 6 shows the predictability of the baleh flow regime relative to other rivers the baleh has an overall predictability of p 0 5 similar to the other tropical monsoonal river included in the plot lower mekong p 0 32 the other tropical rivers in the plot are seasonal ones while the remainder are temperate rivers the baleh predictability is in upper quartile of the tropical rivers but is dominated by constancy i e it has very low contingency this shows that the baleh has a greater degree of similar streamflow c and lower degree of repeated annual pattern m note that only a few calculations of predictability have been published for mediterranean rivers average p is 0 55 and none of these papers reported the two elements separately package 3 event types and their shapes the ahc fig a7 of the 86 individual events analysed generated 5 high flow event types consisting of 3 main groups and 2 single events that did not fit within the main groups these event types are also shown in the pca fig a8 the envelope plots fig 7 of these event types help illustrate key differences in respective magnitudes durations and rates of change type a represents events that rise sharply peaking at around 7 9 days at between 100 900 m3 s above respective time baseflow levels and lasting for around 20 days type b represents very similar events to type a in terms of duration but which have higher peaks up to around 2500 m3 s above baseflow that rise and fall more rapidly type c events are rather similar in magnitude to type b but are longer up to 30 days and more pointed than the dome shape that characterises type b the single events shown in fig 7 d e do not fit the other classes because of their complex shape event d has a double peak while e rises sharply but takes some time to return to baseflow the short events 5 days not included in the formal ahc and pca analyses are also shown as an envelope plot in the fig 7 f these short events vary in magnitude from less than 100 to 500 m3 s above baseflow and can be considered as being a set of low magnitude short lived events most 68 of the variability in the sampled baleh hydrographs could be represented on the first four components of the pca fig 7 g j shows the factor loadings for these four components with values on each day d indicating the main ways that events differ f1 fig 7 g is the major gradient in the data pca the maximum loading on f1 is from d19 d24 this means that the main way in which events differ is in their magnitude at days 19 24 in effect while some events are still going on beyond 19 24 days by this time others have ended and have dropped back to baseflow thus the primary division of events separates those shorter than and those longer than 19 24 days this division is evident from the envelope plots fig 7 a f fig 7 b shows event types shorter than 19 24 days while fig 7 c e show those longer than this maximum loading on f2 the next most important dimension is around day 9 this separates events according to their flow discharge on day 9 11 and clearly helps separate event types a and b in fig 7 with a having a lower discharge on this day fig 8 shows seasonal patterns in the occurrence of events belonging to each of the four event types described above the two single events are omitted event types a and f show the clearest seasonal patterns type a is bimodal with peaks of occurrence in weeks 21 25 late may to early june and then 47 52 november and december while type f occurs most frequently during weeks 22 31 late may to late june the other types have more variable less clear seasonal patterns though type b events tend to occur more commonly towards the end of the year type c the higher magnitude events occur mainly in the final third of the year week 31 onwards and much less commonly in the dry months of may to september weeks 19 40 package 4 trends in rainfall and flow there were no significant trends in monthly mean or maximum monthly rainfall at any of the 7 rainfall stations tables 3 and 4 hence there was no evidence of gross long term changes in rainfall magnitude across the catchment as a whole at the seasonal level there were no significant trends in rainfall in either the wet or dry periods at any of the weather stations more recent rainfall data were available for nanga entawau but analysis of data for this station indicated there was also no evidence of any change over the longer period 1970 2019 p 0 455 nevertheless a change in rainfall frequency was evident though this varied spatially across the baleh for the 4 stations located in the west of the catchment there was a decrease in the number of days each month with no rainfall whereas for the easterly nanga entawau station there was an increase in the number of no rainfall days table 4 there was a significant decrease p 0 05 in discharge in the baleh over the 51 year period fig a9 however this varied seasonally with a significant decrease evident in the wet months but not the dry months fig a10 change in the whole hydrological regime table a1 shows the full set of flow metrics produced for analysis of long term trends in the hydrological regime these were all computed from the long term discharge time series for the baleh then analysed using ahc and pca fig 9 the three classes of year identified by the ahc are colour coded in fig 9 a class 1 represents years with lower flows sitting at the negative extreme of several flow magnitude metrics annual q50 annual max q annual q16 and number of times flow exceeds q16 classes 2 and 3 are generally higher flow years the difference between these related to flow variability class 2 is more variable sitting towards positive end of the vectors for flow cv and sd the direction of the vectors in fig 9 b indicates how the classes differ most of the vectors were of similar length with only those for aspects of timing tq 5 tq 16 tq 84 tq 90 short and hence less important pca factor 1 scores fig 10 for each year showed a significant linear trend over time p 0 05 edf in gams of 1 table 5 this shows that there has been a change in the flow regime of the baleh over the last 51 years factor 1 scores have reduced over time indicating a shift to a lower flow regime this multivariate analysis of the whole regime therefore corroborates the mann kendall test results applied to the raw discharge magnitude data significant trends were evident in the values of ycv and anmmax fig 10 and table 5 the high edf values indicate non linear cyclical patterns rather than linear or directional trends thus the models indicate that there were intra annual differences in terms of flow variability and magnitude with cycles of wet and dry years no significant patterns were evident in nq90 or nq50 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 hyfflow a systematic amalgamation of tools and metrics hyfflow is a framework designed to provide a comprehensive description of the flow regime of a river it represents a systematic amalgamation of what were previously separate ways of analysing hydrological time series while developed initially to provide a baseline characterisation of the tropical river baleh prior to dam construction hyfflow can be applied to any river type and can be useful within other contexts e g understanding baseline conditions prior to deforestation extracting as much information as possible from existing data may be particularly important in data scarce regions such as in tropical countries where human pressures on river systems are great jumani et al 2020 hyfflow consists of a set of packages that characterise various components of the flow regime including objective identification of event types whose functional significance either for geomorphic or ecological processes can be investigated as part of targeted follow up studies this structured approach to characterisation complements and or could be used as part of existing holistic frameworks such as eloha poff et al 2010 hyfflow includes an assessment of change while some existing approaches allow explicitly for this e g ecodeficit ecosurplus concept dundee hydrological regime alteration method annual proportional flow deviation gehrke et al 1995 black et al 2005 vogel et al 2007 hyfflow differs in its approach it uses a combination of time series analysis to assess trends in flow magnitude but notably also uses multivariate analyses to assess changes to the whole regime and determine which aspects of the regime have changed 4 2 hydrology of the river baleh time series analyses package 4 indicated long term changes in flow in the baleh with reductions in discharge during the wet months of the year this is broadly consistent with patterns reported by sa adi et al 2017a who studied a number of catchments across borneo including the upper rajang the cause s of this long term trend in the baleh are unclear there was no change in rainfall magnitude over the same period though there was some change in rainfall frequency indicated by increases in the number of days with no rainfall of the catchments modelled by sa adi et al 2017b the baleh was predicted to experience the least change in rainfall 1 1 1 9 by the end of this century there has been no major change in landcover in the baleh with forest cover being reduced by less than 4 over the last 20 years lum unpublished mres thesis thus neither rainfall nor landcover change provide a clear explanation for the hydrological change sarawak is however experiencing an increase in temperature in the range of 0 1 0 15 c decade sa adi et al 2017a and the increase in evapotranspiration associated with this might help explain the long term reduction in flows in the wet season in the baleh flows in the baleh vary considerably over shorter timescales there is marked inter annual variability in discharge with q50 for example varying from 1000 m3 s to more than 2000 m3 s between years the baleh has a monsoonal tropical climate rather than a seasonal one with wet months of november to march and dry months of may to september baseflows are somewhat higher in the wet periods approx 700 m3 s than dry periods approx 500 m3 s periods of low flow q90 and q95 occur throughout the year and tend to be very short lived lasting only 2 3 days four main types of high flow event occur in the baleh as well as some idiosyncratic events that do not fit any of these main types the main types differ in terms of their magnitude and duration event types a and f respectively those up to approximately 1000 m3 s above baseflow and lasting approximately 3 weeks and those up to 500 m3 s above baseflow lasting up to five days have quite consistent patterns of timing during the year the other two event types are larger up to 2500 m3 s above baseflow and differ mainly in their duration and shape slope of rising and recession limbs type b are around 20 days duration and type c around 30 days the long term data indicate that the timing of these sustained periods of high flow is rather less consistent than types a and f flow predictability p of the baleh computed using colwell s index is moderate and within the range of other tropical rivers notably though it has a low value of contingency indicating that temporal rhythms are not strong this reflects the fact that seasonality in the baleh while evident to some degree is not marked and that both high and low flows occur at any time during the year 4 3 functional flows and dam operation in the baleh the dam currently being constructed on the baleh is scheduled for completion in 2026 detailed information on species flow requirements and life cycles is missing for the baleh a common problem in tropical regions so it is not currently possible to apply habitat models e g phabsim bovee 1985 to develop operational regimes based directly on ecological criteria similarly knowledge of fluvial processes in the baleh is insufficient to identify flows that serve important habitat forming functions and which therefore need to be maintained in order to support geomorphic integrity the insights into the hydrological regime of the baleh provided by hyfflow are therefore important as they provide a clear focus for geomorphic and ecological studies most notably a key task for the baleh is now to undertake work to understand the functional roles of each of the main event types identified e g how they influence scour sediment transport and associated changes in habitat bed sedimentary and topographic conditions the hyfflow outputs showing the timing of occurrence of these events provide a clear template for scheduling dam releases to mimic those events which prove to have important functions the largest natural events in the baleh those greater than 2000 m3 s event types b and c exceed the combined release capacity of the dam turbines 885 m3 s so may be lost post impoundment unless they are generated by rainfall in the lower parts of the catchment event types a and f however could be simulated by artificial releases designed to mimic their shape as per fig 7 these two types unlike the larger ones have rather clear seasonal patterns of occurrence so releases could potentially be made to mimic their timing as well as shape the hyfflow analyses also provide some insights into operational rules for managing lower flows the timing of monsoon periods in the baleh gives rise to lower mean monthly flows on the months may to august inclusive with somewhat lower baseflows during these months than the remainder of the year while the lowest absolute flows also tend to occur during this period it is evident from the hydrograph fig 4 that flows drop below q95 and q90 throughout the year such periods tend to be short lived with durations of 2 3 days and the river does not experience extended periods at low or baseflow at any particular time of the year thus sustained periods releasing only compensation flow from the dam or operating only one turbine 177 m3 s would create a very unnatural hydrograph one possible constraint on flow management in the baleh is that the observed long term trends in flow may impact water storage and hence the capacity for making ff releases even if water is available to deliver a set of designed ffs providing these in a fixed form magnitude shape may be problematic if geomorphically the river is adjusting to a slow directional change in flows similarly as landcover change affects runoff and fine sediment loads such change may alter the geomorphic effectiveness of specific magnitude ff events that were initially designed under different rainfall runoff relations thus the effects of any ffs would need to be monitored to ensure they continue to provide the functions intended 5 conclusions river systems globally face multiple pressures so ways of characterising flow regimes are important for helping to understand these pressures and developing management programmes recent research hayes et al 2018 shows that multiple elements of the natural annual hydrograph are necessary to maintain the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems and their related components i e river channel riparian areas floodplain and groundwater water management must therefore ensure that all flow regime components e g mean flows flow pulses floods occur in a correctly timed fashion with the right frequency and duration and rate of change between flow seasons yarnell et al 2015 hyfflow provides a comprehensive characterisation of flow regimes and of any changes to these it does not provide management prescriptions but rather is a system that allows for characterisation and quantification in ways that are likely relevant to geomorphic processes and ecological integrity the work presented here for the baleh is the starting point for post impoundment flow management designed to maintain physical and ecological integrity hyfflow identified distinct flow types and seasonal patterns to their occurrence with for instance short periods of low flows happening throughout the year and events of moderate size types a and f occurring in the middle and end months of the year this insight helps set a clear suite of research questions for more focussed process based studies that are needed to help design an operational regime for the dam credit authorship contribution statement xin yi chong conceptualization

salinity in the area recent observations show that the overturning process is important to the entire north pacific and is statistically related to the precipitation over the kamchatka peninsula kp this study uses estimations based on specific discharge and the soil and water assessment tool swat to verify and further explore the connection between the terrestrial freshwater discharge from kp and the overturning process new hydrological insights for the region previously inaccessible observed discharge data from 11 major rivers on the kp were obtained and analyzed for the first time based on the data we estimate annual discharge from the entire kp using the specific discharge and regression analysis and we then simulate monthly discharge from the western kp using the swat model our result shows a significant negative correlation r2 0 36 p 0 01 between the interannual variation of sea water salinity in the overturning process area and the variation of annual freshwater discharge

flows out from the sea of okhotsk to form what is called the north pacific intermediate water npiw which is comparable to the nadw yasuda 1997 recent observations suggest that the okhotsk outflow is a potential source of the micronutrient iron in the iron limited high nitrate low chlorophyll north pacific and it plays a key role in the cycle of biogeochemical properties in the north pacific such as active gas exchange and sediment material e g dissolved organic carbon transport hansell et al 2002 nishioka et al 2013 2007 wong et al 1998 strength of the overturning process in the sea of okhotsk is determined by the sea water salinity and uehara et al 2014 concluded that upper layer salinity anomalies propagate along pathways from the bering sea to the northwestern shelf region of the sea of okhotsk and precondition the variations of dsw salinity in the following winter fig 1 upper layer salinity signals can be traced further upstream from the bering sea to the alaskan stream and the western subarctic gyre previous studies have shown that sea ice production surface sea water freshening and wind driven ocean circulation may have impacts on the properties of dsw fujisaki et al 2011 matsuda et al 2009 ohshima et al 2014 and those studies focus mainly on the ocean side the terrestrial side is not often discussed possibly due to limitation of related data uehara et al 2014 revealed a significant negative correlation between the dsw salinity anomaly in the northeastern sea of okhotsk and annual mean precipitation variation over the kamchatka peninsula kp when the latter precedes the former by one year there are numerous rivers on the massive land of kp approximately 472 300 km2 and annual precipitation varies from approximately 350 2500 mm jones and solomina 2015 the kp is located at the relatively up stream section of the sea salt pathway compared with the northern sea of okhotsk freshwater discharge from rivers on the kp to its surrounding oceans eastern sea of okhotsk and north pacific therefore very likely delivers non negligible impact on the dsw formation by freshening the surface sea water salinity such relationship between freshwater discharge and large scale ocean process as thermohaline circulation once verified could highlight the significance of impacts from freshwater discharge to oceans in the pacific sector and potentially encourage more attention on such topic however no study has been done on this topic in the region as the observed hydrological data of kp is highly limited in 2016 under the collaboration between the federal service for hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring of russia roshydromet and the institute of volcanology and seismology far eastern branch of russian academy of sciences ivs feb ras official observed river discharge data of 11 major rivers on the kp was obtained for the first time based on these data we fixed the objectives as to estimate freshwater discharge from kp to its surrounding oceans and to examine its relationship with the dsw formation 2 study area the kp is a remote area located in russian far east with an approximate area of 472 300 km2 with the sea of okhotsk on the west and the pacific ocean on the east the kp is located on several large volcanic belts making it the most active volcanic area on the eurasian continent climate of the kp is influenced by its position at the eastern margin of the asian landmass its mountain ranges the cold ocean currents to the east and by the sea of okhotsk to the west jones and solomina 2015 the summers are cool while winters are cold and long usually lasting from october to may mainly because of the cold arctic winds from siberia and the cold oyashio sea current qiu 2001 nevertheless the kp has considerable variability in terms of climate the kp generally has a subarctic climate while higher and more northern areas have a polar climate peel et al 2007 two major north south mountain ranges the central range and eastern range also cause climate variations especially in terms of precipitation the western coast is relatively colder the central valley between the two ranges is drier and the eastern coast is milder jones and solomina 2015 the kamchatka river is the biggest river on the kp and originates in the mountains of the southern central valley flows northward down the valley and eventually enters the north pacific from the eastern side of klyuchevskaya sopka the highest mountain 4 750 m on the kp one previous study was dedicated to the hydrological features of the kamchatka river frolova et al 2014 while generally speaking study of such topic in the kp region is scarce likely due to high data limitation even though nearly 200 000 people live in petropavlovsk kamchatsky which is the capital city of kp the entire peninsula s population in 2019 was only 314 723 russian federal state statistics service 2020 with such a low population density constant scientific monitoring can be a huge challenge in most places nevertheless several observation stations across the kp have collected meteorological and or hydrological data for many decades some dating back to the 1930s in this study both long term and recent data were used human interference is considered to be negligible during all of the estimations 3 materials and methods predictions in ungauged basins pub is one of the major issues in hydrology and it is also the core topic of the present study the international association of hydrological sciences iahs conducted an initiative called the prediction in ungauged basins from 2003 to 2013 aiming to reduce uncertainty in hydrological predictions by exploring new theories and techniques sivapalan et al 2003 since then advances have been made in many aspects including data collecting techniques krajewski et al 2006 schmugge et al 2002 soulsby et al 2008 process understanding blume et al 2008 model structure blöschl et al 2013 and model uncertainty assessment nester et al 2012 pappenberger et al 2005 while challenges such as robust predictions in ungauged region and harmonization of modelling strategies still remain hrachowitz et al 2013 kp on the other hand is an extremely challenging region for pub studies due to high limitation of both hydrological and meteorological observation data either inaccessible or non existent and high difficulties in conducting both field survey and remote sensing as foreign researchers estimations of river discharge at ungauged basins are generally made based on observed data and theoretical calculations of neighboring gauged basins that possess similar features hrachowitz et al 2013 therefore even under such difficult premises we still identify observation data and official data as the benchmark for our estimations the most essential dataset we obtained includes 13 sets of long term monthly river discharge data from 11 different basins on the kp one set no 2c table 1 is open access data from the global runoff data centre grdc germany river discharge data and the other twelve sets were initially monitored at hydrometeorological posts and stations for selected rivers in the kp region by the roshydromet and provided to the ivs feb ras via collaboration a part of the data from roshydromet was already published in printed form hydrometeoizdat 1987 1977 1973 locations of the 11 basins are shown in fig 2 a time span of the data varies from 30 years to more than 70 years table 1 and basin size also varies from relatively small basins to two of the largest basins on the kp i e the kamchatka river basin and penzhina river basin missing data exist in almost all of the 13 sets therefore depending on the specific objective and method not all of the 13 sets were used in all parts of the study river basin characteristics are discussed in section 4 1 another official dataset we obtained is a publication named world atlas of snow and ice resources hereinafter referred to as the atlas kotlyakov 1997 the beginning of creating the atlas dated back to mid 1970s and took over 300 ussr specialists for more than 20 years till 1997 to reach publication representing the largest project of the intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp of unesco at the time kotlyakov 1999 the atlas contains more than 1000 maps with different scales covering both russian ussr at the time territory and other regions around the world while one major issue exists i e there is no description regarding the data time span from which each map was created we do recognize the uniqueness of the atlas and data extracted from three individual maps of the kp were used in this study annual snowfall amount fig 2b annual duration of snow cover fig 2c and annual duration of cold season number of days with surface air temperature below 0 c in a year fig 2d most of the data in the atlas are presented as contour lines instead of numerical values therefore in order to identify data value at a basin scale we manually created grid with hundreds of intersections over each map and calculated the average of values at all the intersections within the given basin notice that fig 2b c and d were respectively simplified based on the original maps in the atlas namely contour intervals in each map were reduced for demonstration purpose even though the atlas is the only official data we possess besides the observed discharge data its main focus is snow related issues instead of hydrology we therefore decided to use a hydrological definition named specific discharge sd to draw connection onto discharge estimation sd m3 s 1 km 2 is the discharge q m3 s 1 per unit area a km2 of an up stream basin woods et al 1995 it is possible for rivers with different sizes to have the same discharge value at a given time but this often implies substantially different meanings whereas sd of different basins may provide more information when comparing their values previous studies have shown that sd can represent many features of its basin as it is non linearly correlated with the catchment area woods et al 1995 and it is mostly climate and geology dependent komatsu and onda 1996 lyon et al 2012 it is therefore possible to estimate the sd of ungauged basins on the basis of gauged basins that share similar features in the case of having limited observation data sd is considered useful for estimating river discharge in this study we prepared the following six factors by considering data quality and potential of being correlated with the average annual sd of the 11 gauged basins m3 s 1 km 2 annual snowfall amount mm fig 2b basin area km2 average zonal elevation m annual duration of snow cover d fig 2c approximate latitude of basin and vegetation coverage percentage basin area and average zonal elevation were calculated from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem v 2 japan s ministry of economy trade and industry and the u s national aeronautics and space administration vegetation coverage was derived from the global drainage basin database masutomi et al 2009 notice that all components included here are either average value or constant value mainly because of the atlas data are average data which means the estimation based on these components is also a one time averaged estimation correlations between the six factors and average annual sd were analyzed by multiple regression analysis more is discussed in section 4 2 to advance upon the finding by uehara et al 2014 that annual mean precipitation over kp is statistically related to annual dsw salinity anomaly with a one year time gap in between a more physical approach and a shorter time scale e g monthly should be the new basis while new models for pub topics have been under active developments over the past decades many model comparison studies duan et al 2006 franchini and pacciani 1991 gan and burges 1990 perrin et al 2001 reed et al 2004 rutter et al 2009 are suggesting that it is essential to realize in model selection there is no need to find the best model but rather that individual model performances vary with the setting nevertheless it is desirable to ensure model parameters are well constrained and to ensure models have a complete and physically realistic representation of dominant processes hrachowitz et al 2013 under such criteria in addition to the situation in kp we decided to use the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 an open access hydrological model for the secondary estimation in recent years swat has been applied frequently to both small basins e g rostamian et al 2008 spruill et al 2000 and large basins e g abbaspour et al 2015 schuol et al 2008 and has been proved useful for pub studies golmohammadi et al 2014 in this study calculations in swat used the soil conservation service scs curve number method mockus 1972 for surface runoff a modified rational method chow et al 1988 for peak runoff rate the hallow aquifer storage concept arnold et al 1993 for contribution from groundwater flow and the penman monteith method monteith 1965 for potential evapotranspiration table 2 shows inputs used in this study as the most important input for swat meteorological data was derived from the national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr reliability of cfsr data has been verified by many previous studies e g cuceloglu and ozturk 2019 he et al 2016 and was proved capable of representing the climatological seasonal patterns in arctic regions and some major siberian rivers lindsay et al 2014 oshima et al 2015 which have similar characteristics as rivers on the kp daily data of precipitation mm maximum and minimum temperature c wind speed m s 1 relative humidity and solar radiation mj m 2 during january 1 1979 to december 31 2013 were used as the kp is considered pristine with very limited human interference zoelen 2002 both land uses map and soil map were selected from fixed and relatively recent year instead of multiple years as a rainfall runoff model calibration is always necessary for swat in this study we used the sequential uncertainty fitting v 2 algorithm sufi 2 under the calibration and uncertainty procedures program swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 for calibrations excessive number of parameters are related to river discharge in the swat model while we selected parameters for calibration under the following criteria 1 to represent two of the most major basin features on the kp i e groundwater and snowmelt and 2 to contribute to a useful calibration result with high sensitivity p 0 05 not just in one but all given basins after numerous testing calibrations cn2 smtmp smfmx snocovmx sno50cov gw delay gwqmn and alpha bf were selected for calibrations in each basin detail of parameters is discussed in the swat official manual arnold et al 2012 even though soil properties are also directly related to river discharge we decided to leave them uncalibrated to avoid over tuning as we possess no soil information of the kp with proper resolution additionally while glacier exists in several parts of the kp an estimation of annual glacier runoff over 22 regions was reported in the atlas by numerical value instead of contour line as 62 5 m3 s 1 which is fairly low compared to river discharge we therefore decided not to include contribution from glacier discharge in our estimations calibration is usually done by confronting simulations with observations in other words calibration is technically practical in gauged basins therefore to meaningfully simulate the other ungauged basins without calibration the idea of regionalization with physical similarity approach bárdossy 2007 mengistu et al 2019 was applied simulations in each gauged basin were calibrated to a reasonable degree and then their calibrated parameter values were applied to their neighboring basins respectively this approach is the reason why we calibrated the same abovementioned parameters in every gauged basin so that applying parameter values to ungauged basins could be a consistent process in addition basins on the eastern kp were excluded in this approach as having only three gauged basins with relatively small distance to each other is inadequate to conduct the same process the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse krause et al 2005 and r square were used to quantify the calibration quality nse values above 0 5 were treated as acceptable moriasi et al 2007 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 calibrations were not conducted over the same period as simulations owing to missing observation data and observation data outside the calibrated period in several basins were used for validation more is discussed in section 4 3 last but not least we used the dsw salinity data from uehara et al 2014 which was defined as water cooler than 1 5 c at the deepest sampling point in each profile with depth below 100 m we compared their data with both the observed discharge from 11 gauged basins and the simulated discharge from western kp by swat model with time lags between the two components considered more is discussed in section 5 2 4 results 4 1 observed river discharge 4 1 1 seasonal discharge features fig 3 shows boxplots of average monthly discharge of the 11 gauged rivers lines in the middle are monthly mean surface air temperature of the gauged basins no data are available for basin no 10 derived from the weather and climate website in russian https www pogodaiklimat ru discharge of all the 11 rivers increases substantially around may or june to a maximum possibly owing to snowmelt when temperature increases above 0 c around may and then decreases around october when temperature decreases below 0 c this feature is fairly similar to that found in some major siberian rivers e g lena ob yenisei oshima et al 2015 some of the rivers also show an additional peak before the cold season most likely because of relatively higher precipitation around that season it is therefore reasonable to assume that snowmelt water may have a more dominant contribution to discharge than rainfall additionally most of the places on the kp are covered with snow for more than six months of a year fig 2c which could also support this assumption river no 1 penzhina is the only basin located in the northern kp where temperature can be extremely low during cold season causing substantially low discharge during winter despite its considerably large catchment area discharge decreases to nearly zero during midwinter which indicates that the river may be nearly frozen river no 2 kamchatka is the biggest river on the kp by both discharge amount and length and the second biggest by catchment area next to the penzhina discharge from river no 2 reaches its maximum around july which is the latest among the 11 gauged rivers showing a delayed response from its substantially large catchment area even though river no 2 collects considerable water inflow from its massive catchment in the central valley where the river flows annual precipitation can be as low as 350 mm whereas some coastal regions have annual precipitation up to 2500 mm jones and solomina 2015 as a result rainfall appears to be less dominant than snowmelt in river no 2 compared to other rivers this may also be implied as discharge decline becomes seemingly smooth before winter whereas many other rivers nos 4 7 8 9 10 11 show a second peak during the same period seasonal variability is strong among all of the rivers and is most likely caused by variability of both climate and terrain indicating that a monthly discharge estimation is necessary 4 1 2 interannual variation of annual discharge besides great seasonal variability rivers on the kp also show great interannual variability fig 4 when the time scale is sufficiently long enough so that storage components become negligible e g annual water balance within a hydrological cycle can be simplified down to three components precipitation p discharge q and evaporation e as r p e this suggests that annual discharge variation may be caused by either precipitation or evaporation or both to quantitively clarify such relationships we used meteorological observation data from the weather and climate website as options from this data source were limited comparisons were only conducted in basin no 2 from 1971 to 1983 we compared precipitation and evaporation at a middle stream location a dolinovka 55 12 n 159 0 e of river no 2 with its discharge which is measured from a lower stream location b klyuchi 56 3 n 160 8 e monthly discharge at b was found negatively correlated with monthly mean precipitation over a while it shows no such relationship with monthly mean evaporation over a in addition we confirmed that precipitation between a and b are significantly correlated during the comparison period which implies it is very likely that precipitation patterns between the two locations are similar this result suggests precipitation is likely to be the primary reason for interannual variation of annual discharge in river no 2 rather than evaporation which is the same feature as found in the three major siberian rivers oshima et al 2015 we further examined the relationships of interannual variation of annual discharge between the gauged rivers table a1 and observed significant correlations between river nos 2 3 4 5 7 and 8 this finding is reasonable because these basins are relatively close in proximity and therefore likely have similar natural features with such great interannual variability it is possible to expect freshwater discharge from the kp to deliver certain level of impact on dsw salinity through currents and this topic is discussed in section 5 2 4 2 specific discharge based results 4 2 1 west east difference previous studies e g lyon et al 2012 woods et al 1995 have reported that sd often decrease non linearly with respect to catchment area between relatively larger basins which was observed in gauged basins in kp as well fig 5 however a clear difference between sd of basins on the western and eastern kp is worth noticing to further investigate this west east sd difference climate could be a reasonable starting point the climate on kp differs substantially from east to west mainly owing to topographical differences i e the eastern side is mountainous and the western side is relatively flat and contains wetlands even though a definite conclusion is difficult to draw precipitation differences are likely the primary cause of the west east sd difference particularly snowfall related differences arai 1980 discussed a similar sd difference on honshu japan during january to february the study reported that sd in basins on western honshu were distinguishably higher than that on the eastern side during the winter likely due to two main reasons first precipitation is higher in the western side during winter which leads to potentially higher discharge second the western side has more area covered by snow than the eastern side during winter which also leads to potentially higher discharge because snow cover can prevent soil from freezing according to the atlas annual snowfall amount is distinguishably higher in the eastern kp than western kp fig 2b annual duration of cold season is below 200 days for most of the places on the kp fig 2d whereas annual duration of snow cover fig 2c differs substantially between west and east less than 200 days in the west and more than 230 days in the east therefore the logic by arai 1980 can be applied in this study to explain the west east sd difference in the kp during cold season fig 5a in section 4 1 1 we explain the monthly discharge changing sustainably in response to monthly mean surface air temperature likely indicates that snowmelt water may have a more dominant contribution to discharge than rainfall the consistency of west east sd difference from cold season to that of warm season fig 5b and a year fig 5c may support this assumption as well in addition to climate topographical difference may be another reason behind west east sd difference fig 6 shows hypsometric curves of six relatively larger basins between western kp nos 1 3 4 5 and eastern kp nos 2 6 generally non overlapping deviations and the p value indicate a significant difference between the two lines therefore the more concave hypsometric curve of western side could indicate both a higher ratio of subsurface transport and a longer travel time of river flow luo and harlin 2003 vivoni et al 2008 this may also explain the consistency of west east difference between different time periods in fig 5 besides climate and hypsometry geology and vegetation coverage may be worth considering as well however it was reported that the entire kp is extensively covered with volcanic rocks and deposits with different ages and no distinct west east difference of dominant vegetation is shown rather than differences from smaller region to region jones and solomina 2015 it is therefore difficult to draw conclusion from these two points both climate and topographic hypsometry could lead to the west east sd difference while it is unclear which one is more dominant over the other 4 2 2 annual discharge estimation between average annual sd of the 11 gauged basins m3 s 1 km 2 with annual snowfall amount mm p snow fig 2b basin area km2 area average zonal elevation m alt annual duration of snow cover d days fig 2c approximate latitude of basin lat and vegetation coverage percentage veg correlations in all possible combinations of factors were examined with the goal of having low multicollinearity and sufficient significance after the analysis we only found one combination that satisfies the criteria as shown by eq 1 which yields r2 0 83 p 0 001 and both factors having variance inflation factor vif around 1 05 and p value less than 0 01 notice that units of all variables are not standardized as unit is irrelevant in terms of correlation significance which leads to seemingly small coefficients in eq 1 the two factors that yield the best result out of all the factor combinations p snow and days denote annual snowfall amount and annual snow cover duration respectively interestingly despite this analysis being done separately from any process in section 4 2 1 the two factors are parallel to the logic presented by arai 1980 and what we conclude that snowfall amount and snow cover duration may be one of the main sources of the west east sd differences in the kp the consistency between the two results therefore may supports their validity 1 s d 0 0586 0 000025 p s n o w 0 000262 d a y s average annual sd of all ungauged basins can be calculated from eq 1 whereas catchment area can be calculated from dem data average annual discharge of all basins on the kp was therefore derived as 8950 92 22 86 m3 s 1 where 4660 73 25 06 m3 s 1 on the western side and 4290 20 20 53 m3 s 1 on the eastern side the ranges given here were calculated based on the standard error of eq 1 4 3 swat model based results 4 3 1 swat calibration swat simulations in this study were performed from 1979 to 2013 and simulations till 1983 were used as model warm up fig 7 and table 3 describe the calibration results agreements between simulations and observations are generally acceptable while extreme discharge events over all rivers are seemingly difficult to reproduce in simulation river no 3 shows weaker agreement as extraordinarily high summer peaks occurred multiple times in late 1990s while the simulation failed to reproduce them not shown in fig 7 the relatively high baseflow during cold season of river no 5 is not perfectly captured in simulation river nos 3 and 5 show weaker agreements in the validation whereas agreements in other rivers are acceptable therefore we decided not to apply the calibrated parameters of basin no 3 to other ungauged basins as basin no 3 is located in the middle of basin nos 4 and 5 only three basins counted in between the effect of excluding its calibrated parameters to the overall result is negligible calibrated parameters from the remaining seven gauged basins were applied to each of their neighboring ungauged basins the ungauged basins located between each pair of the gauged basins were divided approximately from the middle 4 3 2 monthly discharge estimation by respectively applying the calibrated parameters from each gauged basin on the western kp to their neighboring ungauged basins monthly discharge from the western kp from 1984 2013 was simulated in swat overall 99 basins were counted in this result monthly peak discharge appears in june then decreases gradually towards winter when the monthly base flow becomes less than 3000 m3 s 1 average annual discharge from the western kp during 1984 1996 is 4689 m3 s 1 which is comparable to that from sd based estimation 4661 25 m3 s 1 average monthly discharge from the western kp is shown in fig 8 5 discussion 5 1 discharge estimations average annual discharge estimation in section 4 2 2 is calculated from eq 1 which essentially used two average annual data from the atlas even though these two components snowfall amount and duration of snow cover were chosen based on statistical results they are parallel to the results in section 4 2 1 where the west east sd difference in kp is explained by a logic developed in one previous study that suggests the same two components are likely the cause for such differences arai 1980 however because the two data in atlas were averaged from unknown year to 1996 at most as the atlas was published in 1997 our annual discharge estimation is essentially an average estimation during an unclear period before 1997 estimation of monthly discharge from western kp from 1984 2013 includes 99 individual basins and it was derived from swat simulations one major advantage of using swat is that effects of different terrains on river travel time are considered neitsch et al 2011 which is crucial for discussion of sub annual relationship between freshwater discharge and dsw salinity presented in section 5 2 swat simulations in gauged basins were calibrated to an acceptable degree table 3 however some of the parameter values may not be realistic table a2 mainly smtmp snowmelt base temperature while involvement of more parameters during calibration is associated with a higher likelihood to avoid inaccurate process and consequently parameter values may become more realistic abbaspour 2015 it is difficult to include more theoretically meaningful parameters while maintaining acceptable agreement between simulation and observation and maintaining consistency of each parameter s sensitivity in all different basins this challenge could be a meaningful topic for future study overall the satisfactory agreement between the average annual discharge of sd based results 4661 25 m3 s 1 and that of swat based results 4689 m3 s 1 could possibly imply the validity in both estimations 5 2 impacts of river discharge from kp on dsw salinity the possible relationship between freshwater discharge from the kp and dsw salinity was first hinted by the discovery from uehara et al 2014 that annual mean precipitation over kp is negatively correlated with dsw salinity and with the discharge estimations from our study it is now possible to verify and advance upon this relationship observed river discharge data shows great interannual variability in all gauged basins fig 4 which further implies the potential impact towards dsw salinity we therefore compared the interannual variation of annual discharge of each gauged basin with the annual dsw salinity anomaly during 1943 2003 table 4 during the statistical comparisons a time lag by the unit of month was considered between the two components by shifting the averaging period for annual discharge e g if the time lag is set as 2 months the annual discharge of 1991 of a river would be averaged from the monthly discharge of nov 1990 to oct 1991 two major difficulties exist in the comparisons first missing data exist in both dsw salinity anomaly data and observed discharge data which lead to removal of years when data is missing in either dataset causing some of the comparisons become shorter and discontinuous second a statistically significant correlation does not necessarily ensure a definite connection from which a reasonable time lag must be found as well therefore while significant correlations exist in table 4 it is difficult to find any meaningful pattern in time lags that lead to significant correlation between different basins by using the monthly discharge estimations from swat simulations during 1984 2013 same comparisons were conducted in the eight gauged basins located on the western kp table 5 this time one of the major difficulties i e missing discharge data became irrelevant as all simulations are continuous and from the same period which possibly lead to a larger number of significant correlations while the time lags that lead to significant correlations in each basin do not show meaningful and significant correlation with respect to distance from basin location to dsw formation location possibly because velocity of ocean currents are more complex and different from place to place rather than being constant they are comparable between tables 4 and 5 and are generally less than six to seven months which is comparable to the previous findings that dsw salinity anomaly is correlated with annual mean precipitation variation over kp when the latter precedes the former by one year and that surface sea water circulation process has a one year time gap between eastern kp coast region to the northern sea of okhotsk matsuda et al 2015 uehara et al 2014 all of the findings in previous studies that related to this discussion were concluded on annual scale without direct involvement of terrestrial processes whereas our results present a sub annual understanding with details over the continental side considered we identify this as one major advancement of the present study compared to the previous ones moreover we tried to test time lags in all basins on the western kp with respect to the dsw salinity anomaly because it is not practical to respectively conduct the testing in all 99 basins on the western kp as that leads to an excessive amount of combinations we divided the basins into seven sections roughly based on the topography fig 9 and then tested different time lags we tested time lags from 0 to 12 months in each basin table a3 and found the most significant correlation between annual dsw salinity anomaly and interannual variation of annual discharge from western kp yields r2 0 36 p 0 01 when time lag by month was given in each section as 2 2 5 3 5 2 1 from section no 1 7 respectively in addition we found that this negative correlation becomes stronger when years with less discharge variation being gradually excluded fig 10 this reflects the findings from previous studies that other factors including sea ice production surface sea water freshening and wind driven ocean circulation may also affect the properties of dsw fujisaki et al 2011 matsuda et al 2009 ohshima et al 2014 compared to these previous studies our results provide a quantitative and direct evidence for the first time that besides processes over the ocean side freshwater input from the continental side also delivers impact to the dsw salinity impact from freshwater discharge to such large scale ocean process as thermohaline circulation has rarely been reported therefore our study may highlight the significance of this topic for future studies 6 conclusions official observed monthly discharge data from 11 rivers on the kp were obtained for the first time and used for analysis and estimations of freshwater discharge from the kp annual sd of the 11 gauged basins are distinguishably different between western and eastern kp which are likely caused by west east differences of snowfall amount and snow cover duration correlations between annual sd and several other features of the 11 gauged basins were analyzed using multiple regression analysis a significant correlation yields r2 0 83 p 0 001 was found between annual sd with annual snowfall amount and annual snow cover duration which is consistent with the property of sd reported in previous study sd values of the ungauged basins on the kp were calculated using the correlation annual discharge from the entire kp was estimated as 8950 92 22 86 m3 s 1 4660 73 25 06 m3 s 1 from the western kp and 4290 20 20 53 m3 s 1 from the eastern kp monthly discharge from 1984 2013 from eight gauged basins on the western kp were simulated in the swat model and calibrated to an acceptable degree nse 0 5 r2 0 5 by respectively applying the calibrated parameters from the gauged basins to their neighboring ungauged basins monthly discharge from the western kp during 1984 2013 was simulated after applying a series of time lags to the monthly discharge estimations significant negative correlation was observed between the interannual variation of annual discharge from western kp with the interannual variation of dsw salinity r2 0 36 p 0 01 in the most significant case while the correlation is only a rough representation of the precise mechanism this finding verifies that freshwater discharge from the western kp is a critical factor that affects the dsw salinity for future improvements simulations of the swat model can be refined by carefully including more parameters in the calibrations correlations between the monthly discharge from western kp and dsw salinity may become clearer by accounting for precipitation over sea surface and applying the current methods to basins in areas west of the kp from which the dsw salinity may be influenced as well combining the findings on both ocean side and terrestrial side may bring a better understanding of the dsw formation mechanism overall this study presents quantitative and direct evidence that freshwater discharge into oceans in the pacific sector may deliver impact to large scale ocean processes which has rarely been reported and may hopefully invite more attention to this topic in the future author statement muqing shi conceptualization methodology formal analysis

8179,study region kamchatka peninsula russian federation study focus the strength of an overturning process of north pacific sea water originating in the sea of okhotsk is determined by the sea water salinity in the area recent observations show that the overturning process is important to the entire north pacific and is statistically related to the precipitation over the kamchatka peninsula kp this study uses estimations based on specific discharge and the soil and water assessment tool swat to verify and further explore the connection between the terrestrial freshwater discharge from kp and the overturning process new hydrological insights for the region previously inaccessible observed discharge data from 11 major rivers on the kp were obtained and analyzed for the first time based on the data we estimate annual discharge from the entire kp using the specific discharge and regression analysis and we then simulate monthly discharge from the western kp using the swat model our result shows a significant negative correlation r2 0 36 p 0 01 between the interannual variation of sea water salinity in the overturning process area and the variation of annual freshwater discharge from the western kp therefore successfully verifies that freshwater discharge from the western kp is a critical factor that affects the strength of the overturning process keywords freshwater discharge kamchatka peninsula sea of okhotsk dense shelf water swat model 1 introduction roughly 45 500 km3 of water flows from rivers into oceans around the globe every year which only accounts for approximately 0 003 of water in oceans oki and kanae 2006 numerous studies have pointed out that freshwater discharge into oceans can deliver impacts in terms of mass change sediment transport and salinity fluctuation curry et al 2003 vinayachandran et al 2015 yamamoto kawai et al 2008 among them sea water salinity fluctuation due to freshwater fluxes is the one that may cause impact on a larger scale in many polar and subpolar oceans such as arctic and atlantic oceans significant freshening has been observed and attributed to an acceleration of the global hydrological cycle dickson et al 2002 peterson et al 2002 in the subpolar north atlantic for instance freshening extends to the deeper levels and causes the freshening of north atlantic deep water nadw which may subsequently lead to a weakening of the large scale meridional overturning circulation hansen et al 2004 being fairly similar to the formation of nadw an overturning process of north pacific water originates in the sea of okhotsk under a shallower depth where active sea ice production happens in its northwestern shelf polynya shcherbina et al 2003 the sea of okhotsk is a marginal sea located on the northwest rim of the north pacific and is the southernmost sea in the northern hemisphere with considerable seasonal ice cover nihashi et al 2009 brine rejection occurs during sea ice production which increases the salinity and density of surface sea water and leads to the formation of dense shelf water with potential density of up to 27 0 σ θ dsw gladyshev et al 2000 kitani 1973 shcherbina et al 2004 2003 after leaving the shelves dsw is transported southward by cyclonic ocean circulation in the sea of okhotsk fukamachi et al 2004 mizuta et al 2003 the dsw carries cold oxygenated and nutrient rich water and flows out from the sea of okhotsk to form what is called the north pacific intermediate water npiw which is comparable to the nadw yasuda 1997 recent observations suggest that the okhotsk outflow is a potential source of the micronutrient iron in the iron limited high nitrate low chlorophyll north pacific and it plays a key role in the cycle of biogeochemical properties in the north pacific such as active gas exchange and sediment material e g dissolved organic carbon transport hansell et al 2002 nishioka et al 2013 2007 wong et al 1998 strength of the overturning process in the sea of okhotsk is determined by the sea water salinity and uehara et al 2014 concluded that upper layer salinity anomalies propagate along pathways from the bering sea to the northwestern shelf region of the sea of okhotsk and precondition the variations of dsw salinity in the following winter fig 1 upper layer salinity signals can be traced further upstream from the bering sea to the alaskan stream and the western subarctic gyre previous studies have shown that sea ice production surface sea water freshening and wind driven ocean circulation may have impacts on the properties of dsw fujisaki et al 2011 matsuda et al 2009 ohshima et al 2014 and those studies focus mainly on the ocean side the terrestrial side is not often discussed possibly due to limitation of related data uehara et al 2014 revealed a significant negative correlation between the dsw salinity anomaly in the northeastern sea of okhotsk and annual mean precipitation variation over the kamchatka peninsula kp when the latter precedes the former by one year there are numerous rivers on the massive land of kp approximately 472 300 km2 and annual precipitation varies from approximately 350 2500 mm jones and solomina 2015 the kp is located at the relatively up stream section of the sea salt pathway compared with the northern sea of okhotsk freshwater discharge from rivers on the kp to its surrounding oceans eastern sea of okhotsk and north pacific therefore very likely delivers non negligible impact on the dsw formation by freshening the surface sea water salinity such relationship between freshwater discharge and large scale ocean process as thermohaline circulation once verified could highlight the significance of impacts from freshwater discharge to oceans in the pacific sector and potentially encourage more attention on such topic however no study has been done on this topic in the region as the observed hydrological data of kp is highly limited in 2016 under the collaboration between the federal service for hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring of russia roshydromet and the institute of volcanology and seismology far eastern branch of russian academy of sciences ivs feb ras official observed river discharge data of 11 major rivers on the kp was obtained for the first time based on these data we fixed the objectives as to estimate freshwater discharge from kp to its surrounding oceans and to examine its relationship with the dsw formation 2 study area the kp is a remote area located in russian far east with an approximate area of 472 300 km2 with the sea of okhotsk on the west and the pacific ocean on the east the kp is located on several large volcanic belts making it the most active volcanic area on the eurasian continent climate of the kp is influenced by its position at the eastern margin of the asian landmass its mountain ranges the cold ocean currents to the east and by the sea of okhotsk to the west jones and solomina 2015 the summers are cool while winters are cold and long usually lasting from october to may mainly because of the cold arctic winds from siberia and the cold oyashio sea current qiu 2001 nevertheless the kp has considerable variability in terms of climate the kp generally has a subarctic climate while higher and more northern areas have a polar climate peel et al 2007 two major north south mountain ranges the central range and eastern range also cause climate variations especially in terms of precipitation the western coast is relatively colder the central valley between the two ranges is drier and the eastern coast is milder jones and solomina 2015 the kamchatka river is the biggest river on the kp and originates in the mountains of the southern central valley flows northward down the valley and eventually enters the north pacific from the eastern side of klyuchevskaya sopka the highest mountain 4 750 m on the kp one previous study was dedicated to the hydrological features of the kamchatka river frolova et al 2014 while generally speaking study of such topic in the kp region is scarce likely due to high data limitation even though nearly 200 000 people live in petropavlovsk kamchatsky which is the capital city of kp the entire peninsula s population in 2019 was only 314 723 russian federal state statistics service 2020 with such a low population density constant scientific monitoring can be a huge challenge in most places nevertheless several observation stations across the kp have collected meteorological and or hydrological data for many decades some dating back to the 1930s in this study both long term and recent data were used human interference is considered to be negligible during all of the estimations 3 materials and methods predictions in ungauged basins pub is one of the major issues in hydrology and it is also the core topic of the present study the international association of hydrological sciences iahs conducted an initiative called the prediction in ungauged basins from 2003 to 2013 aiming to reduce uncertainty in hydrological predictions by exploring new theories and techniques sivapalan et al 2003 since then advances have been made in many aspects including data collecting techniques krajewski et al 2006 schmugge et al 2002 soulsby et al 2008 process understanding blume et al 2008 model structure blöschl et al 2013 and model uncertainty assessment nester et al 2012 pappenberger et al 2005 while challenges such as robust predictions in ungauged region and harmonization of modelling strategies still remain hrachowitz et al 2013 kp on the other hand is an extremely challenging region for pub studies due to high limitation of both hydrological and meteorological observation data either inaccessible or non existent and high difficulties in conducting both field survey and remote sensing as foreign researchers estimations of river discharge at ungauged basins are generally made based on observed data and theoretical calculations of neighboring gauged basins that possess similar features hrachowitz et al 2013 therefore even under such difficult premises we still identify observation data and official data as the benchmark for our estimations the most essential dataset we obtained includes 13 sets of long term monthly river discharge data from 11 different basins on the kp one set no 2c table 1 is open access data from the global runoff data centre grdc germany river discharge data and the other twelve sets were initially monitored at hydrometeorological posts and stations for selected rivers in the kp region by the roshydromet and provided to the ivs feb ras via collaboration a part of the data from roshydromet was already published in printed form hydrometeoizdat 1987 1977 1973 locations of the 11 basins are shown in fig 2 a time span of the data varies from 30 years to more than 70 years table 1 and basin size also varies from relatively small basins to two of the largest basins on the kp i e the kamchatka river basin and penzhina river basin missing data exist in almost all of the 13 sets therefore depending on the specific objective and method not all of the 13 sets were used in all parts of the study river basin characteristics are discussed in section 4 1 another official dataset we obtained is a publication named world atlas of snow and ice resources hereinafter referred to as the atlas kotlyakov 1997 the beginning of creating the atlas dated back to mid 1970s and took over 300 ussr specialists for more than 20 years till 1997 to reach publication representing the largest project of the intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp of unesco at the time kotlyakov 1999 the atlas contains more than 1000 maps with different scales covering both russian ussr at the time territory and other regions around the world while one major issue exists i e there is no description regarding the data time span from which each map was created we do recognize the uniqueness of the atlas and data extracted from three individual maps of the kp were used in this study annual snowfall amount fig 2b annual duration of snow cover fig 2c and annual duration of cold season number of days with surface air temperature below 0 c in a year fig 2d most of the data in the atlas are presented as contour lines instead of numerical values therefore in order to identify data value at a basin scale we manually created grid with hundreds of intersections over each map and calculated the average of values at all the intersections within the given basin notice that fig 2b c and d were respectively simplified based on the original maps in the atlas namely contour intervals in each map were reduced for demonstration purpose even though the atlas is the only official data we possess besides the observed discharge data its main focus is snow related issues instead of hydrology we therefore decided to use a hydrological definition named specific discharge sd to draw connection onto discharge estimation sd m3 s 1 km 2 is the discharge q m3 s 1 per unit area a km2 of an up stream basin woods et al 1995 it is possible for rivers with different sizes to have the same discharge value at a given time but this often implies substantially different meanings whereas sd of different basins may provide more information when comparing their values previous studies have shown that sd can represent many features of its basin as it is non linearly correlated with the catchment area woods et al 1995 and it is mostly climate and geology dependent komatsu and onda 1996 lyon et al 2012 it is therefore possible to estimate the sd of ungauged basins on the basis of gauged basins that share similar features in the case of having limited observation data sd is considered useful for estimating river discharge in this study we prepared the following six factors by considering data quality and potential of being correlated with the average annual sd of the 11 gauged basins m3 s 1 km 2 annual snowfall amount mm fig 2b basin area km2 average zonal elevation m annual duration of snow cover d fig 2c approximate latitude of basin and vegetation coverage percentage basin area and average zonal elevation were calculated from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem v 2 japan s ministry of economy trade and industry and the u s national aeronautics and space administration vegetation coverage was derived from the global drainage basin database masutomi et al 2009 notice that all components included here are either average value or constant value mainly because of the atlas data are average data which means the estimation based on these components is also a one time averaged estimation correlations between the six factors and average annual sd were analyzed by multiple regression analysis more is discussed in section 4 2 to advance upon the finding by uehara et al 2014 that annual mean precipitation over kp is statistically related to annual dsw salinity anomaly with a one year time gap in between a more physical approach and a shorter time scale e g monthly should be the new basis while new models for pub topics have been under active developments over the past decades many model comparison studies duan et al 2006 franchini and pacciani 1991 gan and burges 1990 perrin et al 2001 reed et al 2004 rutter et al 2009 are suggesting that it is essential to realize in model selection there is no need to find the best model but rather that individual model performances vary with the setting nevertheless it is desirable to ensure model parameters are well constrained and to ensure models have a complete and physically realistic representation of dominant processes hrachowitz et al 2013 under such criteria in addition to the situation in kp we decided to use the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 an open access hydrological model for the secondary estimation in recent years swat has been applied frequently to both small basins e g rostamian et al 2008 spruill et al 2000 and large basins e g abbaspour et al 2015 schuol et al 2008 and has been proved useful for pub studies golmohammadi et al 2014 in this study calculations in swat used the soil conservation service scs curve number method mockus 1972 for surface runoff a modified rational method chow et al 1988 for peak runoff rate the hallow aquifer storage concept arnold et al 1993 for contribution from groundwater flow and the penman monteith method monteith 1965 for potential evapotranspiration table 2 shows inputs used in this study as the most important input for swat meteorological data was derived from the national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr reliability of cfsr data has been verified by many previous studies e g cuceloglu and ozturk 2019 he et al 2016 and was proved capable of representing the climatological seasonal patterns in arctic regions and some major siberian rivers lindsay et al 2014 oshima et al 2015 which have similar characteristics as rivers on the kp daily data of precipitation mm maximum and minimum temperature c wind speed m s 1 relative humidity and solar radiation mj m 2 during january 1 1979 to december 31 2013 were used as the kp is considered pristine with very limited human interference zoelen 2002 both land uses map and soil map were selected from fixed and relatively recent year instead of multiple years as a rainfall runoff model calibration is always necessary for swat in this study we used the sequential uncertainty fitting v 2 algorithm sufi 2 under the calibration and uncertainty procedures program swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 for calibrations excessive number of parameters are related to river discharge in the swat model while we selected parameters for calibration under the following criteria 1 to represent two of the most major basin features on the kp i e groundwater and snowmelt and 2 to contribute to a useful calibration result with high sensitivity p 0 05 not just in one but all given basins after numerous testing calibrations cn2 smtmp smfmx snocovmx sno50cov gw delay gwqmn and alpha bf were selected for calibrations in each basin detail of parameters is discussed in the swat official manual arnold et al 2012 even though soil properties are also directly related to river discharge we decided to leave them uncalibrated to avoid over tuning as we possess no soil information of the kp with proper resolution additionally while glacier exists in several parts of the kp an estimation of annual glacier runoff over 22 regions was reported in the atlas by numerical value instead of contour line as 62 5 m3 s 1 which is fairly low compared to river discharge we therefore decided not to include contribution from glacier discharge in our estimations calibration is usually done by confronting simulations with observations in other words calibration is technically practical in gauged basins therefore to meaningfully simulate the other ungauged basins without calibration the idea of regionalization with physical similarity approach bárdossy 2007 mengistu et al 2019 was applied simulations in each gauged basin were calibrated to a reasonable degree and then their calibrated parameter values were applied to their neighboring basins respectively this approach is the reason why we calibrated the same abovementioned parameters in every gauged basin so that applying parameter values to ungauged basins could be a consistent process in addition basins on the eastern kp were excluded in this approach as having only three gauged basins with relatively small distance to each other is inadequate to conduct the same process the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse krause et al 2005 and r square were used to quantify the calibration quality nse values above 0 5 were treated as acceptable moriasi et al 2007 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 calibrations were not conducted over the same period as simulations owing to missing observation data and observation data outside the calibrated period in several basins were used for validation more is discussed in section 4 3 last but not least we used the dsw salinity data from uehara et al 2014 which was defined as water cooler than 1 5 c at the deepest sampling point in each profile with depth below 100 m we compared their data with both the observed discharge from 11 gauged basins and the simulated discharge from western kp by swat model with time lags between the two components considered more is discussed in section 5 2 4 results 4 1 observed river discharge 4 1 1 seasonal discharge features fig 3 shows boxplots of average monthly discharge of the 11 gauged rivers lines in the middle are monthly mean surface air temperature of the gauged basins no data are available for basin no 10 derived from the weather and climate website in russian https www pogodaiklimat ru discharge of all the 11 rivers increases substantially around may or june to a maximum possibly owing to snowmelt when temperature increases above 0 c around may and then decreases around october when temperature decreases below 0 c this feature is fairly similar to that found in some major siberian rivers e g lena ob yenisei oshima et al 2015 some of the rivers also show an additional peak before the cold season most likely because of relatively higher precipitation around that season it is therefore reasonable to assume that snowmelt water may have a more dominant contribution to discharge than rainfall additionally most of the places on the kp are covered with snow for more than six months of a year fig 2c which could also support this assumption river no 1 penzhina is the only basin located in the northern kp where temperature can be extremely low during cold season causing substantially low discharge during winter despite its considerably large catchment area discharge decreases to nearly zero during midwinter which indicates that the river may be nearly frozen river no 2 kamchatka is the biggest river on the kp by both discharge amount and length and the second biggest by catchment area next to the penzhina discharge from river no 2 reaches its maximum around july which is the latest among the 11 gauged rivers showing a delayed response from its substantially large catchment area even though river no 2 collects considerable water inflow from its massive catchment in the central valley where the river flows annual precipitation can be as low as 350 mm whereas some coastal regions have annual precipitation up to 2500 mm jones and solomina 2015 as a result rainfall appears to be less dominant than snowmelt in river no 2 compared to other rivers this may also be implied as discharge decline becomes seemingly smooth before winter whereas many other rivers nos 4 7 8 9 10 11 show a second peak during the same period seasonal variability is strong among all of the rivers and is most likely caused by variability of both climate and terrain indicating that a monthly discharge estimation is necessary 4 1 2 interannual variation of annual discharge besides great seasonal variability rivers on the kp also show great interannual variability fig 4 when the time scale is sufficiently long enough so that storage components become negligible e g annual water balance within a hydrological cycle can be simplified down to three components precipitation p discharge q and evaporation e as r p e this suggests that annual discharge variation may be caused by either precipitation or evaporation or both to quantitively clarify such relationships we used meteorological observation data from the weather and climate website as options from this data source were limited comparisons were only conducted in basin no 2 from 1971 to 1983 we compared precipitation and evaporation at a middle stream location a dolinovka 55 12 n 159 0 e of river no 2 with its discharge which is measured from a lower stream location b klyuchi 56 3 n 160 8 e monthly discharge at b was found negatively correlated with monthly mean precipitation over a while it shows no such relationship with monthly mean evaporation over a in addition we confirmed that precipitation between a and b are significantly correlated during the comparison period which implies it is very likely that precipitation patterns between the two locations are similar this result suggests precipitation is likely to be the primary reason for interannual variation of annual discharge in river no 2 rather than evaporation which is the same feature as found in the three major siberian rivers oshima et al 2015 we further examined the relationships of interannual variation of annual discharge between the gauged rivers table a1 and observed significant correlations between river nos 2 3 4 5 7 and 8 this finding is reasonable because these basins are relatively close in proximity and therefore likely have similar natural features with such great interannual variability it is possible to expect freshwater discharge from the kp to deliver certain level of impact on dsw salinity through currents and this topic is discussed in section 5 2 4 2 specific discharge based results 4 2 1 west east difference previous studies e g lyon et al 2012 woods et al 1995 have reported that sd often decrease non linearly with respect to catchment area between relatively larger basins which was observed in gauged basins in kp as well fig 5 however a clear difference between sd of basins on the western and eastern kp is worth noticing to further investigate this west east sd difference climate could be a reasonable starting point the climate on kp differs substantially from east to west mainly owing to topographical differences i e the eastern side is mountainous and the western side is relatively flat and contains wetlands even though a definite conclusion is difficult to draw precipitation differences are likely the primary cause of the west east sd difference particularly snowfall related differences arai 1980 discussed a similar sd difference on honshu japan during january to february the study reported that sd in basins on western honshu were distinguishably higher than that on the eastern side during the winter likely due to two main reasons first precipitation is higher in the western side during winter which leads to potentially higher discharge second the western side has more area covered by snow than the eastern side during winter which also leads to potentially higher discharge because snow cover can prevent soil from freezing according to the atlas annual snowfall amount is distinguishably higher in the eastern kp than western kp fig 2b annual duration of cold season is below 200 days for most of the places on the kp fig 2d whereas annual duration of snow cover fig 2c differs substantially between west and east less than 200 days in the west and more than 230 days in the east therefore the logic by arai 1980 can be applied in this study to explain the west east sd difference in the kp during cold season fig 5a in section 4 1 1 we explain the monthly discharge changing sustainably in response to monthly mean surface air temperature likely indicates that snowmelt water may have a more dominant contribution to discharge than rainfall the consistency of west east sd difference from cold season to that of warm season fig 5b and a year fig 5c may support this assumption as well in addition to climate topographical difference may be another reason behind west east sd difference fig 6 shows hypsometric curves of six relatively larger basins between western kp nos 1 3 4 5 and eastern kp nos 2 6 generally non overlapping deviations and the p value indicate a significant difference between the two lines therefore the more concave hypsometric curve of western side could indicate both a higher ratio of subsurface transport and a longer travel time of river flow luo and harlin 2003 vivoni et al 2008 this may also explain the consistency of west east difference between different time periods in fig 5 besides climate and hypsometry geology and vegetation coverage may be worth considering as well however it was reported that the entire kp is extensively covered with volcanic rocks and deposits with different ages and no distinct west east difference of dominant vegetation is shown rather than differences from smaller region to region jones and solomina 2015 it is therefore difficult to draw conclusion from these two points both climate and topographic hypsometry could lead to the west east sd difference while it is unclear which one is more dominant over the other 4 2 2 annual discharge estimation between average annual sd of the 11 gauged basins m3 s 1 km 2 with annual snowfall amount mm p snow fig 2b basin area km2 area average zonal elevation m alt annual duration of snow cover d days fig 2c approximate latitude of basin lat and vegetation coverage percentage veg correlations in all possible combinations of factors were examined with the goal of having low multicollinearity and sufficient significance after the analysis we only found one combination that satisfies the criteria as shown by eq 1 which yields r2 0 83 p 0 001 and both factors having variance inflation factor vif around 1 05 and p value less than 0 01 notice that units of all variables are not standardized as unit is irrelevant in terms of correlation significance which leads to seemingly small coefficients in eq 1 the two factors that yield the best result out of all the factor combinations p snow and days denote annual snowfall amount and annual snow cover duration respectively interestingly despite this analysis being done separately from any process in section 4 2 1 the two factors are parallel to the logic presented by arai 1980 and what we conclude that snowfall amount and snow cover duration may be one of the main sources of the west east sd differences in the kp the consistency between the two results therefore may supports their validity 1 s d 0 0586 0 000025 p s n o w 0 000262 d a y s average annual sd of all ungauged basins can be calculated from eq 1 whereas catchment area can be calculated from dem data average annual discharge of all basins on the kp was therefore derived as 8950 92 22 86 m3 s 1 where 4660 73 25 06 m3 s 1 on the western side and 4290 20 20 53 m3 s 1 on the eastern side the ranges given here were calculated based on the standard error of eq 1 4 3 swat model based results 4 3 1 swat calibration swat simulations in this study were performed from 1979 to 2013 and simulations till 1983 were used as model warm up fig 7 and table 3 describe the calibration results agreements between simulations and observations are generally acceptable while extreme discharge events over all rivers are seemingly difficult to reproduce in simulation river no 3 shows weaker agreement as extraordinarily high summer peaks occurred multiple times in late 1990s while the simulation failed to reproduce them not shown in fig 7 the relatively high baseflow during cold season of river no 5 is not perfectly captured in simulation river nos 3 and 5 show weaker agreements in the validation whereas agreements in other rivers are acceptable therefore we decided not to apply the calibrated parameters of basin no 3 to other ungauged basins as basin no 3 is located in the middle of basin nos 4 and 5 only three basins counted in between the effect of excluding its calibrated parameters to the overall result is negligible calibrated parameters from the remaining seven gauged basins were applied to each of their neighboring ungauged basins the ungauged basins located between each pair of the gauged basins were divided approximately from the middle 4 3 2 monthly discharge estimation by respectively applying the calibrated parameters from each gauged basin on the western kp to their neighboring ungauged basins monthly discharge from the western kp from 1984 2013 was simulated in swat overall 99 basins were counted in this result monthly peak discharge appears in june then decreases gradually towards winter when the monthly base flow becomes less than 3000 m3 s 1 average annual discharge from the western kp during 1984 1996 is 4689 m3 s 1 which is comparable to that from sd based estimation 4661 25 m3 s 1 average monthly discharge from the western kp is shown in fig 8 5 discussion 5 1 discharge estimations average annual discharge estimation in section 4 2 2 is calculated from eq 1 which essentially used two average annual data from the atlas even though these two components snowfall amount and duration of snow cover were chosen based on statistical results they are parallel to the results in section 4 2 1 where the west east sd difference in kp is explained by a logic developed in one previous study that suggests the same two components are likely the cause for such differences arai 1980 however because the two data in atlas were averaged from unknown year to 1996 at most as the atlas was published in 1997 our annual discharge estimation is essentially an average estimation during an unclear period before 1997 estimation of monthly discharge from western kp from 1984 2013 includes 99 individual basins and it was derived from swat simulations one major advantage of using swat is that effects of different terrains on river travel time are considered neitsch et al 2011 which is crucial for discussion of sub annual relationship between freshwater discharge and dsw salinity presented in section 5 2 swat simulations in gauged basins were calibrated to an acceptable degree table 3 however some of the parameter values may not be realistic table a2 mainly smtmp snowmelt base temperature while involvement of more parameters during calibration is associated with a higher likelihood to avoid inaccurate process and consequently parameter values may become more realistic abbaspour 2015 it is difficult to include more theoretically meaningful parameters while maintaining acceptable agreement between simulation and observation and maintaining consistency of each parameter s sensitivity in all different basins this challenge could be a meaningful topic for future study overall the satisfactory agreement between the average annual discharge of sd based results 4661 25 m3 s 1 and that of swat based results 4689 m3 s 1 could possibly imply the validity in both estimations 5 2 impacts of river discharge from kp on dsw salinity the possible relationship between freshwater discharge from the kp and dsw salinity was first hinted by the discovery from uehara et al 2014 that annual mean precipitation over kp is negatively correlated with dsw salinity and with the discharge estimations from our study it is now possible to verify and advance upon this relationship observed river discharge data shows great interannual variability in all gauged basins fig 4 which further implies the potential impact towards dsw salinity we therefore compared the interannual variation of annual discharge of each gauged basin with the annual dsw salinity anomaly during 1943 2003 table 4 during the statistical comparisons a time lag by the unit of month was considered between the two components by shifting the averaging period for annual discharge e g if the time lag is set as 2 months the annual discharge of 1991 of a river would be averaged from the monthly discharge of nov 1990 to oct 1991 two major difficulties exist in the comparisons first missing data exist in both dsw salinity anomaly data and observed discharge data which lead to removal of years when data is missing in either dataset causing some of the comparisons become shorter and discontinuous second a statistically significant correlation does not necessarily ensure a definite connection from which a reasonable time lag must be found as well therefore while significant correlations exist in table 4 it is difficult to find any meaningful pattern in time lags that lead to significant correlation between different basins by using the monthly discharge estimations from swat simulations during 1984 2013 same comparisons were conducted in the eight gauged basins located on the western kp table 5 this time one of the major difficulties i e missing discharge data became irrelevant as all simulations are continuous and from the same period which possibly lead to a larger number of significant correlations while the time lags that lead to significant correlations in each basin do not show meaningful and significant correlation with respect to distance from basin location to dsw formation location possibly because velocity of ocean currents are more complex and different from place to place rather than being constant they are comparable between tables 4 and 5 and are generally less than six to seven months which is comparable to the previous findings that dsw salinity anomaly is correlated with annual mean precipitation variation over kp when the latter precedes the former by one year and that surface sea water circulation process has a one year time gap between eastern kp coast region to the northern sea of okhotsk matsuda et al 2015 uehara et al 2014 all of the findings in previous studies that related to this discussion were concluded on annual scale without direct involvement of terrestrial processes whereas our results present a sub annual understanding with details over the continental side considered we identify this as one major advancement of the present study compared to the previous ones moreover we tried to test time lags in all basins on the western kp with respect to the dsw salinity anomaly because it is not practical to respectively conduct the testing in all 99 basins on the western kp as that leads to an excessive amount of combinations we divided the basins into seven sections roughly based on the topography fig 9 and then tested different time lags we tested time lags from 0 to 12 months in each basin table a3 and found the most significant correlation between annual dsw salinity anomaly and interannual variation of annual discharge from western kp yields r2 0 36 p 0 01 when time lag by month was given in each section as 2 2 5 3 5 2 1 from section no 1 7 respectively in addition we found that this negative correlation becomes stronger when years with less discharge variation being gradually excluded fig 10 this reflects the findings from previous studies that other factors including sea ice production surface sea water freshening and wind driven ocean circulation may also affect the properties of dsw fujisaki et al 2011 matsuda et al 2009 ohshima et al 2014 compared to these previous studies our results provide a quantitative and direct evidence for the first time that besides processes over the ocean side freshwater input from the continental side also delivers impact to the dsw salinity impact from freshwater discharge to such large scale ocean process as thermohaline circulation has rarely been reported therefore our study may highlight the significance of this topic for future studies 6 conclusions official observed monthly discharge data from 11 rivers on the kp were obtained for the first time and used for analysis and estimations of freshwater discharge from the kp annual sd of the 11 gauged basins are distinguishably different between western and eastern kp which are likely caused by west east differences of snowfall amount and snow cover duration correlations between annual sd and several other features of the 11 gauged basins were analyzed using multiple regression analysis a significant correlation yields r2 0 83 p 0 001 was found between annual sd with annual snowfall amount and annual snow cover duration which is consistent with the property of sd reported in previous study sd values of the ungauged basins on the kp were calculated using the correlation annual discharge from the entire kp was estimated as 8950 92 22 86 m3 s 1 4660 73 25 06 m3 s 1 from the western kp and 4290 20 20 53 m3 s 1 from the eastern kp monthly discharge from 1984 2013 from eight gauged basins on the western kp were simulated in the swat model and calibrated to an acceptable degree nse 0 5 r2 0 5 by respectively applying the calibrated parameters from the gauged basins to their neighboring ungauged basins monthly discharge from the western kp during 1984 2013 was simulated after applying a series of time lags to the monthly discharge estimations significant negative correlation was observed between the interannual variation of annual discharge from western kp with the interannual variation of dsw salinity r2 0 36 p 0 01 in the most significant case while the correlation is only a rough representation of the precise mechanism this finding verifies that freshwater discharge from the western kp is a critical factor that affects the dsw salinity for future improvements simulations of the swat model can be refined by carefully including more parameters in the calibrations correlations between the monthly discharge from western kp and dsw salinity may become clearer by accounting for precipitation over sea surface and applying the current methods to basins in areas west of the kp from which the dsw salinity may be influenced as well combining the findings on both ocean side and terrestrial side may bring a better understanding of the dsw formation mechanism overall this study presents quantitative and direct evidence that freshwater discharge into oceans in the pacific sector may deliver impact to large scale ocean processes which has rarely been reported and may hopefully invite more attention to this topic in the future author statement muqing shi conceptualization methodology formal analysis
