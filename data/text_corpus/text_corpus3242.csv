16210,algal bacterial granular sludge abgs is a promising technology for wastewater treatment benefiting from the synergetic interactions between algae and bacteria however the rapid start up of the abgs system is not trivial herein a novel strategy was proposed by applying the algal mycelial pellets amps as the primary nuclei for accelerating the development of a self sustaining symbiotic abgs system the results indicated that by using this strategy complete granulation was shortened to 12 days much shorter than the control system without amps dosage 28 days the abgs had a large particle diameter 3 3 mm compact granular structure 1 0253 g ml and excellent settleability svi30 of 53 2 ml g moreover 98 6 of cod 80 8 of tn and 80 0 of po4 3 p were removed by the abgs the nuclei of targeted algae chlorella and filamentous fungi aspergillus niger the enhanced production of extracellular polymeric substances especially proteins and the enrichment of functional bacteria such as neomegalonema and flavobacterium facilitated the granules development the low surface free energy 69 56 mj m2 and energy barrier 89 93 kt were the inherent mechanisms for the strong surface hydrophobicity the easy bacterial adhesion and the short granulation period this study provides an economically feasible approach to accelerate abgs granulation and sustain system stability graphical

introduction algal bacterial granular sludge abgs as an environmental sustainable and economically viable platform for municipal wastewater treatment has aroused extensive research in recent years ji and liu 2022 previous studies indicated that the abgs are a promising alternative for the conventional bacteria based aerobic granular sludge ags with a denser structure higher biomass yield better settling capacity and superior nutrient removal ahmad et al 2017 in such a symbiotic system algae provide oxygen via photosynthesis to bacteria for organic matter oxidization whereas the bacteria produce carbon dioxide to algae for photosynthesis benefiting from the synergetic interactions between algae and bacteria the energy consumption related to external aeration can be substantially reduced in the abgs system specifically the recoverable energy from anaerobic digestion of abgs biomass was enough to offset the energy consumption associated with aeration and sludge separation and a net energy gain of 64 1 billion kwh yr was estimated for an abgs system treating municipal wastewater with less greenhouse gases ghgs emissions 60 2 million tons co2e yr zhang et al 2021 achieving rapid granulation of abgs to take advantage of algae bacteria symbiotic relationships is essential for sustaining the excellent process performance ji et al 2020 past attempts to cultivate abgs mainly focused on exposure of activated sludge to a natural or artificial day light regime to induce spontaneous growth of algae he et al 2018a or inoculation with targeted algae such as chlorella or scenedesmus liu et al 2018 however a long reaction time up to 2 months was required to achieve complete granulation of abgs zhang et al 2018 the high energy consumption and low nutrient removal efficiency during the granulation process compromised the merits of this promising technology up to now most research regarding the abgs system centered on the effects of influencing factors e g light intensity salinity and temperature meng et al 2019a meng et al 2019b reactor configuration ahmad et al 2017 granular stability zhao et al 2019b pollutants or nutrient removal efficiencies and mechanisms involved zhao et al 2018 only few studies emphasized the most crucial and difficult issue i e shortening the start up period for the granulation of abgs as an example it was stated that rapid establishment of abgs system could be realized within 18 days but pre culturing mature abgs to serve as the inoculum sludge was still required zhang et al 2020b the formation mechanism of abgs might provide a new insight for the rapid granulation when algae cells coalesce with each other small agglomerates are formed that act as nuclei for microbial adhesion during the primary stage of abgs formation detailed morphology see fig s1 which was a very crucial step to initiation of granule development zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 similarly ahmad et al 2017 confirmed this stating that in a growth environment with high water velocity algae cells tended to accumulate in the interior of abgs as the core and this unique structure was beneficial for sustaining granular stability these studies indicate that different from the anaerobic core in ags abgs are comprised of algae nuclei which challenges the general assumption that algae tend to grow on the ags surface on account of photosynthesis but this phenomenon is often overlooked inspired by these findings it is thus inferred that rapid formation of primary algae nuclei will accelerate the development of abgs nonetheless to the best of our knowledge this remains up to now an unexplored field generally the undesirable properties of algae cells including small cell size poor settling ability slow growth rate and strong electrostatic repulsion make it challenging to form the primary nuclei of abgs via algal self aggregation this issue can be tackled by a pelletization strategy based on co culture of algae and fungi filamentous fungi have different morphology in liquid media including spores mycelium and clumps metz and kossen 1977 thereinto the spores can germinate to form intertwined mycelia and even spherical mycelial aggregates with loose interior and dense surface which are called mycelial pellets mps li et al 2020 when co cultivating algae with fungi algal cells can be rapidly immobilized in the fungal pellets by entrapment in the mps or by attachment to the fungal filaments usually 1 3 d thus forming the algal mycelial pellets amps li et al 2017 this process is easy to operate with high bio flocculation efficiency 90 99 and low operational costs zhao et al 2019a notably the fungi associated pelletization has been extensively studied in promoting bio flocculation of algae cells for wastewater treatment and biofuel production yet whether the pelletized algae mycelial biomass i e amps can provide the primary nuclei for the abgs has not been investigated in this context this work aimed to investigate the feasibility of utilizing amps as the primary nuclei for rapid start up of a self sustaining abgs system with respect to i key parameter optimization for amps biosynthesis ii

theory and v practical implication of this study the results provide a novel and economically feasible strategy to tackle the long start up of abgs systems while shedding light on further engineering applications of abgs for cost effective and environmentally sustainable municipal wastewater treatment 2 methods and materials 2 1 preparation of mps and amps aspergillus niger as3 3928 a filamentous pellet forming fungal strain with high flocculation activity was purchased from the china general microbiological culture collection center beijing china it was incubated in potato dextrose agar pda and sub cultured at 37 c until spores were produced li et al 2017 the spores were scraped from the pda plate and placed into a glass flask 250 ml with sterile water 100 ml to prepare the spore suspensions the concentration of spore suspensions was adjusted to 106 spores ml and inoculated in a sterile liquid czapek medium to obtain mps yu et al 2020 a non flocculating algae strain of chlorella fachb 31 was obtained from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china chlorella was cultivated in bg11 medium under a 12 h light 12 h dark cycle at 25 c then taken out at the logarithmic phase the density of algal cells was adjusted to 8 5 106 cell l for further studies two methods were utilized to prepare amps the co cultivation method based on the spore assisted mode and the adsorption method based on the pellet assisted mode chen et al 2018 as for the former method fresh spores of the candidate fungal strains were inoculated into the suspension of chlorella and then germinated to form the amps while the later method dosed the pre cultured mps into the suspension of chlorella after the flocculation of chlorella the flocculation efficiency was evaluated by a spectrometer dr6000 hach usa at a wavelength of 680 nm the flocculation efficiency was calculated according to eq 1 flocculation efficiency c 0 c t c 0 100 1 where c 0 od680 at the initial stage c t od680 after t hour 2 2 experimental set up and operation three photo reactors with an effective working volume of 400 ml were used for the development of abgs fig s2 they were shaken constantly at 150 rpm and 25 c r1 was operated as a control by inoculating with chlorella and activated sludge r2 was inoculated with mps chlorella and activated sludge whereas r3 was inoculated with amps and activated sludge illumination of the three photo reactors was provided by led lamps philips 40 w germany the average photometric intensity inside the three reactors was controlled at 4500 200 lux with a constant 12 h dark 12 h light cycle the operational cycling time was 12 h which included 1 min filling 712 716 min shaking 1 5 min settling and 2 min discharging before discharging the shaker was stopped for sludge settling and subsequently two hundred milliliters of the upper mixed solution were discharged using a peristaltic pump bt600m chuang rui china the volume exchange rate was kept at 50 resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h the sludge retention time srt was controlled at approximately 28 days according to the calculation formula provided in the supplementary materials text s1 2 3 inoculum sludge and synthetic wastewater jingkou urban wastewater treatment plant located at chongqing china was selected as the sampling place for the activated sludge the inoculum sludge was brown in color with a fluffy appearance and an average particle size of 82 1 μm the sludge volume index at 30 min svi30 was 54 0 ml g the synthetic domestic wastewater was prepared according to zhang et al 2019 it contained 600 mg l of cod ch3coona 60 mg l of nh4 n nh4cl 10 mg l of po4 3 p kh2po4 k2hpo4 25 mg l mgso4 7h2o 30 mg l feso4 7h2o 30 mg l cacl2 and 1 0 ml l trace element solution 2 4 analysis of eps content and components a thermal method for extracting the extracellular polymeric substances eps was employed in conformity with a previous study zhang et al 2019 two main fractions of eps i e proteins pn and polysaccharides ps were quantified by the modified lowery method peterson 1977 and phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 respectively 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra of the extracted eps samples were analyzed by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4700 hitachi japan a parallel factor parafac analysis was employed to handle the eem data and identify the eps components sheng et al 2013 2 5 surface thermodynamics and xdlvo curve analysis the zeta potential of abgs was measured by using a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk for analysis of the contact angle the sludge samples were broken using an ultrasonic cell disruptor xinyi 250n china at 20 khz for 5 min and the sludge suspension was diluted to 50 ml with deionized water subsequently the suspensions were vacuum filtered onto 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membrane filters followed by air drying at 25 a contact angle goniometer dataphysics oca20 germany was used to measure the contact angles of sludge against distilled water formamide and diiodomethane by measuring the contact angle of abgs the surface tension and interface free energy the surface thermodynamic and the xdlvo curve of the abgs can be analyzed the detailed methods for surface thermodynamics analysis and xdlvo calculation are provided in the supplementary materials text s2 2 6 high throughput sequencing the community compositions bacteria algae and fungi of the inoculum sludge as well as the abgs samples taken from r1 r3 on day 30 were evaluated using the high throughput sequencing technology the universal primer pairs 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 were used to amplify the bacterial 16s rrna region targeting the v3 v4 regions lu et al 2015 the primer pairs p23srv 1f 5 ggacagaaagaccctatgaa 3 and p23srv 1r 5 tcagcctgttatccctagag 3 for algae were used for amplification of the hypervariable region of 18s rrna zhang et al 2020b the specific primer sets with barcode its1f 5 cttggtcatttagaggaagtaa 3 and its2r 5 gctgcgttcttcatcgatgc 3 were employed to amplify the fungal its region gardes and bruns 1993 the detailed analytical methods were provided in a previous study guo et al 2019 2 7 analytical methods mixed liquor volatile suspended solids ml v ss svi30 and the concentrations of cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn and po4 3 p in the influent and effluent were determined by standard methods apha 2005 the chlorophyll α content was analyzed using the acetone extraction method ritchie 2008 particle size was measured by a laser particle size analyzer malvern panalytical inc malvern uk and image j software morphology of the granules was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem quattro s thermo scientific the distribution of algae in the abgs was observed by fluorescence microscopy through spontaneous fluorescence of chloroplast at 488 nm excitation wavelength the distribution of nucleic acids proteins α polysaccharides and β polysaccharides in the abgs was visualized by using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss axio scan z1 germany the activities of functional bacteria including ammonia oxidizing bacteria saur nitrite oxidation bacteria snur and heterotrophs sour were determined according to huang et al 2015 the atpase activity was evaluated by a total atpase kit nanjing jiancheng china as described by jiang and liu 2012 2 8 statistical analysis all experiments were performed in triplicate significant differences in variables were ascertained using spss software version 25 0 ibm and a p value 0 05 was regarded as a significant difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal biosynthesis conditions of mps and amps 3 1 1 preparation of mps and amps at optimal conditions the biosynthesis conditions of mps were first optimized in this study as shown in fig 1 a the growth of mps sharply increased during the initial 72 h followed by a relatively saturated state besides various factors that greatly influence the formation of mps including temperature ph rotary speed and initial inoculum spores density were explored in this study results showed that thee biomass of mps reached the maximal value when the cultivation conditions were controlled at an inoculum spores density of 6 3 106 cfu ml ph 6 0 rotary speed of 150 rpm and 35 c fig 1b e since it takes more energy to keep the temperature high and the operational temperature for abgs is generally controlled at 25 30 c 30 c was chosen as the optimal temperature for preparing the mps the adsorption method and co culture method to prepare the amps were comparatively investigated it took respectively 12 h adsorption method and 24 h co culture method to achieve complete flocculation of the algae fig 1f g besides the amps prepared by the adsorption method were more numerous fig 1l and fig s3 the adsorption method was therefore chosen for preparing the amps the preparation conditions of amps were further optimized by evaluating the effects of the mps cultivation period as well as the dosage amounts of mps and algal cells on the flocculation efficiency fig 1 h j shows that the flocculation efficiency reached the maximal value of approximately 99 0 when dosing 50 ml algal cells cell density of 8 5 106 cell ml and 12 g wet weight mps which were pre cultured for 72 h the high flocculation efficiency was possibly due to the mediation of surface protein secreted by the mps the calcium bridging and the increase of hydrophobic interactions li et al 2017 the mps obtained at the optimal conditions had a relatively loose boundary and compact kernel with uniform size of approximately 1 2 mm fig 1k there was no conspicuous difference in morphology between mps and amps except for the color which changed from white to green fig 1l chlorella were closely attached onto the mycelium and mainly distributed in the outer layer of the amps as revealed by sem and tem images fig 1l furthermore the long and dense mycelia intertwined with each other within amps and correspondingly channels and voids were formed on the surface which may play a role of skeleton necessary for bacterial adhesion and the porous structure could facilitate mass transfer lahlali and hijri 2010 therefore it was speculated that the amps might be the ideal nuclei to enhance the development of abgs 3 1 2 optimal mass ratio of amps and activated sludge the mass ratio of amps and activated sludge which plays a central role in affecting the aggregation ability of the abgs was investigated herein at the initial sludge concentration of 3 0 g l mlss as shown in fig s4 the sludge amount adsorbed by amps decreased with further increase of the amps proportion besides the amps gradually broke down or even vanished when the dry mass ratio of amps and activated sludge exceeded 2 5 this may be attributed to the maladaptation of mps to the environment in the bioreactor system phagocytosis by metazoans or exfoliation caused by hydraulic shear leading to amps disintegration fomina and gadd 2002 therefore the optimal mass ratio was determined at 2 5 the ratio of dry weight of amps to that of activated sludge w w 3 2 granulation process and abgs morphology 3 2 1 characteristics of abgs for development of the self sustaining abgs the activated sludge as was inoculated into the three photo reactors to obtain an initial mlss concentration of approximately 3 6 g l in each photo reactor the initial mps and amps concentration in r2 and r3 were roughly 0 1 g l dry weight for a mass ratio to as of 2 5 the granulation process can be classified into three phases according to the variations of the indexes ml v ss svi30 svi30 svi5 and particle size initiation multiplication and stabilization during the initiation phase days 0 8 the mlss concentrations declined from 3 7 g l to 3 4 g l r1 3 6 g l r2 and 3 2 g l r3 respectively which might be subjected to biomass loss associated with the progressive reduction of settling time fig 2 a c in addition except for an apparent rise of svi30 in r1 increased to 56 0 ml g the svi30 of r2 and r3 granules decreased to 48 4 ml g and 47 3 ml g after 8 days respectively fig 2d implying the settling ability of the sludge was improved by dosing the mps or amps meanwhile the mean particle size slightly increased from 82 1 μm to 109 6 μm r1 137 7 μm r2 and 134 0 μm r3 fig 2e and fig s5 the symbiotic growth of algae and bacteria was verified in r3 as the concentration of chlorophyll α increased with operation time fig 2f during the multiplication phase days 8 24 biomass discharge was periodically performed to maintain a relatively stable biomass concentration in all photo reactors the mlss concentrations in r3 was higher than that in r1 and r2 indicating that addition of amps enhanced the biomass retention capacity possibly due to that the algae cell surface properties expedited the bio flocculation process besides the amps exhibited a large specific surface area with high hydrophobicity due to hydrophobins that could provide favorable habitats for microorganisms attachment and survival liang et al 2019 the average diameter of the r3 granules underwent a gradual increase to 300 μm and the svi30 svi5 ratio reached 0 87 on day 12 fig 2d e completion of sludge granulation was defined as particle size 300 μm and svi30 svi5 0 8 liu and tay 2007 nancharaiah and reddy 2018 on the basis of the above criteria complete granulation of abgs was achieved within 12 days in r3 notably r1 and r2 achieved complete granulation after 28 and 20 days respectively at the stabilization phase days 24 35 r3 granules exhibited the most excellent sludge characteristics as evidenced by the largest particle size 3 3 mm the greatest mlss concentration 2 2 g l the highest chlorophyll α content 3 8 mg l and the most excellent settleability svi30 svi5 of 0 99 and svi30 of 53 2 ml g fig 2 the stability of sludge is generally expressed as the integrity coefficient with the lower values indicating the better structural stability muda et al 2010 the integrity coefficient 2 74 of mature abgs in r3 was much lower than that in r1 and r2 on day 35 table s1 in addition the sludge density of r1 1 0184 g ml was lower than that of r3 1 0253 g ml these results showed that addition of amps could effectively accelerate the development of a self sustaining symbiotic abgs and the compact structure deriving from higher biomass retention was contributive to maintain their granular stability 3 2 2 the observation of abgs morphology the brown inoculum sludge gradually turned into a greenish color and the applied mps and amps started to get smaller during the initiation phase fig 3 and fig s6 many irregular large particles were observed in r1 r3 at the multiplication phase and they became denser in sphere or ellipse shape at the stabilization phase fig 3a f high magnification sem images revealed many protozoa vorticella accumulated on the surfaces of r1 r3 granules signifying a superior effluent quality in the self sustaining algae bacterial symbiosis system no obvious filaments were observed on the mature granule surface of r2 and r3 indicating that the addition of mps or amps did not induce the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria fluorescence microscopic images clearly showed that a spherical structure of the abgs was formed with the core of amps in which the mycelium and algae cells were tightly wrapped in the inner part of the granules and the morphological structure of chlorella was integrated fig 3g and fig s7 a large number of bacteria red stained adhered onto the surface of hyphae within the granular core of r3 suggesting the role of supporting skeleton played by amps fig s7 these observations confirmed that the rapid granulation of abgs was induced by applying amps as the nuclei furthermore the proteins green stained α polysaccharides blue stained and β polysaccharides yellow stained formed a continuous layer that occupied the central region of the abgs constituting the matrix of the abgs the entwined hyphae in the amps provoked the formation of voids and channels within r3 granules fig s7 thus facilitated the mass transfer of substrates and dissolved oxygen inhibited the filamentous overgrowth and improved the morphological integrity of granules 3 3 overall performance synergistic algal bacterial reactions and mass balance analysis 3 3 1 photo reactor performance the average cod removal efficiency of r3 98 6 was higher than that of r1 96 4 and r2 98 1 fig 4 a the high mlss concentration in r3 might provide the reasonable explanation for the high degradation of organic matter moreover mps have been reported to be efficient in eliminating the contaminants via biosorption and biodegradation wang et al 2010 similarly it was considered that the addition of amps was beneficial for elevating the cod removal efficiency the nh4 n was removed with the overall efficiency approaching 100 in all photo reactors data not shown and negligible no2 n accumulation 0 5 mg l suggesting the excellent nitrification capability in the abgs systems with the extension of operating time there was an observation of evident declining tendency in the effluent no3 n concentration in r1 r3 which should be responsible for the enhanced tn removal efficiency fig 4c in comparison the effluent no3 n concentration in r3 11 5 mg l was lower than that in r1 19 5 mg l and r2 12 5 mg l at the end of photo reactor operation fig 4b this may be attributable to the expanded granule diameter whereby the enlarged anaerobic anoxic region created a more favorable environment for denitrification winkler et al 2013 the average tn removal efficiency 80 8 obtained in r3 was relatively higher than that of the abgs cultivated under air bubbling conditions averagely 40 3 huang et al 2020 fig 4d illustrates the po4 3 p removal profile in all three photo reactors r3 exhibited the most satisfactory performance in po4 3 p removal since the removal efficiency averagely exceeded 80 0 the biological phosphorus removal was the primary mechanism as the chemical phosphorus removal could be ignored due to the ph below 8 5 in all the photo reactors de godos et al 2009 as demonstrated earlier phosphorus present in wastewater in the forms of organic and inorganic phosphorus both can be effectively utilized by algae cells he et al 2018a therefore the improved capability of po4 3 p removal in r3 was partially associated with the accumulated algal biomass concentration to evaluate the removal pathways of cod and nutrients typical cycle tests of r1 r3 were performed and compared between the light and dark cycles the variations in the nutrient concentration followed a parallel pattern during the light and dark cycles in all photo reactors fig s8 during one cycle cod and nh4 n were well removed in all three photo reactors fig s8a f suggesting that abgs had a better capability for cod and nh4 n removal the po4 3 p removal efficiency in the light cycle was better than in the dark cycle in r1 r3 fig s8a c indicating a certain amount of po4 3 p was removed by algal photosynthesis in the light phase specifically the po4 3 p concentration gradually increased from 5 0 mg l to 21 5 mg l light cycle and from 4 0 mg l to 18 5 mg l dark cycle at the initial 2 h in r3 they gradually declined to 1 0 mg l light cycle and 2 5 mg l dark cycle during the subsequent operating time 2 12 h fig s8c this indicated that po4 3 p was partially removed by phosphorus accumulating organisms paos in addition to uptake by algae which is further investigated in section 3 6 the above results implied that the addition of amps exhibited a promising potential for cod and nutrient removal likely due to the successful accumulation of algae cells and the enhancement of microbial activities to investigate the microbial activities the sour saur and snur of the abgs in all photo reactors were analyzed fig s9a b the maximum sour was obtained in r3 66 2 mg o2 g mlss h which was higher than that in r1 61 5 mg o2 g mlss h similarly the saur and snur of r3 were higher than those in the other two photo reactors indicating that the activities of aob and nob could be enhanced by applying amps as nuclei the activity of microorganisms can be directly reflected by the content of intracellular adenosine triphosphate atp cui et al 2018 the atp content of r1 and r2 slightly decreased respectively to 4 8 and 5 0 u mg prot on day 35 while it still maintained at a high level 6 3 u mg prot in r3 fig s9c the reduction in the atp content implied that a higher fraction of bacteria was inactive or died in r1 and r2 granules possibly related to the low do and shear force whereas the high microbial activity in r3 was contributive to the cod and nutrient removal fig 4 the high microbial activity in r3 was partially owing to the proper mass transfer resistance within the micro environment fig 3 and fig s7 enabled the substrates transportation and created an anoxic zone for denitrification geng et al 2021 3 3 2 synergistic algal bacterial reactions in the abgs system in the self sustaining symbiotic abgs o2 was produced by algae and utilized by aerobic bacteria i e o2 plays a pivotal role between photosynthetic and heterotrophic reactions the difference in do concentration profiles between light and dark phases in a typical cycle fig s8g i mirrored closely the coupling of algal photosynthesis and bacterial respiration the higher do value during the light cycle was possibly owing to the photosynthesis of algae which could provide more o2 to maintain the activity of aerobic bacteria nitrification and heterotrophic bacteria it should be noted that in such a self sustaining abgs system the external aeration was not indispensable which would save the aeration associated energy input accounting for approximately 60 of the total energy in the conventional bacteria based ags system bengtsson et al 2018 3 3 3 mass balance analysis of c n and p according to ji et al 2021 microbial assimilation is the primary mechanism for c n and p removal in an abgs system to further ascertain the contribution of algae and bacteria to the removal of c n and p the respective synthetic reactions for bacteria and algae were constructed based on the empirical formula i e ch1 4o0 4n0 2p0 017 for bacteria and ch1 78o0 36n0 12p0 01 for algae boelee et al 2014 the synthetic reactions for bacteria and algae are described in eq 2 and eq 3 respectively bacterial assimilation reaction with acetate as the organic carbon source c h 3 co o 0 88 o 2 0 22 nh 4 0 019 h 2 po 4 0 8 h 2 0 91 c o 2 1 6 h 2 o 1 1 c h 1 4 n 0 2 o 0 4 p 0 017 algal assimilation reaction with co2 as carbon source c o 2 0 12 nh 4 0 01 h 2 po 4 0 69 h 2 o 3 1 19 o 2 0 11 h c h 1 78 n 0 12 o 0 36 p 0 01 therefore the mass ratio f of removed carbon to nitrogen can be estimated from eq 4 i e 4 f c co d inf c co d eff 1 1 2 m c m a c c nh 4 n inf c nh 4 n eff where c co d inf and c nh 4 n inf are influent cod concentration and nh4 n concentration respectively c co d eff and c nh 4 n eff are effluent cod concentration and nh4 n concentration respectively while m c and m a c are the molecular weights of carbon and ac respectively in addition the coefficient 1 1 is the conversion ratio of ac to cod fig 5 shows that c n and p were majorly removed by bacterial metabolism which was consistent with ji et al 2020 furthermore 34 6 of c 17 0 of n 10 0 of p were removed by algae in r3 system which were higher than those in r1 and r2 some algae species especially green algae are able to take up nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus as energy sources for synthesizing their own cellular substances lee et al 2015 the higher retention of algae biomass chlorophyll α content of 3 8 mg l in r3 because of the efficient flocculation by mps could also contribute to the efficient nutrient removal 3 4 eps production of abgs 3 4 1 analysis of pn and ps content eps secreted by microorganisms play a key role in the sludge granulation and the structural stability of abgs shi and liu 2021 with the progress of granulation the pn content gradually increased to the maximal value of 44 9 mg g ss r1 46 3 mg g ss r2 and 51 1 mg g ss r3 which was respectively 3 1 3 2 and 3 6 folds higher than that of the activated sludge fig 6 a c notably the variation tendency of pn ps ratio over the range of 1 35 to 4 03 was analogous to that of the pn content fig 6a c with observation of no considerable fluctuation in ps content in all photo reactors throughout the whole process this is in line with a previous study where the granulation was positively affected by pn especially for the primary stage he et al 2018b at a later stage of the experiment the pn content dramatically decreased in r1 and slightly decreased in r2 while it remained steady in r3 finally the pn content followed an increasing order r1 29 6 mg g ss r2 34 7 mg g ss r3 48 3 mg g ss a similar pattern was observed that the addition of mps could stimulate bacteria to produce more pn geng et al 2020 pn are relatively hydrophobic substances and the high level of relative hydrophobicity contributes to the decrease of the gibbs free energy thus facilitating the microorganisms to aggregate together and enhancing the stability of the self sustaining symbiotic abgs system zhang et al 2020a 3 4 2 functional groups and fluorescent components of eps ftir spectrometry was adopted to identify the functional groups of eps samples obtained from the abgs and inoculum sludge fig s10 the intensities of two absorption peaks appeared at 3440 cm 1 associated with the polysaccharide oh stretching vibration and 1646 cm 1 associated with the c o bond amide i in the protein primary structure were observed to be strengthened in the abgs samples compared to the inoculum sludge which was consistent with the improvement of pn content fig 6a c in addition the peak at 1096 cm 1 or 1033 cm 1 attributing to polysaccharide c o stretching vibration existed in all eps samples lotti et al 2019 in comparison the intensity of this absorption peak in the abgs was obviously lower than the inoculum sludge this implied that polysaccharides were not the active agents to promote microbial aggregation 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to identify the fluorescent components in the eps fig s11 due to the complex compositions of eps the fluorescence spectra seriously overlapped in fig s11 parallel factor parafac analysis was therefore performed to separate the eem spectra into independent components ishii and boyer 2012 three components were identified as component 1 component 2 and component 3 table 1 component 1 with two peaks at ex em of 220 230 325 375 nm and 250 300 325 375 nm represent the tryptophan and aromatic protein like substances component 2 with ex em at 200 230 350 450 nm and 250 300 350 450 nm was classified as fulvic like and humic like substances component 3 with ex em at 200 230 300 325 nm was identified as protein like substances mainly tyrosine substances luo et al 2014 notably the fi value of component 1 in r3 772 2 was obviously higher than that in r1 and r2 while no significant difference was obtained between r1 731 4 and r2 728 5 for components 2 and 3 there was no obvious difference among the three photo reactors fig 6d therefore it was considered that applying amps as nuclei enhanced the sludge granulation by stimulating the secretion of tryptophan and aromatic protein substances 3 5 analysis of surface free energy of abgs 3 5 1 electronegativity and hydrophobicity the zeta potential of the activated sludge was 14 00 mv and it gradually increased along with the granulation process table s2 at the end of the photo reactor operation the highest zeta potential 11 30 mv was obtained in r3 indicating the electrostatic repulsion between the microorganisms was greatly weakened which was conducive to their mutual aggregation liu et al 2007 furthermore the contact angles of all the sludge samples against water formamide and diiodomethane exhibited distinct increases after complete granulation table s2 notably the contact angle between r3 granules and water clearly increased 87 71 hydrophobicity can be considered to be dominant when the contact angle between the microbial cell surface and water is higher than 65 liu et al 2008 these results indicated that the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface was improved by applying amps as nuclei in a self sustaining symbiotic abgs system cell hydrophobicity is the initial driving force that promotes granular sludge formation and is a crucial factor in bacterial aggregation liu and tay 2004 as described earlier the enhancement of hydrophobicity on the cell surface was beneficial for promoting the microbial aggregation and subsequently forming a more compact three dimensional granular structure adav et al 2008 3 5 2 surface thermodynamic analysis based on xdlvo theory the free energy values and the parameters related to the surface thermodynamics of sludge samples were calculated according to the formula of the surface thermodynamic analysis and the results are shown in table 2 the magnitude of the interfacial free energy δgadh can be used to determine the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface brant and childress 2002 here the δgadh values of r3 69 56 mj m2 was lower than that of r1 60 83 mj m2 and r2 67 34 mj m2 granules according to the thermodynamic theory adhesion between microorganisms is more prone to occur if the δgadh value is lower liu et al 2008 therefore it was demonstrated that the addition of amps positively modified the thermodynamic characteristics of the sludge surface and the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface was improved which is consistent with the contact angles results table s2 herein the xdlvo theory was further employed to reveal the inherent mechanism of bacterial aggregation the potential energy barrier existed on all the total potential energy curves of r1 r3 fig 7 aggregation could occur when microorganisms had enough energy to surpass this potential energy barrier liu et al 2008 besides the lower energy barrier indicated that lower energy was required by the microorganisms to aggregate the total potential energy curves showed that r1 and r2 reached the energy barrier of 138 98 kt and 109 64 kt at 5 50 nm and 5 65 nm respectively while r3 reached the energy barrier 89 93 kt at 5 75 nm indicating that r3 had the lowest energy barrier and the strongest capacity of microbial aggregation 3 6 community structure dynamics of bacteria algae and fungus in contrast to the inoculum sludge the abgs samples had a higher simpson index and lower shannon index indicating that the bacterial diversity of the microbial population decreased in the abgs system table s3 in addition the inoculum sludge exhibited a higher ace index 1000 and chao index 1007 compared to abgs samples demonstrating that the microbial population in the inoculum sludge was more abundant this observation is consistent with guo et al 2019 who suggested that the richness and diversity of microorganisms decreased during the granulation as the granulation progressed the phylum actinobacteriota sharply dropped to below 0 21 in all three photo reactors nevertheless the relative abundance of the phylum proteobacteria was dramatically improved during the photo granulation especially in r3 62 68 which was 3 7 folds higher than that in the inoculum sludge 16 91 fig 8 a lots of evidence confirmed that most of the paos belong to the phylum proteobacteria zhang et al 2012 the heat map showed that the dominant genus in all abgs samples were significantly different from the inoculum sludge fig 8e to be specific the relative abundance of the genus neomegalonema affiliating to the phylum proteobacteria significantly increased to 43 82 r1 20 71 r2 and 46 11 r3 fig 8b the n and p removal efficiencies and eps content were found to be positively correlated with neomegalonema fig 8f this bacterial genus is well known for taking up organic and nitrogenous substances and it is also a pao and eps producer cruz et al 2022 ramos et al 2015 therefore it was inferred that the superior removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p as well as the higher eps content in r3 could be partially ascribed to the proliferation of this genus furthermore the relative abundance of the genus flavobacterium from the phylum bacteroidota gradually increased to 5 12 in r3 and exhibited a positive relationship with the eps production as well as nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency fig 8f this is agree with a previous work which indicated that flavobacterium was an eps secreting bacterium with strong self agglomeration ability liu et al 2017 besides as a denitrifying phosphate accumulating organism dpao flavobacterium could assist in simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphate sengar et al 2018 thereby the higher abundance of flavobacterium may have supported the nutrient removal in r3 for the inoculum sludge the genus candidatus microthrix is the most abundant bacterium 15 48 however it almost disappeared in the abgs as reported before the filamentous bacteria candidatus microthrix is a filamentous bacteria which prefers to dominate in the loosely structured sludge blackall et al 1996 this corresponded well to the observation that there were no visible filaments attached on the surface of r3 granules fig 3 as for the algal community the algae chlorella was identified in all abgs samples because of the targeted control fig 8c comparatively the relative abundance of chlorella f chlorellaceae in r3 23 25 was higher than that of r1 18 52 and r2 11 68 sludge indicating that algal cells were effectively enriched in r3 chlorella is capable of assimilating n and p from wastewater into cellular components such as phospholipids nucleic acids and nucleotides during the growth process which favors the nutrients removal from wastewater mahapatra et al 2013 therefore it was suggested that the addition of amps could retain the targeted algae in the system which was beneficial for enhancing the nutrient removal and establishing the favorable symbiosis between bacteria and algae fig 8d shows that the most dominant fungi in the abgs were tolypocladium r1 catenaria r2 and aspergillus r3 respectively among the classified fungi the genus aspergillus accounted for 38 76 in r3 and was distinctly higher than that in r1 0 96 and r2 3 76 thereby the addition of mps could not only effectively retain the aspergillus but the growth and bioactivity of aspergillus could be well maintained in the photo bioreactor via the addition of amps 3 7 mechanisms analysis and practical implications of this study in this study the development process of abgs induced by amps as nuclei was analyzed to further unravel the internal enhancement mechanisms firstly many flocs attached onto the surface of the amps on day 5 implying the initial formation of amps based granules fig s4 however the young amps based granules appeared to be destabilized and broke into several fragments on day 8 as evidenced by the morphological observation of the granules fig s6 afterwards the fragments of granules acted as nuclei and induced the formation of compact granules fig 3g and fig s7 this result was consistent with wang et al 2014 and geng et al 2020 who reported that the fragments resulting from the granular disintegration could serve as nuclei for the re production of granules amps formed by combining mps with algal cells secreted a large amount of eps detailed analysis see fig s12 and text s3 which was conducive to accelerate the granulation process wang et al 2019 with the enhancement of bacterial collisions and eps secretion the particle diameter was further enlarged and thus provided sufficient ecological niches for the growth of the genus neomegalonema flavobacterium and norank f microscillaceae these bacteria are capable of degrading organic and nitrogenous substances in addition the inoculated algae were effectively enriched in the system and a good symbiotic relationship between bacteria and algae was established consequently satisfactory nitrogen and phosphorus removal averagely 100 0 and 80 8 respectively from the wastewater was realized the analysis of the surface free energy of the abgs further revealed that the addition of amps could provide more energy to overcome the electrostatic repulsive forces between the cells δgadh values of 69 56 mj m2 thereby inducing the microbial aggregation notably the mature abgs inhibited the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria which was beneficial for maintaining the long term stability of the abgs systems fig 8 in a nutshell this study showed that applying amps as the primary nuclei significantly accelerated the development of abgs it is worth emphasizing that except for rapid start up of abgs system and efficient nutrient removal this novel strategy is also promising in the following aspects a rapid formation and easy separation of amps based on the co pelletization strategy the algal cells chlorella were entrapped in the mps of aspergillus within 12 h under the optimized conditions the formed amps 1 2 mm in diameter with excellent settling capability could be easily separated from the culture media merely relying on gravity sedimentation b low dosage amount of amps in addition experimental results indicated that the optimal dry mass ratio of amps and activated sludge was as low as 2 5 much lower than the dosage amount of mps up to 60 w w as carriers for accelerating the aerobic sludge granulation geng et al 2021 indicating that this strategy was economically competitive and thereby could be envisaged for large scale application c great potential for resource recovery most of the nutrients in the wastewater were removed via bacterial and algal assimilations during the photo granulation process fig 5 i e they were concentrated in the abgs biomass besides the fungal genus aspergillus which can produce enzymes such as laccase and protease cabaleiro et al 2002 and a cyclosporin producing fungus tolypocladium aarnio and agathos 1989 were also accumulated in the abgs therefore the abgs biomass has a broad prospect to be a potential resource recovery factory in the forms of biodiesel fertilizers pharmaceuticals etc despite of the aforementioned advantages further research should be carried out at pilot or full scale facilities to provide data from practical applications and prolong the operational process to verify the long term effects of implementing this strategy on the road to advance this promising technology towards engineering applications significant efforts are required on a paradigm shift of the abgs system from current single functionality nutrient removal toward multiple functionality wastewater treatment energy production resource recovery for maximizing the environmental sustainability and economic viability 4 conclusions a novel strategy by using amps as nuclei was proposed with the purpose to accelerate the development of a self sustaining symbiotic abgs the results showed that the abgs was rapidly developed within 12 days with large particle size compact structure and excellent settling property high bioactivity and satisfactory nutrient removal efficiency the fungus aspergillus with the targeted algae chlorella acted as the granule nuclei the reinforced secretion of tryptophan and aromatic protein as well as the enrichment of functional bacteria such as neomegalonema and flavobacterium contributed to the rapid granulation of abgs the surface free energy of abgs indicated that the repulsive barrier between microorganisms was significantly decreased which was the inherent mechanism for the readily bacterial aggregation overall this study provided a cost efficient and practically feasible approach to

16210,algal bacterial granular sludge abgs is a promising technology for wastewater treatment benefiting from the synergetic interactions between algae and bacteria however the rapid start up of the abgs system is not trivial herein a novel strategy was proposed by applying the algal mycelial pellets amps as the primary nuclei for accelerating the development of a self sustaining symbiotic abgs system the results indicated that by using this strategy complete granulation was shortened to 12 days much shorter than the control system without amps dosage 28 days the abgs had a large particle diameter 3 3 mm compact granular structure 1 0253 g ml and excellent settleability svi30 of 53 2 ml g moreover 98 6 of cod 80 8 of tn and 80 0 of po4 3 p were removed by the abgs the nuclei of targeted algae chlorella and filamentous fungi aspergillus niger the enhanced production of extracellular polymeric substances especially proteins and the enrichment of functional bacteria such as neomegalonema and flavobacterium facilitated the granules development the low surface free energy 69 56 mj m2 and energy barrier 89 93 kt were the inherent mechanisms for the strong surface hydrophobicity the easy bacterial adhesion and the short granulation period this study provides an economically feasible approach to accelerate abgs granulation and sustain system stability graphical abstsrct image graphical abstract keywords algal bacterial granular sludge abgs mycelial pellets extracellular polymeric substances eps mechanism analysis xdlvo theory community structure 1 introduction algal bacterial granular sludge abgs as an environmental sustainable and economically viable platform for municipal wastewater treatment has aroused extensive research in recent years ji and liu 2022 previous studies indicated that the abgs are a promising alternative for the conventional bacteria based aerobic granular sludge ags with a denser structure higher biomass yield better settling capacity and superior nutrient removal ahmad et al 2017 in such a symbiotic system algae provide oxygen via photosynthesis to bacteria for organic matter oxidization whereas the bacteria produce carbon dioxide to algae for photosynthesis benefiting from the synergetic interactions between algae and bacteria the energy consumption related to external aeration can be substantially reduced in the abgs system specifically the recoverable energy from anaerobic digestion of abgs biomass was enough to offset the energy consumption associated with aeration and sludge separation and a net energy gain of 64 1 billion kwh yr was estimated for an abgs system treating municipal wastewater with less greenhouse gases ghgs emissions 60 2 million tons co2e yr zhang et al 2021 achieving rapid granulation of abgs to take advantage of algae bacteria symbiotic relationships is essential for sustaining the excellent process performance ji et al 2020 past attempts to cultivate abgs mainly focused on exposure of activated sludge to a natural or artificial day light regime to induce spontaneous growth of algae he et al 2018a or inoculation with targeted algae such as chlorella or scenedesmus liu et al 2018 however a long reaction time up to 2 months was required to achieve complete granulation of abgs zhang et al 2018 the high energy consumption and low nutrient removal efficiency during the granulation process compromised the merits of this promising technology up to now most research regarding the abgs system centered on the effects of influencing factors e g light intensity salinity and temperature meng et al 2019a meng et al 2019b reactor configuration ahmad et al 2017 granular stability zhao et al 2019b pollutants or nutrient removal efficiencies and mechanisms involved zhao et al 2018 only few studies emphasized the most crucial and difficult issue i e shortening the start up period for the granulation of abgs as an example it was stated that rapid establishment of abgs system could be realized within 18 days but pre culturing mature abgs to serve as the inoculum sludge was still required zhang et al 2020b the formation mechanism of abgs might provide a new insight for the rapid granulation when algae cells coalesce with each other small agglomerates are formed that act as nuclei for microbial adhesion during the primary stage of abgs formation detailed morphology see fig s1 which was a very crucial step to initiation of granule development zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 similarly ahmad et al 2017 confirmed this stating that in a growth environment with high water velocity algae cells tended to accumulate in the interior of abgs as the core and this unique structure was beneficial for sustaining granular stability these studies indicate that different from the anaerobic core in ags abgs are comprised of algae nuclei which challenges the general assumption that algae tend to grow on the ags surface on account of photosynthesis but this phenomenon is often overlooked inspired by these findings it is thus inferred that rapid formation of primary algae nuclei will accelerate the development of abgs nonetheless to the best of our knowledge this remains up to now an unexplored field generally the undesirable properties of algae cells including small cell size poor settling ability slow growth rate and strong electrostatic repulsion make it challenging to form the primary nuclei of abgs via algal self aggregation this issue can be tackled by a pelletization strategy based on co culture of algae and fungi filamentous fungi have different morphology in liquid media including spores mycelium and clumps metz and kossen 1977 thereinto the spores can germinate to form intertwined mycelia and even spherical mycelial aggregates with loose interior and dense surface which are called mycelial pellets mps li et al 2020 when co cultivating algae with fungi algal cells can be rapidly immobilized in the fungal pellets by entrapment in the mps or by attachment to the fungal filaments usually 1 3 d thus forming the algal mycelial pellets amps li et al 2017 this process is easy to operate with high bio flocculation efficiency 90 99 and low operational costs zhao et al 2019a notably the fungi associated pelletization has been extensively studied in promoting bio flocculation of algae cells for wastewater treatment and biofuel production yet whether the pelletized algae mycelial biomass i e amps can provide the primary nuclei for the abgs has not been investigated in this context this work aimed to investigate the feasibility of utilizing amps as the primary nuclei for rapid start up of a self sustaining abgs system with respect to i key parameter optimization for amps biosynthesis ii

theory and v practical implication of this study the results provide a novel and economically feasible strategy to tackle the long start up of abgs systems while shedding light on further engineering applications of abgs for cost effective and environmentally sustainable municipal wastewater treatment 2 methods and materials 2 1 preparation of mps and amps aspergillus niger as3 3928 a filamentous pellet forming fungal strain with high flocculation activity was purchased from the china general microbiological culture collection center beijing china it was incubated in potato dextrose agar pda and sub cultured at 37 c until spores were produced li et al 2017 the spores were scraped from the pda plate and placed into a glass flask 250 ml with sterile water 100 ml to prepare the spore suspensions the concentration of spore suspensions was adjusted to 106 spores ml and inoculated in a sterile liquid czapek medium to obtain mps yu et al 2020 a non flocculating algae strain of chlorella fachb 31 was obtained from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china chlorella was cultivated in bg11 medium under a 12 h light 12 h dark cycle at 25 c then taken out at the logarithmic phase the density of algal cells was adjusted to 8 5 106 cell l for further studies two methods were utilized to prepare amps the co cultivation method based on the spore assisted mode and the adsorption method based on the pellet assisted mode chen et al 2018 as for the former method fresh spores of the candidate fungal strains were inoculated into the suspension of chlorella and then germinated to form the amps while the later method dosed the pre cultured mps into the suspension of chlorella after the flocculation of chlorella the flocculation efficiency was evaluated by a spectrometer dr6000 hach usa at a wavelength of 680 nm the flocculation efficiency was calculated according to eq 1 flocculation efficiency c 0 c t c 0 100 1 where c 0 od680 at the initial stage c t od680 after t hour 2 2 experimental set up and operation three photo reactors with an effective working volume of 400 ml were used for the development of abgs fig s2 they were shaken constantly at 150 rpm and 25 c r1 was operated as a control by inoculating with chlorella and activated sludge r2 was inoculated with mps chlorella and activated sludge whereas r3 was inoculated with amps and activated sludge illumination of the three photo reactors was provided by led lamps philips 40 w germany the average photometric intensity inside the three reactors was controlled at 4500 200 lux with a constant 12 h dark 12 h light cycle the operational cycling time was 12 h which included 1 min filling 712 716 min shaking 1 5 min settling and 2 min discharging before discharging the shaker was stopped for sludge settling and subsequently two hundred milliliters of the upper mixed solution were discharged using a peristaltic pump bt600m chuang rui china the volume exchange rate was kept at 50 resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h the sludge retention time srt was controlled at approximately 28 days according to the calculation formula provided in the supplementary materials text s1 2 3 inoculum sludge and synthetic wastewater jingkou urban wastewater treatment plant located at chongqing china was selected as the sampling place for the activated sludge the inoculum sludge was brown in color with a fluffy appearance and an average particle size of 82 1 μm the sludge volume index at 30 min svi30 was 54 0 ml g the synthetic domestic wastewater was prepared according to zhang et al 2019 it contained 600 mg l of cod ch3coona 60 mg l of nh4 n nh4cl 10 mg l of po4 3 p kh2po4 k2hpo4 25 mg l mgso4 7h2o 30 mg l feso4 7h2o 30 mg l cacl2 and 1 0 ml l trace element solution 2 4 analysis of eps content and components a thermal method for extracting the extracellular polymeric substances eps was employed in conformity with a previous study zhang et al 2019 two main fractions of eps i e proteins pn and polysaccharides ps were quantified by the modified lowery method peterson 1977 and phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 respectively 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra of the extracted eps samples were analyzed by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4700 hitachi japan a parallel factor parafac analysis was employed to handle the eem data and identify the eps components sheng et al 2013 2 5 surface thermodynamics and xdlvo curve analysis the zeta potential of abgs was measured by using a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk for analysis of the contact angle the sludge samples were broken using an ultrasonic cell disruptor xinyi 250n china at 20 khz for 5 min and the sludge suspension was diluted to 50 ml with deionized water subsequently the suspensions were vacuum filtered onto 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membrane filters followed by air drying at 25 a contact angle goniometer dataphysics oca20 germany was used to measure the contact angles of sludge against distilled water formamide and diiodomethane by measuring the contact angle of abgs the surface tension and interface free energy the surface thermodynamic and the xdlvo curve of the abgs can be analyzed the detailed methods for surface thermodynamics analysis and xdlvo calculation are provided in the supplementary materials text s2 2 6 high throughput sequencing the community compositions bacteria algae and fungi of the inoculum sludge as well as the abgs samples taken from r1 r3 on day 30 were evaluated using the high throughput sequencing technology the universal primer pairs 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 were used to amplify the bacterial 16s rrna region targeting the v3 v4 regions lu et al 2015 the primer pairs p23srv 1f 5 ggacagaaagaccctatgaa 3 and p23srv 1r 5 tcagcctgttatccctagag 3 for algae were used for amplification of the hypervariable region of 18s rrna zhang et al 2020b the specific primer sets with barcode its1f 5 cttggtcatttagaggaagtaa 3 and its2r 5 gctgcgttcttcatcgatgc 3 were employed to amplify the fungal its region gardes and bruns 1993 the detailed analytical methods were provided in a previous study guo et al 2019 2 7 analytical methods mixed liquor volatile suspended solids ml v ss svi30 and the concentrations of cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn and po4 3 p in the influent and effluent were determined by standard methods apha 2005 the chlorophyll α content was analyzed using the acetone extraction method ritchie 2008 particle size was measured by a laser particle size analyzer malvern panalytical inc malvern uk and image j software morphology of the granules was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem quattro s thermo scientific the distribution of algae in the abgs was observed by fluorescence microscopy through spontaneous fluorescence of chloroplast at 488 nm excitation wavelength the distribution of nucleic acids proteins α polysaccharides and β polysaccharides in the abgs was visualized by using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss axio scan z1 germany the activities of functional bacteria including ammonia oxidizing bacteria saur nitrite oxidation bacteria snur and heterotrophs sour were determined according to huang et al 2015 the atpase activity was evaluated by a total atpase kit nanjing jiancheng china as described by jiang and liu 2012 2 8 statistical analysis all experiments were performed in triplicate significant differences in variables were ascertained using spss software version 25 0 ibm and a p value 0 05 was regarded as a significant difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal biosynthesis conditions of mps and amps 3 1 1 preparation of mps and amps at optimal conditions the biosynthesis conditions of mps were first optimized in this study as shown in fig 1 a the growth of mps sharply increased during the initial 72 h followed by a relatively saturated state besides various factors that greatly influence the formation of mps including temperature ph rotary speed and initial inoculum spores density were explored in this study results showed that thee biomass of mps reached the maximal value when the cultivation conditions were controlled at an inoculum spores density of 6 3 106 cfu ml ph 6 0 rotary speed of 150 rpm and 35 c fig 1b e since it takes more energy to keep the temperature high and the operational temperature for abgs is generally controlled at 25 30 c 30 c was chosen as the optimal temperature for preparing the mps the adsorption method and co culture method to prepare the amps were comparatively investigated it took respectively 12 h adsorption method and 24 h co culture method to achieve complete flocculation of the algae fig 1f g besides the amps prepared by the adsorption method were more numerous fig 1l and fig s3 the adsorption method was therefore chosen for preparing the amps the preparation conditions of amps were further optimized by evaluating the effects of the mps cultivation period as well as the dosage amounts of mps and algal cells on the flocculation efficiency fig 1 h j shows that the flocculation efficiency reached the maximal value of approximately 99 0 when dosing 50 ml algal cells cell density of 8 5 106 cell ml and 12 g wet weight mps which were pre cultured for 72 h the high flocculation efficiency was possibly due to the mediation of surface protein secreted by the mps the calcium bridging and the increase of hydrophobic interactions li et al 2017 the mps obtained at the optimal conditions had a relatively loose boundary and compact kernel with uniform size of approximately 1 2 mm fig 1k there was no conspicuous difference in morphology between mps and amps except for the color which changed from white to green fig 1l chlorella were closely attached onto the mycelium and mainly distributed in the outer layer of the amps as revealed by sem and tem images fig 1l furthermore the long and dense mycelia intertwined with each other within amps and correspondingly channels and voids were formed on the surface which may play a role of skeleton necessary for bacterial adhesion and the porous structure could facilitate mass transfer lahlali and hijri 2010 therefore it was speculated that the amps might be the ideal nuclei to enhance the development of abgs 3 1 2 optimal mass ratio of amps and activated sludge the mass ratio of amps and activated sludge which plays a central role in affecting the aggregation ability of the abgs was investigated herein at the initial sludge concentration of 3 0 g l mlss as shown in fig s4 the sludge amount adsorbed by amps decreased with further increase of the amps proportion besides the amps gradually broke down or even vanished when the dry mass ratio of amps and activated sludge exceeded 2 5 this may be attributed to the maladaptation of mps to the environment in the bioreactor system phagocytosis by metazoans or exfoliation caused by hydraulic shear leading to amps disintegration fomina and gadd 2002 therefore the optimal mass ratio was determined at 2 5 the ratio of dry weight of amps to that of activated sludge w w 3 2 granulation process and abgs morphology 3 2 1 characteristics of abgs for development of the self sustaining abgs the activated sludge as was inoculated into the three photo reactors to obtain an initial mlss concentration of approximately 3 6 g l in each photo reactor the initial mps and amps concentration in r2 and r3 were roughly 0 1 g l dry weight for a mass ratio to as of 2 5 the granulation process can be classified into three phases according to the variations of the indexes ml v ss svi30 svi30 svi5 and particle size initiation multiplication and stabilization during the initiation phase days 0 8 the mlss concentrations declined from 3 7 g l to 3 4 g l r1 3 6 g l r2 and 3 2 g l r3 respectively which might be subjected to biomass loss associated with the progressive reduction of settling time fig 2 a c in addition except for an apparent rise of svi30 in r1 increased to 56 0 ml g the svi30 of r2 and r3 granules decreased to 48 4 ml g and 47 3 ml g after 8 days respectively fig 2d implying the settling ability of the sludge was improved by dosing the mps or amps meanwhile the mean particle size slightly increased from 82 1 μm to 109 6 μm r1 137 7 μm r2 and 134 0 μm r3 fig 2e and fig s5 the symbiotic growth of algae and bacteria was verified in r3 as the concentration of chlorophyll α increased with operation time fig 2f during the multiplication phase days 8 24 biomass discharge was periodically performed to maintain a relatively stable biomass concentration in all photo reactors the mlss concentrations in r3 was higher than that in r1 and r2 indicating that addition of amps enhanced the biomass retention capacity possibly due to that the algae cell surface properties expedited the bio flocculation process besides the amps exhibited a large specific surface area with high hydrophobicity due to hydrophobins that could provide favorable habitats for microorganisms attachment and survival liang et al 2019 the average diameter of the r3 granules underwent a gradual increase to 300 μm and the svi30 svi5 ratio reached 0 87 on day 12 fig 2d e completion of sludge granulation was defined as particle size 300 μm and svi30 svi5 0 8 liu and tay 2007 nancharaiah and reddy 2018 on the basis of the above criteria complete granulation of abgs was achieved within 12 days in r3 notably r1 and r2 achieved complete granulation after 28 and 20 days respectively at the stabilization phase days 24 35 r3 granules exhibited the most excellent sludge characteristics as evidenced by the largest particle size 3 3 mm the greatest mlss concentration 2 2 g l the highest chlorophyll α content 3 8 mg l and the most excellent settleability svi30 svi5 of 0 99 and svi30 of 53 2 ml g fig 2 the stability of sludge is generally expressed as the integrity coefficient with the lower values indicating the better structural stability muda et al 2010 the integrity coefficient 2 74 of mature abgs in r3 was much lower than that in r1 and r2 on day 35 table s1 in addition the sludge density of r1 1 0184 g ml was lower than that of r3 1 0253 g ml these results showed that addition of amps could effectively accelerate the development of a self sustaining symbiotic abgs and the compact structure deriving from higher biomass retention was contributive to maintain their granular stability 3 2 2 the observation of abgs morphology the brown inoculum sludge gradually turned into a greenish color and the applied mps and amps started to get smaller during the initiation phase fig 3 and fig s6 many irregular large particles were observed in r1 r3 at the multiplication phase and they became denser in sphere or ellipse shape at the stabilization phase fig 3a f high magnification sem images revealed many protozoa vorticella accumulated on the surfaces of r1 r3 granules signifying a superior effluent quality in the self sustaining algae bacterial symbiosis system no obvious filaments were observed on the mature granule surface of r2 and r3 indicating that the addition of mps or amps did not induce the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria fluorescence microscopic images clearly showed that a spherical structure of the abgs was formed with the core of amps in which the mycelium and algae cells were tightly wrapped in the inner part of the granules and the morphological structure of chlorella was integrated fig 3g and fig s7 a large number of bacteria red stained adhered onto the surface of hyphae within the granular core of r3 suggesting the role of supporting skeleton played by amps fig s7 these observations confirmed that the rapid granulation of abgs was induced by applying amps as the nuclei furthermore the proteins green stained α polysaccharides blue stained and β polysaccharides yellow stained formed a continuous layer that occupied the central region of the abgs constituting the matrix of the abgs the entwined hyphae in the amps provoked the formation of voids and channels within r3 granules fig s7 thus facilitated the mass transfer of substrates and dissolved oxygen inhibited the filamentous overgrowth and improved the morphological integrity of granules 3 3 overall performance synergistic algal bacterial reactions and mass balance analysis 3 3 1 photo reactor performance the average cod removal efficiency of r3 98 6 was higher than that of r1 96 4 and r2 98 1 fig 4 a the high mlss concentration in r3 might provide the reasonable explanation for the high degradation of organic matter moreover mps have been reported to be efficient in eliminating the contaminants via biosorption and biodegradation wang et al 2010 similarly it was considered that the addition of amps was beneficial for elevating the cod removal efficiency the nh4 n was removed with the overall efficiency approaching 100 in all photo reactors data not shown and negligible no2 n accumulation 0 5 mg l suggesting the excellent nitrification capability in the abgs systems with the extension of operating time there was an observation of evident declining tendency in the effluent no3 n concentration in r1 r3 which should be responsible for the enhanced tn removal efficiency fig 4c in comparison the effluent no3 n concentration in r3 11 5 mg l was lower than that in r1 19 5 mg l and r2 12 5 mg l at the end of photo reactor operation fig 4b this may be attributable to the expanded granule diameter whereby the enlarged anaerobic anoxic region created a more favorable environment for denitrification winkler et al 2013 the average tn removal efficiency 80 8 obtained in r3 was relatively higher than that of the abgs cultivated under air bubbling conditions averagely 40 3 huang et al 2020 fig 4d illustrates the po4 3 p removal profile in all three photo reactors r3 exhibited the most satisfactory performance in po4 3 p removal since the removal efficiency averagely exceeded 80 0 the biological phosphorus removal was the primary mechanism as the chemical phosphorus removal could be ignored due to the ph below 8 5 in all the photo reactors de godos et al 2009 as demonstrated earlier phosphorus present in wastewater in the forms of organic and inorganic phosphorus both can be effectively utilized by algae cells he et al 2018a therefore the improved capability of po4 3 p removal in r3 was partially associated with the accumulated algal biomass concentration to evaluate the removal pathways of cod and nutrients typical cycle tests of r1 r3 were performed and compared between the light and dark cycles the variations in the nutrient concentration followed a parallel pattern during the light and dark cycles in all photo reactors fig s8 during one cycle cod and nh4 n were well removed in all three photo reactors fig s8a f suggesting that abgs had a better capability for cod and nh4 n removal the po4 3 p removal efficiency in the light cycle was better than in the dark cycle in r1 r3 fig s8a c indicating a certain amount of po4 3 p was removed by algal photosynthesis in the light phase specifically the po4 3 p concentration gradually increased from 5 0 mg l to 21 5 mg l light cycle and from 4 0 mg l to 18 5 mg l dark cycle at the initial 2 h in r3 they gradually declined to 1 0 mg l light cycle and 2 5 mg l dark cycle during the subsequent operating time 2 12 h fig s8c this indicated that po4 3 p was partially removed by phosphorus accumulating organisms paos in addition to uptake by algae which is further investigated in section 3 6 the above results implied that the addition of amps exhibited a promising potential for cod and nutrient removal likely due to the successful accumulation of algae cells and the enhancement of microbial activities to investigate the microbial activities the sour saur and snur of the abgs in all photo reactors were analyzed fig s9a b the maximum sour was obtained in r3 66 2 mg o2 g mlss h which was higher than that in r1 61 5 mg o2 g mlss h similarly the saur and snur of r3 were higher than those in the other two photo reactors indicating that the activities of aob and nob could be enhanced by applying amps as nuclei the activity of microorganisms can be directly reflected by the content of intracellular adenosine triphosphate atp cui et al 2018 the atp content of r1 and r2 slightly decreased respectively to 4 8 and 5 0 u mg prot on day 35 while it still maintained at a high level 6 3 u mg prot in r3 fig s9c the reduction in the atp content implied that a higher fraction of bacteria was inactive or died in r1 and r2 granules possibly related to the low do and shear force whereas the high microbial activity in r3 was contributive to the cod and nutrient removal fig 4 the high microbial activity in r3 was partially owing to the proper mass transfer resistance within the micro environment fig 3 and fig s7 enabled the substrates transportation and created an anoxic zone for denitrification geng et al 2021 3 3 2 synergistic algal bacterial reactions in the abgs system in the self sustaining symbiotic abgs o2 was produced by algae and utilized by aerobic bacteria i e o2 plays a pivotal role between photosynthetic and heterotrophic reactions the difference in do concentration profiles between light and dark phases in a typical cycle fig s8g i mirrored closely the coupling of algal photosynthesis and bacterial respiration the higher do value during the light cycle was possibly owing to the photosynthesis of algae which could provide more o2 to maintain the activity of aerobic bacteria nitrification and heterotrophic bacteria it should be noted that in such a self sustaining abgs system the external aeration was not indispensable which would save the aeration associated energy input accounting for approximately 60 of the total energy in the conventional bacteria based ags system bengtsson et al 2018 3 3 3 mass balance analysis of c n and p according to ji et al 2021 microbial assimilation is the primary mechanism for c n and p removal in an abgs system to further ascertain the contribution of algae and bacteria to the removal of c n and p the respective synthetic reactions for bacteria and algae were constructed based on the empirical formula i e ch1 4o0 4n0 2p0 017 for bacteria and ch1 78o0 36n0 12p0 01 for algae boelee et al 2014 the synthetic reactions for bacteria and algae are described in eq 2 and eq 3 respectively bacterial assimilation reaction with acetate as the organic carbon source c h 3 co o 0 88 o 2 0 22 nh 4 0 019 h 2 po 4 0 8 h 2 0 91 c o 2 1 6 h 2 o 1 1 c h 1 4 n 0 2 o 0 4 p 0 017 algal assimilation reaction with co2 as carbon source c o 2 0 12 nh 4 0 01 h 2 po 4 0 69 h 2 o 3 1 19 o 2 0 11 h c h 1 78 n 0 12 o 0 36 p 0 01 therefore the mass ratio f of removed carbon to nitrogen can be estimated from eq 4 i e 4 f c co d inf c co d eff 1 1 2 m c m a c c nh 4 n inf c nh 4 n eff where c co d inf and c nh 4 n inf are influent cod concentration and nh4 n concentration respectively c co d eff and c nh 4 n eff are effluent cod concentration and nh4 n concentration respectively while m c and m a c are the molecular weights of carbon and ac respectively in addition the coefficient 1 1 is the conversion ratio of ac to cod fig 5 shows that c n and p were majorly removed by bacterial metabolism which was consistent with ji et al 2020 furthermore 34 6 of c 17 0 of n 10 0 of p were removed by algae in r3 system which were higher than those in r1 and r2 some algae species especially green algae are able to take up nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus as energy sources for synthesizing their own cellular substances lee et al 2015 the higher retention of algae biomass chlorophyll α content of 3 8 mg l in r3 because of the efficient flocculation by mps could also contribute to the efficient nutrient removal 3 4 eps production of abgs 3 4 1 analysis of pn and ps content eps secreted by microorganisms play a key role in the sludge granulation and the structural stability of abgs shi and liu 2021 with the progress of granulation the pn content gradually increased to the maximal value of 44 9 mg g ss r1 46 3 mg g ss r2 and 51 1 mg g ss r3 which was respectively 3 1 3 2 and 3 6 folds higher than that of the activated sludge fig 6 a c notably the variation tendency of pn ps ratio over the range of 1 35 to 4 03 was analogous to that of the pn content fig 6a c with observation of no considerable fluctuation in ps content in all photo reactors throughout the whole process this is in line with a previous study where the granulation was positively affected by pn especially for the primary stage he et al 2018b at a later stage of the experiment the pn content dramatically decreased in r1 and slightly decreased in r2 while it remained steady in r3 finally the pn content followed an increasing order r1 29 6 mg g ss r2 34 7 mg g ss r3 48 3 mg g ss a similar pattern was observed that the addition of mps could stimulate bacteria to produce more pn geng et al 2020 pn are relatively hydrophobic substances and the high level of relative hydrophobicity contributes to the decrease of the gibbs free energy thus facilitating the microorganisms to aggregate together and enhancing the stability of the self sustaining symbiotic abgs system zhang et al 2020a 3 4 2 functional groups and fluorescent components of eps ftir spectrometry was adopted to identify the functional groups of eps samples obtained from the abgs and inoculum sludge fig s10 the intensities of two absorption peaks appeared at 3440 cm 1 associated with the polysaccharide oh stretching vibration and 1646 cm 1 associated with the c o bond amide i in the protein primary structure were observed to be strengthened in the abgs samples compared to the inoculum sludge which was consistent with the improvement of pn content fig 6a c in addition the peak at 1096 cm 1 or 1033 cm 1 attributing to polysaccharide c o stretching vibration existed in all eps samples lotti et al 2019 in comparison the intensity of this absorption peak in the abgs was obviously lower than the inoculum sludge this implied that polysaccharides were not the active agents to promote microbial aggregation 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to identify the fluorescent components in the eps fig s11 due to the complex compositions of eps the fluorescence spectra seriously overlapped in fig s11 parallel factor parafac analysis was therefore performed to separate the eem spectra into independent components ishii and boyer 2012 three components were identified as component 1 component 2 and component 3 table 1 component 1 with two peaks at ex em of 220 230 325 375 nm and 250 300 325 375 nm represent the tryptophan and aromatic protein like substances component 2 with ex em at 200 230 350 450 nm and 250 300 350 450 nm was classified as fulvic like and humic like substances component 3 with ex em at 200 230 300 325 nm was identified as protein like substances mainly tyrosine substances luo et al 2014 notably the fi value of component 1 in r3 772 2 was obviously higher than that in r1 and r2 while no significant difference was obtained between r1 731 4 and r2 728 5 for components 2 and 3 there was no obvious difference among the three photo reactors fig 6d therefore it was considered that applying amps as nuclei enhanced the sludge granulation by stimulating the secretion of tryptophan and aromatic protein substances 3 5 analysis of surface free energy of abgs 3 5 1 electronegativity and hydrophobicity the zeta potential of the activated sludge was 14 00 mv and it gradually increased along with the granulation process table s2 at the end of the photo reactor operation the highest zeta potential 11 30 mv was obtained in r3 indicating the electrostatic repulsion between the microorganisms was greatly weakened which was conducive to their mutual aggregation liu et al 2007 furthermore the contact angles of all the sludge samples against water formamide and diiodomethane exhibited distinct increases after complete granulation table s2 notably the contact angle between r3 granules and water clearly increased 87 71 hydrophobicity can be considered to be dominant when the contact angle between the microbial cell surface and water is higher than 65 liu et al 2008 these results indicated that the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface was improved by applying amps as nuclei in a self sustaining symbiotic abgs system cell hydrophobicity is the initial driving force that promotes granular sludge formation and is a crucial factor in bacterial aggregation liu and tay 2004 as described earlier the enhancement of hydrophobicity on the cell surface was beneficial for promoting the microbial aggregation and subsequently forming a more compact three dimensional granular structure adav et al 2008 3 5 2 surface thermodynamic analysis based on xdlvo theory the free energy values and the parameters related to the surface thermodynamics of sludge samples were calculated according to the formula of the surface thermodynamic analysis and the results are shown in table 2 the magnitude of the interfacial free energy δgadh can be used to determine the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface brant and childress 2002 here the δgadh values of r3 69 56 mj m2 was lower than that of r1 60 83 mj m2 and r2 67 34 mj m2 granules according to the thermodynamic theory adhesion between microorganisms is more prone to occur if the δgadh value is lower liu et al 2008 therefore it was demonstrated that the addition of amps positively modified the thermodynamic characteristics of the sludge surface and the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface was improved which is consistent with the contact angles results table s2 herein the xdlvo theory was further employed to reveal the inherent mechanism of bacterial aggregation the potential energy barrier existed on all the total potential energy curves of r1 r3 fig 7 aggregation could occur when microorganisms had enough energy to surpass this potential energy barrier liu et al 2008 besides the lower energy barrier indicated that lower energy was required by the microorganisms to aggregate the total potential energy curves showed that r1 and r2 reached the energy barrier of 138 98 kt and 109 64 kt at 5 50 nm and 5 65 nm respectively while r3 reached the energy barrier 89 93 kt at 5 75 nm indicating that r3 had the lowest energy barrier and the strongest capacity of microbial aggregation 3 6 community structure dynamics of bacteria algae and fungus in contrast to the inoculum sludge the abgs samples had a higher simpson index and lower shannon index indicating that the bacterial diversity of the microbial population decreased in the abgs system table s3 in addition the inoculum sludge exhibited a higher ace index 1000 and chao index 1007 compared to abgs samples demonstrating that the microbial population in the inoculum sludge was more abundant this observation is consistent with guo et al 2019 who suggested that the richness and diversity of microorganisms decreased during the granulation as the granulation progressed the phylum actinobacteriota sharply dropped to below 0 21 in all three photo reactors nevertheless the relative abundance of the phylum proteobacteria was dramatically improved during the photo granulation especially in r3 62 68 which was 3 7 folds higher than that in the inoculum sludge 16 91 fig 8 a lots of evidence confirmed that most of the paos belong to the phylum proteobacteria zhang et al 2012 the heat map showed that the dominant genus in all abgs samples were significantly different from the inoculum sludge fig 8e to be specific the relative abundance of the genus neomegalonema affiliating to the phylum proteobacteria significantly increased to 43 82 r1 20 71 r2 and 46 11 r3 fig 8b the n and p removal efficiencies and eps content were found to be positively correlated with neomegalonema fig 8f this bacterial genus is well known for taking up organic and nitrogenous substances and it is also a pao and eps producer cruz et al 2022 ramos et al 2015 therefore it was inferred that the superior removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p as well as the higher eps content in r3 could be partially ascribed to the proliferation of this genus furthermore the relative abundance of the genus flavobacterium from the phylum bacteroidota gradually increased to 5 12 in r3 and exhibited a positive relationship with the eps production as well as nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency fig 8f this is agree with a previous work which indicated that flavobacterium was an eps secreting bacterium with strong self agglomeration ability liu et al 2017 besides as a denitrifying phosphate accumulating organism dpao flavobacterium could assist in simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphate sengar et al 2018 thereby the higher abundance of flavobacterium may have supported the nutrient removal in r3 for the inoculum sludge the genus candidatus microthrix is the most abundant bacterium 15 48 however it almost disappeared in the abgs as reported before the filamentous bacteria candidatus microthrix is a filamentous bacteria which prefers to dominate in the loosely structured sludge blackall et al 1996 this corresponded well to the observation that there were no visible filaments attached on the surface of r3 granules fig 3 as for the algal community the algae chlorella was identified in all abgs samples because of the targeted control fig 8c comparatively the relative abundance of chlorella f chlorellaceae in r3 23 25 was higher than that of r1 18 52 and r2 11 68 sludge indicating that algal cells were effectively enriched in r3 chlorella is capable of assimilating n and p from wastewater into cellular components such as phospholipids nucleic acids and nucleotides during the growth process which favors the nutrients removal from wastewater mahapatra et al 2013 therefore it was suggested that the addition of amps could retain the targeted algae in the system which was beneficial for enhancing the nutrient removal and establishing the favorable symbiosis between bacteria and algae fig 8d shows that the most dominant fungi in the abgs were tolypocladium r1 catenaria r2 and aspergillus r3 respectively among the classified fungi the genus aspergillus accounted for 38 76 in r3 and was distinctly higher than that in r1 0 96 and r2 3 76 thereby the addition of mps could not only effectively retain the aspergillus but the growth and bioactivity of aspergillus could be well maintained in the photo bioreactor via the addition of amps 3 7 mechanisms analysis and practical implications of this study in this study the development process of abgs induced by amps as nuclei was analyzed to further unravel the internal enhancement mechanisms firstly many flocs attached onto the surface of the amps on day 5 implying the initial formation of amps based granules fig s4 however the young amps based granules appeared to be destabilized and broke into several fragments on day 8 as evidenced by the morphological observation of the granules fig s6 afterwards the fragments of granules acted as nuclei and induced the formation of compact granules fig 3g and fig s7 this result was consistent with wang et al 2014 and geng et al 2020 who reported that the fragments resulting from the granular disintegration could serve as nuclei for the re production of granules amps formed by combining mps with algal cells secreted a large amount of eps detailed analysis see fig s12 and text s3 which was conducive to accelerate the granulation process wang et al 2019 with the enhancement of bacterial collisions and eps secretion the particle diameter was further enlarged and thus provided sufficient ecological niches for the growth of the genus neomegalonema flavobacterium and norank f microscillaceae these bacteria are capable of degrading organic and nitrogenous substances in addition the inoculated algae were effectively enriched in the system and a good symbiotic relationship between bacteria and algae was established consequently satisfactory nitrogen and phosphorus removal averagely 100 0 and 80 8 respectively from the wastewater was realized the analysis of the surface free energy of the abgs further revealed that the addition of amps could provide more energy to overcome the electrostatic repulsive forces between the cells δgadh values of 69 56 mj m2 thereby inducing the microbial aggregation notably the mature abgs inhibited the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria which was beneficial for maintaining the long term stability of the abgs systems fig 8 in a nutshell this study showed that applying amps as the primary nuclei significantly accelerated the development of abgs it is worth emphasizing that except for rapid start up of abgs system and efficient nutrient removal this novel strategy is also promising in the following aspects a rapid formation and easy separation of amps based on the co pelletization strategy the algal cells chlorella were entrapped in the mps of aspergillus within 12 h under the optimized conditions the formed amps 1 2 mm in diameter with excellent settling capability could be easily separated from the culture media merely relying on gravity sedimentation b low dosage amount of amps in addition experimental results indicated that the optimal dry mass ratio of amps and activated sludge was as low as 2 5 much lower than the dosage amount of mps up to 60 w w as carriers for accelerating the aerobic sludge granulation geng et al 2021 indicating that this strategy was economically competitive and thereby could be envisaged for large scale application c great potential for resource recovery most of the nutrients in the wastewater were removed via bacterial and algal assimilations during the photo granulation process fig 5 i e they were concentrated in the abgs biomass besides the fungal genus aspergillus which can produce enzymes such as laccase and protease cabaleiro et al 2002 and a cyclosporin producing fungus tolypocladium aarnio and agathos 1989 were also accumulated in the abgs therefore the abgs biomass has a broad prospect to be a potential resource recovery factory in the forms of biodiesel fertilizers pharmaceuticals etc despite of the aforementioned advantages further research should be carried out at pilot or full scale facilities to provide data from practical applications and prolong the operational process to verify the long term effects of implementing this strategy on the road to advance this promising technology towards engineering applications significant efforts are required on a paradigm shift of the abgs system from current single functionality nutrient removal toward multiple functionality wastewater treatment energy production resource recovery for maximizing the environmental sustainability and economic viability 4 conclusions a novel strategy by using amps as nuclei was proposed with the purpose to accelerate the development of a self sustaining symbiotic abgs the results showed that the abgs was rapidly developed within 12 days with large particle size compact structure and excellent settling property high bioactivity and satisfactory nutrient removal efficiency the fungus aspergillus with the targeted algae chlorella acted as the granule nuclei the reinforced secretion of tryptophan and aromatic protein as well as the enrichment of functional bacteria such as neomegalonema and flavobacterium contributed to the rapid granulation of abgs the surface free energy of abgs indicated that the repulsive barrier between microorganisms was significantly decreased which was the inherent mechanism for the readily bacterial aggregation overall this study provided a cost efficient and practically feasible approach to accelerate the development of a self sustaining symbiotic abgs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

16211,internal water storage iws a below grade saturated layer is a bioretention design component created by adjusting the underdrain outlet elevation anaerobic conditions and the presence of a carbon source in iws facilitates denitrification yet it remains unclear how underdrain height within the iws impacts nitrate no3 removal this study applied synthetic stormwater with no3 to three laboratory columns with underdrains located at the bottom middle or top of a 32 cm thick gravel woodchip iws under steady state conditions underdrain nitrogen removal demonstrated a positive linear relationship with increasing hydraulic residence time hrt for a 1 cm h hydraulic loading rate hlr nitrogen removal efficiency increased from 52 to 99 as underdrain height moved from the top to the bottom despite identical iws thickness across columns immobilize zones below the middle and top underdrains limited the steady state nitrogen removal dual isotopes in no3 also indicated denitrification occurred in mobile zones and showed little or no denitrification in immobile zones due to limited mass transport transient flow conditions were applied to mimic storms followed by dry conditions lower effluent nitrogen concentrations and mass fluxes were observed from the bottom underdrain across the range of hlrs tested 1 to 5 cm h but performance of all three underdrains converged after the application of one pore volume the top underdrain enhanced mixing between new incoming low doc stormwater and old iws water with high doc which minimized effluent doc concentrations no3 isotope enrichment factors indicated denitrification during transient flow for all three underdrain heights and enrichment increased for the 5 cm h hlr for sites with narrow iws geometries width to depth ratio 1 optimal underdrain height is likely located between the bottom and top of the iws to promote mixing with old iws water high in doc and sustain denitrification during storms graphical abstract graphical

a major pollutant source to receiving waters nutrients such as nitrogen conveyed in runoff cause habitat degradation and algal blooms which are expected to worsen with population growth and climate change whitehead et al 2009 green stormwater infrastructure gsi is implemented in urban landscapes to protect water resources bioretention is a passive gsi strategy that employs multiple functions ponding infiltration biotic processes and water storage to manage runoff quantity and water quality the main design components include a vegetated basin filled with engineered media an underdrain is often incorporated in a gravel layer below engineered fill media to collect a portion of infiltrated stormwater and discharge to the sewer network or receiving waterbody internal water storage iws is a subsurface bioretention design component created by raising the outlet elevation of the underdrain for combined sewer systems iws provides additional storage volume and water is primarily released via exfiltration into native media for separate sewer systems sites with less permeable soils or nutrient sensitive watersheds iws can be implemented for water quality improvements brown et al 2009 nitrate no3 removal in bioretention occurs via plant uptake or biotic processes including denitrification or dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonia dnra bu et al 2017 igielski et al 2019 li et al 2019 when the iws remains saturated and a carbon source is available often leached from woodchips iws provides favorable conditions for denitrification and no3 is reduced to nitrogen gas n2 kim et al 2003 iws design often connects the perforated underdrain located at the base of the gravel layer to an upturned elbow alternatively a raised underdrain can be positioned at the top of the iws to achieve the same thickness and storage capacity donaghue et al 2022 however the impact of iws underdrain configuration on no3 removal needs to be evaluated understanding the impact of iws design choices on water quality specifically no3 advances design and informs practitioners increased hydraulic residence time hrt corresponds to increased no3 removal halaburka et al 2017 igielski et al 2019 for example one study demonstrated that hrt accounted for 93 of no3 removal compared to the variables of dissolved oxygen do temperature and influent no3 concentration martin et al 2019 we previously employed bioretention columns and modeling to demonstrate that raised underdrain heights with respect to the bottom of the iws introduced nonideal flow regions or immobile zones raised underdrain heights reduced hydraulic efficiency and consequently the measured hrt donaghue et al 2022 it is expected that iws underdrain height would influence no3 removal efficiency which served as a primary motivation to this study in urban environments space limitations and property costs present challenges for gsi implementation understanding the impact of iws underdrain height on no3 removal particularly in narrow systems can allow design flexibility without compromising water quality goals because iws underdrain height induces different flow patterns the consideration of how iws underdrain height impacts no3 dynamics as a function of rain intensity and dry periods is critical under intense precipitation faster infiltration rates into the iws can shorten hrts and consequently reduce no3 removal optimizing iws underdrain configuration to site specific characteristics could combat these effects and maximize no3 removal during precipitation during antecedent dry periods adp woodchips leach dissolved organic carbon doc into iws porewater and doc concentrations can increase as adp increases lynn et al 2015a however during prolonged adps evapotranspiration and exfiltration to underlying media can expose woodchips at the top of the iws to unsaturated conditions others have shown that woodchips in unsaturated layers degrade faster than saturated woodchips and can export higher doc and organic nitrogen lynn et al 2015a the selection of an appropriate iws underdrain configuration may require balancing multiple water quality parameters such as no3 and doc dual isotopes in no3 is a tool gaining traction to characterize nitrogen processing in stormwater burgis et al 2020 burns et al 2009 carey et al 2013 yang and toor 2016 dual isotopes refer to the analysis of both the nitrogen isotopes 14n and 15n and the oxygen isotopes 16o and 18o in no3 isotopes can be useful for identifying transformation processes when the process preferentially favors an isotope leading to fractionation for example a kinetic isotope effect is created during microbial denitrification as organisms preferentially consume lighter nitrogen and oxygen isotopes 14n and 16o this depletion creates solute no3 enriched in heavier isotopes 15n and 18o mariotti et al 1981 zhang et al 2019 consequently denitrification is marked by a predominantly linear positive trend in both the δ15n and δ18o batch experiments demonstrated microbial denitrification can cause isotopic fractionation within tens of minutes to several hours currie 2007 kim et al 2003 sebilo et al 2019 however isotope patterns in flow through systems such as iws are not well studied here column experiments coupled with dual isotope analysis contribute to understanding the application of nitrogen isotopes in gsi systems this work employs three laboratory bioretention columns comprised of a gravel woodchip iws with varying underdrain height to distinguish microbial denitrification from dilution under steady state and transient flow steady state conditions considered the effect of hrt on no3 removal efficiency and no3 removal kinetics transient conditions evaluated the effect of hydraulic loading rate hlr and adp on iws water quality nox dynamics and potential denitrification during flow events 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioretention column design iws underdrain height varied across three cylindrical bioretention columns 28 8 cm id 82 cm height fig 1 a by adjusting the elevation of 2 cm thick screened openings on the center pvc pipe as follows 0 to 2 cm bottom column 1 cm fig 1b 14 to 16 cm middle column 15 cm fig 1c and 30 to 32 cm top column 31 cm fig 1d iws media included a blend of pea gravel and hardwood woodchips at a ratio of 2 1 by volume the mixture and ratio were selected based on performance reported by others lynn et al 2015b further details regarding column media are provided in the si and our previous work donaghue et al 2022 the center pvc pipe connected to an upturned elbow outside each column the invert elevation of the outlet was 30 cm above the column base to maintain a constant iws thickness across all columns the iws included two sample port groups located 5 cm proximal p and 10 cm distal d from the center pvc pipe respectively the sample port heights were 5 10 20 and 25 cm above the column base fig 1a sample identification notes the sample group followed by sample height for example p 20 refers to the proximal iws sample port 20 cm above the column base sampling also included the underdrain effluent 2 2 key nomenclature bioretention columns were differentiated by the height of the underdrain using the terms bottom column 1 cm middle column 15 cm and top column 31 cm when referring to the underdrain sample location we used the terms bottom middle or top underdrain our previous study donaghue et al 2022 employed tracer studies and usgs vs2drti usgs 2019 modeling to characterize iws hydraulics results demonstrated the presence of mobile zones areas of flowing water generally above the underdrain and immobile zones low flow or stagnant areas below the middle and top underdrain to account for the presence of immobile zones measured hrt was calculated by multiplying the volume of column media by the effective pore volume pv which considers only the mobile region divided by flow rate equation s1 the experimental design included steady state ss continuous flow and transient trans intermittent flow events replicate transient events were conducted for each condition and are indicated using capitol roman numerals flow conditions were conducted at hlrs of 1 2 5 and 5 cm h which was also included in the event name transient events considered three different adps 2 8 6 8 and 13 8 days defined here as the dry time between the end of the transient event x and the start of event x 1 for reporting purposes nominal adps are used i e 3 7 and 14 days the term old iws water describes water stored in the iws between transient events and new water refers to fresh incoming synthetic stormwater applied to the top of the column wang et al 2018 the final event concentration refers to the final sample collected at t 300 minutes during transient events while no3 was the only nitrogen source added to synthetic stormwater column samples were analyzed for total nitrogen tn total dissolved nitrogen tdn ammonium ammonia nh4 nh3 and nox the sum of no3 plus nitrite no2 nitrite comprised less than 5 of nox monitored during events ss 5 and ss 2 5 therefore analysis was limited to nox for events following and was assumed to be predominantly no3 nox and doc mass loads released from the underdrain during flow were used to assess column performance mass loads were determined by integrating the area under the underdrain concentration curve using the trapezoidal method mass flux mg m2 for a given transient even equals the total mass load released from the underdrain during flow divided by the column horizontal cross sectional area 0 064 m2 2 3 synthetic stormwater preparation and application synthetic stormwater was prepared using deionized water or reverse osmosis water in a 246 l tank no3 in the form of sodium nitrate was added at a nominal concentration of 3 mg n l which agreed with other column studies igielski et al 2019 kim et al 2003 peterson et al 2015 and mimics no3 porewater concentrations observed for monitored field sites in philadelphia pa synthetic stormwater also included orthophosphate 0 1 mg p l to support microbial growth sodium chloride 58 4 mg l for ionic strength and sodium

corresponded to hlrs of 5 2 5 and 1 cm h respectively before initiating ss tracer studies described elsewhere occurred under continuous flow from november 2019 to january 2020 approximately 32 total pvs were applied to each column during this time donaghue et al 2022 the iws remained fully saturated during ss 5 through ss 1 february 2020 to march 2020 for each event flow application remained constant until the relative standard deviation of nox concentrations varied less than 30 for three consecutive measurements at the underdrain and mobile zone iws sample ports this generally occurred within 5 days the average influent synthetic stormwater no3 concentration for steady state was 2 90 0 26 mg n l samples were generally collected daily monday through friday and analyzed for parameters listed in table s3 the steady state nox removal efficiency was determined at the underdrain location using equation 5 5 n o x c i n f l u e n t c u n d e r d r a i n c i n f l u e n t 100 where cinfluent equals the synthetic stormwater nox concentration 3 mg n l and cunderdrain equals the observed underdrain effluent nox concentration significant differences across steady state events were determined using a paired t test α of 0 05 ss 1hlr finished on march 16 2020 after 5 months of continuous operation due to interruptions in lab access associated with covid restrictions the columns sat dormant for 4 5 months march through august 2020 and a portion of the iws became unsaturated during the dormant period upon returning to the lab a pulse tracer test was performed for all columns to establish a new baseline for hydraulics see si for details ss 1 5 postdormant was introduced at a hlr of 1 5 cm h to reacclimate denitrifying conditions before transitioning to transient flow events during ss 5hlr through ss 1 5 postdormant 110 total pvs were applied to each column 2 7 transient events transient flow provided an environmentally relevant representation of episodic storm and dry conditions transient events lasted five hours 300 min and considered hlrs of 1 2 5 and 5 cm h and adps of 3 7 and 14 days table 1 reports transient event sequencing the event identification notes either the hlr or adp testing scenario and the event replicate i e i ii or iii for example trans 2 5hlr ii refers to transient flow at a 2 5 cm h hlr replicate two for adp transient events a hlr of 2 5 cm h was applied after event trans 2 5hlr i different initial iws water levels were observed each iws was upfilled using reverse osmosis water prior to the start of the event to ensure iws water level depths were consistent across columns low no3 0 4 mg n l and phosphorous 0 2 mg p l concentrations reverse osmosis water was applied through the center pvc pipe filling the iws from the screened opening upward and pumped at a flow rate of 20 ml min this approach was adopted for the remainder of transient events transient sampling followed the frequency listed in table s4 samples were collected immediately before flow application t 0 min and then at time points of 100 140 180 220 260 300 min for the middle and top column and 120 160 200 240 280 300 min for the bottom column sample locations included the underdrain d 25 and d 05 the d 25 and d 05 locations were chosen to collect samples from both mobile and immobile zones determined from previous tracer studies donaghue et al 2022 to account for potential transitional effects between events sample collection was omitted for trans 2 5hlr i and trans 5hlr i a final pulse tracer test was performed at the end of transient events and confirmed flow patterns were not altered table s5 fig s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 steady state nox removal isotopes enrichment for mobile zones and iws non ideal flow nox removal efficiency equation 5 increased as underdrain height decreased for all steady state events fig 2 as hlr decreased from 5 to 1 cm h effluent nox removal increased from 25 to 99 for the bottom underdrain 22 to 84 for the middle underdrain and 10 to 52 for the top underdrain fig 2 p value 0 05 for ss 2 5hlr and ss 5hlr superior performance observed for the bottom underdrain is attributed to longer hrts relative to the middle and top underdrains heights table 1 for example mean tracer residence times equaled 5 0 h 3 8 h and 3 5 h for the bottom middle and top column respectively for an applied hlr of 5 cm h others demonstrated how longer hrt increases no3 removal halaburka et al 2017 he et al 2018 studies considering regression on do temperature influent no3 concentration and hrt indicated hrt contributed most 93 to no3 removal martin et al 2019 the dual isotope data from ss 1hlr support the effectiveness of mobile zones in denitrification the δ15n versus δ18o plot shows a 1 1 line indicating denitrification fig 3 a with up to a 13 difference from the synthetic stormwater water the middle and bottom columns showed a linear slope on the enrichment plots for both isotopes which confirmed that denitrification was occurring fig 3b however the top column showed a non linear enrichment response which indicated mixing of denitrified water and immobile zone water where no3 mass transfer was limited the isotope enrichment calculation helped distinguish between lower no3 concentration due to mixing with immobile zone water and denitrification which removes no3 the enrichment factors of 5 2 and 4 7 for δ15n versus δ18o were close in value table 2 with slightly lower expected for δ18o isotope enrichment factors for middle and bottom underdrains were also similar although slightly lower for middle underdrain 4 6 and 3 5 for δ15n versus δ18o isotope enrichment for ss 1hlr versus ss 1 5hlr post dormant was also similar 5 1 versus 5 4 for δ15n and 4 5 versus 5 0 for δ18o although the highest fractionation was observed for a single sample in ss 1hlr from the bottom underdrain water quality parameters of do doc and nh4 confirmed favorable conditions for denitrification existed in the iws for all columns denitrification conditions require do less than 3 mg o2 l gómez et al 2002 and an adequate carbon source such as doc leaching from woodchips newcomer et al 2012 steady state iws do concentrations measured at 15 cm height remained less than 0 2 mg o2 l across all three columns fig s2a s2b average doc concentrations were 2 1 to 4 8 mg c l during ss 5hlr and decreased to non detect levels 2 mg c l during ss 2 5hlr decreasing doc concentrations as hlr decreased is likely associated with longer hrt for no3 removal and doc utilization lynn et al 2015a during steady state effluent nh4 concentrations ranged from non detect i e 0 016 mg n l to 0 156 mg n l or 4 of the tn concentration and confirmed dnra was not a primary pathway for nox removal average effluent ph across all ss events increased relative to synthetic stormwater 7 06 0 03 to 7 36 0 07 7 34 0 02 and 7 47 0 09 for the bottom middle and top underdrain respectively hlr affected in situ iws nox concentration profiles as a function of depth fig 4 however transport across all three columns varied due to the presence and size of immobile zones in situ two dimensional iws sampling proved a useful approach to identify where processes occur and improve system design for the bottom column nox concentrations decreased as iws sample port height decreased i e approached the base for ss 2 5hlr average proximal iws nox concentrations decreased from 2 9 to 1 6 mg n l as sample port height decreased from p 25 to p 05 cm fig 4a additionally the concentration difference between the p 25 to p 05 iws sample height i e nox p 25 nox p 05 increased from 0 50 to 2 2 mg n l as hlr decreased from 5 to 1 cm h fig 4a the increased differential is attributed to increased residence time and consequently nox removal where denitrification was occurring iws nox concentrations decreased substantially for regions below the middle and top underdrain heights and is likely attributed to limited mass transport into the immobile zones for example nox concentrations remained less than 0 04 mg n l for iws locations p 20 through p 05 for the top column for ss 5hlr through ss 1hlr fig 4c steady state bioretention column nox concentration profiles and dual isotope analysis coupled with tracer studies and flow modeling from previous work suggest that while favorable conditions for denitrification exists in regions below the top and middle underdrain heights no3 removal is less efficient due to limited mass transport i e limited no3 exchange into the immobile zones donaghue et al 2022 however the degree of mass transport to the immobile zone is governed by the concentration gradient thus higher influent no3 concentrations would potentially increase mass transfer rates into this zone velocity heat maps for the ss 1hlr fig s3 illustrate the presence of immobile or low flow zones below the middle and top underdrain column tracer experiments and vs2drti flow and transport modeling conducted by this research group donaghue et al 2022 for the same experimental design demonstrated the presence of immobile zones below the top underdrain thickness 20 cm and middle underdrain thickness 5 cm calculated hydraulic efficiencies ev the mean tracer residence time divided by the theoretical residence time and tracer breakthrough curve statistics supported the presence of immobile zones specifically ev decreased from 1 0 to 0 76 as underdrain height increased from 1 to 31 cm hydraulic efficiencies 1 indicate non ideal flow where the mean tracer residence time is less than the theoretical residence time an undesirable design scenario where treatment volume is underutilized the presence of immobile zones suggests nonequilibrium flow where fluid is partitioned into regions of mobile flowing and immobile stagnant zones nonequilibrium flow includes a mass transfer coefficient as a third parameter to account for exchange between mobile and immobile zones field and pinsky 2000 the effect of iws underdrain configuration on system hydraulics and transport processes will also be influenced by the iws width to depth ratio the presence of immobile zones below the middle and top underdrain was specific to a case where the iws width to depth ratio equaled 0 5 15 cm width 30 cm depth two dimensional flow patterns were observed in mobile regions of the iws fig s3 with higher velocity zones closest to the underdrain location as a result distal sample ports had longer residence times and demonstrated lower no3 concentration profiles fig s4 simulations performed by our research group elsewhere donaghue et al 2022 also considered iws width to depth ratios greater than 1 50 cm width 30 cm depth for this scenario hydraulics efficiencies ranged 0 89 to 0 96 and immobile zones comprised less than 2 of the iws for iws width to depth ratios greater than 1 velocity heat maps showed a wider distribution of velocities while simulations indicated immobile zones were minimal for a iws width to depth ratio of 1 67 maximizing hrt will still be an important factor for achieving higher no3 removal efficiency 3 2 zero order kinetics and evidence of iws aging underdrain nox removal demonstrated a linear correlation with hrt fig 2 for events ss 5hlr through ss 1hlr higher correlations were observed for zero order k0 3 21 g n m 3 d 1 r2 0 946 fig s5a compared to first order kinetic estimates k1 4 25 d 1 r2 0 790 fig s5b the rate model employed by peterson et al 2015 was used to determine rate constants details in si often no3 removal kinetics are considered zero order where the reaction rate is controlled by an independent parameter i e hrt or release of doc from woodchips rather than no3 halaburka et al observed zero order kinetics for aged saturated 13 months woodchip bioreactor columns for an input no3 concentration of 10 mg n l and constant temperature 2017 first order removal rates have been reported for laboratory bioreactor columns influent of 1 to 6 mg n l igielski et al 2019 additionally transition to first order kinetics may occur at lower no3 concentrations 0 5 mg n l schipper et al 2010 addy et al compiled data across 26 peer reviewed papers which included 14 bed field studies and 10 laboratory column woodchip bioreactor studies 2016 authors reported that no3 removal rates during the first year were more than 3 times higher than aged systems therefore rates after year one of operation are more representative of performance long term interestingly columns in this current paper operated 5 months and did not meet the definition of aged yet observed zero order rates agree with mean no3 removal rates 2 8 g n m 3 d 1 for aged 13 to 24 month bioreactors rather than younger 13 month old bioreactors 9 1 g n m 3 d 1 addy et al 2016 during ss 1 5hlr postdormant orange symbology fig 2 removal rates for the middle and bottom underdrain decreased by 46 and 23 respectively these decreases are relative to the pre dormant performance and the percent removal deviated from linear trends observed during ss 5hlr through ss 1hlr green symbology no3 removal rates can vary during the initial one to three years of operation before stabilizing addy et al 2016 one column study using wood pulp and sand media reported a 50 decline in no3 removal efficiency within 1 year of operation robertson et al 2008 higher no3 removal rates that occurred during early operation were attributed to woodchips leaching excess organic material but leaching rates stabilized after extended use halaburka et al 2017 for bioretention systems iws media may not remain permanently saturated between precipitation events due to evapotranspiration and exfiltration to underlying media the 4 5 month dormant period during covid here represented an exaggerated adp case however the observed decline in no3 removal for the bottom and middle underdrains suggest prolonged exposure to semi saturated conditions could contribute to woodchip aging as stated above the isotope data showed the largest fractionation for a single sample in ss 1hlr but similar enrichment factors before and after the 4 5 month dormant period table 2 3 3 nox dual isotope and water quality patterns for transient events under different hlr as transient event hlr increased a higher fraction of old iws water was replaced with new incoming synthetic stormwater consequently nox concentrations fig 5 b and the mass flux of nox leaving the system table s7 increased at the underdrain for all three columns in between transient flow water was stored in the iws for a prolonged residence time 7 days trans 1hlr i through trans 5hlr iii and is more relevant to field conditions the bottom column performed best in minimizing the mass flux of nox from the underdrain followed by the middle and the top columns fig 5b table s7 for the highest hlr 5 cm h tested during transient events the applied iws pore volume was 2 3 total pore volume equaled 1 the final c co ranged from 0 69 to 0 84 fig 5b fig s6 and suggested no3 removal furthermore final c co for trans 5hlr was similar to no3 removal efficiency 100 1 c co observed during steady state ss 5hlr which ranged from 10 to 25 c co 0 75 to 0 90 nox concentration profiles for the d 05 location highlighted the underutilization of treatment volume for a portion of the iws below the middle and top columns during events fig 5c for trans 2 5hlr and trans 5hlr the bottom column nox concentration profiles for the underdrain and d 05 followed similar breakthrough patterns fig 5c average normalized peak nox concentrations for the bottom column d 05 location equaled 0 57 and 0 84 mg n l for trans 2 5hlr and trans 5hlr respectively in contrast the middle and top column normalized cpeak nox concentrations at the d 05 location remained 97 less than the influent concentration across all hlr events fig 5c low nox concentrations observed at d 05 for the middle and top column are likely attributed to presence of an immobile zone and limited mass transport below raised underdrains donaghue et al 2022 however the iws volume below raised underdrains was not entirely characterized by an immobilize zone top column iws nox concentration profiles at the conclusion of trans 2 5hlr ii and iii demonstrated that mixing and mass transport occurred a certain depth below the underdrain fig 6 a for example d 25 nox was 2 2 mg n l but ranged from non detect to 0 16 mg n l for location d 05 to d 20 fig 6a old iws water t 0 min nox concentrations were considerably lower relative to the final event concentrations t 300 min fig 6 this cycle is observed over multiple events fig 5 and suggested that nox removal also occurred between storms for example at the conclusion of trans 2 5hlr i t 300 min sample time the bottom column iws nox concentrations were 2 9 mg n l d 25 and 1 8 mg n l d 05 fig 6a table s8 in contrast corresponding old iws water nox concentrations declined more than 94 and equaled 0 17 mg n l d 25 and 0 04 mg n l d 05 fig 6b all three columns showed a linear slope between δ15n and δ18o fig 7 a and isotope enrichment factors indicated denitrification table 3 albeit with limited data for the top column due to little change in no3 concentrations trans 1hlr and trans 2 5hlr showed roughly half the enrichment of steady state 2 7 to 3 8 for δ15n and 1 6 to 2 9 for δ18o while trans 5hlr showed higher enrichment 7 6 to 9 6 for δ15n and 5 1 to 6 5 for δ18o however there were limited data for the middle and top columns for trans 5hlr additionally some points did not fall on a linear enrichment trend e g the bottom underdrain at t 180 min fig s7 where sufficient data were available the slopes enrichment factors for t 180 min and t 300 min were similar excluding the outliers fig 7b c in some cases trans 1hlr and top column trans 2 5hlr the δ18o data were not linear unlike the steady state conditions the higher enrichment for trans 5hlr may be a reflection of more no3 mass that was applied and available for processing at the higher flow for example 50 mg n were applied for trans 5hlr compared to 10 mg n applied during trans 1hlr during transient flow effluent ph was less than synthetic stormwater 7 0 and effluent peak doc concentrations were associated with old iws water and occurred at the beginning of events hydrolysis of woodchips produces volatile fatty acids and is associated with a decrease in ph lynn et al 2015a except for event trans 1hlr i average effluent ph was 6 7 bottom underdrain and 6 6 middle and top underdrains table s9 other woodchip bioreactor columns demonstrated decreased ph relative to influent conditions under transient flow lynn et al 2015a peterson et al 2015 during dry periods fungi and bacteria can degrade lignocellulose biomass like woodchips which increases doc concentrations in porewater lynn et al 2015b malherbe and cloete 2002 concomitant with decreased ph effluent doc concentrations spiked at the beginning of event sampling first 0 1 to 0 25 total pvs except for the top underdrain fig 5d compared to steady state conditions transient iws water quality highlights the role dry periods play in promoting doc leaching for potential denitrification don was observed in effluent across all three columns fig s8a and nh4 was non detect for most events fig s8b see discussion in si generally the top column resulted in lower effluent doc mass flux table s7 fig s9 and doc concentrations fig 5d from the underdrain this is attributed to more mixing between old iws water and new water during events compared to the bottom column for the trans 5hlr scenario nox and doc mass flux released from the bottom underdrain were 298 mg n m2 and 3 560 mg c m2 respectively compared to 564 mg n m2 and 1980 mg c m2 for the top underdrain table s7 for the middle underdrain nox and doc mass fluxes were 449 mg n m2 and 3 360 mg c m2 for trans 5hlr scenarios opposing trends observed between effluent doc and nox mass fluxes highlight two important considerations regarding underdrain placement first under transient conditions raised underdrains promote mixing between old iws water and new water relative to the bottom column and provide an opportunity to utilize doc built up during adps for denitrification for the top column old iws water doc concentrations ranged from 3 8 to 26 mg c l for p 25 and ranged from 30 to 36 mg c l for p 05 fig s10a in contrast old iws water doc concentrations for the bottom column were consistent across the p 25 and p 05 locations fig s10a following application of new stormwater two trends occurred for the top column 1 p 05 iws doc concentrations spiked and 2 the final event concentration gradient between the p 25 and p 05 increased with increasing hlr for example the gradient ranged from 0 41 to 0 76 mg c l cm for trans 1hlr and ranged from 2 2 to 2 7 mg c l cm for trans 5hlr fig s10a during transient flow for the top column incoming new stormwater pushed a fraction of old iws water with increased doc to the p 05 location this transport phenomena was supported by transient chloride tracer storms conducted previously where chloride a conservative tracer accumulated at the p 05 location over the course of four transient events fig s4 in donaghue et al 2022 however doc concentrations in old iws water declined before the next event suggesting utilization fig s10a c and likely higher doc mass transfer rates to immobile regions during flow conditions a second consideration for underdrain placement is that for bioretention systems release of labile doc to receiving water bodies is also an undesirable outcome and could potentially increase the biological oxygen demand column studies with a bottom underdrain iws commonly assume ideal plug flow when describing no3 removal igielski et al 2019 lynn et al 2017 subramaniam et al 2016 and immobile zones are assumed absent or minimal however flow conditions were classified as non ideal for the middle and top columns as demonstrated by hydraulic efficiencies 1 donaghue et al 2022 the extent of the immobile zone is also impacted by the hlr we previously demonstrated that the immobile zone fraction decreased from 36 to 14 as hlr increased from 4 to 13 cm h donaghue et al 2022 thus site infiltration rates will also influence optimal underdrain height within the iws in order to promote mixing with old iws water and enhance no3 removal during storm events 3 4 impact of adp on nox and isotope patterns for adp conditions the nox mass flux increased in the order of bottom column middle column top column and longer adps generally resulted in lower nox mass fluxes table s7 and concentrations from the bottom and middle columns for example the middle underdrain average nox mass flux was 69 mg n m2 after 14 days compared to 106 mg n m2 after 3 days table s7 final normalized nox concentrations c co for the middle underdrain decreased from 0 55 to 0 26 as adp increased from 3 to 14 days for the top underdrain average nox mass flux decreased from 215 to 166 mg n m2 as adp increased from 3 to 7 days the average mass nox flux was 188 mg n m2 following 14 days unlike the middle underdrain final normalized nox concentrations ranged 0 70 to 0 74 and did not show a decreasing trend as adp increased from 3 to 14 days doc concentrations in old iws water generally did not increase as adp increased from 3 to 14 days with the exception of a few events for example p 05 old iws water doc concentrations ranged from 18 5 to 30 2 mg c l across the variable adps considered fig s11a but old iws water doc concentrations for the middle column p 05 increased from 16 to 31 mg c l between consecutive events trans 7adp iii and trans 14adp ii fig s11b previous columns studies with similar iws media composition reported increasing old iws water doc concentrations as adp increased from 0 to 16 days analytical methods differed lynn et al 2015a authors attributed concurrent doc build up with increased dry periods to doc leaching rates exceeding doc utilization rates however lynn et al observed that doc leaching declined over longer adp periods the maximum doc concentration of 114 mg c l occurred following a 14 day adp but decreased to 76 mg c l after a 30 day adp 2015a isotope data collected to monitor adp focused on evaluating the end of the dry period labeled as t 0 min associated with the subsequent transient event the isotope data neither confirmed nor contradicted the adp assessment because no3 concentrations were low at the end of the dry periods these low concentrations limited analytical precision for the isotope analysis only one sample submitted for analysis met the data quality requirements the one sample with sufficient no3 indicated a second source of no3 released during the dry period with 2 lower δ15n than the synthetic stormwater composition likely woodchip organic matter five samples that were below the suggested detection limits also showed lower δ15n than the synthetic stormwater a possible scenario is that fractionation went to completion and the isotope signal for denitrification was lost this highlights an important consideration when incorporating isotope analysis and suggests isotope sample collection should target the time period immediately following the storm event i e 3 5 h post storm rather than the end of the adp 3 5 iws design considerations and environmental implications iws design for water quality and no3 removal is relevant to nutrient sensitive watersheds where one point of regulation is storm sewer systems under these applications maximizing hrt during a storm event is critical to enhance no3 removal during a storm for example the underdrain could extend several feet from the outlet structure rather than span the entire length of the basin this design would increase travel time while not tested in this study other design components in addition to iws underdrain height can be included to enhance water quality for example an area of impermeable liner could be placed between overlying fill media and the iws near the outlet location to prevent suspected short circuiting additionally baffles could be implemented into the iws to minimize immobile zones operation and maintenance considerations may also influence iws underdrain placement gas buildup from denitrification can cause impediments to flow and was observed to occur during adps of this study between storms raised underdrains provide a release conduit which may help maintain intended hydrology we recognized in our previous work that issues with the underdrain clogging due to sediment are minimized when the underdrain is raised compared to bottom underdrain configurations donaghue et al 2022 in situ iws sampling reveals spatial and temporal variations related to transport processes limiting sampling to inlet and outlet locations may overlook the presence and influence of immobile zones on system performance a critical component to improving gsi design additionally dual isotope analysis is a valuable tool to distinguish whether low no3 concentrations are a result of denitrification or dilution during storm events however the application of dual isotope approaches is limited for studying dry periods if no3 concentrations are below detection limits therefore it is important to collect enough samples to follow temporal trends before dilution occurs if additional no3 sources occur during prolonged adps dual isotopes can be used to identify them in field or laboratory systems eq 1 2 4 conclusions specific conclusions from this study include the following no3 removal efficiency increased with increasing hrt and zero order kinetics were observed across all three iws underdrain heights for steady state as a result iws design strategies that increase hrt will enhance no3 removal efficiency for steady state conditions tested here the bottom column always outperformed the middle and top columns with respect to nox removal because of longer residences times steady state nox removal decreased following a 4 5 month duration when the iws was partially saturated woodchip longevity and effectiveness may become compromised in climates with extended dry periods or if the iws water level lowers due to exfiltration between storms impermeable liners at the base of iws could help to mitigate this challenge under steady state conditions immobile zones created by underdrains at the top of the iws reduced hydraulic efficiency and limited denitrification despite low do and a sufficient carbon source contrasting no3 isotope enrichment trends support this conclusion where the mobile zone exhibited linear no3 isotope enrichment response for both isotopes compared to non linear no3 isotope enrichment response for the top column for transient events a linear no3 isotope enrichment response was observed across all columns regardless of iws underdrain height while effluent nox concentrations converged across all columns for the highest hlr the top underdrain resulted in lower effluent doc mass fluxes these results suggests that during storm conditions top underdrains enhance mixing between old iws water and new stormwater which allows microbes to utilize doc built up during adps and enhance denitrification during storm events an iws underdrain configured at the bottom of the iws increased residence time but can force plug flow conditions that limit mixing with old iws water and utilization of doc iws design for water quality enhancement will require incorporating measures that balance denitrification with doc exportation design decisions may include an underdrain located mid depth of the iws to promote mixing shortening the length of the underdrain to minimize short circuiting or incorporating impermeable liners at discrete locations between fill media and the iws to increase travel times declaration of competing interest none

16211,internal water storage iws a below grade saturated layer is a bioretention design component created by adjusting the underdrain outlet elevation anaerobic conditions and the presence of a carbon source in iws facilitates denitrification yet it remains unclear how underdrain height within the iws impacts nitrate no3 removal this study applied synthetic stormwater with no3 to three laboratory columns with underdrains located at the bottom middle or top of a 32 cm thick gravel woodchip iws under steady state conditions underdrain nitrogen removal demonstrated a positive linear relationship with increasing hydraulic residence time hrt for a 1 cm h hydraulic loading rate hlr nitrogen removal efficiency increased from 52 to 99 as underdrain height moved from the top to the bottom despite identical iws thickness across columns immobilize zones below the middle and top underdrains limited the steady state nitrogen removal dual isotopes in no3 also indicated denitrification occurred in mobile zones and showed little or no denitrification in immobile zones due to limited mass transport transient flow conditions were applied to mimic storms followed by dry conditions lower effluent nitrogen concentrations and mass fluxes were observed from the bottom underdrain across the range of hlrs tested 1 to 5 cm h but performance of all three underdrains converged after the application of one pore volume the top underdrain enhanced mixing between new incoming low doc stormwater and old iws water with high doc which minimized effluent doc concentrations no3 isotope enrichment factors indicated denitrification during transient flow for all three underdrain heights and enrichment increased for the 5 cm h hlr for sites with narrow iws geometries width to depth ratio 1 optimal underdrain height is likely located between the bottom and top of the iws to promote mixing with old iws water high in doc and sustain denitrification during storms graphical abstract graphical

a major pollutant source to receiving waters nutrients such as nitrogen conveyed in runoff cause habitat degradation and algal blooms which are expected to worsen with population growth and climate change whitehead et al 2009 green stormwater infrastructure gsi is implemented in urban landscapes to protect water resources bioretention is a passive gsi strategy that employs multiple functions ponding infiltration biotic processes and water storage to manage runoff quantity and water quality the main design components include a vegetated basin filled with engineered media an underdrain is often incorporated in a gravel layer below engineered fill media to collect a portion of infiltrated stormwater and discharge to the sewer network or receiving waterbody internal water storage iws is a subsurface bioretention design component created by raising the outlet elevation of the underdrain for combined sewer systems iws provides additional storage volume and water is primarily released via exfiltration into native media for separate sewer systems sites with less permeable soils or nutrient sensitive watersheds iws can be implemented for water quality improvements brown et al 2009 nitrate no3 removal in bioretention occurs via plant uptake or biotic processes including denitrification or dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonia dnra bu et al 2017 igielski et al 2019 li et al 2019 when the iws remains saturated and a carbon source is available often leached from woodchips iws provides favorable conditions for denitrification and no3 is reduced to nitrogen gas n2 kim et al 2003 iws design often connects the perforated underdrain located at the base of the gravel layer to an upturned elbow alternatively a raised underdrain can be positioned at the top of the iws to achieve the same thickness and storage capacity donaghue et al 2022 however the impact of iws underdrain configuration on no3 removal needs to be evaluated understanding the impact of iws design choices on water quality specifically no3 advances design and informs practitioners increased hydraulic residence time hrt corresponds to increased no3 removal halaburka et al 2017 igielski et al 2019 for example one study demonstrated that hrt accounted for 93 of no3 removal compared to the variables of dissolved oxygen do temperature and influent no3 concentration martin et al 2019 we previously employed bioretention columns and modeling to demonstrate that raised underdrain heights with respect to the bottom of the iws introduced nonideal flow regions or immobile zones raised underdrain heights reduced hydraulic efficiency and consequently the measured hrt donaghue et al 2022 it is expected that iws underdrain height would influence no3 removal efficiency which served as a primary motivation to this study in urban environments space limitations and property costs present challenges for gsi implementation understanding the impact of iws underdrain height on no3 removal particularly in narrow systems can allow design flexibility without compromising water quality goals because iws underdrain height induces different flow patterns the consideration of how iws underdrain height impacts no3 dynamics as a function of rain intensity and dry periods is critical under intense precipitation faster infiltration rates into the iws can shorten hrts and consequently reduce no3 removal optimizing iws underdrain configuration to site specific characteristics could combat these effects and maximize no3 removal during precipitation during antecedent dry periods adp woodchips leach dissolved organic carbon doc into iws porewater and doc concentrations can increase as adp increases lynn et al 2015a however during prolonged adps evapotranspiration and exfiltration to underlying media can expose woodchips at the top of the iws to unsaturated conditions others have shown that woodchips in unsaturated layers degrade faster than saturated woodchips and can export higher doc and organic nitrogen lynn et al 2015a the selection of an appropriate iws underdrain configuration may require balancing multiple water quality parameters such as no3 and doc dual isotopes in no3 is a tool gaining traction to characterize nitrogen processing in stormwater burgis et al 2020 burns et al 2009 carey et al 2013 yang and toor 2016 dual isotopes refer to the analysis of both the nitrogen isotopes 14n and 15n and the oxygen isotopes 16o and 18o in no3 isotopes can be useful for identifying transformation processes when the process preferentially favors an isotope leading to fractionation for example a kinetic isotope effect is created during microbial denitrification as organisms preferentially consume lighter nitrogen and oxygen isotopes 14n and 16o this depletion creates solute no3 enriched in heavier isotopes 15n and 18o mariotti et al 1981 zhang et al 2019 consequently denitrification is marked by a predominantly linear positive trend in both the δ15n and δ18o batch experiments demonstrated microbial denitrification can cause isotopic fractionation within tens of minutes to several hours currie 2007 kim et al 2003 sebilo et al 2019 however isotope patterns in flow through systems such as iws are not well studied here column experiments coupled with dual isotope analysis contribute to understanding the application of nitrogen isotopes in gsi systems this work employs three laboratory bioretention columns comprised of a gravel woodchip iws with varying underdrain height to distinguish microbial denitrification from dilution under steady state and transient flow steady state conditions considered the effect of hrt on no3 removal efficiency and no3 removal kinetics transient conditions evaluated the effect of hydraulic loading rate hlr and adp on iws water quality nox dynamics and potential denitrification during flow events 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioretention column design iws underdrain height varied across three cylindrical bioretention columns 28 8 cm id 82 cm height fig 1 a by adjusting the elevation of 2 cm thick screened openings on the center pvc pipe as follows 0 to 2 cm bottom column 1 cm fig 1b 14 to 16 cm middle column 15 cm fig 1c and 30 to 32 cm top column 31 cm fig 1d iws media included a blend of pea gravel and hardwood woodchips at a ratio of 2 1 by volume the mixture and ratio were selected based on performance reported by others lynn et al 2015b further details regarding column media are provided in the si and our previous work donaghue et al 2022 the center pvc pipe connected to an upturned elbow outside each column the invert elevation of the outlet was 30 cm above the column base to maintain a constant iws thickness across all columns the iws included two sample port groups located 5 cm proximal p and 10 cm distal d from the center pvc pipe respectively the sample port heights were 5 10 20 and 25 cm above the column base fig 1a sample identification notes the sample group followed by sample height for example p 20 refers to the proximal iws sample port 20 cm above the column base sampling also included the underdrain effluent 2 2 key nomenclature bioretention columns were differentiated by the height of the underdrain using the terms bottom column 1 cm middle column 15 cm and top column 31 cm when referring to the underdrain sample location we used the terms bottom middle or top underdrain our previous study donaghue et al 2022 employed tracer studies and usgs vs2drti usgs 2019 modeling to characterize iws hydraulics results demonstrated the presence of mobile zones areas of flowing water generally above the underdrain and immobile zones low flow or stagnant areas below the middle and top underdrain to account for the presence of immobile zones measured hrt was calculated by multiplying the volume of column media by the effective pore volume pv which considers only the mobile region divided by flow rate equation s1 the experimental design included steady state ss continuous flow and transient trans intermittent flow events replicate transient events were conducted for each condition and are indicated using capitol roman numerals flow conditions were conducted at hlrs of 1 2 5 and 5 cm h which was also included in the event name transient events considered three different adps 2 8 6 8 and 13 8 days defined here as the dry time between the end of the transient event x and the start of event x 1 for reporting purposes nominal adps are used i e 3 7 and 14 days the term old iws water describes water stored in the iws between transient events and new water refers to fresh incoming synthetic stormwater applied to the top of the column wang et al 2018 the final event concentration refers to the final sample collected at t 300 minutes during transient events while no3 was the only nitrogen source added to synthetic stormwater column samples were analyzed for total nitrogen tn total dissolved nitrogen tdn ammonium ammonia nh4 nh3 and nox the sum of no3 plus nitrite no2 nitrite comprised less than 5 of nox monitored during events ss 5 and ss 2 5 therefore analysis was limited to nox for events following and was assumed to be predominantly no3 nox and doc mass loads released from the underdrain during flow were used to assess column performance mass loads were determined by integrating the area under the underdrain concentration curve using the trapezoidal method mass flux mg m2 for a given transient even equals the total mass load released from the underdrain during flow divided by the column horizontal cross sectional area 0 064 m2 2 3 synthetic stormwater preparation and application synthetic stormwater was prepared using deionized water or reverse osmosis water in a 246 l tank no3 in the form of sodium nitrate was added at a nominal concentration of 3 mg n l which agreed with other column studies igielski et al 2019 kim et al 2003 peterson et al 2015 and mimics no3 porewater concentrations observed for monitored field sites in philadelphia pa synthetic stormwater also included orthophosphate 0 1 mg p l to support microbial growth sodium chloride 58 4 mg l for ionic strength and sodium bicarbonate 252 mg l for buffering capacity table s1 the ph was adjusted to 7 0 using hydrochloric acid synthetic stormwater was applied to the top of columns using a masterflex l s digital drive peristatic pump cole parmer and evenly distributed through a polyethylene ring with equidistant perforations 2 4 water quality analysis for steady state water quality parameters measured included ph doc nh4 nh3 nox don pon and tn from the underdrain and nox from iws sample ports table s3 do was measured in the iws using a unisense oxygen minioptode 3000 µm unisense denmark unisense probes were located at 15 cm above the column base underdrain flow rates were measured gravimetrically by collecting underdrain effluent for one minute in a beaker the mass was then measured and converted to ml min doc and ph were measured for the underdrain location only for steady state doc was determined by catalyzed combustion using a toc v chs analyzer shimadzu doc samples from ss 1hlr exceeded holding times following covid lab restrictions and were not analyzed for transient events uv absorbance 254 nm was measured using an agilent 8453 spectrophotometer and was employed as a surrogate for doc e g similar to abusallout and hua 2017 berger et al 2019 samples were analyzed the same day of collection ph was measured using a thermo scientific orion versa star module nitrogen chemistry analysis included tn tdn nox and nh4 nh3 using an aq300 discrete analyzer seal analytical samples for dissolved constituents were centrifuged at 1 000 x g for 8 min to remove particulates and bacteria nox and nh4 nh3 were analyzed in accordance with epa methods 126 d rev 0 and 150 a rev 2 respectively tn uncentrifuged and tdn determination used peroxodisulfate oxidation digestion ebina et al 1983 followed by nox analysis described above particulate organic nitrogen pon tn tdn and dissolved organic nitrogen don tdn nox nh4 nh3 were determined by difference aq300 batch analysis included continued calibration verification ccv continued calibration blank ccb and reference material hach 2833249 quality control samples analyzed every 10 samples for digested tn and tdn samples an ammonium reference material 2 5 mg n l was included with each batch as a quality control measure for digestion recovery conversion of nh4 to no3 acceptance criteria for quality control samples and the digested reference material sample was 10 of the known concentration error propagation for don concentrations determined by difference was calculated using the standard deviation of replicates for nox and nh4 nh3 chemistries reported in method precision studies when considering the 2 5 mg n l digested reference material this corresponded to an uncertainty less than 5 sample preservation and analytical detection limits are reported in table s6 2 5 isotopic analysis and enrichment factor calculations stable isotope samples for no3 were collected at the end of each steady state event from the underdrain location and sample ports d 10 and d 25 table s3 and during transient events table s4 isotope samples were filtered 0 45 µm and stored frozen in 30 ml wide mouth high density polyethylene hdpe bottles thermo scientific dwk life sciences wheaton leak resistant isotope analysis was conducted at the davis stable isotope facility sif university of california samples selected for 15n and 18o analysis had nox measurements above sif lower limit of quantitation 0 4 μm or 0 05 mg n l and methods followed a bacteria denitrification assay university of california davis stable isotope facility nitrogen n and oxygen o content in column samples were compared to laboratory reference materials with known 15n and 18o analytical results were presented in delta notation δ expressed as

suggested when decreasing nox concentrations coincided with increasing δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 along a linear slope between 0 5 and 1 0 kendall et al 2007 when isotopic signatures suggested denitrification enrichment factors ɛ provided an estimation of column denitrification efficiency enrichment factors were calculated using the isotopic ratios in equations 3 and 4 3 ε 15 n δ 15 n s a m

initial isotope values are compared to the fraction of no3 concentration remaining the enrichment factor is the slope of the linear trend between the isotope difference and concentrations on a log normal scale and more negative ɛ indicates more efficient microbial denitrification enrichment factors were determined for 15n no3 and 18o no3 for select steady state and transient events it was assumed nox equaled no3 for enrichment factor calculations 2 6 steady state events steady state ss considered the three events ss 5hlr ss 2 5hlr and ss 1hlr table 1 additional detail in table s2 which corresponded to hlrs of 5 2 5 and 1 cm h respectively before initiating ss tracer studies described elsewhere occurred under continuous flow from november 2019 to january 2020 approximately 32 total pvs were applied to each column during this time donaghue et al 2022 the iws remained fully saturated during ss 5 through ss 1 february 2020 to march 2020 for each event flow application remained constant until the relative standard deviation of nox concentrations varied less than 30 for three consecutive measurements at the underdrain and mobile zone iws sample ports this generally occurred within 5 days the average influent synthetic stormwater no3 concentration for steady state was 2 90 0 26 mg n l samples were generally collected daily monday through friday and analyzed for parameters listed in table s3 the steady state nox removal efficiency was determined at the underdrain location using equation 5 5 n o x c i n f l u e n t c u n d e r d r a i n c i n f l u e n t 100 where cinfluent equals the synthetic stormwater nox concentration 3 mg n l and cunderdrain equals the observed underdrain effluent nox concentration significant differences across steady state events were determined using a paired t test α of 0 05 ss 1hlr finished on march 16 2020 after 5 months of continuous operation due to interruptions in lab access associated with covid restrictions the columns sat dormant for 4 5 months march through august 2020 and a portion of the iws became unsaturated during the dormant period upon returning to the lab a pulse tracer test was performed for all columns to establish a new baseline for hydraulics see si for details ss 1 5 postdormant was introduced at a hlr of 1 5 cm h to reacclimate denitrifying conditions before transitioning to transient flow events during ss 5hlr through ss 1 5 postdormant 110 total pvs were applied to each column 2 7 transient events transient flow provided an environmentally relevant representation of episodic storm and dry conditions transient events lasted five hours 300 min and considered hlrs of 1 2 5 and 5 cm h and adps of 3 7 and 14 days table 1 reports transient event sequencing the event identification notes either the hlr or adp testing scenario and the event replicate i e i ii or iii for example trans 2 5hlr ii refers to transient flow at a 2 5 cm h hlr replicate two for adp transient events a hlr of 2 5 cm h was applied after event trans 2 5hlr i different initial iws water levels were observed each iws was upfilled using reverse osmosis water prior to the start of the event to ensure iws water level depths were consistent across columns low no3 0 4 mg n l and phosphorous 0 2 mg p l concentrations reverse osmosis water was applied through the center pvc pipe filling the iws from the screened opening upward and pumped at a flow rate of 20 ml min this approach was adopted for the remainder of transient events transient sampling followed the frequency listed in table s4 samples were collected immediately before flow application t 0 min and then at time points of 100 140 180 220 260 300 min for the middle and top column and 120 160 200 240 280 300 min for the bottom column sample locations included the underdrain d 25 and d 05 the d 25 and d 05 locations were chosen to collect samples from both mobile and immobile zones determined from previous tracer studies donaghue et al 2022 to account for potential transitional effects between events sample collection was omitted for trans 2 5hlr i and trans 5hlr i a final pulse tracer test was performed at the end of transient events and confirmed flow patterns were not altered table s5 fig s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 steady state nox removal isotopes enrichment for mobile zones and iws non ideal flow nox removal efficiency equation 5 increased as underdrain height decreased for all steady state events fig 2 as hlr decreased from 5 to 1 cm h effluent nox removal increased from 25 to 99 for the bottom underdrain 22 to 84 for the middle underdrain and 10 to 52 for the top underdrain fig 2 p value 0 05 for ss 2 5hlr and ss 5hlr superior performance observed for the bottom underdrain is attributed to longer hrts relative to the middle and top underdrains heights table 1 for example mean tracer residence times equaled 5 0 h 3 8 h and 3 5 h for the bottom middle and top column respectively for an applied hlr of 5 cm h others demonstrated how longer hrt increases no3 removal halaburka et al 2017 he et al 2018 studies considering regression on do temperature influent no3 concentration and hrt indicated hrt contributed most 93 to no3 removal martin et al 2019 the dual isotope data from ss 1hlr support the effectiveness of mobile zones in denitrification the δ15n versus δ18o plot shows a 1 1 line indicating denitrification fig 3 a with up to a 13 difference from the synthetic stormwater water the middle and bottom columns showed a linear slope on the enrichment plots for both isotopes which confirmed that denitrification was occurring fig 3b however the top column showed a non linear enrichment response which indicated mixing of denitrified water and immobile zone water where no3 mass transfer was limited the isotope enrichment calculation helped distinguish between lower no3 concentration due to mixing with immobile zone water and denitrification which removes no3 the enrichment factors of 5 2 and 4 7 for δ15n versus δ18o were close in value table 2 with slightly lower expected for δ18o isotope enrichment factors for middle and bottom underdrains were also similar although slightly lower for middle underdrain 4 6 and 3 5 for δ15n versus δ18o isotope enrichment for ss 1hlr versus ss 1 5hlr post dormant was also similar 5 1 versus 5 4 for δ15n and 4 5 versus 5 0 for δ18o although the highest fractionation was observed for a single sample in ss 1hlr from the bottom underdrain water quality parameters of do doc and nh4 confirmed favorable conditions for denitrification existed in the iws for all columns denitrification conditions require do less than 3 mg o2 l gómez et al 2002 and an adequate carbon source such as doc leaching from woodchips newcomer et al 2012 steady state iws do concentrations measured at 15 cm height remained less than 0 2 mg o2 l across all three columns fig s2a s2b average doc concentrations were 2 1 to 4 8 mg c l during ss 5hlr and decreased to non detect levels 2 mg c l during ss 2 5hlr decreasing doc concentrations as hlr decreased is likely associated with longer hrt for no3 removal and doc utilization lynn et al 2015a during steady state effluent nh4 concentrations ranged from non detect i e 0 016 mg n l to 0 156 mg n l or 4 of the tn concentration and confirmed dnra was not a primary pathway for nox removal average effluent ph across all ss events increased relative to synthetic stormwater 7 06 0 03 to 7 36 0 07 7 34 0 02 and 7 47 0 09 for the bottom middle and top underdrain respectively hlr affected in situ iws nox concentration profiles as a function of depth fig 4 however transport across all three columns varied due to the presence and size of immobile zones in situ two dimensional iws sampling proved a useful approach to identify where processes occur and improve system design for the bottom column nox concentrations decreased as iws sample port height decreased i e approached the base for ss 2 5hlr average proximal iws nox concentrations decreased from 2 9 to 1 6 mg n l as sample port height decreased from p 25 to p 05 cm fig 4a additionally the concentration difference between the p 25 to p 05 iws sample height i e nox p 25 nox p 05 increased from 0 50 to 2 2 mg n l as hlr decreased from 5 to 1 cm h fig 4a the increased differential is attributed to increased residence time and consequently nox removal where denitrification was occurring iws nox concentrations decreased substantially for regions below the middle and top underdrain heights and is likely attributed to limited mass transport into the immobile zones for example nox concentrations remained less than 0 04 mg n l for iws locations p 20 through p 05 for the top column for ss 5hlr through ss 1hlr fig 4c steady state bioretention column nox concentration profiles and dual isotope analysis coupled with tracer studies and flow modeling from previous work suggest that while favorable conditions for denitrification exists in regions below the top and middle underdrain heights no3 removal is less efficient due to limited mass transport i e limited no3 exchange into the immobile zones donaghue et al 2022 however the degree of mass transport to the immobile zone is governed by the concentration gradient thus higher influent no3 concentrations would potentially increase mass transfer rates into this zone velocity heat maps for the ss 1hlr fig s3 illustrate the presence of immobile or low flow zones below the middle and top underdrain column tracer experiments and vs2drti flow and transport modeling conducted by this research group donaghue et al 2022 for the same experimental design demonstrated the presence of immobile zones below the top underdrain thickness 20 cm and middle underdrain thickness 5 cm calculated hydraulic efficiencies ev the mean tracer residence time divided by the theoretical residence time and tracer breakthrough curve statistics supported the presence of immobile zones specifically ev decreased from 1 0 to 0 76 as underdrain height increased from 1 to 31 cm hydraulic efficiencies 1 indicate non ideal flow where the mean tracer residence time is less than the theoretical residence time an undesirable design scenario where treatment volume is underutilized the presence of immobile zones suggests nonequilibrium flow where fluid is partitioned into regions of mobile flowing and immobile stagnant zones nonequilibrium flow includes a mass transfer coefficient as a third parameter to account for exchange between mobile and immobile zones field and pinsky 2000 the effect of iws underdrain configuration on system hydraulics and transport processes will also be influenced by the iws width to depth ratio the presence of immobile zones below the middle and top underdrain was specific to a case where the iws width to depth ratio equaled 0 5 15 cm width 30 cm depth two dimensional flow patterns were observed in mobile regions of the iws fig s3 with higher velocity zones closest to the underdrain location as a result distal sample ports had longer residence times and demonstrated lower no3 concentration profiles fig s4 simulations performed by our research group elsewhere donaghue et al 2022 also considered iws width to depth ratios greater than 1 50 cm width 30 cm depth for this scenario hydraulics efficiencies ranged 0 89 to 0 96 and immobile zones comprised less than 2 of the iws for iws width to depth ratios greater than 1 velocity heat maps showed a wider distribution of velocities while simulations indicated immobile zones were minimal for a iws width to depth ratio of 1 67 maximizing hrt will still be an important factor for achieving higher no3 removal efficiency 3 2 zero order kinetics and evidence of iws aging underdrain nox removal demonstrated a linear correlation with hrt fig 2 for events ss 5hlr through ss 1hlr higher correlations were observed for zero order k0 3 21 g n m 3 d 1 r2 0 946 fig s5a compared to first order kinetic estimates k1 4 25 d 1 r2 0 790 fig s5b the rate model employed by peterson et al 2015 was used to determine rate constants details in si often no3 removal kinetics are considered zero order where the reaction rate is controlled by an independent parameter i e hrt or release of doc from woodchips rather than no3 halaburka et al observed zero order kinetics for aged saturated 13 months woodchip bioreactor columns for an input no3 concentration of 10 mg n l and constant temperature 2017 first order removal rates have been reported for laboratory bioreactor columns influent of 1 to 6 mg n l igielski et al 2019 additionally transition to first order kinetics may occur at lower no3 concentrations 0 5 mg n l schipper et al 2010 addy et al compiled data across 26 peer reviewed papers which included 14 bed field studies and 10 laboratory column woodchip bioreactor studies 2016 authors reported that no3 removal rates during the first year were more than 3 times higher than aged systems therefore rates after year one of operation are more representative of performance long term interestingly columns in this current paper operated 5 months and did not meet the definition of aged yet observed zero order rates agree with mean no3 removal rates 2 8 g n m 3 d 1 for aged 13 to 24 month bioreactors rather than younger 13 month old bioreactors 9 1 g n m 3 d 1 addy et al 2016 during ss 1 5hlr postdormant orange symbology fig 2 removal rates for the middle and bottom underdrain decreased by 46 and 23 respectively these decreases are relative to the pre dormant performance and the percent removal deviated from linear trends observed during ss 5hlr through ss 1hlr green symbology no3 removal rates can vary during the initial one to three years of operation before stabilizing addy et al 2016 one column study using wood pulp and sand media reported a 50 decline in no3 removal efficiency within 1 year of operation robertson et al 2008 higher no3 removal rates that occurred during early operation were attributed to woodchips leaching excess organic material but leaching rates stabilized after extended use halaburka et al 2017 for bioretention systems iws media may not remain permanently saturated between precipitation events due to evapotranspiration and exfiltration to underlying media the 4 5 month dormant period during covid here represented an exaggerated adp case however the observed decline in no3 removal for the bottom and middle underdrains suggest prolonged exposure to semi saturated conditions could contribute to woodchip aging as stated above the isotope data showed the largest fractionation for a single sample in ss 1hlr but similar enrichment factors before and after the 4 5 month dormant period table 2 3 3 nox dual isotope and water quality patterns for transient events under different hlr as transient event hlr increased a higher fraction of old iws water was replaced with new incoming synthetic stormwater consequently nox concentrations fig 5 b and the mass flux of nox leaving the system table s7 increased at the underdrain for all three columns in between transient flow water was stored in the iws for a prolonged residence time 7 days trans 1hlr i through trans 5hlr iii and is more relevant to field conditions the bottom column performed best in minimizing the mass flux of nox from the underdrain followed by the middle and the top columns fig 5b table s7 for the highest hlr 5 cm h tested during transient events the applied iws pore volume was 2 3 total pore volume equaled 1 the final c co ranged from 0 69 to 0 84 fig 5b fig s6 and suggested no3 removal furthermore final c co for trans 5hlr was similar to no3 removal efficiency 100 1 c co observed during steady state ss 5hlr which ranged from 10 to 25 c co 0 75 to 0 90 nox concentration profiles for the d 05 location highlighted the underutilization of treatment volume for a portion of the iws below the middle and top columns during events fig 5c for trans 2 5hlr and trans 5hlr the bottom column nox concentration profiles for the underdrain and d 05 followed similar breakthrough patterns fig 5c average normalized peak nox concentrations for the bottom column d 05 location equaled 0 57 and 0 84 mg n l for trans 2 5hlr and trans 5hlr respectively in contrast the middle and top column normalized cpeak nox concentrations at the d 05 location remained 97 less than the influent concentration across all hlr events fig 5c low nox concentrations observed at d 05 for the middle and top column are likely attributed to presence of an immobile zone and limited mass transport below raised underdrains donaghue et al 2022 however the iws volume below raised underdrains was not entirely characterized by an immobilize zone top column iws nox concentration profiles at the conclusion of trans 2 5hlr ii and iii demonstrated that mixing and mass transport occurred a certain depth below the underdrain fig 6 a for example d 25 nox was 2 2 mg n l but ranged from non detect to 0 16 mg n l for location d 05 to d 20 fig 6a old iws water t 0 min nox concentrations were considerably lower relative to the final event concentrations t 300 min fig 6 this cycle is observed over multiple events fig 5 and suggested that nox removal also occurred between storms for example at the conclusion of trans 2 5hlr i t 300 min sample time the bottom column iws nox concentrations were 2 9 mg n l d 25 and 1 8 mg n l d 05 fig 6a table s8 in contrast corresponding old iws water nox concentrations declined more than 94 and equaled 0 17 mg n l d 25 and 0 04 mg n l d 05 fig 6b all three columns showed a linear slope between δ15n and δ18o fig 7 a and isotope enrichment factors indicated denitrification table 3 albeit with limited data for the top column due to little change in no3 concentrations trans 1hlr and trans 2 5hlr showed roughly half the enrichment of steady state 2 7 to 3 8 for δ15n and 1 6 to 2 9 for δ18o while trans 5hlr showed higher enrichment 7 6 to 9 6 for δ15n and 5 1 to 6 5 for δ18o however there were limited data for the middle and top columns for trans 5hlr additionally some points did not fall on a linear enrichment trend e g the bottom underdrain at t 180 min fig s7 where sufficient data were available the slopes enrichment factors for t 180 min and t 300 min were similar excluding the outliers fig 7b c in some cases trans 1hlr and top column trans 2 5hlr the δ18o data were not linear unlike the steady state conditions the higher enrichment for trans 5hlr may be a reflection of more no3 mass that was applied and available for processing at the higher flow for example 50 mg n were applied for trans 5hlr compared to 10 mg n applied during trans 1hlr during transient flow effluent ph was less than synthetic stormwater 7 0 and effluent peak doc concentrations were associated with old iws water and occurred at the beginning of events hydrolysis of woodchips produces volatile fatty acids and is associated with a decrease in ph lynn et al 2015a except for event trans 1hlr i average effluent ph was 6 7 bottom underdrain and 6 6 middle and top underdrains table s9 other woodchip bioreactor columns demonstrated decreased ph relative to influent conditions under transient flow lynn et al 2015a peterson et al 2015 during dry periods fungi and bacteria can degrade lignocellulose biomass like woodchips which increases doc concentrations in porewater lynn et al 2015b malherbe and cloete 2002 concomitant with decreased ph effluent doc concentrations spiked at the beginning of event sampling first 0 1 to 0 25 total pvs except for the top underdrain fig 5d compared to steady state conditions transient iws water quality highlights the role dry periods play in promoting doc leaching for potential denitrification don was observed in effluent across all three columns fig s8a and nh4 was non detect for most events fig s8b see discussion in si generally the top column resulted in lower effluent doc mass flux table s7 fig s9 and doc concentrations fig 5d from the underdrain this is attributed to more mixing between old iws water and new water during events compared to the bottom column for the trans 5hlr scenario nox and doc mass flux released from the bottom underdrain were 298 mg n m2 and 3 560 mg c m2 respectively compared to 564 mg n m2 and 1980 mg c m2 for the top underdrain table s7 for the middle underdrain nox and doc mass fluxes were 449 mg n m2 and 3 360 mg c m2 for trans 5hlr scenarios opposing trends observed between effluent doc and nox mass fluxes highlight two important considerations regarding underdrain placement first under transient conditions raised underdrains promote mixing between old iws water and new water relative to the bottom column and provide an opportunity to utilize doc built up during adps for denitrification for the top column old iws water doc concentrations ranged from 3 8 to 26 mg c l for p 25 and ranged from 30 to 36 mg c l for p 05 fig s10a in contrast old iws water doc concentrations for the bottom column were consistent across the p 25 and p 05 locations fig s10a following application of new stormwater two trends occurred for the top column 1 p 05 iws doc concentrations spiked and 2 the final event concentration gradient between the p 25 and p 05 increased with increasing hlr for example the gradient ranged from 0 41 to 0 76 mg c l cm for trans 1hlr and ranged from 2 2 to 2 7 mg c l cm for trans 5hlr fig s10a during transient flow for the top column incoming new stormwater pushed a fraction of old iws water with increased doc to the p 05 location this transport phenomena was supported by transient chloride tracer storms conducted previously where chloride a conservative tracer accumulated at the p 05 location over the course of four transient events fig s4 in donaghue et al 2022 however doc concentrations in old iws water declined before the next event suggesting utilization fig s10a c and likely higher doc mass transfer rates to immobile regions during flow conditions a second consideration for underdrain placement is that for bioretention systems release of labile doc to receiving water bodies is also an undesirable outcome and could potentially increase the biological oxygen demand column studies with a bottom underdrain iws commonly assume ideal plug flow when describing no3 removal igielski et al 2019 lynn et al 2017 subramaniam et al 2016 and immobile zones are assumed absent or minimal however flow conditions were classified as non ideal for the middle and top columns as demonstrated by hydraulic efficiencies 1 donaghue et al 2022 the extent of the immobile zone is also impacted by the hlr we previously demonstrated that the immobile zone fraction decreased from 36 to 14 as hlr increased from 4 to 13 cm h donaghue et al 2022 thus site infiltration rates will also influence optimal underdrain height within the iws in order to promote mixing with old iws water and enhance no3 removal during storm events 3 4 impact of adp on nox and isotope patterns for adp conditions the nox mass flux increased in the order of bottom column middle column top column and longer adps generally resulted in lower nox mass fluxes table s7 and concentrations from the bottom and middle columns for example the middle underdrain average nox mass flux was 69 mg n m2 after 14 days compared to 106 mg n m2 after 3 days table s7 final normalized nox concentrations c co for the middle underdrain decreased from 0 55 to 0 26 as adp increased from 3 to 14 days for the top underdrain average nox mass flux decreased from 215 to 166 mg n m2 as adp increased from 3 to 7 days the average mass nox flux was 188 mg n m2 following 14 days unlike the middle underdrain final normalized nox concentrations ranged 0 70 to 0 74 and did not show a decreasing trend as adp increased from 3 to 14 days doc concentrations in old iws water generally did not increase as adp increased from 3 to 14 days with the exception of a few events for example p 05 old iws water doc concentrations ranged from 18 5 to 30 2 mg c l across the variable adps considered fig s11a but old iws water doc concentrations for the middle column p 05 increased from 16 to 31 mg c l between consecutive events trans 7adp iii and trans 14adp ii fig s11b previous columns studies with similar iws media composition reported increasing old iws water doc concentrations as adp increased from 0 to 16 days analytical methods differed lynn et al 2015a authors attributed concurrent doc build up with increased dry periods to doc leaching rates exceeding doc utilization rates however lynn et al observed that doc leaching declined over longer adp periods the maximum doc concentration of 114 mg c l occurred following a 14 day adp but decreased to 76 mg c l after a 30 day adp 2015a isotope data collected to monitor adp focused on evaluating the end of the dry period labeled as t 0 min associated with the subsequent transient event the isotope data neither confirmed nor contradicted the adp assessment because no3 concentrations were low at the end of the dry periods these low concentrations limited analytical precision for the isotope analysis only one sample submitted for analysis met the data quality requirements the one sample with sufficient no3 indicated a second source of no3 released during the dry period with 2 lower δ15n than the synthetic stormwater composition likely woodchip organic matter five samples that were below the suggested detection limits also showed lower δ15n than the synthetic stormwater a possible scenario is that fractionation went to completion and the isotope signal for denitrification was lost this highlights an important consideration when incorporating isotope analysis and suggests isotope sample collection should target the time period immediately following the storm event i e 3 5 h post storm rather than the end of the adp 3 5 iws design considerations and environmental implications iws design for water quality and no3 removal is relevant to nutrient sensitive watersheds where one point of regulation is storm sewer systems under these applications maximizing hrt during a storm event is critical to enhance no3 removal during a storm for example the underdrain could extend several feet from the outlet structure rather than span the entire length of the basin this design would increase travel time while not tested in this study other design components in addition to iws underdrain height can be included to enhance water quality for example an area of impermeable liner could be placed between overlying fill media and the iws near the outlet location to prevent suspected short circuiting additionally baffles could be implemented into the iws to minimize immobile zones operation and maintenance considerations may also influence iws underdrain placement gas buildup from denitrification can cause impediments to flow and was observed to occur during adps of this study between storms raised underdrains provide a release conduit which may help maintain intended hydrology we recognized in our previous work that issues with the underdrain clogging due to sediment are minimized when the underdrain is raised compared to bottom underdrain configurations donaghue et al 2022 in situ iws sampling reveals spatial and temporal variations related to transport processes limiting sampling to inlet and outlet locations may overlook the presence and influence of immobile zones on system performance a critical component to improving gsi design additionally dual isotope analysis is a valuable tool to distinguish whether low no3 concentrations are a result of denitrification or dilution during storm events however the application of dual isotope approaches is limited for studying dry periods if no3 concentrations are below detection limits therefore it is important to collect enough samples to follow temporal trends before dilution occurs if additional no3 sources occur during prolonged adps dual isotopes can be used to identify them in field or laboratory systems eq 1 2 4 conclusions specific conclusions from this study include the following no3 removal efficiency increased with increasing hrt and zero order kinetics were observed across all three iws underdrain heights for steady state as a result iws design strategies that increase hrt will enhance no3 removal efficiency for steady state conditions tested here the bottom column always outperformed the middle and top columns with respect to nox removal because of longer residences times steady state nox removal decreased following a 4 5 month duration when the iws was partially saturated woodchip longevity and effectiveness may become compromised in climates with extended dry periods or if the iws water level lowers due to exfiltration between storms impermeable liners at the base of iws could help to mitigate this challenge under steady state conditions immobile zones created by underdrains at the top of the iws reduced hydraulic efficiency and limited denitrification despite low do and a sufficient carbon source contrasting no3 isotope enrichment trends support this conclusion where the mobile zone exhibited linear no3 isotope enrichment response for both isotopes compared to non linear no3 isotope enrichment response for the top column for transient events a linear no3 isotope enrichment response was observed across all columns regardless of iws underdrain height while effluent nox concentrations converged across all columns for the highest hlr the top underdrain resulted in lower effluent doc mass fluxes these results suggests that during storm conditions top underdrains enhance mixing between old iws water and new stormwater which allows microbes to utilize doc built up during adps and enhance denitrification during storm events an iws underdrain configured at the bottom of the iws increased residence time but can force plug flow conditions that limit mixing with old iws water and utilization of doc iws design for water quality enhancement will require incorporating measures that balance denitrification with doc exportation design decisions may include an underdrain located mid depth of the iws to promote mixing shortening the length of the underdrain to minimize short circuiting or incorporating impermeable liners at discrete locations between fill media and the iws to increase travel times declaration of competing interest none

16212,nutrient storage is considered a critical strategy for algal species to adapt to a fluctuating nutrient supply luxury phosphorus p uptake into storage of polyphosphate extends the duration of cyanobacterial dominance and their blooms under p deficiency however it is unclear whether nitrogen n storage in the form of cyanophycin supports persistent cyanobacterial dominance or blooms in the tropics where n deficiency commonly occurs in summer in this study we examined genes for cyanophycin synthesis and degradation in raphidiopsis raciborskii a widespread and dominant cyanobacterium in tropical waters and detected the cyanophycin accumulation under fluctuating n concentrations and its ecological role in the population dynamics of the species the genes for cyanophycin synthesis cpha and degradation cphb were highly conserved in 21 out of 23 raphidiopsis strains this suggested that the synthesis and degradation of cyanophycin are evolutionarily conserved to support the proliferation of r raciborskii in n fluctuating and or deficient conditions isotope 15n nano3 labeling experiments showed that r raciborskii qdh7 always commenced to synthesize and accumulate cyanophycin under fluctuating n conditions regardless of whether exogenous n was deficient when the no3 n concentration exceeded 1 2 mg l 1 r raciborskii synthesized cyanophycin primarily through uptake of 15n nano3 however when the no3 n concentration was below 1 0 mg l 1 cyanophycin based n was derived from unlabeled n2 as evidenced by increased dinitrogenase activity cells grown under no3 n 1 0 mg l 1 had lower cyanophycin accumulation rates than cells grown under no3 n 1 2 mg l 1 our field investigation in a large tropical reservoir underscored the association between cyanophycin content and the population dynamics of r raciborskii the cyanophycin content was high in n sufficient no3 n 0 45 mg l 1 periods and decreased in n deficient summer in summer r raciborskii sustained a relatively high biomass and produced few heterocysts 1 these findings indicated that cyanophycin released n rather than fixed n supported persistent r raciborskii blooms in n deficient seasons our study suggests that the highly adaptive strategy in a n2 fixing cyanobacterial species makes mitigating its bloom more difficult than previously assumed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cylindrospermopsis raciborskii nitrogen storage cyanophycin nitrogen deficiency bloom dynamics 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms are occurring with increased frequency intensity and duration in freshwater bodies throughout the world these blooms threaten human health and freshwater ecosystem functioning coffer et al 2021 ho et al 2019 huisman et al 2018 paerl and otten 2013 many species of cyanobacteria have evolved various eco physiological strategies to adapt to nutrient fluctuations these strategies allow them to dominate the phytoplankton community and form blooms paerl and otten 2013 scott et al 2019 one of the well studied strategies is luxury p uptake into storage as polyphosphate polyp facilitating the dominance and persistence of cyanobacteria in p deficient environments carey et al 2012 ritchie et al 2001 another physiological strategy is n2 fixation via conversion of n2 to nh4 which can be used as a n source when available n sources are depleted in waters schindler et al 2008 however n2 fixation is energetically expensive dixon and kahn 2004 a growing body of evidence indicates that n2 fixation is not the principal strategy for acquiring n and unlikely provides enough n to support cyanobacterial blooms paerl et al 2016 scott et al 2019 shatwell and köhler 2019 xu et al 2021 therefore there are likely other mechanisms allowing cyanobacteria to gain a competitive advantage under n deficient and or fluctuating n conditions several earlier laboratory studies showed that cyanobacteria can store n just as they store p allen et al 1980 simon 1971 recently it was found that the n reserves are mainly in the forms of cyanophycin and phycobilisomes in many cyanobacterial species and cyanophycin is used as an internal n source under n deficient conditions before using phycobilisomes zhang and yang 2019 phycobilisomes plays a less important role than cyanophycin in the diazotrophic cyanobacteria which use cyanophycin as the main n storage li et al 2001 cyanophycin c10h19n5o5 is a non ribosomally synthesized polypeptide with a relatively high ratio of n to c flores et al 2019 its biosynthesis and degradation are catalyzed by cyanophycin synthase encoded by cpha and cyanophycinase encoded by cphb respectively picossi et al 2004 under sufficient n supply many cyanobacteria accumulate cyanophycin during unbalanced growth induced by nutrient fluctuations e g p pulses polerecky et al 2021 trautmann et al 2016 van de waal et al 2010 in contrast in the absence of n cyanobacteria contain very low levels of cyanophycin mackerras et al 1990 cyanophycin accumulation enables synechocystis sp and microcoleus sp to optimize n assimilation under n deficient conditions and especially under fluctuating n supply tee et al 2020 watzer and forchhammer 2018 cyanophycin has been detected in many cyanobacteria species but never in eukaryotic algae mojzes et al 2020 therefore analogous to the case of p storage cyanophycin may provide cyanobacteria with a competitive advantage over sympatric phytoplankton species in nature with fluctuating or deficient n supply forchhammer and schwarz 2019 several bloom forming cyanobacteria such as microcystis sp dolichospermum sp formerly anabaena aphanizomenon ovalisporum and planktothrix agardhii store n intracellularly as cyanophycin sukenik et al 2015 van de waal et al 2010 their advantage over eukaryotic algae under n limiting conditions may be related to cyanophycin kurmayer et al 2016 freshwater diazotrophic filamentous raphidiopsis formerly cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is one of the most successful bloom forming cyanobacteria in the tropics lei et al 2014 lu et al 2021 rzymski and poniedzialek 2014 this species has diverse nutritional utilization strategies that are critical for its rapid growth and global expansion burford et al 2016 r raciborskii was reported to have a competitive advantage under low n conditions figueredo et al 2014 xiao et al 2021 as n2 fixation by r raciborskii accounts for less than 10 of the total assimilated n and it cannot support a high growth rate under n deficiency willis et al 2016 in addition to fixed n there must be other n sources to meet the high n demands of dominant or blooming r raciborskii under n deficient conditions previous studies have shed some light on the n storage in r raciborskii mackerras et al 1990 trautmann et al 2016 van de waal et al 2010 however there are several major issues still to be resolved first the heterocysts of r raciborskii cs 505 can accumulate cyanophycin polar nodules from fixed n in n free medium plominsky et al 2015 but it is unknown whether the ability to synthesize this n storage compound is restricted to strain cs 505 or common among r raciborskii taxa there are multiple ecotypes with a high trait variability within and among locally occurring r raciborskii strains bolius et al 2017 second cyanophycin is considered to also be accumulated during the n2 fixation process in diazotrophic cyanobacteria watzer and forchhammer 2018 but it is unclear whether r raciborskii can accumulate cyanophycin under a fluctuating n supply namely n sufficient and n deficient conditions as has been reported for non diazotrophic cyanobacteria flores et al 2019 third observations on cyanophycin synthesis in cyanobacteria were predominantly conducted under standard laboratory conditions burnat et al 2014 sukenik et al 2015 van de waal et al 2010 thus probing into the relationship between n concentration and cyanophycin accumulation in natural conditions will provide further insights into the functional significance of cyanophycin in phytoplankton population dynamics to investigate the n stored in cyanophycin for r raciborskii to respond to n fluctuating we first checked whether all the published full genomes of r raciborskii strains contain genes involved in cyanophycin synthesis and degradation cpha and cphb respectively subsequently we conducted culture experiments to examine cyanophycin accumulation and dinitrogenase activity in r raciborskii under two n fluctuation scenarios we also quantitatively detected the dynamics of cellular cyanophycin content nutrient levels and phytoplankton biomass in a large reservoir in south china which has a stable annual phytoplankton community dominated by r raciborskii xiao et al 2021 we hypothesized that r raciborskii assimilates ambient n and stores it as cyanophycin during n sufficient period and that it is this stored n rather than energy intensive fixed n that supports proliferation of r raciborskii in n deficient waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 verification of cyanophycin associated genes and granules in raphidiopsis first we compared the genomic sequences of 23 raphidiopsis strains to verify the presence of cpha and cphb these genomic sequences were downloaded from the ncbi database https www ncbi nlm nih gov genome the raphidiopsis strains were isolated from diverse ecoregions around the world table 1 then we conducted metabolic level analysis of raphidiopsis cells containing cyanophycin granules we extracted cyanophycin as described by trautmann et al 2016 with some modifications fig s1a 2 2 exploring the cyanophycin accumulation in two simulated n fluctuation scenarios with stable isotope 15n nano3 2 2 1 strain and culture medium two simulated n fluctuation scenarios in which sufficient n concentration changed to n deficient conditions were applied to a 30 day culture of r raciborskii qdh7 a strain isolated from qiandeng lake 23 03 n 113 08 e foshan city guangdong province china and was preserved at jinan university this strain was unialgal but not axenic during experimental work the absence of heterotrophic bacteria was confirmed by routine microscopic observation we chose the form and concentration of dissolved n based on observations in the reservoir where we conducted our field study however because the simulated n fluctuation scenario was achieved by dilution with n free medium on day 13 if the initial n concentration was 1 4 mg l 1 then the exogenous n concentration on day 13 0 3 mg n l 1 fig s2 was too low therefore it was finally decided to supply nitrate at an initial n concentration of 14 mg l 1 the basal medium was modified wright s cryptophyte wc medium which contained 1000 ml distilled water 36 76 mg cacl2 2h2o 36 97 mg mgso4 7h2o 12 60 mg nahco3 0 15 mg k2hpo4 85 01 mg nano3 28 42 mg na2sio3 9h2o and trace metals guilard et al 1974 2 2 2 experimental design r raciborskii qdh7 were first cultivated in n free wc medium for 2 days to exhaust the initial n in cells qian et al 2017 till no growth was observed this eliminated any effect of simultaneous uptake of various din sources the conventional nano3 in the modified wc medium was replaced with 15n nano3 as the sole n source for isotopic experiments the n starved cells were inoculated into the above modified wc medium 15n 14 mg l 1 with an initial optical density of 0 1 0 12 at 750 nm od750 nm then on day 13 the n concentration in the culture medium was reduced by four times by adding n free wc medium one off dilution or by two times on day 13 then two times on day 15 and then two times on day 18 stepwise dilution cells cultured in n free wc medium served as the control the ambient nitrate concentration was determined by measuring od220 nm and calculated using the following equation c no3 mm 0 2726 od220 nm 0 0024 r 2 0 99 collos et al 1999 the culture experiments were performed in tissue culture flasks of 250 ml with 60 ml culture medium fig s3 at 25 1 c under 35 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 with a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle each treatment was performed in triplicate for each replicate sample the culture in each flask was only used to determine cell growth 1 ml and cyanophycin content 50 ml or dinitrogenase activety 40 ml on a sampling day fig 1 a 2 2 3 determination of cell growth cyanophycin content and dinitrogenase activity cell growth was determined by an estimation from od750 nm every 3 days using a spectrophotometer uh5300 hitachi tokyo japan briand et al 2008 there is a good linear relationship between od750 nm and dry biomass cell concentration post et al 1985 fig s4 at 3 day intervals the cyanophycin content in 50 ml culture samples was measured the culture samples were immediately filtered through an acetate membrane 0 45 μm pore size and then the membrane containing the cells was stored at 80 c until cyanophycin content of r raciborskii dry cell weight analysis algal samples of 40 ml were withdrawn aseptically on day 6 12 15 and 21 for detection of dinitrogenase activity which was detected by acetylene reduction assay paerl et al 2014 briefly culture samples were injected into crimp sealed 100 ml serum bottles previously flushed with n2 cac2 generated acetylene 10 v v of 7 ml was injected into these sample bottles the sample bottles were incubated in a constant temperature water bath at 30 c for 4 h subsequently the gas phase samples were collected in pre evacuated vacutainer becton dickinson inc with a gas tight syringe hamilton co reno usa the product ethylene content was determined using a shimadzu flame ionization gas chromatograph model gc 14a equipped with a gs q capillary column agilent j w scientific folsom ca 30 m 0 546 mm one unit u of dinitrogenase activity was defined as the amount of dinitrogenase catalyzing the reduction of 1 nmol of acetylene per hour per mg fresh biomass 2 3 examining the effect of 15n nano3 concentrations on source of n used in cyanophycin synthesis in diazotrophic cyanobacteria the n used in cyanophycin synthesis can be derived not only from ambient n van de waal et al 2010 but also from newly fixed n finzi hart et al 2009 to explore the effect of n concentrations on the source of n used in cyanophycin synthesis we supplied 15n nano3 at concentrations of 0 8 1 0 1 2 and 1 4 mg n l 1 in r raciborskii qdh7 culture medium the n starved cells were prepared as described above and inoculated into these 15n modified wc media with an initial od750 nm of 0 1 the cells were sampled on day 0 1 3 10 and 20 for cyanophycin extraction and detection as described above because cyanophycin is a polymer of arginine and aspartate the 15n arginine content can indicate whether the n in cyanophycin derives from no3 15n or 14n derived from n2 fixation samples were collected on day 1 and day 3 for 15n arginine detection the concentration of 15n arginine in the solution containing the solubilized cyanophycin was determined by daruibiotech co ltd guangzhou china the parent ions of the normal molecule m z 175 and those of 15n labelled arginine m z 176 containing one atom of 15n m z 177 two atoms of 15n m z 178 three atoms of 15n m h were detected 2 4 field surveys 2 4 1 study reservoir and sampling to explore the relationship between cyanophycin accumulation and r raciborskii population dynamics in natural conditions a monthly limnological investigation of nutrient concentrations phytoplankton composition proportion of heterocysts of total r raciborskii cells and cyanophycin content of r raciborskii dry cell weight in the water was conducted from january 2019 to december 2019 in a tropical reservoir the zh reservoir 22 57 n 112 57 e fig 4a in south china due to the monsoonal climate the reservoir has a warm monomictic mixing regime its normal storage volume is about 1 2 108 m3 its maximum depth is 12 m and it has dendritic shape the sampling site was in the center of the reservoir fig 4a at this site water samples were collected at a depth of 0 5 m and kept cool until analyses 2 4 2 nutrient levels in water phytoplankton composition and cyanophycin analysis for nutrient analysis water samples were transported to the laboratory within 8 h of collection the environmental nutrients included soluble reactive p srp nitrate no3 n ammonium nh4 n tn and total p tp din was calculated as the sum of no3 n and nh4 n the nutrient concentrations were measured and calculated following the standards set by the usa environmental protection agency for phytoplankton composition and biomass analysis each 1000 ml water sample was preserved in the field with 1 v v lugol s iodine solution and sedimented for 48 h phytoplankton taxa were identified according to the latest taxonomic literature and counted under an inverted microscope at 400 magnification utermöhl 1958 at least 400 settling units were counted and the average sizes of all the counted algal cells were calculated the biomass of each algal cell was calculated based on biovolume assuming specific gravity of 1 mg mm 3 hillebrand et al 1999 for cyanophycin content analysis each 200 ml water sample was filtered through an acetate membrane 0 45 μm pore size cyanophycin was extracted from the algae collected on the membranes the cyanophycin content of r raciborskii dry cell weight was calculated using the following formula c p g c d c w c c p g

in cell growth cyanophycin dinitrogenase activity and 15n arginine content μmol l 1 in the extracted cyanophycin using the multcomp package in r a paired t test was performed to analyze the significantly statistical differences in the n concentration and cyanophycin contents of dry cell weight between the first half year and the second half year 3 results 3 1 cyanophycin is prevalent in raphidiopsis we confirmed the presence of three putative cyanophycin synthase genes cpha cpha2 and cpha2 and one putative cyanophycinase gene cphb in the draft genomes of r raciborskii qdh7 n8 and publicly available genomic data for 21 r raciborskii strains isolated around the world the genes cpha and cphb were widely present among strains of r raciborskii including strains from china australia korea and the usa but not in the strains cyrf and cylp from brazil table 1 the lack of cpha and cphb in the genomes of the two brazilian strains cyrf and cylp might be because of incomplete genome assembly and annotation both cpha and cphb were highly conserved among r raciborskii strains the three putative cpha genes were around 2654 989 and 1940 bp in length and cphb was around 893 bp in length table s1 cyanophycin granules were observed inside r raciborskii cells fig s1b these results confirmed that r raciborskii accumulates cyanophycin as a form of stored n we speculated that cyanophycin is evolutionarily conserved to support the proliferation of r raciborskii in n fluctuating and or deficient conditions to test this idea we conducted further experiments and observations to determine the contribution of n stored as cyanophycin to the persistent dominance and blooms of harmful cyanobacteria 3 2 growth and n assimilation patterns under simulated n fluctuating conditions the growth patterns of r raciborskii in two simulated n fluctuation scenarios were shown in fig 1b and s5 the biomass indicated by od750 nm was not significantly different between these two n dilution

fluctuating conditions than under n depleted conditions at each timepoint from day 9 p 0 001 repeated measures anova without n supplementation there was a long lag in cell growth fig 1b and the biomass did not increase until day 13 the n uptake curves before dilution were similar in these two n dilution scenarios as indicated by their nano3 concentration repeated measures anova f 4 001 p 0 056 fig 1a and table s2 in the first 3 days exogenous n was rapidly taken up by r raciborskii qdh7 and the uptake rate of nano3 was highest at this time fig s6 cyanophycin content on day 3 was significantly higher than day 0 tukey s post hoc p 0 001 in one off dilution stepwise group and control group respectively when the n starved cells were inoculated into fresh n sufficient medium fig 2 a the cyanophycin content of r raciborskii qdh7 increased to 20 8 of dry cell weight after that the cyanophycin content gradually decreased until day 13 when the cell culture medium was diluted upon n fluctuation caused by dilution cyanophycin was accumulated again fig 2a after this one off dilution the cyanophycin content was significantly higher on day 15 than on day 12 tukey s post hoc p 0 01 similarly upon stepwise dilution the cyanophycin content increased from day 15 to day 18 and from day 18 to day 21 day 18 and day 21 were the days when the stepwise dilutions occurred notably under n depleted conditions cyanophycin was unexpectedly accumulated on day 3 and its level was not significantly different from that under n sufficient conditions tukey s post hoc p 0 183 compared to one off dilution p 0 863 compared to stepwise dilution fig 2a however from day 3 onwards without n dilution the cyanophycin content decreased with increasing culture time fig 2a the activity of dinitrogenase was highly dependent on the exogenous no3 concentration fig 2b for instance its activity was remarkably higher in the early stage of n depleted blank control conditions since the n concentration dropped to 1 03 mg l 1 after one off dilution on day 13 fig 1a the dinitrogenase activity on day 15 significantly increased tukey s post hoc p 0 001 fig 2b compared with that in the stepwise dilution group in which the no3 n concentration was 2 27 mg l 1 on day 13 fig 1a after the n concentration dropped to 0 33 mg l 1 due to stepwise dilution on day 18 a significant increase in dinitrogenase activity tukey s post hoc p 0 001 compared to one off dilution and control group respectively was detected on day 21 3 3 the source of n used for cyanophycin synthesis under fluctuating n at different concentrations the source of n used in cyanophycin synthesis depended on the concentration of exogenous bioavailable no3 n as above there was non significant difference in exogenous no3 n concentration between the two n fluctuating conditions before day 13 repeated measures anova f 4 001 p 0 056 fig 1a and table s2 accordingly there was no significant difference in the 15n arginine content of cyanophycin between the two treatments tukey s post hoc p 0 797 on day 3 p 0 915 on day 9 fig 2c d in the one off dilution group the exogenous no3 n concentration decreased to 0 71 mg l 1 on day 15 accompanied by the accumulation of cyanophycin and the up regulation of dinitrogenase activity fig 2a b however the content of cyanophycin based 15n arginine dropped on day 16 fig 2c in contrast the exogenous no3 n concentration did not decrease notably in the stepwise dilution group on day 15 concentration 1 59 mg l 1 at this no3 n concentration dinitrogenase activity was not highly upregulated on day 15 fig 2b but the cyanophycin based 15n arginine content fig 2d and cyanophycin content synchronously increased fig 2a the experiments with different 15n nano3 concentrations revealed a specific n threshold that determined the source of cyanophycin based n fig 3 when cells were cultured with 1 2 and 1 4 mg no3 n l 1 the cyanophycin was rapidly accumulated at first and then gradually decreased in contrast the cyanophycin content in cells cultured with 0 8 and 1 0 mg no3 n l 1 did not increase rapidly on day 1 tukey s post hoc p 0 05 compared to that on day 0 but increased on day 3 tukey s post hoc p 0 05 compared to that on day 1 fig 3a tracing of 15n arginine revealed significantly higher content in the cyanophycin extracted from cells in the 1 2 and 1 4 mg no3 n l 1 groups than in the other groups fig 3b indicating that ambient 15n nano3 was the main source of n in the newly synthesized cyanophycin in contrast the 15n arginine content in cyanophycin was significantly lower on day 1 tukey s post hoc p 0 01 and day 3 tukey s post hoc p 0 05 in the 0 8 and 1 0 mg n l 1 groups compared to 1 4 and 1 2 mg no3 n l 1 groups 3 4 nutrient phytoplankton cyanophycin and heterocyst profiles in the zh reservoir the tn concentration fluctuated in the reservoir throughout 2019 but its average in the first half of the year 1 34 mg n l 1 was significantly higher than that in the second half 1 03 mg n l 1 paired t test t 2 79 df 8 90 p 0 02 fig 4 c in june the tn concentration decreased precipitously to 0 89 mg l 1 similarly the no3 n concentration remained relatively stable in the first half of the year average approx 0 45 mg n l 1 and then dropped to the annual minimum of 0 05 mg n l 1 in june fig 4c before the onset of r raciborskii blooms fig 4d the nh4 concentration remained stable at around 0 06 mg l 1 despite a slight decrease early on fig 4c as for phytoplankton biomass r raciborskii was dominant in the phytoplankton community throughout the entire year accounting for nearly 80 of the phytoplankton biomass fig 4d the phytoplankton biomass including that of r raciborskii peaked in july after the tn concentration peaked in may starting from may the phytoplankton biomass including that of r raciborskii remained higher than that in spring from january to april interestingly the cyanophycin dynamics were diametrically opposite to r raciborskii population dynamics fig 4b the cyanophycin content dry cell weight was dependent on the ambient n levels so it was relatively high in the first half of the year e g peak content of 5 0 in february the cyanophycin content decreased after may and its average content was significantly decreased in the second half of the year paired t test t 3 242 df 5 34 p 0 02 throughout the year heterocysts accounted for less than 1 of total cells in the reservoir data not shown indicating n2 fixation contributed very little n to the reservoir 4 discussion the highly conserved genes for cyanophycin synthesis cpha and degradation cphb were confirmed to be present in 21 of 23 ecotypes of raphidiopsis raphidiopsis raciborskii qdh7 always commenced to synthesize and accumulate cyanophycin under n fluctuating conditions regardless of whether exogenous n was deficient in the culture experiments r raciborskii generated cyanophycin through prioritizing uptake of 15n nano3 at n concentrations 1 2 mg l 1 but cyanophycin based n was derived from unlabeled n2 at n concentrations 1 0 mg l 1 fig s7 cells grown under no3 n 1 0 mg l 1 had lower cyanophycin accumulation rates than cells grown under no3 n 1 2 mg l 1 our field investigation showed that the cyanophycin content remained at a high level in n sufficient no3 n 0 45 mg l 1 periods but decreased in n deficient summer in summer r raciborskii sustained a relative high biomass and formed few heterocysts 1 our findings strongly suggested that cyanophycin released n rather than fixed n supports the persistent blooms of r raciborskii in n deficient seasons 4 1 cyanophycin accumulation in r raciborskii upon n fluctuations regardless of exogenous n concentration many studies of nutrient storage are biased towards the belief that cyanophycin was accumulated when the exogenous n concentration is high and degraded when it is low trautmann et al 2016 van de waal et al 2010 several studies however have reported an unexplained transient accumulation of cyanophycin in n starved synechocystis sp cells klotz et al 2016 consistent with this polerecky et al 2021 found that the cyanobacterium cyanothece sp atcc 51 142 prioritized cyanophycin synthesis under both n deficient and n sufficient conditions these findings suggested that the accumulation of cyanophycin may be independent of absolute n concentrations and there are likely to be certain factors that trigger its synthesis and degradation in our culture experiments n fluctuations triggered cyanophycin synthesis in r raciborskii r raciborskii always commenced to synthesize and accumulate cyanophycin when it was inoculated into fresh medium one type of n fluctuation or when subjected to simulated n fluctuations in the culture fig 2 as diazotrophic cyanobacteria unicellular cyanothece sp atcc 51 142 and filamentous trichodesmium sp fix n at night and store the fixed n in the form of cyanophycin finzi hart et al 2009 sherman et al 1998 similarly r raciborskii cs 505 yields distinct cyanophycin polar nodules in the heterocysts plominsky et al 2015 cyanophycin was synthesized at night to store fixed n and degraded during the daytime to mobilize n for photosynthesis in diazotrophic cyanobacteria these findings led to the belief that diazotrophic cyanobacteria accumulate cyanophycin only during the n2 fixation process watzer and forchhammer 2018 however this does not appear to be the case our study revealed that once r raciborskii encountered n fluctuations it began to accumulate cyanophycin regardless of exogenous n concentration therefore it was suggested that n fluctuations cause r raciborskii to enter an unbalanced growth stage and the reduction in its growth rate drives the conversion of exogenous n to cyanophycin polerecky et al 2021 whereas during exponential growth cyanophycin synthesis is bypassed and it is degraded in favor of protein synthesis watzer et al 2015 4 2 n threshold determining cyanophycin accumulation or degradation in natural waters previous studies have shown that in natural waters planktonic algae generally show unbalanced growth in dynamically fluctuating environments van de waal et al 2010 and cpha encoding cyanophycin synthetase is actively transcribed to cope with nutrient fluctuations interestingly cphb which is responsible for cyanophycin degradation is also very active under such conditions tee et al 2020 these findings suggested that cyanophycin synthesis and degradation co occurred when r raciborskii encounters n fluctuations and that the ambient n concentration determines how much cyanophycin is ultimately accumulated or degraded our field results supported this idea we observed that the cellular cyanophycin content was dependent on the exogenous no3 n levels during n deficient 0 45 mg no3 n l 1 conditions in summer cyanophycin was degraded and remained at a relatively low level in the first half of the year january to june when the no3 n concentration was relatively high average 0 45 mg tn l 1 the cyanophycin content was also relatively high fig 4b accordingly we speculated that there exists a threshold n concentration in natural waters that triggers accumulation or degradation of cyanophycin the n substrates for cyanophycin synthesis are not only derived from ambient n van de waal et al 2010 but also from newly fixed n in diazotrophic cyanobacteria finzi hart et al 2009 our 15n labeling experiments revealed that there was a n threshold determining the source of n in cyanophycin if algal cells were inoculated into medium containing sufficient no3 n 1 2 mg l 1 then ambient nano3 was the preferred substrate over n2 it was suggested that under a relatively high n concentration r raciborskii produced cyanophycin as n storage utilizing up taken available no3 n if the ambient no3 n concentration was too low 1 0 mg l 1 for it to be assimilated into cyanophycin r raciborskii assimilated an unlabeled external n source probably as fixed n as evidenced by the increase in dinitrogenase activity fig 2b this suggested that n deficiency activated n2 fixation and the fixed n rather than no3 n likely contributed most of the n substrates for cyanophycin synthesis the proposed n threshold determining the n2 fixation behavior could also be found in a field study by gonzález madina et al 2019 they reported that when the tn concentration was higher than 1 0 mg l 1 all the species behaved as non n2 fixers that is a complete absence of heterocysts which is an adequate proxy of non n2 fixing gonzález madina et al 2019 although r raciborskii could accumulate cyanophycin regardless of exogenous n concentration once it encountered fluctuating n conditions cells grown under no3 n 1 0 mg l 1 had lower cyanophycin accumulation rates than cells grown under no3 n 1 2 mg l 1 fig 3 under high nitrate conditions no3 n 1 2 mg l 1 r raciborskii rapidly accumulated cyanophycin on day 1 when the uptake rate of nano3 was highest in contrast under low nitrate conditions no3 n 1 0 mg l 1 a switch from atmospheric n to nh4 caused long lag times in cyanophycin accumulation fig 3a this is because cells have to produce enzymes first to allow them fix n dixon and kahn 2004 this finding supports our speculation there does exist a n threshold in natural waters determining whether cyanophycin is accumulated or degraded although this natural threshold was lower than that of experimental study due to the complexity of natural waters when the ambient n concentration was relatively high no3 n 0 45 mg l 1 cyanophycin was synthesized faster than it was degraded leading to cyanophycin accumulation while the available n concentration became lower than 0 45 mg l 1 the n used for cyanophycin synthesis was derived from fixed n leading to a long lag in cyanophycin synthesis thus cyanophycin degradation was faster than its synthesis resulting in decreased cyanophycin content based on these findings we propose that if the ambient n concentration is high enough and fluctuates severely then r raciborskii will prioritize cyanophycin accumulation to store n by taking up ambient n when the ambient n concentration becomes low r raciborskii will first release the n from recently synthesized cyanophycin to alleviate the n deficient conditions thereby minimizing the need for energy intensive n2 fixation 4 3 n stored in cyanophycin accumulated under n fluctuating and high n conditions facilitates the persistent dominance and blooms of r raciborskii as with many other aquatic ecosystems our studied reservoir showed fluctuations in tn throughout the year the tn was highest in spring to early summer and declined to low levels as summer progressed fig 4c it is likely that in summer the higher temperatures promoted r raciborskii blooms and their demands for inorganic n depleted the inorganic n to n limited conditions schindler et al 2008 however the long duration of the high biomass of r raciborskii from early summer to fall fig 4b must be supported by sufficient n previous studies have also revealed that the rates of n2 fixation across most freshwater systems are insufficient to alleviate n limitation within the ecosystem paerl et al 2016 scott and mccarthy 2010 shatwell and köhler 2019 xu et al 2021 another study showed that n2 fixation did not confer a competitive advantage upon r raciborskii under n limiting conditions and provided little n to support relatively low growth willis et al 2016 consistent with that finding we observed few heterocysts 1 of total r raciborskii cells in our reservoir during the yearlong survey meanwhile the monthly cell quotas μg chl a per μg tp were greater than 0 3 fig s8 indicating that our studied reservoir was characterized as p limitation throughout the year maberly et al 2020 p limitation constrains the synthesis of atp and related enzymes for n2 fixation and or heterocysts formation stewart and alexander 1971 yema et al 2016 in addition we isolated two strains from this reservoir and found that under n depleted conditions these two strains produced a low proportion of heterocysts fig s9 heterocysts are specialized cells to fix n flores and herrero 2010 and so the presence of few heterocysts is indicative of rather low inputs of fixed n also r raciborskii is not a surface bloom former but rather is distributed throughout the water column where light energy limitation may constrain the ability to fix n2 furthermore internal nh4 n regenerated from sediments was reported to help sustain cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu xu et al 2021 unlike shallow lake however the zh reservoir we studied has a maximum depth of 12 m the depth makes the hypolimnion seasonally undisturbed by hydrodynamic actions with only the epilimnion staying active qin et al 2020 thus we suggest that regenerated nh4 n may not meet the n demand for summer fall r raciborskii dominated blooms in our studied system these findings and those of previous reports illustrate that another n source must be supporting the persistent dominance and blooms of r raciborskii in n deficient summer waters just as analogous to polyp this effective p storage allows cyanobacteria to take up more p than is required in p sufficient conditions so that cells can continue to grow later under p deficient conditions willis et al 2017 similarly we found that under n sufficient condition in spring the cyanophycin content in r raciborskii was relatively higher thus we propose that r raciborskii also assimilated more n than that was required for cell growth under n sufficient conditions in spring as for the function of this stored n the rationale may be similar to that of polyp which extends the duration in which r raciborskii can sustain growth under p deficiency xiao et al 2020 the polyp quota generally decreased and supported high primary productivity in the p deficient season in lake ontario li et al 2019 there are two main n storages cyanophycin and phycobilisomes in cyanobacteria compared to cyanophycin phycobilisomes has a dual role in n storage and photosynthesis forchhammer and schwarz 2019 the degradation of phycobilisomes changes the water color from blue green to yellow and appear chlorotic allen et al 1980 simon 1971 during our observation the water color was basically unchanged remaining blue green the year round we thus suggest that cyanophycin not phycobilisomes was used as the main internal n storage for the diazotrophic r raciborskii li et al 2001 we found that the cyanophycin dynamics were diametrically opposite to the population dynamics of r raciborskii in the zh reservoir fig 4b and 4d integrating our findings and the previous reports we develop a potential scenario for the function of cyanophycin in the high n no3 n 0 45 mg l 1 season r raciborskii preferentially activates cyanophycin accumulation when the no3 n concentration declines 0 45 mg l 1 and it prioritizes cyanophycin degradation releasing internal n to alleviate the cells from n deficiency especially under light energy limited conditions i e in subsurface populations this flexible n storage and rapid release capability likely obviates the need for the energy intensive n2 fixation allowing r raciborskii to proliferate and sustain its dominance during n deficient seasons although the threshold of n concentration might be approximate it provides some insights into the mechanism by which r raciborskii can proliferate under n deficient conditions we therefore suggest that as nutrient storage molecules polyp and cyanophycin may jointly facilitate the dominance of cyanobacteria in environments with fluctuating nutrient availability these mechanisms allow bloom forming cyanobacteria to avoid nutrient limitation 5 conclusion our study verified the presence of cyanophycin associated genes and granules in r raciborskii our experimental strain qdh7 of the species always commenced to accumulate cyanophycin under simulated fluctuating n conditions we suggested that there is a no3 n threshold 0 45 mg l 1 determining whether cyanophycin is accumulated or degraded in natural waters the cyanophycin content was closely associated with the population dynamics of r raciborskii in a large tropical reservoir zh reservoir southern china indicating that n released from stored n in the form of cyanophycin rather than fixed n supported the proliferation of r raciborskii under n deficient summer conditions our study demonstrated the role of stored n in cyanobacterial dominance and bloom formation due to this highly adaptive strategy in a n2 fixing cyanobacterial species mitigating its bloom will be more difficult than previously assumed credit authorship contribution statement

16212,nutrient storage is considered a critical strategy for algal species to adapt to a fluctuating nutrient supply luxury phosphorus p uptake into storage of polyphosphate extends the duration of cyanobacterial dominance and their blooms under p deficiency however it is unclear whether nitrogen n storage in the form of cyanophycin supports persistent cyanobacterial dominance or blooms in the tropics where n deficiency commonly occurs in summer in this study we examined genes for cyanophycin synthesis and degradation in raphidiopsis raciborskii a widespread and dominant cyanobacterium in tropical waters and detected the cyanophycin accumulation under fluctuating n concentrations and its ecological role in the population dynamics of the species the genes for cyanophycin synthesis cpha and degradation cphb were highly conserved in 21 out of 23 raphidiopsis strains this suggested that the synthesis and degradation of cyanophycin are evolutionarily conserved to support the proliferation of r raciborskii in n fluctuating and or deficient conditions isotope 15n nano3 labeling experiments showed that r raciborskii qdh7 always commenced to synthesize and accumulate cyanophycin under fluctuating n conditions regardless of whether exogenous n was deficient when the no3 n concentration exceeded 1 2 mg l 1 r raciborskii synthesized cyanophycin primarily through uptake of 15n nano3 however when the no3 n concentration was below 1 0 mg l 1 cyanophycin based n was derived from unlabeled n2 as evidenced by increased dinitrogenase activity cells grown under no3 n 1 0 mg l 1 had lower cyanophycin accumulation rates than cells grown under no3 n 1 2 mg l 1 our field investigation in a large tropical reservoir underscored the association between cyanophycin content and the population dynamics of r raciborskii the cyanophycin content was high in n sufficient no3 n 0 45 mg l 1 periods and decreased in n deficient summer in summer r raciborskii sustained a relatively high biomass and produced few heterocysts 1 these findings indicated that cyanophycin released n rather than fixed n supported persistent r raciborskii blooms in n deficient seasons our study suggests that the highly adaptive strategy in a n2 fixing cyanobacterial species makes mitigating its bloom more difficult than previously assumed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cylindrospermopsis raciborskii nitrogen storage cyanophycin nitrogen deficiency bloom dynamics 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms are occurring with increased frequency intensity and duration in freshwater bodies throughout the world these blooms threaten human health and freshwater ecosystem functioning coffer et al 2021 ho et al 2019 huisman et al 2018 paerl and otten 2013 many species of cyanobacteria have evolved various eco physiological strategies to adapt to nutrient fluctuations these strategies allow them to dominate the phytoplankton community and form blooms paerl and otten 2013 scott et al 2019 one of the well studied strategies is luxury p uptake into storage as polyphosphate polyp facilitating the dominance and persistence of cyanobacteria in p deficient environments carey et al 2012 ritchie et al 2001 another physiological strategy is n2 fixation via conversion of n2 to nh4 which can be used as a n source when available n sources are depleted in waters schindler et al 2008 however n2 fixation is energetically expensive dixon and kahn 2004 a growing body of evidence indicates that n2 fixation is not the principal strategy for acquiring n and unlikely provides enough n to support cyanobacterial blooms paerl et al 2016 scott et al 2019 shatwell and köhler 2019 xu et al 2021 therefore there are likely other mechanisms allowing cyanobacteria to gain a competitive advantage under n deficient and or fluctuating n conditions several earlier laboratory studies showed that cyanobacteria can store n just as they store p allen et al 1980 simon 1971 recently it was found that the n reserves are mainly in the forms of cyanophycin and phycobilisomes in many cyanobacterial species and cyanophycin is used as an internal n source under n deficient conditions before using phycobilisomes zhang and yang 2019 phycobilisomes plays a less important role than cyanophycin in the diazotrophic cyanobacteria which use cyanophycin as the main n storage li et al 2001 cyanophycin c10h19n5o5 is a non ribosomally synthesized polypeptide with a relatively high ratio of n to c flores et al 2019 its biosynthesis and degradation are catalyzed by cyanophycin synthase encoded by cpha and cyanophycinase encoded by cphb respectively picossi et al 2004 under sufficient n supply many cyanobacteria accumulate cyanophycin during unbalanced growth induced by nutrient fluctuations e g p pulses polerecky et al 2021 trautmann et al 2016 van de waal et al 2010 in contrast in the absence of n cyanobacteria contain very low levels of cyanophycin mackerras et al 1990 cyanophycin accumulation enables synechocystis sp and microcoleus sp to optimize n assimilation under n deficient conditions and especially under fluctuating n supply tee et al 2020 watzer and forchhammer 2018 cyanophycin has been detected in many cyanobacteria species but never in eukaryotic algae mojzes et al 2020 therefore analogous to the case of p storage cyanophycin may provide cyanobacteria with a competitive advantage over sympatric phytoplankton species in nature with fluctuating or deficient n supply forchhammer and schwarz 2019 several bloom forming cyanobacteria such as microcystis sp dolichospermum sp formerly anabaena aphanizomenon ovalisporum and planktothrix agardhii store n intracellularly as cyanophycin sukenik et al 2015 van de waal et al 2010 their advantage over eukaryotic algae under n limiting conditions may be related to cyanophycin kurmayer et al 2016 freshwater diazotrophic filamentous raphidiopsis formerly cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is one of the most successful bloom forming cyanobacteria in the tropics lei et al 2014 lu et al 2021 rzymski and poniedzialek 2014 this species has diverse nutritional utilization strategies that are critical for its rapid growth and global expansion burford et al 2016 r raciborskii was reported to have a competitive advantage under low n conditions figueredo et al 2014 xiao et al 2021 as n2 fixation by r raciborskii accounts for less than 10 of the total assimilated n and it cannot support a high growth rate under n deficiency willis et al 2016 in addition to fixed n there must be other n sources to meet the high n demands of dominant or blooming r raciborskii under n deficient conditions previous studies have shed some light on the n storage in r raciborskii mackerras et al 1990 trautmann et al 2016 van de waal et al 2010 however there are several major issues still to be resolved first the heterocysts of r raciborskii cs 505 can accumulate cyanophycin polar nodules from fixed n in n free medium plominsky et al 2015 but it is unknown whether the ability to synthesize this n storage compound is restricted to strain cs 505 or common among r raciborskii taxa there are multiple ecotypes with a high trait variability within and among locally occurring r raciborskii strains bolius et al 2017 second cyanophycin is considered to also be accumulated during the n2 fixation process in diazotrophic cyanobacteria watzer and forchhammer 2018 but it is unclear whether r raciborskii can accumulate cyanophycin under a fluctuating n supply namely n sufficient and n deficient conditions as has been reported for non diazotrophic cyanobacteria flores et al 2019 third observations on cyanophycin synthesis in cyanobacteria were predominantly conducted under standard laboratory conditions burnat et al 2014 sukenik et al 2015 van de waal et al 2010 thus probing into the relationship between n concentration and cyanophycin accumulation in natural conditions will provide further insights into the functional significance of cyanophycin in phytoplankton population dynamics to investigate the n stored in cyanophycin for r raciborskii to respond to n fluctuating we first checked whether all the published full genomes of r raciborskii strains contain genes involved in cyanophycin synthesis and degradation cpha and cphb respectively subsequently we conducted culture experiments to examine cyanophycin accumulation and dinitrogenase activity in r raciborskii under two n fluctuation scenarios we also quantitatively detected the dynamics of cellular cyanophycin content nutrient levels and phytoplankton biomass in a large reservoir in south china which has a stable annual phytoplankton community dominated by r raciborskii xiao et al 2021 we hypothesized that r raciborskii assimilates ambient n and stores it as cyanophycin during n sufficient period and that it is this stored n rather than energy intensive fixed n that supports proliferation of r raciborskii in n deficient waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 verification of cyanophycin associated genes and granules in raphidiopsis first we compared the genomic sequences of 23 raphidiopsis strains to verify the presence of cpha and cphb these genomic sequences were downloaded from the ncbi database https www ncbi nlm nih gov genome the raphidiopsis strains were isolated from diverse ecoregions around the world table 1 then we conducted metabolic level analysis of raphidiopsis cells containing cyanophycin granules we extracted cyanophycin as described by trautmann et al 2016 with some modifications fig s1a 2 2 exploring the cyanophycin accumulation in two simulated n fluctuation scenarios with stable isotope 15n nano3 2 2 1 strain and culture medium two simulated n fluctuation scenarios in which sufficient n concentration changed to n deficient conditions were applied to a 30 day culture of r raciborskii qdh7 a strain isolated from qiandeng lake 23 03 n 113 08 e foshan city guangdong province china and was preserved at jinan university this strain was unialgal but not axenic during experimental work the absence of heterotrophic bacteria was confirmed by routine microscopic observation we chose the form and concentration of dissolved n based on observations in the reservoir where we conducted our field study however because the simulated n fluctuation scenario was achieved by dilution with n free medium on day 13 if the initial n concentration was 1 4 mg l 1 then the exogenous n concentration on day 13 0 3 mg n l 1 fig s2 was too low therefore it was finally decided to supply nitrate at an initial n concentration of 14 mg l 1 the basal medium was modified wright s cryptophyte wc medium which contained 1000 ml distilled water 36 76 mg cacl2

free wc medium for 2 days to exhaust the initial n in cells qian et al 2017 till no growth was observed this eliminated any effect of simultaneous uptake of various din sources the conventional nano3 in the modified wc medium was replaced with 15n nano3 as the sole n source for isotopic experiments the n starved cells were inoculated into the above modified wc medium 15n 14 mg l 1 with an initial optical density of 0 1 0 12 at 750 nm od750 nm then on day 13 the n concentration in the culture medium was reduced by four times by adding n free wc medium one off dilution or by two times on day 13 then two times on day 15 and then two times on day 18 stepwise dilution cells cultured in n free wc medium served as the control the ambient nitrate concentration was determined by measuring od220 nm

cell growth was determined by an estimation from od750 nm every 3 days using a spectrophotometer uh5300 hitachi tokyo japan briand et al 2008 there is a good linear relationship between od750 nm and dry biomass cell concentration post et al 1985 fig s4 at 3 day intervals the cyanophycin content in 50 ml culture samples was measured the culture samples were immediately filtered through an acetate

synthesis in diazotrophic cyanobacteria the n used in cyanophycin synthesis can be derived not only from ambient n van de waal et al 2010 but also from newly fixed n finzi hart et al 2009 to explore the effect of n concentrations on the source of n used in cyanophycin synthesis we supplied 15n nano3 at concentrations of 0 8 1 0 1 2 and 1 4 mg n l 1 in r raciborskii qdh7 culture medium the n starved cells were prepared as described above and inoculated into these 15n modified wc media with an initial od750 nm of 0 1 the cells were sampled on day 0 1 3 10 and 20 for cyanophycin extraction and detection as described above because cyanophycin is a polymer of arginine and aspartate the 15n arginine content can indicate whether the n in cyanophycin derives from no3 15n or 14n derived from n2 fixation samples were collected on day 1 and day 3 for 15n arginine detection the concentration of 15n arginine in the solution containing the solubilized cyanophycin was determined by daruibiotech co ltd guangzhou china the parent ions of the normal molecule m z 175 and those of 15n labelled arginine m z 176 containing one atom of 15n m z 177 two atoms of 15n m z 178 three atoms of 15n m h were detected 2 4 field surveys 2 4 1 study reservoir and sampling to explore the relationship between cyanophycin accumulation and r raciborskii population dynamics in natural conditions a monthly limnological investigation of nutrient concentrations phytoplankton composition proportion of heterocysts of total r raciborskii cells and cyanophycin content of r raciborskii dry cell weight in the water was conducted from january 2019 to december 2019 in a tropical reservoir the zh reservoir 22 57 n 112 57 e fig 4a in south china due to the monsoonal climate the reservoir has a warm monomictic mixing regime its normal storage volume is about 1 2 108 m3 its maximum depth is 12 m and it has dendritic shape the sampling site was in the center of the reservoir fig 4a at this site water samples were collected at a depth of 0 5 m and kept cool until analyses 2 4 2 nutrient levels in water phytoplankton composition and cyanophycin analysis for nutrient analysis water samples were transported to the laboratory within 8 h of collection the environmental nutrients included soluble reactive p srp nitrate no3 n ammonium nh4 n tn and total p tp din was calculated as the sum of no3 n and nh4 n the nutrient concentrations were measured and calculated following the standards set by the usa environmental protection agency for phytoplankton composition and biomass analysis each 1000 ml water sample was preserved in the field with 1 v v lugol s iodine solution and sedimented for 48 h phytoplankton taxa were identified according to the latest taxonomic literature and counted under an inverted microscope at 400 magnification utermöhl 1958 at least 400 settling units were counted and the average sizes of all the counted algal cells were calculated the biomass of each algal cell was calculated based on biovolume assuming specific gravity of 1 mg mm 3 hillebrand et al 1999 for cyanophycin content analysis each 200 ml water sample was filtered through an acetate membrane 0 45 μm

in cell growth cyanophycin dinitrogenase activity and 15n arginine content μmol l 1 in the extracted cyanophycin using the multcomp package in r a paired t test was performed to analyze the significantly statistical differences in the n concentration and cyanophycin contents of dry cell weight between the first half year and the second half year 3 results 3 1 cyanophycin is prevalent in raphidiopsis we confirmed the presence of three putative cyanophycin synthase genes cpha cpha2 and cpha2 and one putative cyanophycinase gene cphb in the draft genomes of r raciborskii qdh7 n8 and publicly available genomic data for 21 r raciborskii strains isolated around the world the genes cpha and cphb were widely present among strains of r raciborskii including strains from china australia korea and the usa but not in the strains cyrf and cylp from brazil table 1 the lack of cpha and cphb in the genomes of the two brazilian strains cyrf and cylp might be because of incomplete genome assembly and annotation both cpha and cphb were highly conserved among r raciborskii strains the three putative cpha genes were around 2654 989 and 1940 bp in length and cphb was around 893 bp in length table s1 cyanophycin granules were observed inside r raciborskii cells fig s1b these results confirmed that r raciborskii accumulates cyanophycin as a form of stored n we speculated that cyanophycin is evolutionarily conserved to support the proliferation of r raciborskii in n fluctuating and or deficient conditions to test this idea we conducted further experiments and observations to determine the contribution of n stored as cyanophycin to the persistent dominance and blooms of harmful cyanobacteria 3 2 growth and n assimilation patterns under simulated n fluctuating conditions the growth patterns of r raciborskii in two simulated n fluctuation scenarios were shown in fig 1b and s5 the biomass indicated by od750 nm was not significantly different between these two n dilution scenarios except for day 12 repeated measures anova p 0 963 0 996 0 991 0 159 on day 3 6 9 13 respectively table s2 s3 before dilution namely before day 13 the biomass was significantly higher under n fluctuating conditions than under n depleted conditions at each timepoint from day 9 p 0 001 repeated measures anova without n supplementation there was a long lag in cell growth fig 1b and the biomass did not increase until day 13 the n uptake curves before dilution were similar in these two n dilution scenarios as indicated by their nano3 concentration repeated measures anova f 4 001 p 0 056 fig 1a and table s2 in the first 3 days exogenous n was rapidly taken up by r raciborskii qdh7 and the uptake rate of nano3 was highest at this time fig s6 cyanophycin content on day 3 was significantly higher than day 0 tukey s post hoc p 0 001 in one off dilution stepwise group and control group respectively when the n starved cells were inoculated into fresh n sufficient medium fig 2 a the cyanophycin content of r raciborskii qdh7 increased to 20 8 of dry cell weight after that the cyanophycin content gradually decreased until day 13 when the cell culture medium was diluted upon n fluctuation caused by dilution cyanophycin was accumulated again fig 2a after this one off dilution the cyanophycin content was significantly higher on day 15 than on day 12 tukey s post hoc p 0 01 similarly upon stepwise dilution the cyanophycin content increased from day 15 to day 18 and from day 18 to day 21 day 18 and day 21 were the days when the stepwise dilutions occurred notably under n depleted conditions cyanophycin was unexpectedly accumulated on day 3 and its level was not significantly different from that under n sufficient conditions tukey s post hoc p 0 183 compared to one off dilution p 0 863 compared to stepwise dilution fig 2a however from day 3 onwards without n dilution the cyanophycin content decreased with increasing culture time fig 2a the activity of dinitrogenase was highly dependent on the exogenous no3 concentration fig 2b for instance its activity was remarkably higher in the early stage of n depleted blank control conditions since the n concentration dropped to 1 03 mg l 1 after one off dilution on day 13 fig 1a the dinitrogenase activity on day 15 significantly increased tukey s post hoc p 0 001 fig 2b compared with that in the stepwise dilution group in which the no3 n concentration was 2 27 mg l 1 on day 13 fig 1a after the n concentration dropped to 0 33 mg l 1 due to stepwise dilution on day 18 a significant increase in dinitrogenase activity tukey s post hoc p 0 001 compared to one off dilution and control group respectively was detected on day 21 3 3 the source of n used for cyanophycin synthesis under fluctuating n at different concentrations the source of n used in cyanophycin synthesis depended on the concentration of exogenous bioavailable no3 n as above there was non significant difference in exogenous no3 n concentration between the two n fluctuating conditions before day 13 repeated measures anova f 4 001 p 0 056 fig 1a and table s2 accordingly there was no significant difference in the 15n arginine content of cyanophycin between the two treatments tukey s post hoc p 0 797 on day 3 p 0 915 on day 9 fig 2c d in the one off dilution group the exogenous no3 n concentration decreased to 0 71 mg l 1 on day 15 accompanied by the accumulation of cyanophycin and the up regulation of dinitrogenase activity fig 2a b however the content of cyanophycin based 15n arginine dropped on day 16 fig 2c in contrast the exogenous no3 n concentration did not decrease notably in the stepwise dilution group on day 15 concentration 1 59 mg l 1 at this no3 n concentration dinitrogenase activity was not highly upregulated on day 15 fig 2b but the cyanophycin based 15n arginine content fig 2d and cyanophycin content synchronously increased fig 2a the experiments with different 15n nano3 concentrations revealed a specific n threshold that determined the source of cyanophycin based n fig 3 when cells were cultured with 1 2 and 1 4 mg no3 n l 1 the cyanophycin was rapidly accumulated at first and then gradually decreased in contrast the cyanophycin content in cells cultured with 0 8 and 1 0 mg no3 n l 1 did not increase rapidly on day 1 tukey s post hoc p 0 05 compared to that on day 0 but increased on day 3 tukey s post hoc p 0 05 compared to that on day 1 fig 3a tracing of 15n arginine revealed significantly higher content in the cyanophycin extracted from cells in the 1 2 and 1 4 mg no3 n l 1 groups than in the other groups fig 3b indicating that ambient 15n nano3 was the main source of n in the newly synthesized cyanophycin in contrast the 15n arginine content in cyanophycin was significantly lower on day 1 tukey s post hoc p 0 01 and day 3 tukey s post hoc p 0 05 in the 0 8 and 1 0 mg n l 1 groups compared to 1 4 and 1 2 mg no3 n l 1 groups 3 4 nutrient phytoplankton cyanophycin and heterocyst profiles in the zh reservoir the tn concentration fluctuated in the reservoir throughout 2019 but its average in the first half of the year 1 34 mg n l 1 was significantly higher than that in the second half 1 03 mg n l 1 paired t test t 2 79 df 8 90 p 0 02 fig 4 c in june the tn concentration decreased precipitously to 0 89 mg l 1 similarly the no3 n concentration remained relatively stable in the first half of the year average approx 0 45 mg n l 1 and then dropped to the annual minimum of 0 05 mg n l 1 in june fig 4c before the onset of r raciborskii blooms fig 4d the nh4 concentration remained stable at around 0 06 mg l 1 despite a slight decrease early on fig 4c as for phytoplankton biomass r raciborskii was dominant in the phytoplankton community throughout the entire year accounting for nearly 80 of the phytoplankton biomass fig 4d the phytoplankton biomass including that of r raciborskii peaked in july after the tn concentration peaked in may starting from may the phytoplankton biomass including that of r raciborskii remained higher than that in spring from january to april interestingly the cyanophycin dynamics were diametrically opposite to r raciborskii population dynamics fig 4b the cyanophycin content dry cell weight was dependent on the ambient n levels so it was relatively high in the first half of the year e g peak content of 5 0 in february the cyanophycin content decreased after may and its average content was significantly decreased in the second half of the year paired t test t 3 242 df 5 34 p 0 02 throughout the year heterocysts accounted for less than 1 of total cells in the reservoir data not shown indicating n2 fixation contributed very little n to the reservoir 4 discussion the highly conserved genes for cyanophycin synthesis cpha and degradation cphb were confirmed to be present in 21 of 23 ecotypes of raphidiopsis raphidiopsis raciborskii qdh7 always commenced to synthesize and accumulate cyanophycin under n fluctuating conditions regardless of whether exogenous n was deficient in the culture experiments r raciborskii generated cyanophycin through prioritizing uptake of 15n nano3 at n concentrations 1 2 mg l 1 but cyanophycin based n was derived from unlabeled n2 at n concentrations 1 0 mg l 1 fig s7 cells grown under no3 n 1 0 mg l 1 had lower cyanophycin accumulation rates than cells grown under no3 n 1 2 mg l 1 our field investigation showed that the cyanophycin content remained at a high level in n sufficient no3 n 0 45 mg l 1 periods but decreased in n deficient summer in summer r raciborskii sustained a relative high biomass and formed few heterocysts 1 our findings strongly suggested that cyanophycin released n rather than fixed n supports the persistent blooms of r raciborskii in n deficient seasons 4 1 cyanophycin accumulation in r raciborskii upon n fluctuations regardless of exogenous n concentration many studies of nutrient storage are biased towards the belief that cyanophycin was accumulated when the exogenous n concentration is high and degraded when it is low trautmann et al 2016 van de waal et al 2010 several studies however have reported an unexplained transient accumulation of cyanophycin in n starved synechocystis sp cells klotz et al 2016 consistent with this polerecky et al 2021 found that the cyanobacterium cyanothece sp atcc 51 142 prioritized cyanophycin synthesis under both n deficient and n sufficient conditions these findings suggested that the accumulation of cyanophycin may be independent of absolute n concentrations and there are likely to be certain factors that trigger its synthesis and degradation in our culture experiments n fluctuations triggered cyanophycin synthesis in r raciborskii r raciborskii always commenced to synthesize and accumulate cyanophycin when it was inoculated into fresh medium one type of n fluctuation or when subjected to simulated n fluctuations in the culture fig 2 as diazotrophic cyanobacteria unicellular cyanothece sp atcc 51 142 and filamentous trichodesmium sp fix n at night and store the fixed n in the form of cyanophycin finzi hart et al 2009 sherman et al 1998 similarly r raciborskii cs 505 yields distinct cyanophycin polar nodules in the heterocysts plominsky et al 2015 cyanophycin was synthesized at night to store fixed n and degraded during the daytime to mobilize n for photosynthesis in diazotrophic cyanobacteria these findings led to the belief that diazotrophic cyanobacteria accumulate cyanophycin only during the n2 fixation process watzer and forchhammer 2018 however this does not appear to be the case our study revealed that once r raciborskii encountered n fluctuations it began to accumulate cyanophycin regardless of exogenous n concentration therefore it was suggested that n fluctuations cause r raciborskii to enter an unbalanced growth stage and the reduction in its growth rate drives the conversion of exogenous n to cyanophycin polerecky et al 2021 whereas during exponential growth cyanophycin synthesis is bypassed and it is degraded in favor of protein synthesis watzer et al 2015 4 2 n threshold determining cyanophycin accumulation or degradation in natural waters previous studies have shown that in natural waters planktonic algae generally show unbalanced growth in dynamically fluctuating environments van de waal et al 2010 and cpha encoding cyanophycin synthetase is actively transcribed to cope with nutrient fluctuations interestingly cphb which is responsible for cyanophycin degradation is also very active under such conditions tee et al 2020 these findings suggested that cyanophycin synthesis and degradation co occurred when r raciborskii encounters n fluctuations and that the ambient n concentration determines how much cyanophycin is ultimately accumulated or degraded our field results supported this idea we observed that the cellular cyanophycin content was dependent on the exogenous no3 n levels during n deficient 0 45 mg no3 n l 1 conditions in summer cyanophycin was degraded and remained at a relatively low level in the first half of the year january to june when the no3 n concentration was relatively high average 0 45 mg tn l 1 the cyanophycin content was also relatively high fig 4b accordingly we speculated that there exists a threshold n concentration in natural waters that triggers accumulation or degradation of cyanophycin the n substrates for cyanophycin synthesis are not only derived from ambient n van de waal et al 2010 but also from newly fixed n in diazotrophic cyanobacteria finzi hart et al 2009 our 15n labeling experiments revealed that there was a n threshold determining the source of n in cyanophycin if algal cells were inoculated into medium containing sufficient no3 n 1 2 mg l 1 then ambient nano3 was the preferred substrate over n2 it was suggested that under a relatively high n concentration r raciborskii produced cyanophycin as n storage utilizing up taken available no3 n if the ambient no3 n concentration was too low 1 0 mg l 1 for it to be assimilated into cyanophycin r raciborskii assimilated an unlabeled external n source probably as fixed n as evidenced by the increase in dinitrogenase activity fig 2b this suggested that n deficiency activated n2 fixation and the fixed n rather than no3 n likely contributed most of the n substrates for cyanophycin synthesis the proposed n threshold determining the n2 fixation behavior could also be found in a field study by gonzález madina et al 2019 they reported that when the tn concentration was higher than 1 0 mg l 1 all the species behaved as non n2 fixers that is a complete absence of heterocysts which is an adequate proxy of non n2 fixing gonzález madina et al 2019 although r raciborskii could accumulate cyanophycin regardless of exogenous n concentration once it encountered fluctuating n conditions cells grown under no3 n 1 0 mg l 1 had lower cyanophycin accumulation rates than cells grown under no3 n 1 2 mg l 1 fig 3 under high nitrate conditions no3 n 1 2 mg l 1 r raciborskii rapidly accumulated cyanophycin on day 1 when the uptake rate of nano3 was highest in contrast under low nitrate conditions no3 n 1 0 mg l 1 a switch from atmospheric n to nh4 caused long lag times in cyanophycin accumulation fig 3a this is because cells have to produce enzymes first to allow them fix n dixon and kahn 2004 this finding supports our speculation there does exist a n threshold in natural waters determining whether cyanophycin is accumulated or degraded although this natural threshold was lower than that of experimental study due to the complexity of natural waters when the ambient n concentration was relatively high no3 n 0 45 mg l 1 cyanophycin was synthesized faster than it was degraded leading to cyanophycin accumulation while the available n concentration became lower than 0 45 mg l 1 the n used for cyanophycin synthesis was derived from fixed n leading to a long lag in cyanophycin synthesis thus cyanophycin degradation was faster than its synthesis resulting in decreased cyanophycin content based on these findings we propose that if the ambient n concentration is high enough and fluctuates severely then r raciborskii will prioritize cyanophycin accumulation to store n by taking up ambient n when the ambient n concentration becomes low r raciborskii will first release the n from recently synthesized cyanophycin to alleviate the n deficient conditions thereby minimizing the need for energy intensive n2 fixation 4 3 n stored in cyanophycin accumulated under n fluctuating and high n conditions facilitates the persistent dominance and blooms of r raciborskii as with many other aquatic ecosystems our studied reservoir showed fluctuations in tn throughout the year the tn was highest in spring to early summer and declined to low levels as summer progressed fig 4c it is likely that in summer the higher temperatures promoted r raciborskii blooms and their demands for inorganic n depleted the inorganic n to n limited conditions schindler et al 2008 however the long duration of the high biomass of r raciborskii from early summer to fall fig 4b must be supported by sufficient n previous studies have also revealed that the rates of n2 fixation across most freshwater systems are insufficient to alleviate n limitation within the ecosystem paerl et al 2016 scott and mccarthy 2010 shatwell and köhler 2019 xu et al 2021 another study showed that n2 fixation did not confer a competitive advantage upon r raciborskii under n limiting conditions and provided little n to support relatively low growth willis et al 2016 consistent with that finding we observed few heterocysts 1 of total r raciborskii cells in our reservoir during the yearlong survey meanwhile the monthly cell quotas μg chl a per μg tp were greater than 0 3 fig s8 indicating that our studied reservoir was characterized as p limitation throughout the year maberly et al 2020 p limitation constrains the synthesis of atp and related enzymes for n2 fixation and or heterocysts formation stewart and alexander 1971 yema et al 2016 in addition we isolated two strains from this reservoir and found that under n depleted conditions these two strains produced a low proportion of heterocysts fig s9 heterocysts are specialized cells to fix n flores and herrero 2010 and so the presence of few heterocysts is indicative of rather low inputs of fixed n also r raciborskii is not a surface bloom former but rather is distributed throughout the water column where light energy limitation may constrain the ability to fix n2 furthermore internal nh4 n regenerated from sediments was reported to help sustain cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu xu et al 2021 unlike shallow lake however the zh reservoir we studied has a maximum depth of 12 m the depth makes the hypolimnion seasonally undisturbed by hydrodynamic actions with only the epilimnion staying active qin et al 2020 thus we suggest that regenerated nh4 n may not meet the n demand for summer fall r raciborskii dominated blooms in our studied system these findings and those of previous reports illustrate that another n source must be supporting the persistent dominance and blooms of r raciborskii in n deficient summer waters just as analogous to polyp this effective p storage allows cyanobacteria to take up more p than is required in p sufficient conditions so that cells can continue to grow later under p deficient conditions willis et al 2017 similarly we found that under n sufficient condition in spring the cyanophycin content in r raciborskii was relatively higher thus we propose that r raciborskii also assimilated more n than that was required for cell growth under n sufficient conditions in spring as for the function of this stored n the rationale may be similar to that of polyp which extends the duration in which r raciborskii can sustain growth under p deficiency xiao et al 2020 the polyp quota generally decreased and supported high primary productivity in the p deficient season in lake ontario li et al 2019 there are two main n storages cyanophycin and phycobilisomes in cyanobacteria compared to cyanophycin phycobilisomes has a dual role in n storage and photosynthesis forchhammer and schwarz 2019 the degradation of phycobilisomes changes the water color from blue green to yellow and appear chlorotic allen et al 1980 simon 1971 during our observation the water color was basically unchanged remaining blue green the year round we thus suggest that cyanophycin not phycobilisomes was used as the main internal n storage for the diazotrophic r raciborskii li et al 2001 we found that the cyanophycin dynamics were diametrically opposite to the population dynamics of r raciborskii in the zh reservoir fig 4b and 4d integrating our findings and the previous reports we develop a potential scenario for the function of cyanophycin in the high n no3 n 0 45 mg l 1 season r raciborskii preferentially activates cyanophycin accumulation when the no3 n concentration declines 0 45 mg l 1 and it prioritizes cyanophycin degradation releasing internal n to alleviate the cells from n deficiency especially under light energy limited conditions i e in subsurface populations this flexible n storage and rapid release capability likely obviates the need for the energy intensive n2 fixation allowing r raciborskii to proliferate and sustain its dominance during n deficient seasons although the threshold of n concentration might be approximate it provides some insights into the mechanism by which r raciborskii can proliferate under n deficient conditions we therefore suggest that as nutrient storage molecules polyp and cyanophycin may jointly facilitate the dominance of cyanobacteria in environments with fluctuating nutrient availability these mechanisms allow bloom forming cyanobacteria to avoid nutrient limitation 5 conclusion our study verified the presence of cyanophycin associated genes and granules in r raciborskii our experimental strain qdh7 of the species always commenced to accumulate cyanophycin under simulated fluctuating n conditions we suggested that there is a no3 n threshold 0 45 mg l 1 determining whether cyanophycin is accumulated or degraded in natural waters the cyanophycin content was closely associated with the population dynamics of r raciborskii in a large tropical reservoir zh reservoir southern china indicating that n released from stored n in the form of cyanophycin rather than fixed n supported the proliferation of r raciborskii under n deficient summer conditions our study demonstrated the role of stored n in cyanobacterial dominance and bloom formation due to this highly adaptive strategy in a n2 fixing cyanobacterial species mitigating its bloom will be more difficult than previously assumed credit authorship contribution statement

16213,phosphate addition is commonly applied as an effective method to remediate lead contaminated sites via formation of low solubility lead phosphate solids however subsequent transport of the lead phosphate particles may impact the effectiveness of this remediation strategy hence this study investigates the mechanisms involved in the aggregation of lead phosphate particles and their deposition in sand columns as a function of typical water chemistry parameters clean bed filtration theory was evaluated to predict the particle deposition behavior using derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory to estimate particle substrate interactions the observed particle deposition was not predictable from the primary energy barrier in clean bed filtration models even in simple monovalent background electrolyte nano3 because weak deposition in a secondary energy minimum prevailed even at low ionic strength and ripening occurred at ionic strengths of 12 5 mm or higher for aged aggregated suspensions straining also occurred at 12 5 mm or higher aggregation and deposition were further enhanced at low total p pb ratios i e p pb 1 and in the presence of divalent cations such as ca2 0 2 mm which resulted in less negative particle surface potentials and weaker electrostatic repulsion forces however the presence of 5 mg c l of humic acid induced strong steric or electrosteric repulsion which hindered particle aggregation and deposition even in the presence of ca2 this study demonstrates the importance of myriad mechanisms in lead phosphate deposition and provides useful

mobility in soil was highlighted as a research need in a critical review scheckel et al 2013 lead phosphate particle mobility is also of great importance in drinking water treatment for example lead phosphate particles can block activated carbon point of use filters lytle et al 2020 pan et al 2021 purchase et al 2021 therefore further investigation is needed to determine lead phosphate particle mobility in porous media like other nanoparticles and colloids the aggregation state of the lead phosphate particles as well as interactions among the particles aqueous species and the solid matrix can affect their transport in porous media the effects of water chemistry on the formation of lead phosphate particles have been investigated in a few studies lang and kaupenjohann 2003 wang et al 2013 mainly focusing on particle size and phase for example cl and f substitution for oh of lead phosphates altered particle size and morphology wang et al 2013 the presence of natural organic matter nom reduced the size of chloropyromorphite and enhanced their mobility in sand columns lang and kaupenjohann 2003 our previous work also investigated effects of aqueous parameters on lead phosphate particle aggregation in water supply systems zhao et al 2018 and deposition in activated carbon point of use filters pan et al 2021 however the effects of these parameters on the deposition behavior of lead phosphate particles in soil or sand media more representative of lead remediation in natural environments have not been systematically studied the water chemistry including ph ionic strength is and presence of cations is known to influence the aggregation and deposition of particles by modifying the surface charge or screening charges on the particles and collectors adsorption of nom or polymers can further block deposition sites or induce either bridging or steric repulsion between the particles and collectors legg et al 2014 li et al 2014 liao et al 2017 liu et al 2012 tosco et al 2012 wang et al 2014 the aggregation and deposition behavior of engineered nanoparticles 1 to 100 nm in three external dimensions has been extensively investigated typically starting with one type of nanoparticle and spiking it into different matrices for the attachment experiments in contrast studies are less common on colloids 1 to 1000 nm including particulate lead that have naturally formed i e nucleated precipitated under a range of potential remediation conditions and background water chemistries butkus et al found that dissolved phosphate amendment substantially reduced mobility of both dissolved and particulate lead pbo in column experiments butkus and johnson 2011 they also predicted attachment of lead containing particles pbo and pb3 co3 2oh2 in porous media using derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory however predicting the transport of other particulate lead especially lead phosphate remained to be explored field scale studies on lead phosphate remediation have typically focused on affirming the formation of lead phosphate species but did not fully characterize the size of particles formed or the potential for particulate lead transport across a range of treatment conditions gong et al 2018 scheckel et al 2013 to parameterize transport models the hamaker constant of the lead phosphate particles is needed which has not been reported elsewhere mechanistic studies are needed that identify the relevant attachment interactions involved in the particle deposition and assess whether standard clean bed filtration and dlvo theories are applicable to predict lead phosphate transport across a variety of conditions the objectives of this study are two fold 1 to investigate the effect of various aqueous parameters is p pb ratios divalent cations ca2 and humic acid ha on the formation aggregation and deposition of lead phosphate particles in porous media and 2 evaluate the suitability of dlvo and clean bed filtration theories to predict the empirical column deposition behavior of lead phosphate particles given the particle collector properties and lead phosphate homoaggregation behavior dynamic light scattering dls was employed to evaluate the homoaggregation of lead phosphate particles and determine their hamaker constant then sand column deposition experiments were conducted in the different water chemistries to monitor lead breakthrough and retention the breakthrough and retention profiles as well as empirical attachment efficiencies were compared to predictions from dlvo theory for clean bed filtration to better identify the mechanisms involved in lead phosphate removal the new knowledge acquired here can be useful to optimize lead immobilization strategies in soil and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1

phosphate particles described in section 2 4 1 ml of freshly prepared suspension was added to a cuvette and particle size was measured after 15 min and 21 h triplicate sets of measurements were performed on three separately prepared samples the zeta potentials of sand collectors prepared for the deposition experiments section 2 3 were also measured in the various background solutions i e

experiments because homoaggregation experiments on the lead phosphate particles demonstrated aggregation over 1 h at higher is 12 5 mm both fresh and aged suspensions were compared in column

for irreversible attachment with or without ripening details on the model equations and fitted parameters are provided in the si and table s2 for samples showing relatively high concentrations of lead in the 0 1 μm fraction in the column effluent the presence of dissolved rather than nanoparticulate lead was quantified by filtering triplicate samples through a 3 kda amicon ultra 15 centrifugal ultrafiltration device milliporesigma burlington ma acidifying the filtrate in 2 nitric acid and quantifying the lead by faas all filter units were pre rinsed by centrifuging with 15 ml of deionized water prior to filtering the sample and filter loss for a dissolved pb no3 2 control sample was determined to be negligible to quantify pb retention within the column after the deposition experiments liquid residual was drained from the column inlet by manually shaking to dislodge the liquid and the liquid residual was digested in 2 hno3 matrix overnight the volume of liquid residual collected in each experiment was recorded for mass balance calculations then the sand was extruded and divided into 10 sections along the column length the mass of each section was measured and recorded then each section was digested with 5 ml of 2 nitric acid overnight finally the residual sand after extrusion was rinsed off the sides of the column walls with 5 ml of 2 hno3 and allowed to soak overnight for inclusion in mass balance calculations for total lead recovery the lead recovered from the sectioned sand liquid residual and hno3 soak after column sectioning are denoted as sand residual and soak respectively 2 5 dlvo modeling dlvo theory was applied to evaluate the critical coagulation concentration ccc data to determine hamaker constants as well as to predict the critical deposition concentraiton cdc assuming clean bed deposition particle collector interactions for the dlvo modeling the zeta potentials of the particles were measured at all is used in the aggregation and deposition experiments and at higher is up to 500 mm the zeta potentials of colloidal particles from the ottawa sand were also measured the dlvo predictions of the cdc were compared against the experimental results to help distinguish clean bed attachment from ripening and straining phenomena as described in section 2 4 and the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 behavior of lead phosphate particles in monovalent electrolyte nano3 3 1 1 homoaggregation experiments to determine aggregation rates the critical coagulation concentration ccc and hamaker constant of lead phosphate the homoaggregation behavior of the lead phosphate particles was measured across a wide range of is 2 mm to 200 mm by adding nano3 si fig s2a the attachment efficiency α was plotted as a function of is si fig s2b to estimate the ccc as 69 4 mm interestingly the zeta potential of the precipitates was similar across the range of is up to the ccc which is atypical of charge screening that would be predicted by gouy chapman theory for particles with constant surface charge the results suggest a higher surface charge develops e g by phosphate adsorption or incorporation at higher is the measured zeta potentials at each is si fig s3 were used to parameterize the dlvo model si eqs s3 s6 and compute interaction energy profiles the interaction energy profile represents the total energy of interaction v t between two surfaces e g particle particle at different separation distances h with a positive value indicative of a repulsive barrier that must be overcome for the particles to approach and attach at the ccc there should be no energy barrier to attachment i e v t 0 across all h given this condition and the cccs from triplicated homoaggregation experiments 66 68 and 73 mm the hamaker constant of the lead phosphate particles in water was estimated by plotting dlvo profiles at several is and identifying the hamaker constant value that results in v t h 0 at all h si fig s4 which was 3 70 0 11 10 20 j it is noted that some uncertainty exists in this analysis as a secondary energy minimum is observed in the dlvo profiles in which particles could agglomerate if this process is also considered the estimated hamaker constant would be lower however the estimated value of 3 70 0 11 10 20 j is of a reasonable order of magnitude relative to hamaker constants reported for other inorganic materials bergström 1997 for instance the hamaker constants of unsubstituted hydroxyapatite calcite and lead sulfide have been reported to be 1 3 1 2 10 20 j vandiver et al 2006 8 7 10 20 j liu et al 2018 and 5 0 10 20 j bergström 1997 respectively additional homoaggregation studies were conducted to monitor aggregation over a narrower range of is 5 10 12 5 15 and 20 mm across which the column experiments showed a significant change in particle breakthrough for these is aggregation was monitored over 60 min as a relevant timeframe for the column deposition studies because slow aggregation was observed in this is range fig 1 column experiments were run with both fresh suspensions prepared immediately before introduction to the column and aged suspensions prepared 21 h before introduction to the column to investigate the influence of the aggregation state the particle size was hence measured after 15 min approximately the time for particle breakthrough in column experiments for the fresh suspensions and after 21 h aging of the suspension measurements were performed on triplicate samples with five measurements per sample all 15 measurements are shown in fig 2 b increasing aggregation was apparent with increasing is with a significant proportion of large agglomerates observed at 12 5 mm is and higher after 21 h the presence of large 1 μm agglomerates suggested by the dls results was supported in filtration experiments where the quantity of lead passing a 1 μm filter generally decreased with higher is fig 2c 3 1 2 freshly prepared lead phosphate particles set i fresh show ripening in column deposition experiments with monovalent electrolyte nano3 column experiments were performed at is 5 to 20 mm across which nearly complete to nearly zero breakthrough was observed the column effluents were measured for total lead unfiltered fig 3 and 0 1 μm lead si fig s6a with 0 1 μm lead computed by difference si fig s6c the 0 1 μm lead was generally low except at the lowest is where small unaggregated nanoparticles may be able to pass through the filter ultrafiltration experiments affirmed negligible dissolved 3 kda lead in these samples hence results are discussed for the total lead breakthrough while the breakthrough profiles of 0 1 μm show largely the same trends for fresh suspensions under low is 5 and 10 mm lead was detectable in the effluent from the first pv and increased to a high plateau of total lead c c 0 0 95 and 1 00 respectively during phase i fig 3a after switching to lead free background solution starting from pv 10 the concentration of lead in the effluent rapidly declined suggesting minimal detachment of any previously deposited lead the retention profiles after sectioning the column also showed minimal deposition in the column si figs s7a and 3c the mass balance recoveries summing all eluted and retained fractions were 90 or higher si fig s5 the shape of the breakthrough curves at 5 and 10 mm could be fitted well without ripening fig 3a suggesting typical clean bed filtration behavior in contrast at higher is 12 5 to 20 mm the breakthrough curves showed an initial increase in effluent lead followed by declining recovery over time with the ultimate c c 0 of total lead after 10 pvs of injection declining to 0 64 0 28 and 0 10 under 12 5 15 and 20 mm is respectively fig 3a the breakthrough profiles suggest a ripening phenomenon occurred in which particles attach to those already deposited to collectors bradford et al 2003 wang et al 2012 hence the breakthrough curves are not amenable to fitting by clean bed filtration theory to better demonstrate the impact of ripening breakthrough curves were fitted in mnms using two approaches fig 3a 1 we fitted k att in a single site irreversible linear attachment model with ripening multiplier a and exponent β using the experimental data from entire phase i portion of the breakthrough curve and 2 we fitted k att without ripening using the experimental data from only the initial portion of the breakthrough curve where ripening may not yet have been initiated to extrapolate a hypothetical breakthrough curve for clean bed attachment only a higher extent of deposition is generally observed with increasing is and ripening is also observed at 12 5 to 20 mm is the fitted parameters are provided in table s2 it is noted that when fitting three parameters simultaneously 95 confidence intervals in the fitted results are wide 70 of the best fit value for the ripening multiplier at 12 5 to 20 mm is as well as k att for 20 mm is hence the fitting results are interpreted only to affirm that ripening can explain the deviation of the breakthrough curve from clean bed attachment the retention profile in the sand column si fig s7a shows higher retention at 12 5 mm and higher is than at the lower is with nearly all retained lead found near the column inlet at 12 5 15 and 20 mm is the non exponential retention profiles are consistent with theoretical expectations when ripening occurs and other reported hyperexponential retention profiles for ripening cases dong et al 2018 interestingly at higher is particularly 15 and 20 mm the mass of lead recovered from the sectioned sand denoted sand in fig 3c was low rather most of the lead was recovered in the liquid residual denoted residual and to some extent in the hno3 soak of the column and remaining sand after column sectioning denoted soak mass balance recoveries were 90 or higher si fig s5 the high proportion of lead in the liquid residual suggests that particles were not strongly attached to the sand collectors but rather were easily transferable to liquid during the manual shaking to separate the liquid residual these results are consistent with ripening to form loose aggregates of lead phosphate particles extending into the liquid phase that are only weakly attached to the sand and hence able to be removed by shear forces the influence of ripening can be remarkable given that the measured homoaggregation was slow particularly at 12 5 and 15 mm is figs 1 and 2 to explain these results the rate of particle particle collisions including those that do not result in attachment was estimated in the homoaggregation experiments using smoluchowski and fuchs theories of colloid stability hiemenz and rajagopalan 2016 and compared to the estimated rate of particle collector collisions in the deposition experiments elimelech et al 1995 the particle particle collision rate in suspension was estimated to be 1 3 1012 m 3 s 1 on a per volume basis or 1 3 106 s 1 in the 1 ml dls sample volume whereas the particle collector collision rate was estimated to be orders of magnitude higher as 3 5 1015 m 3 s 1 or 7 0 1010 s 1 in the 20 ml column volume hence the magnified influence of ripening in the deposition studies relative to aggregation in the homoaggregation studies can be consistent with the higher rate of interaction with sand collectors and any previously deposited particles on the sand 3 1 3 aged lead phosphate particles set i aged show additional straining in column deposition experiments with monovalent electrolyte nano3 breakthrough curves from aged suspensions showed similar trends to the fresh suspensions however under higher is 10 to 20 mm the maximum lead breakthrough in the effluents for the aged suspensions were dramatically lower than those from freshly prepared suspensions the dls results fig 2b show that long term aggregation was negligible at 5 mm is particle diameter remained at 219 19 nm after 21 h similar to 251 41 nm after 15 min for the fresh suspensions on the other hand increasingly large aggregates were observed after 21 h in 10 12 5 15 and 20 mm is with several measurements showing detection of particles with sizes above the reliable upper size limit for dls analysis e g 1 μm diameter for the 10 12 5 15 and 20 mm samples the sizes measured in the first one to two measurement replicates per sample were typically larger than the following replicates suggesting the existence of both small and large aggregates with the large aggregates settling outside the measurement window over time filtration experiments affirmed a decreasing fraction of lead passing a 1 μm filter with increasing is fig 2c it is also noted that the recovery from the mass balance at 20 mm is was much lower 60 than at other is fig s5 this was likely due to accumulation of large aggregates on the inlet mesh of the column which was unable to be soaked with acid after the column deposition experiments a prior theoretical and experimental study on the deposition behavior of aggregates suggested that the α representative of the energy barrier to particle substrate attachment should not depend strongly on the particle aggregation state as the bulk of the aggregate does not closely approach the substrate surface lin and wiesner 2012 hence the significantly enhanced deposition of the aged lead phosphate suspensions compared to the freshly prepared suspensions suggests that in addition to the deposition and ripening phenomena observed in the freshly prepared suspensions an additional particle removal process must have occurred given the large aggregate sizes measured for the aged suspensions at is 10 mm fig 2b the additional removal is likely attributable to straining i e filtration in the pore throats of the packed sand column which has been reported to become relevant when the ratio of particle to collector size lies between approximately 0 002 and 0 15 bradford et al 2007 2005 in this study the average diameter of the 30 to 40 mesh ottawa sand collectors was 500 μm with 100 of particles within the specified mesh range according to the manufacturer s certificate of analysis for the specific lot used bdh 2018 therefore the range of particle sizes that can undergo straining was calculated to be 1 μm to 76 μm based on the average of the two mesh cutoffs or 0 8 μm to 89 μm considering the upper and lower size ranges consistent with the presence of large 1 μm aggregates observed after 21 h in is 12 5 mm and to a lesser but observable extent in 10 mm is fig 2b c similarly to the freshly prepared suspensions a predominance of lead in the liquid residual is apparent for the aged suspensions even at 10 mm is fig 3d also consistent with a straining mechanism whereby particles are only physically strained in the pores as opposed to strongly attached onto the sand substrate and hence able to be removed when shaking the residual water from the sand column 3 1 4 dlvo modeling suggests lead phosphate particle deposition in monovalent electrolyte is attributable to deposition in the secondary minimum standard dlvo theory accounts for van der waals and electrostatic interactions and can be used to model particle substrate interaction energy profiles given the properties of the lead phosphate particles and sand collectors the cdc can be estimated as the is where no energy barrier to deposition occurs the hamaker constant for the lead phosphate water silica system was calculated as 1 6 10 20 j using si eq s10 the dlvo model si eqs s9 and s10 was then applied to compute interaction energy profiles at various is and the cdc was estimated to be 100 to 150 mm is si fig s8 if it is assumed that the repulsive energy barrier must be fully diminished to zero for fast deposition however again a secondary energy minimum was observed in the dlvo profiles tufenkji and elimelech previously discussed the importance of this secondary energy minimum in column experiments with latex particles and the possibility for dual modes of deposition one in the secondary energy well and a second by overcoming the primary energy barrier tufenkji and elimelech 2004 for their particles at 3 mm is despite computing an exceedingly large repulsive energy barrier of nearly 5000 k b t to primary deposition a secondary energy minimum with depth of 3 6 k b t was computed at 3 mm is and estimated to result in α of 0 93 for deposition in the secondary minimum the secondary deposition is expected to become more important than primary deposition when the height of the primary energy barrier exceeds 10 k b t hahn and o melia 2004 shen et al further reported that valleys on natural sand surfaces as used here can shield deposited colloids from hydrodynamic shear forces further increasing the importance of deposition in the secondary minimum shen et al 2011 for the lead phosphate particles here the primary energy barrier is not predicted to be eliminated until the is reaches 50 mm however a secondary energy minimum of 4 k b t develops at 20 mm at particle sand separation distance of 12 nm with a primary energy barrier of 100 k b t suggesting that rapid deposition in the secondary minimum can be dominant to compare the observed experimental results to the dlvo predictions the experimental α must be estimated at each condition typically by applying colloid filtration theory as in si eq s11 with the single collector efficiency η 0 estimated from the particle substrate and flow conditions using si eq s12 as noted the final c c 0 experimentally measured after 10 pvs injections in the deposition experiments are clearly impacted by ripening however the cdc for only particle substrate interactions can be estimated if the attachment rate of the lead phosphate particles to the clean sand k att is determined and used to simulate a hypothetical plateau c c 0 for clean bed deposition without ripening this cdc should be predictable by dlvo theory as described in section 3 1 2 and the si k att was fitted using two approaches either using a model with both attachment and ripening or by fitting only the initial portion of the breakthrough curve prior to the observation of ripening effects applying the fitted k att from either approach in forward computation of the model allowed us to extrapolate plateau c c 0 values without ripening which were inputted into si eq s11 to calculate α finally α versus is was plotted to estimate an experimental cdc value note only a limited number of data from 10 to 20 mm is were available following this procedure the experimental cdc was estimated to be 20 to 30 mm si fig s9 this cdc value agrees with the is where a secondary minimum is observed in the dlvo interaction energy profile but is well below the cdc for primary deposition in summary considering only the primary energy barrier from dlvo modeling would largely overestimate the cdc however in the absence of ripening and straining lead phosphate deposition is predictable using dlvo theory when deposition in the secondary minimum is considered at high particle concentrations as evaluated here e g 20 mg l ripening and straining phenomena must also be considered by implementing these processes into the transport modeling predictions additional improvements could be made to extend the dlvo modeling for both ccc and cdc evaluation to include impacts of surface roughness zhu et al 2020 charge heterogeneity popa et al 2010 and non spherical shape gomez flores et al 2020 which can result in higher attachment than predicted it is also noted that weak deposition ripening and straining processes are sensitive to shear forces bradford et al 2007 2006 li et al 2005 perez et al 2020 and can become even more prominent at natural porewater flow velocities compared to the high velocities used here to represent phosphate injection for groundwater remediation 3 2 influence of p pb ratio divalent cations and humic acid on lead phosphate aggregation and deposition 3 2 1 lower rp pb set ii and higher ca2 set iii facilitate aggregation whereas dissolved humic acid set iv retards aggregation further experiments were conducted when reducing the p pb ratio to r p pb 1 table 1 set ii introducing divalent cations as ca2 at 0 2 or 1 mm set iii and introducing ha at 0 05 or 5 mg c l with 0 2 mm ca2 set iv for all conditions the particle size grew to over 1000 nm within 15 min except in the presence of ha at 5 mg c l which stabilized the particles 229 25 nm even after 21 h in 0 2 mm ca2 fig 2 for sets ii and iii the degree of aggregation corresponded well to loss of electrostatic stabilization as evaluated through the zeta potential measurements based on gwb calculations table s3 sets i and ii initial solutions for both p pb ratios were supersaturated with hydroxylpyromorphite si 21 2 0 1 pb3 po4 2 si 12 5 0 1 pbhpo4 si 3 4 0 2 pb oh 2 si 1 7 0 3 pbco3 si 1 5 0 3 and pb3 co3 2 oh 2 si 5 1 0 8 from raman measurements in our previous work only hydroxylpyromorphite was detected at r p pb 1 zhao et al 2018 according to the saturation indices calculated using gwb table s3 hydroxylpyromorphite had the highest saturation index among the possible lead containing minerals therefore hydroxylpyromorphite tended to precipitate first leading to a decrease in lead and phosphate ion concentrations and thereby a decrease in the saturation index of other mineral phases making them unfavorable to precipitate at low p pb ratios the particles exhibit a weak positive charge 3 1 0 2 mv likely due to decreased phosphate adsorption fig 2d the weak charge is consistent with the rapid aggregation however the proportion of dissolved 0 1 μm lead was also notably higher with lower phosphate addition 6 22 0 01 mg l for r p pb 1 compared to 0 7 0 1 mg l for r p pb 10 for set iii in the presence of 0 2 and 1 mm ca2 particles were less negatively charged 25 9 0 8 and 15 1 0 5 mv than in the absence of ca2 42 1 0 4 mv due to charge neutralization or screening it is noted that our previous work showed no apparent ca substitution zhao et al 2018 in the cases of r p pb 1 and increasing concentrations of ca2 charge heterogeneity i e patches of positive and negative charge on the particle surface could occur e g due to ca2 adsorption especially considering that ca2 enrichment was observed in our prior study on lead phosphate particles zhao et al 2018 patch charge electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged patches could also explain the more rapid homoaggregation that was observed in these cases for set iv including ha particle stability could not be explained solely by electrostatic effects in the presence of 0 2 mm ca2 and 0 05 mg c l of ha the particles were indeed less negatively charged 26 5 0 8 mv than conditions without ca2 or ha and showed more extensive aggregation for the higher concentration 5 mg c l of ha the apparent zeta potential 33 4 1 4 mv was less negative than in monovalent electrolyte solutions where aggregation was observed fig 2 because ha coatings can increase the surface roughness or form an extended layer on the particle surfaces it is possible that they can provide additional negative charge to the particles yet still produce a lower electrophoretic mobility measurement or apparent zeta potential by imparting hydrodynamic drag hence the stabilization by high ha concentrations can be attributed to steric or electrosteric repulsion from the adsorbed ha baalousha 2009 han et al 2014 huangfu et al 2013 thio et al 2011 to investigate the effect of the particle aggregation state the aged suspensions were evaluated further in column deposition experiments 3 2 2 lower rp pb set ii and higher ca2 set iii promote deposition and straining under high r p pb 10 without ca2 a relatively high maximum effluent concentration of total lead was obtained when r p pb was decreased to 1 or when increasing concentrations of ca2 were present in the background solution much lower total lead was detected in effluents fig 4 a notably slow breakthrough of the 0 1 μm fraction appears for r p pb 1 si fig s10a corresponding to the higher dissolved lead concentration measured in the original precipitated sample ultrafiltration results confirmed that the r p pb 1 sample contained 5 4 mg l 0 2 mg l of dissolved lead passing a 3 kda filter whereas r p pb 10 samples had negligible dissolved lead this dissolved portion of lead exhibits reversible sorption to the sand i e high retardation with minimal irreversible attachment i e the plateau concentration is similar to that in the injected suspension for r p pb 1 and 0 2 or 1 mm of ca2 the mass recovery of lead from the column again shows the majority of the lead is present in the liquid residual rather than the sectioned sand fig 4c d given these results and the large aggregates formed under these conditions fig 2 the high removal in the column is likely attributable to straining or perhaps attachment in a shallow secondary minimum rather than strong attachment to the sand similar to the aged suspension at 20 mm is the mass balance recovery under r p pb 1 was low 40 si fig s5 likely due to accumulation of large aggregates on the inlet mesh to the column 3 2 3 moderately high concentration of dissolved humic acid set iv inhibits deposition deposition studies were finally performed with varying ha concentrations under a condition where extensive particle removal was observed 0 2 mm ca2 the low concentration of ha 0 05 mg c l did not effectively counter the extensive aggregation or deposition observed in the presence of ca2 without ha fig 4b and most of the retained lead was recovered in the liquid residual fig 4d however the presence of 5 mg c l of ha results in a remarkably high plateau of total lead c c 0 1 0 in the column effluent fig 4b and correspondingly lead retention in the column was negligible in presence of 5 mg c l of humic acid fig 4d and si fig s11b nom is commonly reported to inhibit attachment via both electrostatic and steric repulsion zhao et al 2018 here the apparent zeta potentials of the sand and lead phosphate particles were similar or even lower in magnitude i e less negative in the combined presence of 0 2 mm ca2 and 5 mg c l of ha than under other conditions in nano3 where extensive deposition was observed but as noted in section 3 2 1 the ha coating may influence both charge and drag on the particles in the electrophoretic mobility measurements therefore the enhanced transport in the presence of ha may be attributable to either steric or electrosteric repulsion consistent with previous studies chen et al 2012 huangfu et al 2018 jiang et al 2010 thio et al 2011 given that ha can apparently inhibit all forms of deposition observed under other conditions particle substrate attachment ripening and straining the strong stabilizing effect of the ha as well as the ha concentration must be considered to predict lead phosphate transport in soils and groundwater prediction of these effects will require information on the ha layer thickness and layer density or adsorbed mass on the particles to quantify the steric forces by extended dlvo theory 4 conclusions lead phosphate particles that remain mobile after phosphate remediation can ultimately contaminate drinking water sources including groundwater and surface water therefore it is essential to investigate the transport of lead phosphate particles and identify strategies to reduce their mobility this research identified that lead phosphate transport can be challenging to predict across a range of water chemistries several mechanisms of particle removal were important even in simple monovalent electrolyte including deposition in secondary minima ripening to previously deposited particles and straining of large aggregates ripening and straining can be particularly difficult to foresee as the influence of particle particle interactions was exaggerated in the deposition studies compared to homoaggregation studies the presence of low levels of ca2 can also induce rapid aggregation and straining on the other hand a sufficiently high ha concentration can counter all forms of particle removal by steric repulsion hence characterization of the ionic strength electrolyte composition and ha concentration will all be important to predict lead phosphate transport this study also implies that the phosphate remediation strategy can be tuned to optimize lead removal notably excessive phosphate adsorption can provide electrostatic stabilization enhancing particle transport however lower phosphate concentrations may be less effective to precipitate the lead phosphate given the myriad influences of water chemistry further testing will be required e g using response surface methodology to inform guidance on whether phosphate remediation can be effective to immobilize lead across a wider range of soil and groundwater conditions bench scale and pilot scale tests are also necessary to verify deposition behaviors across a wider variety of situations including inhomogeneity in the soil or groundwater

16213,phosphate addition is commonly applied as an effective method to remediate lead contaminated sites via formation of low solubility lead phosphate solids however subsequent transport of the lead phosphate particles may impact the effectiveness of this remediation strategy hence this study investigates the mechanisms involved in the aggregation of lead phosphate particles and their deposition in sand columns as a function of typical water chemistry parameters clean bed filtration theory was evaluated to predict the particle deposition behavior using derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory to estimate particle substrate interactions the observed particle deposition was not predictable from the primary energy barrier in clean bed filtration models even in simple monovalent background electrolyte nano3 because weak deposition in a secondary energy minimum prevailed even at low ionic strength and ripening occurred at ionic strengths of 12 5 mm or higher for aged aggregated suspensions straining also occurred at 12 5 mm or higher aggregation and deposition were further enhanced at low total p pb ratios i e p pb 1 and in the presence of divalent cations such as ca2 0 2 mm which resulted in less negative particle surface potentials and weaker electrostatic repulsion forces however the presence of 5 mg c l of humic acid induced strong steric or electrosteric repulsion which hindered particle aggregation and deposition even in the presence of ca2 this study demonstrates the importance of myriad mechanisms in lead phosphate deposition and provides useful

conventional pump and treat technology for example nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi is extensively used for in situ remediation of lead contaminated groundwater fu et al 2015 su et al 2014 phosphate treatment has been proposed for remediation of uranium contaminated subsurface sediments pan et al 2016 and has also been widely adopted to immobilize lead in soil via formation of lead phosphates especially pyromorphites with even lower solubility than lead hydroxides e g hydroxylpyromorphite with reported k sp of 10 76 8 or chloropyromorphite with k sp of 10 84 4 ruby et al 1994 scheckel et al 2013 zhang and ryan 1999 in the united states regulations on lead contaminated soils include consideration of not just total lead but specifically the bioavailable lead scheckel et al 2013 by forming lead phosphate particles dissolved lead concentrations could be lowered significantly to mitigate the release of dissolved lead hettiarachchi and pierzynski 2004 and potentially the lead bioavailability in a laboratory study an integrated approach using phosphate or biochar amendment has been studied to remediate lead contaminated soil and groundwater simultaneously and both amendments were found to be highly effective in lead removal from groundwater while phosphate amended soil was more effective in lead immobilization dai et al 2018 for field soil applications addition of phosphate amendments including dissolved phosphates rock phosphate in powder or particulate form and hydroxyapatite potentially in the form of fish bones has been demonstrated gong et al 2018 scheckel et al 2013 however lead phosphate particles can potentially remain mobile in soil or groundwater and still pose a risk to water supplies hence the impact of phosphate remediation on lead mobility in soil was highlighted as a research need in a critical review scheckel et al 2013 lead phosphate particle mobility is also of great importance in drinking water treatment for example lead phosphate particles can block activated carbon point of use filters lytle et al 2020 pan et al 2021 purchase et al 2021 therefore further investigation is needed to determine lead phosphate particle mobility in porous media like other nanoparticles and colloids the aggregation state of the lead phosphate particles as well as interactions among the particles aqueous species and the solid matrix can affect their transport in porous media the effects of water chemistry on the formation of lead phosphate particles have been investigated in a few studies lang and kaupenjohann 2003 wang et al 2013 mainly focusing on particle size and phase for example cl and f substitution for oh of lead phosphates altered particle size and morphology wang et al 2013 the presence of natural organic matter nom reduced the size of chloropyromorphite and enhanced their mobility in sand columns lang and kaupenjohann 2003 our previous work also investigated effects of aqueous parameters on lead phosphate particle aggregation in water supply systems zhao et al 2018 and deposition in activated carbon point of use filters pan et al 2021 however the effects of these parameters on the deposition behavior of lead phosphate particles in soil or sand media more representative of lead remediation in natural environments have not been systematically studied the water chemistry including ph ionic strength is and presence of cations is known to influence the aggregation and deposition of particles by modifying the surface charge or screening charges on the particles and collectors adsorption of nom or polymers can further block deposition sites or induce either bridging or steric repulsion between the particles and collectors legg et al 2014 li et al 2014 liao et al 2017 liu et al 2012 tosco et al 2012 wang et al 2014 the aggregation and deposition behavior of engineered nanoparticles 1 to 100 nm in three external dimensions has been extensively investigated typically starting with one type of nanoparticle and spiking it into different matrices for the attachment experiments in contrast studies are less common on colloids 1 to 1000 nm including particulate lead that have naturally formed i e nucleated precipitated under a range of potential remediation conditions and background water chemistries butkus et al found that dissolved phosphate amendment substantially reduced mobility of both dissolved and particulate lead pbo in column experiments butkus and johnson 2011 they also predicted attachment of lead containing particles pbo and pb3 co3 2oh2 in porous media using derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory however predicting the transport of other particulate lead especially lead phosphate remained to be explored field scale studies on lead phosphate remediation have typically focused on affirming the formation of lead phosphate species but did not fully characterize the size of particles formed or the potential for particulate lead transport across a range of treatment conditions gong et al 2018 scheckel et al 2013 to parameterize transport models the hamaker constant of the lead phosphate particles is needed which has not been reported elsewhere mechanistic studies are needed that identify the relevant attachment interactions involved in the particle deposition and assess whether standard clean bed filtration and dlvo theories are applicable to predict lead phosphate transport across a variety of conditions the objectives of this study are two fold 1 to investigate the effect of various aqueous parameters is p pb ratios divalent cations ca2 and humic acid ha on the formation aggregation and deposition of lead phosphate particles in porous media and 2 evaluate the suitability of dlvo and clean bed filtration theories to predict the empirical column deposition behavior of lead phosphate particles given the particle collector properties and lead phosphate homoaggregation behavior dynamic light scattering dls was employed to evaluate the homoaggregation of lead phosphate particles and determine their hamaker constant then sand column deposition experiments were conducted in the different water chemistries to monitor lead breakthrough and retention the breakthrough and retention profiles as well as empirical attachment efficiencies were compared to predictions from dlvo theory for clean bed filtration to better identify the mechanisms involved in lead phosphate removal the new knowledge acquired here can be useful to optimize lead immobilization strategies in soil and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1

phosphate particles described in section 2 4 1 ml of freshly prepared suspension was added to a cuvette and particle size was measured after 15 min and 21 h triplicate sets of measurements were

for irreversible attachment with or without ripening details on the model equations and fitted parameters are provided in the si and table s2 for samples showing relatively high concentrations of lead in the 0 1 μm fraction in the column effluent the presence of dissolved rather than nanoparticulate lead was quantified by filtering triplicate samples through a 3 kda amicon ultra 15 centrifugal ultrafiltration device milliporesigma burlington ma acidifying the filtrate in 2 nitric acid and quantifying the lead by faas all filter units were pre rinsed by centrifuging with 15 ml of deionized water prior to filtering the sample and filter loss for a dissolved pb no3 2 control sample was determined to be negligible to quantify pb retention within the column after the deposition experiments liquid residual was drained from the column inlet by manually shaking to dislodge the liquid and the liquid residual was digested in 2 hno3 matrix overnight the volume of liquid residual collected in each experiment was recorded for mass balance calculations then the sand was extruded and divided into 10 sections along the column length the mass of each section was measured and recorded then each section was digested with 5 ml of 2 nitric acid overnight finally the residual sand after extrusion was rinsed off the sides of the column walls with 5 ml of 2 hno3 and allowed to soak overnight for inclusion in mass balance calculations for total lead recovery the lead recovered from the sectioned sand liquid residual and hno3 soak after column sectioning are denoted as sand residual and soak respectively 2 5 dlvo modeling dlvo theory was applied to evaluate the critical coagulation concentration ccc data to determine hamaker constants as well as to predict the critical deposition concentraiton cdc assuming clean bed deposition particle collector interactions for the dlvo modeling the zeta potentials of the particles were measured at all is used in the aggregation and deposition experiments and at higher is up to 500 mm the zeta potentials of colloidal particles from the ottawa sand were also measured the dlvo predictions of the cdc were compared against the experimental results to help distinguish clean bed attachment from ripening and straining phenomena as described in section 2 4 and the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 behavior of lead phosphate particles in monovalent electrolyte nano3 3 1 1 homoaggregation experiments to determine aggregation rates the critical coagulation concentration ccc and hamaker constant of lead phosphate the homoaggregation behavior of the lead phosphate particles was measured across a wide range of is 2 mm to 200 mm by adding nano3 si fig s2a the attachment efficiency α was plotted as a function of is si fig s2b to estimate the ccc as 69 4 mm interestingly the zeta potential of the precipitates was similar across the range of is up to the ccc which is atypical of charge screening that would be predicted by gouy chapman theory for particles with constant surface charge the results suggest a higher surface charge develops e g by phosphate adsorption or incorporation at higher is the measured zeta potentials at each is si fig s3 were used to parameterize the dlvo model si eqs s3 s6 and compute interaction energy profiles the interaction energy profile represents the total energy of interaction v t between two surfaces e g particle particle at different separation distances h with a positive value indicative of a repulsive barrier that must be overcome for the particles to approach and attach at the ccc there should be no energy barrier to attachment i e v t 0 across all h given this condition and the cccs from triplicated homoaggregation experiments 66 68 and 73 mm the hamaker constant of the lead phosphate particles in water was estimated by plotting dlvo profiles at several is and identifying the hamaker constant value that results in v t h 0 at all h si fig s4 which was 3 70 0 11 10 20 j it is noted that some uncertainty exists in this analysis as a secondary energy minimum is observed in the dlvo profiles in which particles could agglomerate if this process is also considered the estimated hamaker constant would be lower however the estimated value of 3 70 0 11 10 20 j is of a reasonable order of magnitude relative to hamaker constants reported for other inorganic materials bergström 1997 for instance the hamaker constants of unsubstituted hydroxyapatite calcite and lead sulfide have been reported to be 1 3 1 2 10 20 j vandiver et al 2006 8 7 10 20 j liu et al 2018 and 5 0 10 20 j bergström 1997 respectively additional homoaggregation studies were conducted to monitor aggregation over a narrower range of is 5 10 12 5 15 and 20 mm across which the column experiments showed a significant change in particle breakthrough for these is aggregation was monitored over 60 min as a relevant timeframe for the column deposition studies because slow aggregation was observed in this is range fig 1 column experiments were run with both fresh suspensions prepared immediately before introduction to the column and aged suspensions prepared 21 h before introduction to the column to investigate the influence of the aggregation state the particle size was hence measured after 15 min approximately the time for particle breakthrough in column experiments for the fresh suspensions and after 21 h aging of the suspension measurements were performed on triplicate samples with five measurements per sample all 15 measurements are shown in fig 2 b increasing aggregation was apparent with increasing is with a significant proportion of large agglomerates observed at 12 5 mm is and higher after 21 h the presence of large 1 μm agglomerates suggested by the dls results was supported in filtration experiments where the quantity of lead passing a 1 μm filter generally decreased with higher is fig 2c 3 1 2 freshly prepared lead phosphate particles set i fresh show ripening in column deposition experiments with monovalent electrolyte nano3 column experiments were performed at is 5 to 20 mm across which nearly complete to nearly zero breakthrough was observed the column effluents were measured for total lead unfiltered fig 3 and 0 1 μm lead si fig s6a with 0 1 μm lead computed by difference si fig s6c the 0 1 μm lead was generally low except at the lowest is where small unaggregated nanoparticles may be able to pass through the filter ultrafiltration experiments affirmed negligible dissolved 3 kda lead in these samples hence results are discussed for the total lead breakthrough while the breakthrough profiles of 0 1 μm show largely the same trends for fresh suspensions under low is 5 and 10 mm lead was detectable in the effluent from the first pv and increased to a high plateau of total lead c c 0 0 95 and 1 00 respectively during phase i fig 3a after switching to lead free background solution starting from pv 10 the concentration of lead in the effluent rapidly declined suggesting minimal detachment of any previously deposited lead the retention profiles after sectioning the column also showed minimal deposition in the column si figs s7a and 3c the mass balance recoveries summing all eluted and retained fractions were 90 or higher si fig s5 the shape of the breakthrough curves at 5 and 10 mm could be fitted well without ripening fig 3a suggesting typical clean bed filtration behavior in contrast at higher is 12 5 to 20 mm the breakthrough curves showed an initial increase in effluent lead followed by declining recovery over time with the ultimate c c 0 of total lead after 10 pvs of injection declining to 0 64 0 28 and 0 10 under 12 5 15 and 20 mm is respectively fig 3a the breakthrough profiles suggest a ripening phenomenon occurred in which particles attach to those already deposited to collectors bradford et al 2003 wang et al 2012 hence the breakthrough curves are not amenable to fitting by clean bed filtration theory to better demonstrate the impact of ripening breakthrough curves were fitted in mnms using two approaches fig 3a 1 we fitted k att in a single site irreversible linear attachment model with ripening multiplier a and exponent β using the experimental data from entire phase i portion of the breakthrough curve and 2 we fitted k att without ripening using the experimental data from only the initial portion of the breakthrough curve where ripening may not yet have been initiated to extrapolate a hypothetical breakthrough curve for clean bed attachment only a higher extent of deposition is generally observed with increasing is and ripening is also observed at 12 5 to 20 mm is the fitted parameters are provided in table s2 it is noted that when fitting three parameters simultaneously 95 confidence intervals in the fitted results are wide 70 of the best fit value for the ripening multiplier at 12 5 to 20 mm is as well as k att for 20 mm is hence the fitting results are interpreted only to affirm that ripening can explain the deviation of the breakthrough curve from clean bed attachment the retention profile in the sand column si fig s7a shows higher retention at 12 5 mm and higher is than at the lower is with nearly all retained lead found near the column inlet at 12 5 15 and 20 mm is the non exponential retention profiles are consistent with theoretical expectations when ripening occurs and other reported hyperexponential retention profiles for ripening cases dong et al 2018 interestingly at higher is particularly 15 and 20 mm the mass of lead recovered from the sectioned sand denoted sand in fig 3c was low rather most of the lead was recovered in the liquid residual denoted residual and to some extent in the hno3 soak of the column and remaining sand after column sectioning denoted soak mass balance recoveries were 90 or higher si fig s5 the high proportion of lead in the liquid residual suggests that particles were not strongly attached to the sand collectors but rather were easily transferable to liquid during the manual shaking to separate the liquid residual these results are consistent with ripening to form loose aggregates of lead phosphate particles extending into the liquid phase that are only weakly attached to the sand and hence able to be removed by shear forces the influence of ripening can be remarkable given that the measured homoaggregation was slow particularly at 12 5 and 15 mm is figs 1 and 2 to explain these results the rate of particle particle collisions including those that do not result in attachment was estimated in the homoaggregation experiments using smoluchowski and fuchs theories of colloid stability hiemenz and rajagopalan 2016 and compared to the estimated rate of particle collector collisions in the deposition experiments elimelech et al 1995 the particle particle collision rate in suspension was estimated to be 1 3 1012 m 3 s 1 on a per volume basis or 1 3 106 s 1 in the 1 ml dls sample volume whereas the particle collector collision rate was estimated to be orders of magnitude higher as 3 5 1015 m 3 s 1 or 7 0 1010 s 1 in the 20 ml column volume hence the magnified influence of ripening in the deposition studies relative to aggregation in the homoaggregation studies can be consistent with the higher rate of interaction with sand collectors and any previously deposited particles on the sand 3 1 3 aged lead phosphate particles set i aged show additional straining in column deposition experiments with monovalent electrolyte nano3 breakthrough curves from aged suspensions showed similar trends to the fresh suspensions however under higher is 10 to 20 mm the maximum lead breakthrough in the effluents for the aged suspensions were dramatically lower than those from freshly prepared suspensions the dls results fig 2b show that long term aggregation was negligible at 5 mm is particle diameter remained at 219 19 nm after 21 h similar to 251 41 nm after 15 min for the fresh suspensions on the other hand increasingly large aggregates were observed after 21 h in 10 12 5 15 and 20 mm is with several measurements showing detection of particles with sizes above the reliable upper size limit for dls analysis e g 1 μm diameter for the 10 12 5 15 and 20 mm samples the sizes measured in the first one to two measurement replicates per sample were typically larger than the following replicates suggesting the existence of both small and large aggregates with the large aggregates settling outside the measurement window over time filtration experiments affirmed a decreasing fraction of lead passing a 1 μm filter with increasing is fig 2c it is also noted that the recovery from the mass balance at 20 mm is was much lower 60 than at other is fig s5 this was likely due to accumulation of large aggregates on the inlet mesh of the column which was unable to be soaked with acid after the column deposition experiments a prior theoretical and experimental study on the deposition behavior of aggregates suggested that the α representative of the energy barrier to particle substrate attachment should not depend strongly on the particle aggregation state as the bulk of the aggregate does not closely approach the substrate surface lin and wiesner 2012 hence the significantly enhanced deposition of the aged lead phosphate suspensions compared to the freshly prepared suspensions suggests that in addition to the deposition and ripening phenomena observed in the freshly prepared suspensions an additional particle removal process must have occurred given the large aggregate sizes measured for the aged suspensions at is 10 mm fig 2b the additional removal is likely attributable to straining i e filtration in the pore throats of the packed sand column which has been reported to become relevant when the ratio of particle to collector size lies between approximately 0 002 and 0 15 bradford et al 2007 2005 in this study the average diameter of the 30 to 40 mesh ottawa sand collectors was 500 μm with 100 of particles within the specified mesh range according to the manufacturer s certificate of analysis for the specific lot used bdh 2018 therefore the range of particle sizes that can undergo straining was calculated to be 1 μm to 76 μm based on the average of the two mesh cutoffs or 0 8 μm to 89 μm considering the upper and lower size ranges consistent with the presence of large 1 μm aggregates observed after 21 h in is 12 5 mm and to a lesser but observable extent in 10 mm is fig 2b c similarly to the freshly prepared suspensions a predominance of lead in the liquid residual is apparent for the aged suspensions even at 10 mm is fig 3d also consistent with a straining mechanism whereby particles are only physically strained in the pores as opposed to strongly attached onto the sand substrate and hence able to be removed when shaking the residual water from the sand column 3 1 4 dlvo modeling suggests lead phosphate particle deposition in monovalent electrolyte is attributable to deposition in the secondary minimum standard dlvo theory accounts for van der waals and electrostatic interactions and can be used to model particle substrate interaction energy profiles given the properties of the lead phosphate particles and sand collectors the cdc can be estimated as the is where no energy barrier to deposition occurs the hamaker constant for the lead phosphate water silica system was calculated as 1 6 10 20 j using si eq s10 the dlvo model si eqs s9 and s10 was then applied to compute interaction energy profiles at various is and the cdc was estimated to be 100 to 150 mm is si fig s8 if it is assumed that the repulsive energy barrier must be fully diminished to zero for fast deposition however again a secondary energy minimum was observed in the dlvo profiles tufenkji and elimelech previously discussed the importance of this secondary energy minimum in column experiments with latex particles and the possibility for dual modes of deposition one in the secondary energy well and a second by overcoming the primary energy barrier tufenkji and elimelech 2004 for their particles at 3 mm is despite computing an exceedingly large repulsive energy barrier of nearly 5000 k b t to primary deposition a secondary energy minimum with depth of 3 6 k b t was computed at 3 mm is and estimated to result in α of 0 93 for deposition in the secondary minimum the secondary deposition is expected to become more important than primary deposition when the height of the primary energy barrier exceeds 10 k b t hahn and o melia 2004 shen et al further reported that valleys on natural sand surfaces as used here can shield deposited colloids from hydrodynamic shear forces further increasing the importance of deposition in the secondary minimum shen et al 2011 for the lead phosphate particles here the primary energy barrier is not predicted to be eliminated until the is reaches 50 mm however a secondary energy minimum of 4 k b t develops at 20 mm at particle sand separation distance of 12 nm with a primary energy barrier of 100 k b t suggesting that rapid deposition in the secondary minimum can be dominant to compare the observed experimental results to the dlvo predictions the experimental α must be estimated at each condition typically by applying colloid filtration theory as in si eq s11 with the single collector efficiency η 0 estimated from the particle substrate and flow conditions using si eq s12 as noted the final c c 0 experimentally measured after 10 pvs injections in the deposition experiments are clearly impacted by ripening however the cdc for only particle substrate interactions can be estimated if the attachment rate of the lead phosphate particles to the clean sand k att is determined and used to simulate a hypothetical plateau c c 0 for clean bed deposition without ripening this cdc should be predictable by dlvo theory as described in section 3 1 2 and the si k att was fitted using two approaches either using a model with both attachment and ripening or by fitting only the initial portion of the breakthrough curve prior to the observation of ripening effects applying the fitted k att from either approach in forward computation of the model allowed us to extrapolate plateau c c 0 values without ripening which were inputted into si eq s11 to calculate α finally α versus is was plotted to estimate an experimental cdc value note only a limited number of data from 10 to 20 mm is were available following this procedure the experimental cdc was estimated to be 20 to 30 mm si fig s9 this cdc value agrees with the is where a secondary minimum is observed in the dlvo interaction energy profile but is well below the cdc for primary deposition in summary considering only the primary energy barrier from dlvo modeling would largely overestimate the cdc however in the absence of ripening and straining lead phosphate deposition is predictable using dlvo theory when deposition in the secondary minimum is considered at high particle concentrations as evaluated here e g 20 mg l ripening and straining phenomena must also be considered by implementing these processes into the transport modeling predictions additional improvements could be made to extend the dlvo modeling for both ccc and cdc evaluation to include impacts of surface roughness zhu et al 2020 charge heterogeneity popa et al 2010 and non spherical shape gomez flores et al 2020 which can result in higher attachment than predicted it is also noted that weak deposition ripening and straining processes are sensitive to shear forces bradford et al 2007 2006 li et al 2005 perez et al 2020 and can become even more prominent at natural porewater flow velocities compared to the high velocities used here to represent phosphate injection for groundwater remediation 3 2 influence of p pb ratio divalent cations and humic acid on lead phosphate aggregation and deposition 3 2 1 lower rp pb set ii and higher ca2 set iii facilitate aggregation whereas dissolved humic acid set iv retards aggregation further experiments were conducted when reducing the p pb ratio to r p pb 1 table 1 set ii introducing divalent cations as ca2 at 0 2 or 1 mm set iii and introducing ha at 0 05 or 5 mg c l with 0 2 mm ca2 set iv for all conditions the particle size grew to over 1000 nm within 15 min except in the presence of ha at 5 mg c l which stabilized the particles 229 25 nm even after 21 h in 0 2 mm ca2 fig 2 for sets ii and iii the degree of aggregation corresponded well to loss of electrostatic stabilization as evaluated through the zeta potential measurements based on gwb calculations table s3 sets i and ii initial solutions for both p pb ratios were supersaturated with hydroxylpyromorphite si 21 2 0 1 pb3 po4 2 si 12 5 0 1 pbhpo4 si 3 4 0 2 pb oh 2 si 1 7 0 3 pbco3 si 1 5 0 3 and pb3 co3 2 oh 2 si 5 1 0 8 from raman measurements in our previous work only hydroxylpyromorphite was detected at r p pb 1 zhao et al 2018 according to the saturation indices calculated using gwb table s3 hydroxylpyromorphite had the highest saturation index among the possible lead containing minerals therefore hydroxylpyromorphite tended to precipitate first leading to a decrease in lead and phosphate ion concentrations and thereby a decrease in the saturation index of other mineral phases making them unfavorable to precipitate at low p pb ratios the particles exhibit a weak positive charge 3 1 0 2 mv likely due to decreased phosphate adsorption fig 2d the weak charge is consistent with the rapid aggregation however the proportion of dissolved 0 1 μm lead was also notably higher with lower phosphate addition 6 22 0 01 mg l for r p pb 1 compared to 0 7 0 1 mg l for r p pb 10 for set iii in the presence of 0 2 and 1 mm ca2 particles were less negatively charged 25 9 0 8 and 15 1 0 5 mv than in the absence of ca2 42 1 0 4 mv due to charge neutralization or screening it is noted that our previous work showed no apparent ca substitution zhao et al 2018 in the cases of r p pb 1 and increasing concentrations of ca2 charge heterogeneity i e patches of positive and negative charge on the particle surface could occur e g due to ca2 adsorption especially considering that ca2 enrichment was observed in our prior study on lead phosphate particles zhao et al 2018 patch charge electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged patches could also explain the more rapid homoaggregation that was observed in these cases for set iv including ha particle stability could not be explained solely by electrostatic effects in the presence of 0 2 mm ca2 and 0 05 mg c l of ha the particles were indeed less negatively charged 26 5 0 8 mv than conditions without ca2 or ha and showed more extensive aggregation for the higher concentration 5 mg c l of ha the apparent zeta potential 33 4 1 4 mv was less negative than in monovalent electrolyte solutions where aggregation was observed fig 2 because ha coatings can increase the surface roughness or form an extended layer on the particle surfaces it is possible that they can provide additional negative charge to the particles yet still produce a lower electrophoretic mobility measurement or apparent zeta potential by imparting hydrodynamic drag hence the stabilization by high ha concentrations can be attributed to steric or electrosteric repulsion from the adsorbed ha baalousha 2009 han et al 2014 huangfu et al 2013 thio et al 2011 to investigate the effect of the particle aggregation state the aged suspensions were evaluated further in column deposition experiments 3 2 2 lower rp pb set ii and higher ca2 set iii promote deposition and straining under high r p pb 10 without ca2 a relatively high maximum effluent concentration of total lead was obtained when r p pb was decreased to 1 or when increasing concentrations of ca2 were present in the background solution much lower total lead was detected in effluents fig 4 a notably slow breakthrough of the 0 1 μm fraction appears for r p pb 1 si fig s10a corresponding to the higher dissolved lead concentration measured in the original precipitated sample ultrafiltration results confirmed that the r p pb 1 sample contained 5 4 mg l 0 2 mg l of dissolved lead passing a 3 kda filter whereas r p pb 10 samples had negligible dissolved lead this dissolved portion of lead exhibits reversible sorption to the sand i e high retardation with minimal irreversible attachment i e the plateau concentration is similar to that in the injected suspension for r p pb 1 and 0 2 or 1 mm of ca2 the mass recovery of lead from the column again shows the majority of the lead is present in the liquid residual rather than the sectioned sand fig 4c d given these results and the large aggregates formed under these conditions fig 2 the high removal in the column is likely attributable to straining or perhaps attachment in a shallow secondary minimum rather than strong attachment to the sand similar to the aged suspension at 20 mm is the mass balance recovery under r p pb 1 was low 40 si fig s5 likely due to accumulation of large aggregates on the inlet mesh to the column 3 2 3 moderately high concentration of dissolved humic acid set iv inhibits deposition deposition studies were finally performed with varying ha concentrations under a condition where extensive particle removal was observed 0 2 mm ca2 the low concentration of ha 0 05 mg c l did not effectively counter the extensive aggregation or deposition observed in the presence of ca2 without ha fig 4b and most of the retained lead was recovered in the liquid residual fig 4d however the presence of 5 mg c l of ha results in a remarkably high plateau of total lead c c 0 1 0 in the column effluent fig 4b and correspondingly lead retention in the column was negligible in presence of 5 mg c l of humic acid fig 4d and si fig s11b nom is commonly reported to inhibit attachment via both electrostatic and steric repulsion zhao et al 2018 here the apparent zeta potentials of the sand and lead phosphate particles were similar or even lower in magnitude i e less negative in the combined presence of 0 2 mm ca2 and 5 mg c l of ha than under other conditions in nano3 where extensive deposition was observed but as noted in section 3 2 1 the ha coating may influence both charge and drag on the particles in the electrophoretic mobility measurements therefore the enhanced transport in the presence of ha may be attributable to either steric or electrosteric repulsion consistent with previous studies chen et al 2012 huangfu et al 2018 jiang et al 2010 thio et al 2011 given that ha can apparently inhibit all forms of deposition observed under other conditions particle substrate attachment ripening and straining the strong stabilizing effect of the ha as well as the ha concentration must be considered to predict lead phosphate transport in soils and groundwater prediction of these effects will require information on the ha layer thickness and layer density or adsorbed mass on the particles to quantify the steric forces by extended dlvo theory 4 conclusions lead phosphate particles that remain mobile after phosphate remediation can ultimately contaminate drinking water sources including groundwater and surface water therefore it is essential to investigate the transport of lead phosphate particles and identify strategies to reduce their mobility this research identified that lead phosphate transport can be challenging to predict across a range of water chemistries several mechanisms of particle removal were important even in simple monovalent electrolyte including deposition in secondary minima ripening to previously deposited particles and straining of large aggregates ripening and straining can be particularly difficult to foresee as the influence of particle particle interactions was exaggerated in the deposition studies compared to homoaggregation studies the presence of low levels of ca2 can also induce rapid aggregation and straining on the other hand a sufficiently high ha concentration can counter all forms of particle removal by steric repulsion hence characterization of the ionic strength electrolyte composition and ha concentration will all be important to predict lead phosphate transport this study also implies that the phosphate remediation strategy can be tuned to optimize lead removal notably excessive phosphate adsorption can provide electrostatic stabilization enhancing particle transport however lower phosphate concentrations may be less effective to precipitate the lead phosphate given the myriad influences of water chemistry further testing will be required e g using response surface methodology to inform guidance on whether phosphate remediation can be effective to immobilize lead across a wider range of soil and groundwater conditions bench scale and pilot scale tests are also necessary to verify deposition behaviors across a wider variety of situations including inhomogeneity in the soil or groundwater

16214,a laboratory scale sulfur autotrophic reactor sar was first constructed for treating tellurite te iv wastewater the sar had excellent te iv bioreduction efficiency 90 96 at 5 30 mg l and conformed to the first order kinetic model the te iv bioreduction was elaborated deeply from extracellular polymeric substances eps functions microbial metabolic activity key enzyme activity microbial community succession and quorum sensing te iv stimulated the increase of redox substances in eps and the improved cell membrane permeability led to the increase of electron transport system activity catalase and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh alleviated the oxidative stress caused by te iv toxicity to maintain metabolic activity the increase of sulfur dioxygenase activity sdo suggested that more atp produced by sulfur oxidation might provide energy for various physiological activities meanwhile nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir and sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr played an active role in sulfur oxidation and te iv bioreduction combined with the above results and dynamic succession of three functional microbial communities a synergistic mechanism was proposed to explain the excellent performance of sar this work provided a promising strategy for te iv wastewater treatment process and te iv bioreduction mechanism graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tellurite bioreduction sulfur autotrophic extracellular polymeric substances electron transfer sulfide sulfide quinone oxidoreductase 1 introduction as a kind of metalloid element tellurium te is not only widely used in metallurgy glass petrochemical and other traditional industrial fields but also can be used in the production of high performance photovoltaic modules and thermoelectric cells due to the development of renewable energy technology in recent years ramos ruiz et al 2017 with the increasing demand for te and the expansion of industrial production scale te contamination has drawn serious attention for instance the concentration of te in electroplating wastewater was found at 10 mg l with high level of exposure risks zheng et al 2021 in addition to the above mentioned industrial wastewater the mining and refining of some ores e g copper ores also caused the release of te to the water and soil environment wadgaonkar et al 2018 stable te containing compounds include te vi tellurate te iv tellurite te 0 elemental tellurium and te ⅱ tellurides among which te iv has the highest level of toxicity and environmental hazard presentato et al 2018 studies have shown that the intake of te iv can cause clinical symptoms such as nausea and vomiting and peripheral neuropathy in rats and mice maria wagner 1995 therefore researchers paid special attention to te iv contamination te 0 has the lowest toxicity and can be separated from aqueous solution thus reducing te iv to te 0 is the main pathway to reduce the adverse environmental impact borghese et al 2020 due to the benefits of better eco friendliness and cost effectiveness compared with physicochemical treatment researchers tend to use biological treatment technology to bioreduce te iv to date most of researches on te iv biological treatment technology mainly focused on the te iv bioreduction by pure culture bacteria e g rhodococcus aetherivorans rhodobacter capsulatus and shewanella oneidensis vaigankar et al 2018 and fungi e g phanerochaete chrysosporium espinosa ortiz et al 2017 compared with pure culture bacteria and fungi the microbial community is generally more suitable for growing in complex environment for application in biological treatment processes the use of microbial community has these advantages 1 microbial community has more robust adaptability and stability to environmental fluctuations 2 the operating conditions are simpler safer and more stable and 3 maintenance and operation costs are low previously only a few bioreactors have been reported for the te iv bioreduction including upflow anaerobic sludge bed uasb mal et al 2017 continuous stirred tank reactor cstr rajwade and paknikar 2003 and ch4 based membrane biofilm reactor ch4 mbfr shi et al 2019 however these bioreactors all used organic matter as electron donor which would increase the economic cost and the risk of secondary pollution therefore it is vital to provide an economical effective and practical biological treatment technology for te iv bioreduction it is noted that autotrophic microorganisms can utilize inorganic electron donors e g elemental sulfur h2 s2o3 2 and s2 and low sludge production in sulfur autotrophic reactor sar di capua et al 2019 elemental sulfur is non toxic low cost stable and provides a film forming place for microorganisms than other electron donors e g h2 s2o3 2 and s2 hao et al 2019 the sar is usually used to remove nitrogen from drinking water and municipal sewage cui et al 2019 but there are few reports on reducing heavy metal contamination shi et al 2020 reported a simultaneous reduction of vanadium v v v and chromium vi cr vi in sar sahinkaya et al 2013 proved that autotrophic denitrification is not affected by chromate with 0 5 mg l concentration chen et al 2018a found that high concentration of v v 60 and 100 mg l could inhibit autotrophic denitrification activity while 30mg l v v had little effect on autotrophic denitrification activity whereas there is no related research on the te iv bioreduction in sar it is far from enough to macroscopically study the te iv bioreduction performance in the biological treatment process so it is necessary to clarify the synergistic mechanism of this process from a microscopic perspective this study aimed to construct a novel sar to achieve continuous bioreduction of te iv and explored synergistic mechanism of te iv bioreduction in the reactor through the following two aspects 1 the effects of different te iv concentrations on the performance and kinetic model of te iv bioreduction 2 the possible synergistic mechanism of te iv bioreduction in sar which was proposed by studying extracellular polymeric substances microbial metabolic activity key enzyme activity microbial community succession and quorum sensing this investigation provides technical methods and theoretical guidance for the large scale treatment of te iv wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 up flow reactor setup and operating conditions a column reactor made of plexiglass diameter of 5cm height of 61 cm total volume of 1 2 l was used to study the continuous bioreduction of te iv with different te iv concentrations fig s1 sulfur particles with a diameter of 3 5mm were filled into sar with a filling height of 33cm sulfur particles contained more than 99 sulfur and were obtained from guangfu fine chemical research institute in tianjin china five experimental phases were carried out in sar and the continuous operating conditions of sar were shown in tabel s1 phase i was the start

funnel with ethyl acetate for extraction separation and this step was repeated three times to complete the extraction of ahls the upper layer of solution in the separating funnel was evaporated by using a rotary evaporator then the sample in the rotary evaporator was dissolved with methanol and the volume was fixed to 2 ml the obtained ahls were stored in a refrigerator at 20 c for subsequent measurement 2 8 analysis methods te iv concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700e usa adenosine triphosphate atp was measured by high performance

comparison test variance between two groups was compared by multiple t tests p 0 05 was considered as moderately significant p 0 01 was considered as highly significant and p 0 001 was considered as noticeably significant zhang et al 2021 3 result and discussion 3 1 bioreduction performance and reduction kinetics of te iv the te iv bioreduction performance was studied for 110 days in sar fig 1 the start up phase was from days 1 to 14 phase ⅰ to restore the microbial activity in sar fig s2 during phase ⅰ the total nitrogen removal efficiency was stable at 99 indicating that the microbial activity in sar had restored normal level from days 15 to 110 phases ⅱ ⅴ and the te iv concentration was continuously increased to explore the te iv bioreduction performance in sar when 5 mg l te iv was added te iv could be bioreduced at the beginning of phase ⅱ 15 37 days and the te iv bioreduction efficiency was stable at about 95 with the increase of te iv concentration from 5 mg l to 10 mg l in phase ⅲ 38 60 days the te iv bioreduction efficiency in sar was still about 95 when the te iv concentration increased to 20 mg l in phase ⅳ 61 83 days the te iv bioreduction efficiency decreased slightly to about 90 and the result was consistent with the previous report ramos ruiz et al 2017 this may be the toxic effect of te iv on microorganisms which need to adapt to the change of te iv concentration however it is noteworthy that the te iv bioreduction efficiency was increased to about 96 in phase ⅴ 84 110 days it indicated that microorganisms had adapted to the high concentration of te iv and the tolerance of sar was improved at the same time no excessive sulfate so4 2 table s2 was produced during sar operation and the ph range was kept at 6 7 7 0 it is well known that the suitable ph range for the growth of sulfur autotrophic bacteria is 6 8 pokorna zabranska 2015 therefore low sulfate and suitable ph range supported the smooth working processes of the sar it is noted that sulfide was not detected in the wastewater which could be that sulfide was immediately oxidized by sulfur autotrophic bacteria qiu et al 2020 kinetic model is one of the important analysis methods to explore the removal performance of pollutants and can directly reflect the removal performance of pollutants by determining the reaction order and changing the parameters ju et al 2008 zeng zhang 2005 therefore the zero order half order and first order kinetic models were used to fit the te iv bioreduction process in sar fig 2 table s1 listed the calculated rate constant k0v r k 1 2v r and k1v r value and correlation coefficients r2 of various kinetic models the r2 values of the first order kinetic models were higher than those of the zero order and half order kinetic models in phase ⅱ ⅴ so the first order kinetic model was more consistent with the te iv bioreduction performance the results of fitting kinetic models showed that sar could provide better electrons and the number of electron acceptors was the limiting factor li et al 2020 which made the reactor achieve effective te iv bioreduction performance it was observed that the te iv concentration increased from5mg l to 10mg l the k1v r value increased from 0 407 to 0 448 1 h when the te iv concentration increased from 10mg l to 20mg l the k1v r value decreased from 0 448 to 0 357 1 h moreover when the te iv concentration increased from 20mg l to 30mg l the k1v r value increased from 0 357 to 0 410 1 h the identified k1v r values were consistent with the change trend of the reactor performance and the change of te iv concentration may affect the k1v r value in particular the increase in k1v r value in phase ⅴ indicated that the microorganism had adapted to the change of te iv concentration and had recovered good performance which meant that sar was highly tolerant to te iv so the reactor could still maintain excellent te iv bioreduction ability to sum up te iv could be bioreduced efficiently in sar using elemental sulfur as electron donor according to the kinetic model analysis the tolerance of sar to te iv was high studies have reported that te iv cannot be entirely stably removed in the initial phase of 10 mg l and 20 mg l te iv using methanogenic granular sludge in a uasb reactor mal et al 2017 adding 10mg l te iv to ch4 based membrane biofilm reactor the bioreduction efficiency increased in the first 20 days and gradually decreased to 0 after reaching the highest bioreduction rate shi et al 2019 compared with these reported literatures the te iv bioreduction in sar could operate stably for at least 110 days even with high te iv concentration suggesting that sar could treat te iv wastewater efficiently and had excellent performance however the mechanism of te iv bioreduction in sar remained to be further elucidated we propose that it may be due to the synergistic effect of various aspects in sar to achieve efficient te iv bioreduction the detailed experimental results would be discussed in the following sections 3 2 function analysis of eps eps secretion is one of the basic characteristics of microorganisms in nature which is helpful to establish a mature biofilm structure and protect microorganisms from external environment interference shi et al 2017 that is to say eps may play an important role in te iv bioreduction promoting microbial aggregation and maintaining the stability of biofilm structure in sar fig 3 a reflected the composition changes of eps the total eps content was 40 18 45 70 44 74 44 86 and 46 20 mg g vss in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively there was no significant increase p 0 05 in eps content in phases ⅰ ⅴ nevertheless it has been reported that ps in eps is negatively charged which will hinder the electron transfer in the bioreduction process zhao et al 2020 the ps content was 31 53 30 88 27 46 25 58 and 23 13 mg g vss in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively with the increase of te iv concentration the ps content in phase ⅴ decreased significantly p 0 001 the ps content of phases ⅱ ⅴ were all less than that of phase ⅰ which indicated that the decrease of ps content could reduce the toxic stress of te iv on microorganisms and improve the electron transfer to increase the metabolic activity of microorganisms besides the pn content was 8 654 14 82 17 28 19 28 and 23 07 mg g vss in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively the results showed that pn content was significantly increased p 0 001 from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ the pn content also gradually increased and pn could promote the stability and aggregation of biofilm during phase ⅰ ⅴ shi et al 2017 it can be seen from fig 3a that the ratios of pn ps in phases ⅰ ⅴ were 0 27 0 48 0 63 0 75 and 1 00 respectively indicating that pn ps increased continuously during phasess ⅰ ⅴ the hydrophobicity of microbial aggregates is positively correlated with pn ps which may help to enhance the stability of biofilm structure zhang et al 2015 therefore it was possible for sar to form a stable biofilm structure with higher pn and pn ps thus improving the te iv bioreduction performance except that the composition changes of eps were related to pollutant removal performance eps has been reported to promote electron transfer which is conducive to pollutant removal zhang et al 2015 therefore the electron transfer efficiency of eps was evaluated by electrochemical characterization tafel curves of eps was shown in fig 3b the exchange current density in phases ⅰ ⅴ were 7 97 10 8 9 14 10 8 1 098 10 7 1 604 10 7 and 1 819 10 7 a cm2 respectively the results indicated that the higher level of exchange current was associated with the higher amount of electron transfer in the reactor this may be that more redox substances were produced in eps which reduced the electron transfer resistance guo et al 2020 in order to reveal more clearly whether there would be redox substances in eps cv curves were employed fig 3c in phases ⅰ ⅴ the current response gradually increased and obvious redox peaks appeared in the potential of 0 3 v and 0 1 v in phase ⅴ in the potential of 0 3v it may be redox groups such as quinone hydroquinone groups in humus yang et al 2014 outer membrane cytochromes in protein may exist in the potential of 0 1 v ye et al 2018 and outer membrane cytochromes have been reported to have the ability to transfer electrons from microorganisms to metal containing minerals to achieve environmental pollution remediation clarke et al 2011 shi et al 2016 these results indicated that redox groups quinone hydroquinone groups and redox molecules outer membrane cytochromes may improve the electron transfer efficiency in the te iv bioreduction process which were beneficial to the stable and efficient performance of te iv bioreduction in sar to further reveal the characteristics of eps more clearly the 3d eem fluorescence spectrum of eps was also analyzed as shown in fig 3d and 3e the following two specific components could be identified as aromatic like proteins and humic acids substances the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of aromatic like proteins and humic acids substances were 220 230 340 350 nm and 210 230 350 nm respectively aromatic like proteins may be related to extracellular proteins synthesized during microbial assimilation and usually play an important role in the formation and maintenance of biofilm han et al 2018 this showed that sulfur autotrophic biofilm still had excellent bioreduction performance under high te iv concentration specially the discovery of humic acids substances in sar was consistent with the previous report han et al 2020 humic acids substances acted as electron shuttles to promote electron transfer luan et al 2010 thus significantly improving the te iv bioreduction efficiency the secretion of redox substances in eps was increased during the te iv bioreduction which led to the increase of electron transfer so as to increase metabolic activity and make the sar operate stably and efficiently overall the functions of eps during the te iv bioreduction was showed in fig 3f the higher pn and pn ps indicated the formation of stable biofilm structure in sar aromatic like proteins in eps also played an essential role in forming and maintaining of biofilm meanwhile the decrease of ps and the increase of redox substances outer membrane cytochromes redox groups and humic acids substances in eps could improve the electron transfer efficiency during the te iv bioreduction 3 3 analysis of microbial metabolic activity atp played a vital role in eps secretion and pollutant removal yan et al 2016 furthermore atp content can be used as a critical index to evaluate microbial metabolic activity therefore it was necessary to understand the changes of atp content in sar as shown in fig 4 a atp content was 9 45 11 57 12 12 20 04 and 21 13 mg vss in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively atp content in phase ⅴ was significantly higher than that in phase ⅰ p 0 001 the gradual increase of atp content meant that the bacteria in sar still had good metabolic activity and could provide more energy for eps secretion biofilm formation te iv bioreduction and other physiological processes even under the condition of high te iv concentration the increase of atp content may be due to the improvement of cell membrane permeability dehghani et al 2018 and the cell membrane permeability was measured in this study as shown in fig 4b the concentration of o nitrophenol was 28 89 34 44 36 00 40 44 and 51 78 μmol l in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively with the increase of te iv concentration the concentration of o nitrophenol in phase ⅴ increased significantly p 0 001 this indicated that the cell membrane permeability was improved in sar the improvement of cell membrane permeability made it easier for bacteria to absorb nutrients to promote atp synthesis and increase metabolic activity during the te iv bioreduction in sar what s more the basis of microbial metabolic activity is redox reaction driven by electron transfer which often occurs in the te iv bioreduction process blenkinsopp and lock 1990 thus the microbial metabolic activity was characterized by analyzing etsa etsa was 5 10 3 32 6 86 9 37 and 9 39 μg mg h in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively compared with the etsa in phase ⅰ the etsa in phase ⅴ increased significantly p 0 001 fig 4c the results showed that the increased etsa may be due to the improvement of cell membrane permeability of bacteria during the te iv bioreduction which was beneficial to electron transfer mediated by electron shuttles such as redox substances in eps modestra mohan 2014 therefore the elevated etsa during the te iv bioreduction which increased microbial metabolic activity and contributed to the excellent te iv bioreduction furthermore the microbial metabolic activity is affected by the te iv toxicity some researchers have proposed that the te iv toxicity is attributed to oxidative stress caused by the production of reactive oxygen species ros when cells are exposed to te iv and antioxidant enzymes are essential to eliminate the harmful effects of excess ros presentato et al 2019 therefore the changes of antioxidant enzymes cat and nadh activity were further used to explore how microorganisms in sar responded to the oxidative stress to maintain their metabolic activity the cat activity was 37 20 45 61 60 43 71 54 and 76 01 u g in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively fig 4d the results suggested that cat activity increased significantly in phase ⅴ p 0 001 and cat played an important role in protecting cells from oxidative stress in sar to be specific this was mainly to enhance the resistance to te iv toxicity by promoting the production of antioxidant enzyme cat so as to reduce cell damage besides electron transport chain etc is one of the main sites of ros production in bacterial cells and nadh is related to ros elimination thus nadh activity was detected the nadh activity was 1 97 1 58 1 35 1 10 and 0 69 u g in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively fig 4e the significantly decreased nadh activity in phase ⅴ p 0 001 suggested that an effective cell metabolism strategy to avoid aggravating oxidative stress may reduce the electron flux through etc by reducing the level of the pro oxidative metabolite nadh lemire et al 2017 hence microorganisms could maintain their metabolic activity by adjusting the activity of cat and nadh to enhance their antioxidant capacity when dealing with te iv toxicity in sar in summary the schematic diagram of microbial metabolic activity during te iv bioreduction was showed in fig 4f the increase of atp production in sar was conducive to metabolic activity and the increase of cell membrane permeability was conducive to electron transfer mediated by autocrine electron shuttles thus leading to the increase of etsa in addition the enhanced cat and nadh activity increased oxidative stress resistance thus maintaining the metabolic activity in sar 3 4 analysis of key enzymes activity in previous reports the process of te iv bioreduction depends on nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir is responsible for reducing se iv wang et al 2018b because of the similar chemical properties of te iv and se iv nir may also be involved in te iv bioreduction therefore the key enzymes activity nar and nir activity involved in te iv bioreduction were studied in sar as shown in fig 5 a nar activity in phases ⅰ ⅴ was 0 84 1 47 1 48 1 49 and 1 67 u g respectively nir activity was 0 51 0 62 0 65 0 84 and 1 00 u g respectively fig 5b the results showed that the nar and nir activity significantly increased in phase ⅴ p 0 001 with the increase of te iv concentration this indicated that nar and nir participated in the te iv bioreduction in sar and the increase of nar and nir activity may be related to the high expression of nar and nir genes napa and nirs he et al 2021 it was possible that besides nar and nir enzymes involved in sulfur oxidation may also be related to te iv bioreduction in sar it is reported that sdo is key enzyme in the process of sulfur oxidation camacho et al 2020 sulfur oxidizing bacteria would be enriched in sar discussed in section 3 5 which could autotrophically use elemental sulfur to obtain the energy necessary for growth by sulfur oxidation yin et al 2014 therefore it was great significance to study sulfur oxidation on the metabolic activity of bacteria the sdo activity in phases ⅰ ⅴ was 0 181 0 200 0 228 0 239 and 0 260 u g respectively fig 5c compared with phase ⅰ the sdo activity in phase ⅴ was significantly increased p 0 05 elemental sulfur is difficult to be utilized by microorganisms because of its poor water solubility and stable chemical properties the enhanced sdo activity indicated that autotrophic bacteria in sar made elemental sulfur easier to be bio oxidized thus with the improvement of sdo activity the bioavailability of elemental sulfur as an electron donor was greatly improved the increase of sdo activity was consistent with the increase of atp which indicated that it was beneficial for bacteria to use elemental sulfur to obtain energy for growth and metabolic activities moreover the process of oxidizing elemental sulfur first needs to be activated the activation process will produce hydrogen sulfide which has toxic effects on a variety of microbial metabolic processes and the generation of hydrogen sulfide can mainly be metabolized by sqr wang et al 2018a hence sqr activity involved in sulfur oxidation process was examined sqr activity was 1 368 1 445 1 631 1 723 and 2 110 u g in phases ⅱ ⅴ respectively fig 5d with the increase of te iv concentration sqr activity in phase ⅴ was increased significantly p 0 01 this result suggested that the increase of sqr activity could reduce the toxicity caused by sulfur oxidation process in sar and thus maintained the normal metabolic activity of bacteria 3 5 microbial community and quorum sensing analysis 3 5 1 dynamic analysis of microbial community in order to know more about the specific role of different bacteria in te iv bioreduction in sar the diversity and richness of the microbial community were analyzed table s2 shannon index and simpson index can be used to evaluate the microbial diversity of microbial community in phases ⅰ ⅴ simpson indices of microbial community were 0 028 0 017 0 012 0 010 and 0 008 respectively shannon indices of microbial community were 4 953 5 250 5 463 5 601 and 5 754 in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively the lower simpson index and the higher shannon index indicated the increase of microbial diversity in sar moreover chao 1 index and ace index can be used as indicators of microbial richness in phases ⅰ ⅴ chao 1 indices were 1403 211 1415 437 1524 123 1586 180 and 1632 298 respectively ace indices were 1408 286 1424 621 1525 551 1606 326 and 1693 941 respectively therefore the results showed that chao 1 indices and ace indices in sar increased continuously with the increase of te iv concentration indicating that the richness of microbial community also increased all in all the increase of diversity and richness of microbial community revealed that microorganisms adapted to the changes of te iv concentration through domestication and enrichment to further elucidate the succession of microbial community the dynamic changes of microbial community composition were analyzed at the phylum level fig 6 a proteobacteria 40 53 64 16 chloroflexi 4 24 16 32 bacteroidetes 5 06 10 24 were dominant in phases ⅰ ⅴ these dominant bacteria were widely found in wastewater treatment such as autotrophic nitrogen removal by sulfur and anaerobic digestion of sludge li et al 2018 studies have shown that many extracellular respiratory microorganisms belong to proteobacteria such as geobacter the model bacteria of extracellular respiration which could use metal as an electron acceptor for bioreduction therefore the composition of the microbial community was discussed in detail at the genus level fig 6b we found that geobacter increased from 0 060 in phase ⅰ to 2 834 in phase ⅴ with the increase of te iv concentration moreover the relative abundance of electroactive bacteria geothrix increased from 0 064 to 3 091 geobacter and geothrix may grow intermediate metabolites utilized by autotrophic bacteria as electron donors wang et al 2021 the geobacter s high conductivity fimbriae and biofilm may contribute to electron transfer lovley et al 2011 so as to improve the te iv bioreduction performance and fill ecological niches in sar the increase in geothrix may be because of that geothrix adapted to the change of the environment in sar and geothrix may secrete several redox active substances as electron shuttles for electron transfer to achieve excellent te iv bioreduction performance dulon et al 2006 in addition thiobacillus ignavibacterium acidithiobacillus thermomonas thiomonas and rhodanobacter were all enriched in the identified genera according to reports geobacter thiobacillus and ignavibacterium had been found in arsenic rich groundwater and had potential roles in arsenic mobilization jean das 2016 thiobacillus and ignavibacterium may use humic acids substancesas an electron shuttle to transfer electrons chai et al 2020 thermomonas could use inorganic carbon to reduce pollutants without organic matter xing et al 2018 so enrichment of these bacteria meant that they had the ability to reduce heavy metal ions with high concentration simultaneously bacteria related to sulfur oxidation appeared in sar including thiobacillus ignavibacterium rhodanobacter and acidithiobacillus ignavibacterium and thiobacillus could metabolize sulfide and remove pollutants at the same time zheng et al 2020 furthermore rhodanobacter was also found in highly polluted areas in previous studies indicating that rhodanobacter had good tolerance to heavy metals and could oxidize reducing sulfides koh et al 2015 more importantly acidithiobacillus could support autotrophic growth by using elemental sulfur and various inorganic sulfur compounds acidithiobacillus had lived in harsh environment for a long time and adapted to sudden and long term pressure changes in various environments zhang et al 2016b therefore the enrichment of acidithiobacillus indicated that they adapt to various ecological niches with high te iv concentration and some gene clusters that may encode functional enzymes had been identified in genomics indicating that acidithiobacillus had the ability to cope with high concentration of heavy metal ions zhang et al 2016a as a result acidithiobacillus could adapt and survive quickly when dealing with the pressure of te iv in sar in summary after 110 days of operation of sar different bacteria had formed a symbiont the microbial communities related to electrochemically active heavy metal reduction and sulfur oxidation could cooperate with each other to complete the te iv bioreduction process which made the performance of the sar operate well 3 5 2 analysis of quorum sensing quorum sensing mediated by signal molecules is an important means of information communication among bacteria and the change of community structure may be regulated by signal molecules maddela et al 2019 c10 hsl and c14 hsl had been found in sar fig 6c in phases ⅰ ⅴ the concentrations of c10 hsl were 161 626 58 724 62 822 132 644 and 143 741 μg l respectively the results showed that c10 hsl decreased significantly in phase ⅴ p 0 05 with the increase of te iv concentration the concentrations of c14 hsl were not detected in phases ⅰ ⅱ but increased significantly p 0 001 to 29 2948 and 42 2428 μg l in phases ⅳ ⅴ c14 hsl was not detected in phases ⅰ ⅱ which may be due to the fact that bacteria did not need to secrete c14 hsl to regulate the change of microbial community c10 hsl and c14 hsl were typical signal molecules in sludge and biofilm these results indicated that the secretion of c10 hsl and c14 hsl may mediate the te iv bioreduction by microbial community in sar according to previous reports microbial information exchange mediated by a quorum sensing system is a critical communication mode among bacteria and can regulate the survival strategies and group behaviors of microorganisms schuster et al 2013 which are important guarantees for the survival of microorganisms in complex environments therefore the functional microbial community secreted a large number of c10 hsl and c14 hsl with the increase of te iv concentration which activated their community behavior and regulated their cooperation with other populations to cope with the change of external environment hence c10 hsl and c14 hsl may regulate the structure of microbial community to achieve excellent performance of te iv bioreduction 3 6 possible mechanism and prospect based on the experimental results of eps functions microbial metabolic activity key enzyme activity microbial community and quorum sensing a mechanism diagram was established to illustrate the synergistic mechanism of te iv bioreduction in sar fig 7 firstly at the level of microbial community succession and quorum sensing c10 hsl and c14 hsl were secreted in large quantities for the information exchange among bacteria in response to te iv stress in phases ⅱ ⅴ thereby achieving regulation of sulfur oxidizing bacteria thiobacillus ignavibacterium rhodanobacter and acidithiobacillus heavy metal reducing bacteria thiobacillus ignavibacterium acidithiobacillus thermomonas thiomonas rhodanobacter and geobacter and electroactive bacteria geobacter and geothrix electroactive bacteria might form the conductive network to promote long distance transport between microorganisms and may also produce filamentous appendages or nanotubes as electronic channels to promote electron transfer thus actively promoting the te iv bioreduction jiang et al 2020 li et al 2021 secondly at the level of eps role the decrease of ps and the increase of outer membrane cytochromes and redox groups in eps could promote the electron transfer of bacteria thirdly at the level of microbial metabolic activity the secreted humic acids substances of geobacter and some secreted electron shuttles of geothrix could also promote electron transfer which meant that etsa could be increased moreover the improvement of cell membrane permeability was also beneficial to electron transfer mediated by electron shuttle thus promoting the increase of etsa oxidative stress associated with ros could be eliminated by cat and nadh in cells during the te iv bioreduction finally at the level of key enzyme activity nar and nir could catalyze the te iv bioreduction indicating that te iv may be reduced by replacing nitrogen compounds through nitrite and nitrate reduction pathways furthermore acidithiobacillus used elemental sulfur to grow and generate energy chen et al 2012 and the enhanced sdo activity made elemental sulfur more easily utilized by acidithiobacillus to generate atp atp provided energy for microbial metabolic activities such as eps synthesis sqr could reduce the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide produced during sulfur oxidation and thiobacillus ignavibacterium and rhodanobacter could use the produced sulfide during sulfur oxidation to grow therefore in sar microorganisms could not only make better use of elemental sulfur to promote their own growth through sulfur oxidation but also actively respond to the impact of increasing te iv concentration through the synergistic interaction among eps functions microbial metabolic activity key enzyme activity microbial community succession and quorum sensing so as to obtain excellent te iv bioreduction performance in general the excellent te iv bioreduction performance in sar was not only achieved by a certain way but was the result of synergy of microorganisms through complex processes in a word it was feasible to bioreduce te iv by sar in the future this may inspire researchers to promote and apply the proposed sar in field environment to treat other heavy metal wastewater and devote to the application of engineering technology not only in industrial wastewater treatment but also in the remediation of groundwater contaminated by te iv at present there are few pure culture bacteria related to the te iv bioreduction which can separate and purify strains with a strong ability to reduce te iv from the microbial community in the sar to enrich and broaden the understanding of te iv bioreduction functional bacteria more importantly outer membrane cytochromes in autotrophic bacteria have been reported to mediate the electron transfer in the process of iron oxidation beckwith et al 2015 liu et al 2012 percak dennett et al 2017 however the specific electron transfer process that outer membrane cytochromes participate in sulfur oxidation needs further exploration nitrate and heavy metals are often co contaminated in groundwater lee et al 2015 li krumholz 2008 sar may provide a new strategy for the simultaneous removal of nitrate and te iv in groundwater in addition te iv can be reduced by microorganisms to produce tellurium nanoparticles tenps which can be used as valuable nanomaterials in various fields because of their attractive photoelectric properties baesman et al 2009 tenps continuously produced in sar can be extracted by physical method e g ultra high speed centrifugation and other methods mal et al 2017 this provides new opportunities for sustainable energy production and bioremediation 4 conclusions in this study the bioreduction performance and synergistic mechanism of te iv in sar were examined for the first time the results showed that sar could efficiently reduce te iv concentration up to 30 mg l and conformed to the first order kinetic model when the sar responded to te iv stress the secretion of redox substances outer membrane cytochromes redox groups and humic acids substances in eps and the improvement of cell membrane permeability played a positive role in enhancing etsa the increase of atp enhanced the metabolic activity of microorganisms and provided energy in addition this stud confirmed that key enzymes played a significant role in antioxidation cat and nadh te iv bioreduction nar and nir and sulfur oxidation sqr and sdo processes the changes of microbial community may be related to c10 hsl and c14 hsl in conclusion efficient te iv bioreduction could be achieved through the synergistic effect of eps microbial metabolic activity key enzyme activity microbial community and quorum sensing in sar the results of this study provided a novel and feasible method for the effective removal of te iv pollutant

16214,a laboratory scale sulfur autotrophic reactor sar was first constructed for treating tellurite te iv wastewater the sar had excellent te iv bioreduction efficiency 90 96 at 5 30 mg l and conformed to the first order kinetic model the te iv bioreduction was elaborated deeply from extracellular polymeric substances eps functions microbial metabolic activity key enzyme activity microbial community succession and quorum sensing te iv stimulated the increase of redox substances in eps and the improved cell membrane permeability led to the increase of electron transport system activity catalase and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh alleviated the oxidative stress caused by te iv toxicity to maintain metabolic activity the increase of sulfur dioxygenase activity sdo suggested that more atp produced by sulfur oxidation might provide energy for various physiological activities meanwhile nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir and sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr played an active role in sulfur oxidation and te iv bioreduction combined with the above results and dynamic succession of three functional microbial communities a synergistic mechanism was proposed to explain the excellent performance of sar this work provided a promising strategy for te iv wastewater treatment process and te iv bioreduction mechanism graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tellurite bioreduction sulfur autotrophic extracellular polymeric substances electron transfer sulfide sulfide quinone oxidoreductase 1 introduction as a kind of metalloid element tellurium te is not only widely used in metallurgy glass petrochemical and other traditional industrial fields but also can be used in the production of high performance photovoltaic modules and thermoelectric cells due to the development of renewable energy technology in recent years ramos ruiz et al 2017 with the increasing demand for te and the expansion of industrial production scale te contamination has drawn serious attention for instance the concentration of te in electroplating wastewater was found at 10 mg l with high level of exposure risks zheng et al 2021 in addition to the above mentioned industrial wastewater the mining and refining of some ores e g copper ores also caused the release of te to the water and soil environment wadgaonkar et al 2018 stable te containing compounds include te vi tellurate te iv tellurite te 0 elemental tellurium and te ⅱ tellurides among which te iv has the highest level of toxicity and environmental hazard presentato et al 2018 studies have shown that the intake of te iv can cause clinical symptoms such as nausea and vomiting and peripheral neuropathy in rats and mice maria wagner 1995 therefore researchers paid special attention to te iv contamination te 0 has the lowest toxicity and can be separated from aqueous solution thus reducing te iv to te 0 is the main pathway to reduce the adverse environmental impact borghese et al 2020 due to the benefits of better eco friendliness and cost effectiveness compared with physicochemical treatment researchers tend to use biological treatment technology to bioreduce te iv to date most of researches on te iv biological treatment technology mainly focused on the te iv bioreduction by pure culture bacteria e g rhodococcus aetherivorans rhodobacter capsulatus and shewanella oneidensis vaigankar et al 2018 and fungi e g phanerochaete chrysosporium espinosa ortiz et al 2017 compared with pure culture bacteria and fungi the microbial community is generally more suitable for growing in complex environment for application in biological treatment processes the use of microbial community has these advantages 1 microbial community has more robust adaptability and stability to environmental fluctuations 2 the operating conditions are simpler safer and more stable and 3 maintenance and operation costs are low previously only a few bioreactors have been reported for the te iv bioreduction including upflow anaerobic sludge bed uasb mal et al 2017 continuous stirred tank reactor cstr rajwade and paknikar 2003 and ch4 based membrane biofilm reactor ch4 mbfr shi et al 2019 however these bioreactors all used organic matter as electron donor which would increase the economic cost and the risk of secondary pollution therefore it is vital to provide an economical effective and practical biological treatment technology for te iv bioreduction it is noted that autotrophic microorganisms can utilize inorganic electron donors e g elemental sulfur h2 s2o3 2 and s2 and low sludge production in sulfur autotrophic reactor sar di capua et al 2019 elemental sulfur is non toxic low cost stable and provides a film forming place for microorganisms than other electron donors e g h2 s2o3 2 and s2 hao et al 2019 the sar is usually used to remove nitrogen from drinking water and municipal sewage cui et al 2019 but there are few reports on reducing heavy metal contamination shi et al 2020 reported a simultaneous reduction of vanadium v v v and chromium vi cr vi in sar sahinkaya et al 2013 proved that autotrophic denitrification is not affected by chromate with 0 5 mg l concentration chen et al 2018a found that high concentration of v v 60 and 100 mg l could inhibit autotrophic denitrification activity while 30mg l v v had little effect on autotrophic denitrification activity whereas there is no related research on the te iv bioreduction in sar it is far from enough to macroscopically study the te iv bioreduction performance in the biological treatment process so it is necessary to clarify the synergistic mechanism of this process from a microscopic perspective this study aimed to construct a novel sar to achieve continuous bioreduction of te iv and explored synergistic mechanism of te iv bioreduction in the reactor through the following two aspects 1 the effects of different te iv concentrations on the performance and kinetic model of te iv bioreduction 2 the possible synergistic mechanism of te iv bioreduction in sar which was proposed by studying extracellular polymeric substances microbial metabolic activity key enzyme activity microbial community succession and quorum sensing this investigation provides technical methods and theoretical guidance for the large scale treatment of te iv wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 up flow reactor setup and operating conditions a column reactor made of plexiglass diameter of 5cm height of 61 cm total volume of 1 2 l was used to study the continuous bioreduction of te iv with different te iv concentrations fig s1 sulfur particles with a diameter of 3 5mm were filled into sar with a filling height of 33cm sulfur particles contained more than 99 sulfur and were obtained from guangfu fine chemical research institute in tianjin china five experimental phases were carried out in sar and the continuous operating conditions of sar were shown in tabel s1 phase i was the start

chen et al 2018b 2 3 te iv reduction kinetics analysis to explore the effect of different te iv concentrations on te iv bioreduction in sar the experiment data of phases ii v were used to fit different kinetic models zero order half order and first order kinetic models qambrani et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 for kinetic analysis water samples were collected from four ports at different

comparison test variance between two groups was compared by multiple t tests p 0 05 was considered as moderately significant p 0 01 was considered as highly significant and p 0 001 was considered as noticeably significant zhang et al 2021 3 result and discussion 3 1 bioreduction performance and reduction kinetics of te iv the te iv bioreduction performance was studied for 110 days in sar fig 1 the start up phase was from days 1 to 14 phase ⅰ to restore the microbial activity in sar fig s2 during phase ⅰ the total nitrogen removal efficiency was stable at 99 indicating that the microbial activity in sar had restored normal level from days 15 to 110 phases ⅱ ⅴ and the te iv concentration was continuously increased to explore the te iv bioreduction performance in sar when 5 mg l te iv was added te iv could be bioreduced at the beginning of phase ⅱ 15 37 days and the te iv bioreduction efficiency was stable at about 95 with the increase of te iv concentration from 5 mg l to 10 mg l in phase ⅲ 38 60 days the te iv bioreduction efficiency in sar was still about 95 when the te iv concentration increased to 20 mg l in phase ⅳ 61 83 days the te iv bioreduction efficiency decreased slightly to about 90 and the result was consistent with the previous report ramos ruiz et al 2017 this may be the toxic effect of te iv on microorganisms which need to adapt to the change of te iv concentration however it is noteworthy that the te iv bioreduction efficiency was increased to about 96 in phase ⅴ 84 110 days it indicated that microorganisms had adapted to the high concentration of te iv and the tolerance of sar was improved at the same time no excessive sulfate so4 2 table s2 was produced during sar operation and the ph range was kept at 6 7 7 0 it is well known that the suitable ph range for the growth of sulfur autotrophic bacteria is 6 8 pokorna zabranska 2015 therefore low sulfate and suitable ph range supported the smooth working processes of the sar it is noted that sulfide was not detected in the wastewater which could be that sulfide was immediately oxidized by sulfur autotrophic bacteria qiu et al 2020 kinetic model is one of the important analysis methods to explore the removal performance of pollutants and can directly reflect the removal performance of pollutants by determining the reaction order and changing the parameters ju et al 2008 zeng zhang 2005 therefore the zero order half order and first order kinetic models were used to fit the te iv bioreduction process in sar fig 2 table s1 listed the calculated rate constant k0v r k 1 2v r and k1v r value and correlation coefficients r2 of various kinetic models the r2 values of the first order kinetic models were higher than those of the zero order and half order kinetic models in phase ⅱ ⅴ so the first order kinetic model was more consistent with the te iv bioreduction performance the results of fitting kinetic models showed that sar could provide better electrons and the number of electron acceptors was the limiting factor li et al 2020 which made the reactor achieve effective te iv bioreduction performance it was observed that the te iv concentration increased from5mg l to 10mg l the k1v r value increased from 0 407 to 0 448 1 h when the te iv concentration increased from 10mg l to 20mg l the k1v r value decreased from 0 448 to 0 357 1 h moreover when the te iv concentration increased from 20mg l to 30mg l the k1v r value increased from 0 357 to 0 410 1 h the identified k1v r values were consistent with the change trend of the reactor performance and the change of te iv concentration may affect the k1v r value in particular the increase in k1v r value in phase ⅴ indicated that the microorganism had adapted to the change of te iv concentration and had recovered good performance which meant that sar was highly tolerant to te iv so the reactor could still maintain excellent te iv bioreduction ability to sum up te iv could be bioreduced efficiently in sar using elemental sulfur as electron donor according to the kinetic model analysis the tolerance of sar to te iv was high studies have reported that te iv cannot be entirely stably removed in the initial phase of 10 mg l and 20 mg l te iv using methanogenic granular sludge in a uasb reactor mal et al 2017 adding 10mg l te iv to ch4 based membrane biofilm reactor the bioreduction efficiency increased in the first 20 days and gradually decreased to 0 after reaching the highest bioreduction rate shi et al 2019 compared with these reported literatures the te iv bioreduction in sar could operate stably for at least 110 days even with high te iv concentration suggesting that sar could treat te iv wastewater efficiently and had excellent performance however the mechanism of te iv bioreduction in sar remained to be further elucidated we propose that it may be due to the synergistic effect of various aspects in sar to achieve efficient te iv bioreduction the detailed experimental results would be discussed in the following sections 3 2 function analysis of eps eps secretion is one of the basic characteristics of microorganisms in nature which is helpful to establish a mature biofilm structure and protect microorganisms from external environment interference shi et al 2017 that is to say eps may play an important role in te iv bioreduction promoting microbial aggregation and maintaining the stability of biofilm structure in sar fig 3 a reflected the composition changes of eps the total eps content was 40 18 45 70 44 74 44 86 and 46 20 mg g vss in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively there was no significant increase p 0 05 in eps content in phases ⅰ ⅴ nevertheless it has been reported that ps in eps is negatively charged which will hinder the electron transfer in the bioreduction process zhao et al 2020 the ps content was 31 53 30 88 27 46 25 58 and 23 13 mg g vss in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively with the increase of te iv concentration the ps content in phase ⅴ decreased significantly p 0 001 the ps content of phases ⅱ ⅴ were all less than that of phase ⅰ which indicated that the decrease of ps content could reduce the toxic stress of te iv on microorganisms and improve the electron transfer to increase the metabolic activity of microorganisms besides the pn content was 8 654 14 82 17 28 19 28 and 23 07 mg g vss in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively the results showed that pn content was significantly increased p 0 001 from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ the pn content also gradually increased and pn could promote the stability and aggregation of biofilm during phase ⅰ ⅴ shi et al 2017 it can be seen from fig 3a that the ratios of pn ps in phases ⅰ ⅴ were 0 27 0 48 0 63 0 75 and 1 00 respectively indicating that pn ps increased continuously during phasess ⅰ ⅴ the hydrophobicity of microbial aggregates is positively correlated with pn ps which may help to enhance the stability of biofilm structure zhang et al 2015 therefore it was possible for sar to form a stable biofilm structure with higher pn and pn ps thus improving the te iv bioreduction performance except that the composition changes of eps were related to pollutant removal performance eps has been reported to promote electron transfer which is conducive to pollutant removal zhang et al 2015 therefore the electron transfer efficiency of eps was evaluated by electrochemical characterization tafel curves of eps was shown in fig 3b the exchange current density in phases ⅰ ⅴ were 7 97 10 8 9 14 10 8 1 098 10 7 1 604 10 7 and 1 819 10 7 a cm2 respectively the results indicated that the higher level of exchange current was associated with the higher amount of electron transfer in the reactor this may be that more redox substances were produced in eps which reduced the electron transfer resistance guo et al 2020 in order to reveal more clearly whether there would be redox substances in eps cv curves were employed fig 3c in phases ⅰ ⅴ the current response gradually increased and obvious redox peaks appeared in the potential of 0 3 v and 0 1 v in phase ⅴ in the potential of 0 3v it may be redox groups such as quinone hydroquinone groups in humus yang et al 2014 outer membrane cytochromes in protein may exist in the potential of 0 1 v ye et al 2018 and outer membrane cytochromes have been reported to have the ability to transfer electrons from microorganisms to metal containing minerals to achieve environmental pollution remediation clarke et al 2011 shi et al 2016 these results indicated that redox groups quinone hydroquinone groups and redox molecules outer membrane cytochromes may improve the electron transfer efficiency in the te iv bioreduction process which were beneficial to the stable and efficient performance of te iv bioreduction in sar to further reveal the characteristics of eps more clearly the 3d eem fluorescence spectrum of eps was also analyzed as shown in fig 3d and 3e the following two specific components could be identified as aromatic like proteins and humic acids substances the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of aromatic like proteins and humic acids substances were 220 230 340 350 nm and 210 230 350 nm respectively aromatic like proteins may be related to extracellular proteins synthesized during microbial assimilation and usually play an important role in the formation and maintenance of biofilm han et al 2018 this showed that sulfur autotrophic biofilm still had excellent bioreduction performance under high te iv concentration specially the discovery of humic acids substances in sar was consistent with the previous report han et al 2020 humic acids substances acted as electron shuttles to promote electron transfer luan et al 2010 thus significantly improving the te iv bioreduction efficiency the secretion of redox substances in eps was increased during the te iv bioreduction which led to the increase of electron transfer so as to increase metabolic activity and make the sar operate stably and efficiently overall the functions of eps during the te iv bioreduction was showed in fig 3f the higher pn and pn ps indicated the formation of stable biofilm structure in sar aromatic like proteins in eps also played an essential role in forming and maintaining of biofilm meanwhile the decrease of ps and the increase of redox substances outer membrane cytochromes redox groups and humic acids substances in eps could improve the electron transfer efficiency during the te iv bioreduction 3 3 analysis of microbial metabolic activity atp played a vital role in eps secretion and pollutant removal yan et al 2016 furthermore atp content can be used as a critical index to evaluate microbial metabolic activity therefore it was necessary to understand the changes of atp content in sar as shown in fig 4 a atp content was 9 45 11 57 12 12 20 04 and 21 13 mg vss in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively atp content in phase ⅴ was significantly higher than that in phase ⅰ p 0 001 the gradual increase of atp content meant that the bacteria in sar still had good metabolic activity and could provide more energy for eps secretion biofilm formation te iv bioreduction and other physiological processes even under the condition of high te iv concentration the increase of atp content may be due to the improvement of cell membrane permeability dehghani et al 2018 and the cell membrane permeability was measured in this study as shown in fig 4b the concentration of o nitrophenol was 28 89 34 44 36 00 40 44 and 51 78 μmol l in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively with the increase of te iv concentration the concentration of o nitrophenol in phase ⅴ increased significantly p 0 001 this indicated that the cell membrane permeability was improved in sar the improvement of cell membrane permeability made it easier for bacteria to absorb nutrients to promote atp synthesis and increase metabolic activity during the te iv bioreduction in sar what s more the basis of microbial metabolic activity is redox reaction driven by electron transfer which often occurs in the te iv bioreduction process blenkinsopp and lock 1990 thus the microbial metabolic activity was characterized by analyzing etsa etsa was 5 10 3 32 6 86 9 37 and 9 39 μg mg h in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively compared with the etsa in phase ⅰ the etsa in phase ⅴ increased significantly p 0 001 fig 4c the results showed that the increased etsa may be due to the improvement of cell membrane permeability of bacteria during the te iv bioreduction which was beneficial to electron transfer mediated by electron shuttles such as redox substances in eps modestra mohan 2014 therefore the elevated etsa during the te iv bioreduction which increased microbial metabolic activity and contributed to the excellent te iv bioreduction furthermore the microbial metabolic activity is affected by the te iv toxicity some researchers have proposed that the te iv toxicity is attributed to oxidative stress caused by the production of reactive oxygen species ros when cells are exposed to te iv and antioxidant enzymes are essential to eliminate the harmful effects of excess ros presentato et al 2019 therefore the changes of antioxidant enzymes cat and nadh activity were further used to explore how microorganisms in sar responded to the oxidative stress to maintain their metabolic activity the cat activity was 37 20 45 61 60 43 71 54 and 76 01 u g in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively fig 4d the results suggested that cat activity increased significantly in phase ⅴ p 0 001 and cat played an important role in protecting cells from oxidative stress in sar to be specific this was mainly to enhance the resistance to te iv toxicity by promoting the production of antioxidant enzyme cat so as to reduce cell damage besides electron transport chain etc is one of the main sites of ros production in bacterial cells and nadh is related to ros elimination thus nadh activity was detected the nadh activity was 1 97 1 58 1 35 1 10 and 0 69 u g in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively fig 4e the significantly decreased nadh activity in phase ⅴ p 0 001 suggested that an effective cell metabolism strategy to avoid aggravating oxidative stress may reduce the electron flux through etc by reducing the level of the pro oxidative metabolite nadh lemire et al 2017 hence microorganisms could maintain their metabolic activity by adjusting the activity of cat and nadh to enhance their antioxidant capacity when dealing with te iv toxicity in sar in summary the schematic diagram of microbial metabolic activity during te iv bioreduction was showed in fig 4f the increase of atp production in sar was conducive to metabolic activity and the increase of cell membrane permeability was conducive to electron transfer mediated by autocrine electron shuttles thus leading to the increase of etsa in addition the enhanced cat and nadh activity increased oxidative stress resistance thus maintaining the metabolic activity in sar 3 4 analysis of key enzymes activity in previous reports the process of te iv bioreduction depends on nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir is responsible for reducing se iv wang et al 2018b because of the similar chemical properties of te iv and se iv nir may also be involved in te iv bioreduction therefore the key enzymes activity nar and nir activity involved in te iv bioreduction were studied in sar as shown in fig 5 a nar activity in phases ⅰ ⅴ was 0 84 1 47 1 48 1 49 and 1 67 u g respectively nir activity was 0 51 0 62 0 65 0 84 and 1 00 u g respectively fig 5b the results showed that the nar and nir activity significantly increased in phase ⅴ p 0 001 with the increase of te iv concentration this indicated that nar and nir participated in the te iv bioreduction in sar and the increase of nar and nir activity may be related to the high expression of nar and nir genes napa and nirs he et al 2021 it was possible that besides nar and nir enzymes involved in sulfur oxidation may also be related to te iv bioreduction in sar it is reported that sdo is key enzyme in the process of sulfur oxidation camacho et al 2020 sulfur oxidizing bacteria would be enriched in sar discussed in section 3 5 which could autotrophically use elemental sulfur to obtain the energy necessary for growth by sulfur oxidation yin et al 2014 therefore it was great significance to study sulfur oxidation on the metabolic activity of bacteria the sdo activity in phases ⅰ ⅴ was 0 181 0 200 0 228 0 239 and 0 260 u g respectively fig 5c compared with phase ⅰ the sdo activity in phase ⅴ was significantly increased p 0 05 elemental sulfur is difficult to be utilized by microorganisms because of its poor water solubility and stable chemical properties the enhanced sdo activity indicated that autotrophic bacteria in sar made elemental sulfur easier to be bio oxidized thus with the improvement of sdo activity the bioavailability of elemental sulfur as an electron donor was greatly improved the increase of sdo activity was consistent with the increase of atp which indicated that it was beneficial for bacteria to use elemental sulfur to obtain energy for growth and metabolic activities moreover the process of oxidizing elemental sulfur first needs to be activated the activation process will produce hydrogen sulfide which has toxic effects on a variety of microbial metabolic processes and the generation of hydrogen sulfide can mainly be metabolized by sqr wang et al 2018a hence sqr activity involved in sulfur oxidation process was examined sqr activity was 1 368 1 445 1 631 1 723 and 2 110 u g in phases ⅱ ⅴ respectively fig 5d with the increase of te iv concentration sqr activity in phase ⅴ was increased significantly p 0 01 this result suggested that the increase of sqr activity could reduce the toxicity caused by sulfur oxidation process in sar and thus maintained the normal metabolic activity of bacteria 3 5 microbial community and quorum sensing analysis 3 5 1 dynamic analysis of microbial community in order to know more about the specific role of different bacteria in te iv bioreduction in sar the diversity and richness of the microbial community were analyzed table s2 shannon index and simpson index can be used to evaluate the microbial diversity of microbial community in phases ⅰ ⅴ simpson indices of microbial community were 0 028 0 017 0 012 0 010 and 0 008 respectively shannon indices of microbial community were 4 953 5 250 5 463 5 601 and 5 754 in phases ⅰ ⅴ respectively the lower simpson index and the higher shannon index indicated the increase of microbial diversity in sar moreover chao 1 index and ace index can be used as indicators of microbial richness in phases ⅰ ⅴ chao 1 indices were 1403 211 1415 437 1524 123 1586 180 and 1632 298 respectively ace indices were 1408 286 1424 621 1525 551 1606 326 and 1693 941 respectively therefore the results showed that chao 1 indices and ace indices in sar increased continuously with the increase of te iv concentration indicating that the richness of microbial community also increased all in all the increase of diversity and richness of microbial community revealed that microorganisms adapted to the changes of te iv concentration through domestication and enrichment to further elucidate the succession of microbial community the dynamic changes of microbial community composition were analyzed at the phylum level fig 6 a proteobacteria 40 53 64 16 chloroflexi 4 24 16 32 bacteroidetes 5 06 10 24 were dominant in phases ⅰ ⅴ these dominant bacteria were widely found in wastewater treatment such as autotrophic nitrogen removal by sulfur and anaerobic digestion of sludge li et al 2018 studies have shown that many extracellular respiratory microorganisms belong to proteobacteria such as geobacter the model bacteria of extracellular respiration which could use metal as an electron acceptor for bioreduction therefore the composition of the microbial community was discussed in detail at the genus level fig 6b we found that geobacter increased from 0 060 in phase ⅰ to 2 834 in phase ⅴ with the increase of te iv concentration moreover the relative abundance of electroactive bacteria geothrix increased from 0 064 to 3 091 geobacter and geothrix may grow intermediate metabolites utilized by autotrophic bacteria as electron donors wang et al 2021 the geobacter s high conductivity fimbriae and biofilm may contribute to electron transfer lovley et al 2011 so as to improve the te iv bioreduction performance and fill ecological niches in sar the increase in geothrix may be because of that geothrix adapted to the change of the environment in sar and geothrix may secrete several redox active substances as electron shuttles for electron transfer to achieve excellent te iv bioreduction performance dulon et al 2006 in addition thiobacillus ignavibacterium acidithiobacillus thermomonas thiomonas and rhodanobacter were all enriched in the identified genera according to reports geobacter thiobacillus and ignavibacterium had been found in arsenic rich groundwater and had potential roles in arsenic mobilization jean das 2016 thiobacillus and ignavibacterium may use humic acids substancesas an electron shuttle to transfer electrons chai et al 2020 thermomonas could use inorganic carbon to reduce pollutants without organic matter xing et al 2018 so enrichment of these bacteria meant that they had the ability to reduce heavy metal ions with high concentration simultaneously bacteria related to sulfur oxidation appeared in sar including thiobacillus ignavibacterium rhodanobacter and acidithiobacillus ignavibacterium and thiobacillus could metabolize sulfide and remove pollutants at the same time zheng et al 2020 furthermore rhodanobacter was also found in highly polluted areas in previous studies indicating that rhodanobacter had good tolerance to heavy metals and could oxidize reducing sulfides koh et al 2015 more importantly acidithiobacillus could support autotrophic growth by using elemental sulfur and various inorganic sulfur compounds acidithiobacillus had lived in harsh environment for a long time and adapted to sudden and long term pressure changes in various environments zhang et al 2016b therefore the enrichment of acidithiobacillus indicated that they adapt to various ecological niches with high te iv concentration and some gene clusters that may encode functional enzymes had been identified in genomics indicating that acidithiobacillus had the ability to cope with high concentration of heavy metal ions zhang et al 2016a as a result acidithiobacillus could adapt and survive quickly when dealing with the pressure of te iv in sar in summary after 110 days of operation of sar different bacteria had formed a symbiont the microbial communities related to electrochemically active heavy metal reduction and sulfur oxidation could cooperate with each other to complete the te iv bioreduction process which made the performance of the sar operate well 3 5 2 analysis of quorum sensing quorum sensing mediated by signal molecules is an important means of information communication among bacteria and the change of community structure may be regulated by signal molecules maddela et al 2019 c10 hsl and c14 hsl had been found in sar fig 6c in phases ⅰ ⅴ the concentrations of c10 hsl were 161 626 58 724 62 822 132 644 and 143 741 μg l respectively the results showed that c10 hsl decreased significantly in phase ⅴ p 0 05 with the increase of te iv concentration the concentrations of c14 hsl were not detected in phases ⅰ ⅱ but increased significantly p 0 001 to 29 2948 and 42 2428 μg l in phases ⅳ ⅴ c14 hsl was not detected in phases ⅰ ⅱ which may be due to the fact that bacteria did not need to secrete c14 hsl to regulate the change of microbial community c10 hsl and c14 hsl were typical signal molecules in sludge and biofilm these results indicated that the secretion of c10 hsl and c14 hsl may mediate the te iv bioreduction by microbial community in sar according to previous reports microbial information exchange mediated by a quorum sensing system is a critical communication mode among bacteria and can regulate the survival strategies and group behaviors of microorganisms schuster et al 2013 which are important guarantees for the survival of microorganisms in complex environments therefore the functional microbial community secreted a large number of c10 hsl and c14 hsl with the increase of te iv concentration which activated their community behavior and regulated their cooperation with other populations to cope with the change of external environment hence c10 hsl and c14 hsl may regulate the structure of microbial community to achieve excellent performance of te iv bioreduction 3 6 possible mechanism and prospect based on the experimental results of eps functions microbial metabolic activity key enzyme activity microbial community and quorum sensing a mechanism diagram was established to illustrate the synergistic mechanism of te iv bioreduction in sar fig 7 firstly at the level of microbial community succession and quorum sensing c10 hsl and c14 hsl were secreted in large quantities for the information exchange among bacteria in response to te iv stress in phases ⅱ ⅴ thereby achieving regulation of sulfur oxidizing bacteria thiobacillus ignavibacterium rhodanobacter and acidithiobacillus heavy metal reducing bacteria thiobacillus ignavibacterium acidithiobacillus thermomonas thiomonas rhodanobacter and geobacter and electroactive bacteria geobacter and geothrix electroactive bacteria might form the conductive network to promote long distance transport between microorganisms and may also produce filamentous appendages or nanotubes as electronic channels to promote electron transfer thus actively promoting the te iv bioreduction jiang et al 2020 li et al 2021 secondly at the level of eps role the decrease of ps and the increase of outer membrane cytochromes and redox groups in eps could promote the electron transfer of bacteria thirdly at the level of microbial metabolic activity the secreted humic acids substances of geobacter and some secreted electron shuttles of geothrix could also promote electron transfer which meant that etsa could be increased moreover the improvement of cell membrane permeability was also beneficial to electron transfer mediated by electron shuttle thus promoting the increase of etsa oxidative stress associated with ros could be eliminated by cat and nadh in cells during the te iv bioreduction finally at the level of key enzyme activity nar and nir could catalyze the te iv bioreduction indicating that te iv may be reduced by replacing nitrogen compounds through nitrite and nitrate reduction pathways furthermore acidithiobacillus used elemental sulfur to grow and generate energy chen et al 2012 and the enhanced sdo activity made elemental sulfur more easily utilized by acidithiobacillus to generate atp atp provided energy for microbial metabolic activities such as eps synthesis sqr could reduce the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide produced during sulfur oxidation and thiobacillus ignavibacterium and rhodanobacter could use the produced sulfide during sulfur oxidation to grow therefore in sar microorganisms could not only make better use of elemental sulfur to promote their own growth through sulfur oxidation but also actively respond to the impact of increasing te iv concentration through the synergistic interaction among eps functions microbial metabolic activity key enzyme activity microbial community succession and quorum sensing so as to obtain excellent te iv bioreduction performance in general the excellent te iv bioreduction performance in sar was not only achieved by a certain way but was the result of synergy of microorganisms through complex processes in a word it was feasible to bioreduce te iv by sar in the future this may inspire researchers to promote and apply the proposed sar in field environment to treat other heavy metal wastewater and devote to the application of engineering technology not only in industrial wastewater treatment but also in the remediation of groundwater contaminated by te iv at present there are few pure culture bacteria related to the te iv bioreduction which can separate and purify strains with a strong ability to reduce te iv from the microbial community in the sar to enrich and broaden the understanding of te iv bioreduction functional bacteria more importantly outer membrane cytochromes in autotrophic bacteria have been reported to mediate the electron transfer in the process of iron oxidation beckwith et al 2015 liu et al 2012 percak dennett et al 2017 however the specific electron transfer process that outer membrane cytochromes participate in sulfur oxidation needs further exploration nitrate and heavy metals are often co contaminated in groundwater lee et al 2015 li krumholz 2008 sar may provide a new strategy for the simultaneous removal of nitrate and te iv in groundwater in addition te iv can be reduced by microorganisms to produce tellurium nanoparticles tenps which can be used as valuable nanomaterials in various fields because of their attractive photoelectric properties baesman et al 2009 tenps continuously produced in sar can be extracted by physical method e g ultra high speed centrifugation and other methods mal et al 2017 this provides new opportunities for sustainable energy production and bioremediation 4 conclusions in this study the bioreduction performance and synergistic mechanism of te iv in sar were examined for the first time the results showed that sar could efficiently reduce te iv concentration up to 30 mg l and conformed to the first order kinetic model when the sar responded to te iv stress the secretion of redox substances outer membrane cytochromes redox groups and humic acids substances in eps and the improvement of cell membrane permeability played a positive role in enhancing etsa the increase of atp enhanced the metabolic activity of microorganisms and provided energy in addition this stud confirmed that key enzymes played a significant role in antioxidation cat and nadh te iv bioreduction nar and nir and sulfur oxidation sqr and sdo processes the changes of microbial community may be related to c10 hsl and c14 hsl in conclusion efficient te iv bioreduction could be achieved through the synergistic effect of eps microbial metabolic activity key enzyme activity microbial community and quorum sensing in sar the results of this study provided a novel and feasible method for the effective removal of te iv pollutant
