control 2 material and methods 2 1 study area zhong river watershed 2698 km2 31 20 31 63 n 119 08 119 75 e is located in the west of lake taihu basin lower reach of yangtze river china fig 1 its annual average temperature and precipitation were 16 1 c and 1186 6 mm yr 2000 2020 respectively the watershed has a mountain lowland mixed landscape with the lowland areas accounting for 46 5 of the total area cui et al 2022 there are 171 polders 613 km2 in the region accounting for 62 of the lowland areas with land use types including surface water 21 0 residential area 17 2 paddy land 56 3 and dry land 5 5 82 of these polders were dominated by agricultural activities with rice wheat cropping systems the amount of n p fertilizers applied to the rice and wheat rotations was as large as 33 3 and 14 6 kg ha yr respectively zhu and jin 2013 2 2 model descriptions and datasets phosphorus dynamic model for lowland polder systems pdp and nitrogen dynamic model for lowland polder systems ndp developed by huang et al 2016 and huang et al 2018 were used to describe n p dynamics in 171 polders in pdp and ndp models physical and biological processes in the water area were described with a daily time step compared with the previous watershed models e g swat and hspf pdp and ndp models include specific mechanisms describing the artificial drainage i e irrigation flood and culvert drainage and water exchange among surface water groundwater and soil water in farmlands fig s2 there are six modules in pdp and ndp models dry land water area residential area paddy land water management and nutrient balance modules zhang et al 2022 n p dynamic modules of different land use types were calculated in detail fig s2 including 1 atmospheric deposition n p load from livestock and people in residential area 2 settling releasing and plant n p uptake in water bodies 3 fertilizer application irrigation erosion n p form transformation and crop harvest in agricultural land 4 export of water n p to surrounding streams through seepage and artificial drainage the model was set up and run for each polder with the inputs of land use tn tp concentrations in the connected rivers and meteorological data these two models have been evaluated using a measured dataset 2014 2016 collected from a typical agricultural polder polder jian in our study area and achieved an acceptable performance coefficient of determination 0 55 in fig s3 the polders in lake taihu basin have similar properties e g irrigation flood and culvert drainage strategies etc and there are limited changes in land use residential lifestyle and social industrial patterns in the study area during the study period therefore the calibrated parameters table s1 and s2 in the typical polder were used for all 171 polders the required data for model development include land use meteorological and water quality data table 1 the land use data were derived from satellite images with a 30 m resolution during 1980 2020 one for each decade the water quality data included monthly tn tp concentrations during 2014 2020 and were obtained from 12 sampling sites in connected rivers fig 1 the data represented the tn tp conditions in the connected rivers and were used for model inputs and calibration 2 3 quantifying the drivers of polder n p sources and sinks previous studies revealed that watershed n p loss is greatly affected by precipitation tn tp in connected rivers and land use hanrahan et al 2021 huang et al 2018 shrestha et al 2018 based on the developed models pdp and ndp 58 scenarios table s3 with various combinations of natural and anthropogenic drivers were simulated to estimate n p exports and retention for 171 polders in zhong river watershed fig 2 among these 58 scenarios 41 scenarios sim pr1 41 aimed to simulate the n p exports under different precipitation conditions during 1980 2020 12 scenarios sim wq1 12 aimed to simulate the n p exports under different tn tp concentrations in connected rivers we counted the tn tp concentrations of 12 water sampling sites and referred to the changes of that in lake taihu basin from 1980 to 2020 chen et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 and set 12 scenarios with varying tn tp concentration intervals ranging from 0 2 to 5 5 and 0 02 to 0 55 mg l respectively 5 scenarios sim lucc1 5 aimed to simulate the n p exports under different land use conditions during 1980 2020 except for scenario variables all other drivers were from 2020 table s3 3 results 3 1 n p sources and sinks of the polders the investigated polders had a large n p load 2450 and 106 t yr and loss intensity 38 37 and 1 75 kg ha yr in 2020 with a complex spatial pattern fig 3 in 171 polders 7 0 and 11 7 of n and p loss intensity were 30 and 1 6 kg ha yr respectively the n p loss intensity were higher in 84 and 88 polders compared to the average level accounting for 49 1 and 51 5 respectively the estimated polders n p load is comparable with other studies in lake taihu basin liu et al 2020 lu et al 2022 wang et al 2022b yuan et al 2011 and significantly higher top 10 than that from previous case studies worldwide table s4 polder n p loss mainly depends on precipitation tn tp concentrations in connected rivers of polders fig 4 there is a significant increase in the number of polders with high n p sources when the rainy season may september precipitation and tn tp in connected rivers of the polders have a threshold of 950 mm yr 0 2 and 0 02 mg l fig 4 a and b the average loss intensity 38 37 and 1 75 kg ha yr for tn tp for these polders were taken as the critical point of the high n p sources when the rainy season precipitation was 750 mm yr the number of polders with high n p sources increased slowly when the rainy season precipitation reached 950 mm yr there was a significant increase in the number 106 and 56 in 2016 the rainy season precipitation reached the highest in all years 1430 7 mm yr the number reached a peak 153 and 170 when tn tp in connected rivers of the polders were 0 2 and 0 02 mg l there were 153 and 169 polders with high n p sources with the increase of tn tp concentrations the number decreased significantly fig 4 c and d when the precipitation and tn tp in connected rivers were fixed the land use change was not a significant driver for the conversion of the amount fig 4 e and f 3 2 response of polder n p loss to natural and anthropogenic drivers precipitation has a greatest impact on polder n p loss followed by tn tp concentrations in connected rivers the standard deviation calculations of n p load variation of the three type scenarios were summarized in table 2 3 2 1 impact of precipitation on polder n p loss polder n p loss were positively related to the rainy season precipitation fig 5 compared with annual precipitation rainy season precipitation more highly p 0 001 r2 0 8 determined polder n p loss with a loss intensity increase of 6 05 and 0 28 kg ha yr for 100 mm increase of rainy season precipitation in 2011 the annual precipitation was moderately low during the study period but the rainy season precipitation 958 mm yr was significantly higher than other years the polder n p loss intensity were extremely large 41 36 and 2 16 kg ha yr on the seasonal scale fig s4 the trend of polder n p loss was autumn winter spring and summer the average daily n p loss intensity 13 5 and 0 71 kg km2 was highest in autumn july september during 1980 2020 the proportion of precipitation and n p loss in this period were 31 7 48 3 and 31 6 respectively in autumn and winter which is the wheat season culverts are open thus increasing the amount of n p exported through the culvert drainage in addition aquatic plants decay during this period increasing the transformation of n p in the water in contrast during the summer rice season the culvert drainage is closed due to the need for irrigation reducing the amount of n p exported through the culvert drainage route in addition high temperature increases the rate of denitrification which reduces the soluble n content variations in p loss and seasonal precipitation essentially coincide which is mainly due to the fact that p is mostly present in a dissolved state and precipitation directly affects the flushing of sediment and the leaching of p polder n p load were related to moderate rainfall days calculating the rainfall and corresponding annual polder n p load for 41 precipitation scenarios the n p load were positively related to the increase of rainy season precipitation p 0 001 fig 6 a b however under similar rainy season precipitation conditions precipitation pattern directly affected n p load the more days of moderate rainfall intensity daily precipitation 15 mm the lager the n p load fig 6 the effect of precipitation pattern on p load was particularly significant comparing the two scenarios with 800 and 900 mm yr precipitation in rainy season corresponding to 41 and 35 days of moderate rainfall respectively the scenario with more days of moderate rainfall corresponded to a larger p load fig 6 b and d 3 2 2 impact of nutrient conditions in the connected rivers on polder n p loss polder n p loss intensity decreased with the increase of tn tp concentrations in connected rivers of polders comparing the 12 scenarios polder n p loss intensity gradually decreased as the tn tp in connected rivers increased fig 7 for each 0 5 and 0 05 mg l increase in tn tp in connected rivers the polder n p loss intensity decreased by 0 55 and 0 05 kg ha yr the most significant fluctuation in n p loss intensity were observed when the tn tp ranged from 0 2 and 0 02 mg l to 0 5 and 0 05 mg l respectively with a reduction of 5 16 kg n ha yr and 0 11 kg p ha yr in this range changes of tn tp in connected rivers only affected certain polders especially those with lower loss intensity fig 7 this is most likely due to agricultural polders pumping water from the connected rivers for agricultural irrigation during the rice season the flow of the connected rivers is slow after entering the polders which has a significant effect on the retention of n p 3 2 3 impact of land use on polder n p loss polder n p loss intensity were positively related to farmland area but negatively related to surface water area fig 8 during 1980 2020 the regional proportion of surface water increased by 10 7 17 and the farmland decreased from 81 to 62 as land use evolved the polder n p loss intensity decreased by an average of 0 73 and 0 51 kg ha yr per decade the correlation between the four land use types surface water residential area paddy and dry land and polder n p loss were investigated fig 8 c and d as the percentage of farmland paddy and dry land increased the polder n p loss intensity increased significantly p 0 01 in addition n p loss intensity decreased with the increase of the proportion of surface water area fig 8d which indicated that surface water has a large potential in n p retention 4 discussion 4 1 underlying mechanism of polder n p loss the response of n p loss to natural and anthropogenic drivers is related to the loss pathway the transport of n p in the polders is dominated by irrigation seepage flood and culvert drainage which determine the response to precipitation tn tp concentrations in connected rivers and land use the high temperature and precipitation during the rainy season directly determine the magnitude and fluctuation of runoff which in turn drives the n p exports through culvert and flood drainage zhao et al 2011b with a high share of 61 8 of farmland in polders the contribution of n p fertilization dominated the n p sources in the polders huang et al 2018 in fact the underutilization 59 72 of n p fertilizers led to the storage and emission of surplus n p into the soil and water and sink into surrounding rivers and lakes through rainfall leaching and seepage yu and shi 2015 zhang et al 2008 in agricultural polders of zhong river watershed some farmers apply excessive fertilizer to obtain large yields a practice that reduces fertilizer utilization to 28 41 yu and shi 2015 zhang et al 2008 resulting in large amounts of fertilizer flowing into the surrounding freshwater and thus causing significant stress on downstream aquatic health mekonnen and hoekstra 2018 zou et al 2022 therefore appropriate fertilization practices especially avoiding over fertilization before heavy rainfall events are extremely critical for n p control blann et al 2009 a recent study concluded that a 15 25 reduction in n fertilizer application to summer rice fields does not significantly reduce average grain yield hofmeier et al 2015 in addition the high intensity of precipitation increased the scouring of surface n sediment entrainment and p leaching li et al 2022 yan and gao 2021 polder n p loss were most significant when the rainy season precipitation reaches 950 mm yr on the seasonal scale from july to september fig s4 which is the period of high intensity of n p loss attention should be paid to the storage and interception of high concentration of n p during the period of heavy rainfall there is a large difference of n p loss between polders lowland artificial watershed and mountain watersheds compared to mountain watersheds polders are relatively closed and have unique hydrological and nutrient transport processes fig s1 on the one hand the path of n p transport is uncertain in previous studies surface runoff was considered to be the main pathway of n p loss in mountain watersheds and it was more prominent during heavy rainfall with a single rainstorm contributing up to 90 of n p loss li et al 2022 wang et al 2022a in lake qiandao the p load into the lake accounts for 91 3 of the year during june and july when heavy rainfall is concentrated li et al 2022 however in the polders only 60 of the n p loss occur during the rainy season on the other hand the n p transport process are discontinuous in contrast to the natural slope forming catchment process in the mountain watersheds apostel et al 2021 francesconi et al 2016 the hydrological process in polders is divided by dikes and pumping stations fig s2 huang et al 2020 wang et al 2007 during the rice season water is diverted through culverts and pumping stations to meet the irrigation needs of the rice fields this route artificially changed the process of n p transport and is an important way for n p input from the connected rivers during heavy rainfall the polder ground elevation is lower than the water level of connected rivers it is necessary to drain water through the flood pumping station which is an important way to export n p from polders fig s2 4 2 polders n p sources or sinks the investigated polders were the major n p sources for their surrounding rivers and lakes the polder n p loss intensity were at the top level top 10 in previous studies in lake taihu basin and other regions table s4 the loss intensity of n p in the polder jian one of the polders of the study area were 56 7 and 1 14 kg ha yr huang et al 2018 huang et al 2016 which coincides with the quantified results of this study the investigated polders in zhong river watershed had a large n p loss intensity 38 37 and 1 75 kg ha yr it is of concern that the loss intensity of tn is much higher than the average level in lake taihu basin 15 33 kg ha yr huang et al 2020 huang et al 2017 the tp loss intensity was similar to other typical areas in lake taihu basin for example the tp loss intensity was 1 75 kg ha yr in agricultural lands of a town located in lake taihu basin and ranged from 1 63 to 4 92 kg ha yr in xitiaoxi watershed guo et al 2004 zhao et al 2012 among the 171 polders in zhong river watershed there were 84 and 88 polders had a higher n p loss intensity compared with the average level which were related to the high population density and intensive agriculture in the polders luo et al 2007 polders can be sources or sinks for surrounding rivers precipitation tn tp in connected rivers were characterized as the sensitive factors driving polder n p loss it is necessary to strengthen the generalization and optimization of rainwater disposal systems in the polders during rice season may september a large amount of agricultural fertilizers were applied on the one hand intense rainfall increases erosion and the washing away of excess nutrients from the soil on the other hand excessive n p infiltrates into the surrounding rivers and lakes causes the polder n p load to peak during the rainy season therefore intensifying precipitation collection and treatment during heavy rainfall and avoiding fertilization before heavy rainfall events can effectively reduce n p erosion by rainwater meanwhile monitoring and controlling of n p concentrations in polders and connected rivers should be strengthened in the future to prevent polders from sinks to sources in addition surface water retention and plant absorption are essential ways to reduce n p qin et al 2016 xue et al 2020 utilizing the dikes and ponds rationally and improving plant cover is not negligible for polders n p sources to sinks fisher and acreman 2004 land et al 2016 4 3 implications for environmental management lowland polders and mountain watersheds require specific measures to control n p existing n p controls are mainly based on administrative districts which do not scientifically integrate nutrient transport patterns liu et al 2016 zeng et al 2020 moreover it is not practical to prevent and control the entire river basin given the economic costs and implementation difficulties the polder is a physical unit that has been formed over thousands of years it can be used as an ideal unit for non point source pollution control in agriculture due to its clear spatial boundaries and adjustable water volume which facilitates tracking of water quantities pollutant sources and transport processes huang et al 2018 it can be seen that in the future the reduction the n p reduction mode of the polders can be explored based on the characteristics of artificially controlled sluice pump and the long retention time in the polders developing targeted management techniques for farmland surface water and other constituent units to maximize n p retention polders with ditch pond landscape have a large potential in n p retention most of the surface water in the polders are ditches and ponds which are well positioned to intercept fertilizer runoff and pollutants powers et al 2013 a summary of 31 ditches and ponds in china on nutrients showed that the mean values of n p retention were as high as 47 9 and 45 1 respectively fig s5 the flat terrain of polders and the slow flow of water in ditches and ponds are conducive to the natural deposition of particulate n p cui et al 2022 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 at the same time large aquatic plants are widely distributed in ditches and ponds which can absorb n p from the water column provide carbon sources promote denitrification and enhance n p retention capacity fisher and acreman 2004 sun et al 2021 the drainage of ditches and ponds to the surrounding rivers is concentrated during heavy rainfall during low and medium rainfall agricultural tailwater discharges are retained in ditches and ponds and not directly discharged into rivers outside the polders which is conducive to n p retention huang et al 2016 therefore enhancing polder n p retention is a promising direction for nutrient control 5 conclusions n p loss and its underlying mechanisms in 171 lowland artificial watersheds polder were investigated via process based modelling our model practices revealed that polders had a large n p loss intensity 38 37 and 1 75 kg ha yr for their surrounding rivers and lakes polder n p loss were highly related to rainy season precipitation and tn tp concentrations in connected rivers with a threshold value of 950 mm yr 0 2 and 0 02 mg l respectively compared with annual precipitation rainy season precipitation more highly p 0 001 r2 0 8 determined polder n p loss our analysis on the underlying mechanisms of n p for the unique watershed systems polders revealed their large potential in n p retention due to their dike pond landscape given the large difference of n p loss in lowland and mountain watersheds more specific

of water n p to surrounding streams through seepage and artificial drainage the model was set up and run for each polder with the inputs of land use tn tp concentrations in the connected rivers and meteorological data these two models have been evaluated using a measured dataset 2014 2016 collected from a typical agricultural polder polder jian in our study area and achieved an acceptable performance coefficient of determination 0 55 in fig s3 the polders in lake taihu basin have similar properties e g irrigation flood and culvert drainage strategies etc and there are limited changes in land use residential lifestyle and social industrial patterns in the study area during the study period therefore the calibrated parameters table s1 and s2 in the typical polder were used for all 171 polders the required data for model development include land use meteorological and water quality data table 1 the land use data were derived from satellite images with a 30 m resolution during 1980 2020 one for each decade the water quality data included monthly tn tp concentrations during 2014 2020 and were obtained from 12 sampling sites in connected rivers fig 1 the data represented the tn tp conditions in the connected rivers and were used for model inputs and calibration 2 3 quantifying the drivers of polder n p sources and sinks previous studies revealed that watershed n p loss is greatly affected by precipitation tn tp in connected rivers and land use hanrahan et al 2021 huang et al 2018 shrestha et al 2018 based on the developed models pdp and ndp 58 scenarios table s3 with various combinations of natural and anthropogenic drivers were simulated to estimate n p exports and retention for 171 polders in zhong river watershed fig 2 among these 58 scenarios 41 scenarios sim pr1 41 aimed to simulate the n p exports under different precipitation conditions during 1980 2020 12 scenarios sim wq1 12 aimed to simulate the n p exports under different tn tp concentrations in connected rivers we counted the tn tp concentrations of 12 water sampling sites and referred to the changes of that in lake taihu basin from 1980 to 2020 chen et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 and set 12 scenarios with varying tn tp concentration intervals ranging from 0 2 to 5 5 and 0 02 to 0 55 mg l respectively 5 scenarios sim lucc1 5 aimed to simulate the n p exports under different land use conditions during 1980 2020 except for scenario variables all other drivers were from 2020 table s3 3 results 3 1 n p sources and sinks of the polders the investigated polders had a large n p load 2450 and 106 t yr and loss intensity 38 37 and 1 75 kg ha yr in 2020 with a complex spatial pattern fig 3 in 171 polders 7 0 and 11 7 of n and p loss intensity were 30 and 1 6 kg ha yr respectively the n p loss intensity were higher in 84 and 88 polders compared to the average level accounting for 49 1 and 51 5 respectively the estimated polders n p load is comparable with other studies in lake taihu basin liu et al 2020 lu et al 2022 wang et al 2022b yuan et al 2011 and significantly higher top 10 than that from previous case studies worldwide table s4 polder n p loss mainly depends on precipitation tn tp concentrations in connected rivers of polders fig 4 there is a significant increase in the number of polders with high n p sources when the rainy season may september precipitation and tn tp in connected rivers of the polders have a threshold of 950 mm yr 0 2 and 0 02 mg l fig 4 a and b the average loss intensity 38 37 and 1 75 kg ha yr for tn tp for these polders were taken as the critical point of the high n p sources when the rainy season precipitation was 750 mm yr the number of polders with high n p sources increased slowly when the rainy season precipitation reached 950 mm yr there was a significant increase in the number 106 and 56 in 2016 the rainy season precipitation reached the highest in all years 1430 7 mm yr the number reached a peak 153 and 170 when tn tp in connected rivers of the polders were 0 2 and 0 02 mg l there were 153 and 169 polders with high n p sources with the increase of tn tp concentrations the number decreased significantly fig 4 c and d when the precipitation and tn tp in connected rivers were fixed the land use change was not a significant driver for the conversion of the amount fig 4 e and f 3 2 response of polder n p loss to natural and anthropogenic drivers precipitation has a greatest impact on polder n p loss followed by tn tp concentrations in connected rivers the standard deviation calculations of n p load variation of the three type scenarios were summarized in table 2 3 2 1 impact of precipitation on polder n p loss polder n p loss were positively related to the rainy season precipitation fig 5 compared with annual precipitation rainy season precipitation more highly p 0 001 r2 0 8 determined polder n p loss with a loss intensity increase of 6 05 and 0 28 kg ha yr for 100 mm increase of rainy season precipitation in 2011 the annual precipitation was moderately low during the study period but the rainy season precipitation 958 mm yr was significantly higher than other years the polder n p loss intensity were extremely large 41 36 and 2 16 kg ha yr on the seasonal scale fig s4 the trend of polder n p loss was autumn winter spring and summer the average daily n p loss intensity 13 5 and 0 71 kg km2 was highest in autumn july september during 1980 2020 the proportion of precipitation and n p loss in this period were 31 7 48 3 and 31 6 respectively in autumn and winter which is the wheat season culverts are open thus increasing the amount of n p exported through the culvert drainage in addition aquatic plants decay during this period increasing the transformation of n p in the water in contrast during the summer rice season the culvert drainage is closed due to the need for irrigation reducing the amount of n p exported through the culvert drainage route in addition high temperature increases the rate of denitrification which reduces the soluble n content variations in p loss and seasonal precipitation essentially coincide which is mainly due to the fact that p is mostly present in a dissolved state and precipitation directly affects the flushing of sediment and the leaching of p polder n p load were related to moderate rainfall days calculating the rainfall and corresponding annual polder n p load for 41 precipitation scenarios the n p load were positively related to the increase of rainy season precipitation p 0 001 fig 6 a b however under similar rainy season precipitation conditions precipitation pattern directly affected n p load the more days of moderate rainfall intensity daily precipitation 15 mm the lager the n p load fig 6 the effect of precipitation pattern on p load was particularly significant comparing the two scenarios with 800 and 900 mm yr precipitation in rainy season corresponding to 41 and 35 days of moderate rainfall respectively the scenario with more days of moderate rainfall corresponded to a larger p load fig 6 b and d 3 2 2 impact of nutrient conditions in the connected rivers on polder n p loss polder n p loss intensity decreased with the increase of tn tp concentrations in connected rivers of polders comparing the 12 scenarios polder n p loss intensity gradually decreased as the tn tp in connected rivers increased fig 7 for each 0 5 and 0 05 mg l increase in tn tp in connected rivers the polder n p loss intensity decreased by 0 55 and 0 05 kg ha yr the most significant fluctuation in n p loss intensity were observed when the tn tp ranged from 0 2 and 0 02 mg l to 0 5 and 0 05 mg l respectively with a reduction of 5 16 kg n ha yr and 0 11 kg p ha yr in this range changes of tn tp in connected rivers only affected certain polders especially those with lower loss intensity fig 7 this is most likely due to agricultural polders pumping water from the connected rivers for agricultural irrigation during the rice season the flow of the connected rivers is slow after entering the polders which has a significant effect on the retention of n p 3 2 3 impact of land use on polder n p loss polder n p loss intensity were positively related to farmland area but negatively related to surface water area fig 8 during 1980 2020 the regional proportion of surface water increased by 10 7 17 and the farmland decreased from 81 to 62 as land use evolved the polder n p loss intensity decreased by an average of 0 73 and 0 51 kg ha yr per decade the correlation between the four land use types surface water residential area paddy and dry land and polder n p loss were investigated fig 8 c and d as the percentage of farmland paddy and dry land increased the polder n p loss intensity increased significantly p 0 01 in addition n p loss intensity decreased with the increase of the proportion of surface water area fig 8d which indicated that surface water has a large potential in n p retention 4 discussion 4 1 underlying mechanism of polder n p loss the response of n p loss to natural and anthropogenic drivers is related to the loss pathway the transport of n p in the polders is dominated by irrigation seepage flood and culvert drainage which determine the response to precipitation tn tp concentrations in connected rivers and land use the high temperature and precipitation during the rainy season directly determine the magnitude and fluctuation of runoff which in turn drives the n p exports through culvert and flood drainage zhao et al 2011b with a high share of 61 8 of farmland in polders the contribution of n p fertilization dominated the n p sources in the polders huang et al 2018 in fact the underutilization 59 72 of n p fertilizers led to the storage and emission of surplus n p into the soil and water and sink into surrounding rivers and lakes through rainfall leaching and seepage yu and shi 2015 zhang et al 2008 in agricultural polders of zhong river watershed some farmers apply excessive fertilizer to obtain large yields a practice that reduces fertilizer utilization to 28 41 yu and shi 2015 zhang et al 2008 resulting in large amounts of fertilizer flowing into the surrounding freshwater and thus causing significant stress on downstream aquatic health mekonnen and hoekstra 2018 zou et al 2022 therefore appropriate fertilization practices especially avoiding over fertilization before heavy rainfall events are extremely critical for n p control blann et al 2009 a recent study concluded that a 15 25 reduction in n fertilizer application to summer rice fields does not significantly reduce average grain yield hofmeier et al 2015 in addition the high intensity of precipitation increased the scouring of surface n sediment entrainment and p leaching li et al 2022 yan and gao 2021 polder n p loss were most significant when the rainy season precipitation reaches 950 mm yr on the seasonal scale from july to september fig s4 which is the period of high intensity of n p loss attention should be paid to the storage and interception of high concentration of n p during the period of heavy rainfall there is a large difference of n p loss between polders lowland artificial watershed and mountain watersheds compared to mountain watersheds polders are relatively closed and have unique hydrological and nutrient transport processes fig s1 on the one hand the path of n p transport is uncertain in previous studies surface runoff was considered to be the main pathway of n p loss in mountain watersheds and it was more prominent during heavy rainfall with a single rainstorm contributing up to 90 of n p loss li et al 2022 wang et al 2022a in lake qiandao the p load into the lake accounts for 91 3 of the year during june and july when heavy rainfall is concentrated li et al 2022 however in the polders only 60 of the n p loss occur during the rainy season on the other hand the n p transport process are discontinuous in contrast to the natural slope forming catchment process in the mountain watersheds apostel et al 2021 francesconi et al 2016 the hydrological process in polders is divided by dikes and pumping stations fig s2 huang et al 2020 wang et al 2007 during the rice season water is diverted through culverts and pumping stations to meet the irrigation needs of the rice fields this route artificially changed the process of n p transport and is an important way for n p input from the connected rivers during heavy rainfall the polder ground elevation is lower than the water level of connected rivers it is necessary to drain water through the flood pumping station which is an important way to export n p from polders fig s2 4 2 polders n p sources or sinks the investigated polders were the major n p sources for their surrounding rivers and lakes the polder n p loss intensity were at the top level top 10 in previous studies in lake taihu basin and other regions table s4 the loss intensity of n p in the polder jian one of the polders of the study area were 56 7 and 1 14 kg ha yr huang et al 2018 huang et al 2016 which coincides with the quantified results of this study the investigated polders in zhong river watershed had a large n p loss intensity 38 37 and 1 75 kg ha yr it is of concern that the loss intensity of tn is much higher than the average level in lake taihu basin 15 33 kg ha yr huang et al 2020 huang et al 2017 the tp loss intensity was similar to other typical areas in lake taihu basin for example the tp loss intensity was 1 75 kg ha yr in agricultural lands of a town located in lake taihu basin and ranged from 1 63 to 4 92 kg ha yr in xitiaoxi watershed guo et al 2004 zhao et al 2012 among the 171 polders in zhong river watershed there were 84 and 88 polders had a higher n p loss intensity compared with the average level which were related to the high population density and intensive agriculture in the polders luo et al 2007 polders can be sources or sinks for surrounding rivers precipitation tn tp in connected rivers were characterized as the sensitive factors driving polder n p loss it is necessary to strengthen the generalization and optimization of rainwater disposal systems in the polders during rice season may september a large amount of agricultural fertilizers were applied on the one hand intense rainfall increases erosion and the washing away of excess nutrients from the soil on the other hand excessive n p infiltrates into the surrounding rivers and lakes causes the polder n p load to peak during the rainy season therefore intensifying precipitation collection and treatment during heavy rainfall and avoiding fertilization before heavy rainfall events can effectively reduce n p erosion by rainwater meanwhile monitoring and controlling of n p concentrations in polders and connected rivers should be strengthened in the future to prevent polders from sinks to sources in addition surface water retention and plant absorption are essential ways to reduce n p qin et al 2016 xue et al 2020 utilizing the dikes and ponds rationally and improving plant cover is not negligible for polders n p sources to sinks fisher and acreman 2004 land et al 2016 4 3 implications for environmental management lowland polders and mountain watersheds require specific measures to control n p existing n p controls are mainly based on administrative districts which do not scientifically integrate nutrient transport patterns liu et al 2016 zeng et al 2020 moreover it is not practical to prevent and control the entire river basin given the economic costs and implementation difficulties the polder is a physical unit that has been formed over thousands of years it can be used as an ideal unit for non point source pollution control in agriculture due to its clear spatial boundaries and adjustable water volume which facilitates tracking of water quantities pollutant sources and transport processes huang et al 2018 it can be seen that in the future the reduction the n p reduction mode of the polders can be explored based on the characteristics of artificially controlled sluice pump and the long retention time in the polders developing targeted management techniques for farmland surface water and other constituent units to maximize n p retention polders with ditch pond landscape have a large potential in n p retention most of the surface water in the polders are ditches and ponds which are well positioned to intercept fertilizer runoff and pollutants powers et al 2013 a summary of 31 ditches and ponds in china on nutrients showed that the mean values of n p retention were as high as 47 9 and 45 1 respectively fig s5 the flat terrain of polders and the slow flow of water in ditches and ponds are conducive to the natural deposition of particulate n p cui et al 2022 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 at the same time large aquatic plants are widely distributed in ditches and ponds which can absorb n p from the water column provide carbon sources promote denitrification and enhance n p retention capacity fisher and acreman 2004 sun et al 2021 the drainage of ditches and ponds to the surrounding rivers is concentrated during heavy rainfall during low and medium rainfall agricultural tailwater discharges are retained in ditches and ponds and not directly discharged into rivers outside the polders which is conducive to n p retention huang et al 2016 therefore enhancing polder n p retention is a promising direction for nutrient control 5 conclusions n p loss and its underlying mechanisms in 171 lowland artificial watersheds polder were investigated via process based modelling our model practices revealed that polders had a large n p loss intensity 38 37 and 1 75 kg ha yr for their surrounding rivers and lakes polder n p loss were highly related to rainy season precipitation and tn tp concentrations in connected rivers with a threshold value of 950 mm yr 0 2 and 0 02 mg l respectively compared with annual precipitation rainy season precipitation more highly p 0 001 r2 0 8 determined polder n p loss our analysis on the underlying mechanisms of n p for the unique watershed systems polders revealed their large potential in n p retention due to their dike pond landscape given the large difference of n p loss in lowland and mountain watersheds more specific

1771,tracer transport in hydraulic fractures is substantially affected by the rock matrix surrounding them nevertheless there is not yet an expression in literature to address the relationship among the transport coefficients porous walls hydraulic fracture geometries and non newtonian fluid properties therefore the tracer dispersion due to non newtonian fluid flows in hydraulic fractures with different geometries and porous walls is mathematically derived and studied in the current work rectangular triangular and elliptical models and power law model are considered here to describe the hydraulic fracture geometry and the non newtonian fluid rheology respectively the results reveal that as the flow behavior index grows the coefficient of the shear dispersion term in the case of the shear thinning and newtonian fluids follows an order of triangular elliptical rectangular and in the case of the shear thickening while the same order is followed at the beginning it turns first to triangular rectangular elliptical then to rectangular triangular elliptical and finally to rectangular elliptical triangular the coefficient of the shear dispersion term increases sharply for each geometrical model with the flow behavior index when the fluid is shear thinning while it first increases slightly and then flattens when the fluid is shear thickening however the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for porous walls is lower than the one for nonporous walls it is also found that the average tracer dispersion coefficients in rectangular triangular and elliptical nonporous walled and porous walled hydraulic fractures and their ratio dictate that the hydraulic fracture rock matrix communication through the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux needs to be considered for determination of the tracer dispersion during the transition for intermediate peclet numbers and the advection dominated tracer transport for large peclet numbers this study along with its findings can pave the way for future investigations on the tracer dispersion in a network of hydraulic fractures with rough and porous walls keywords shear dispersion non newtonian fluids hydraulic fractures geometries porous walls data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction hydraulically fracturing technology has become a substantial part of north america in recent years due to the low mobility of fluids toward the wells in unconventional resources such as shale rocks dejam et al 2018 recently hydraulic fracturing of wells in tight reservoirs has changed the energy environment in china chen and liu 2023 a significant area of research in both academia and industry is to improve the understanding of tracer transport and mobility of fluid flow in hydraulically fractured reservoirs to improve production dejam 2019 these reservoirs exhibit a double porosity system comprising of a hydraulic fracture and a rock matrix which communicate with each other this communication is because of the porous nature of the rock matrix while the hydraulic fracture walls are porous they are not necessarily parallel dontsov 2016 therefore the hydraulic fracture can potentially have other geometries triangular elliptical etc rather than rectangular due to the geomechanical properties mainly the horizontal principal stress difference and the angle between the perforation orientation and the maximum horizontal stress zhang and chen 2009 furthermore the fluid which is used for the purpose of the hydraulic fracturing can be either newtonian in the case of water or non newtonian in the case of polymer solutions tracer dispersion resulted from newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows through conduits fractures tubes etc with a variety of wall conditions nonporous porous impermeable permeable etc have been extensively studied in the past first taylor 1953 addressed the tracer dispersion due to pressure driven flows of a newtonian fluid in a tube and found that it is proportional to pe 2 where pe is the peclet number defined as the ratio of the advection to the diffusion later aris 1956 studied the technique of moments to determine the tracer dispersion for generalized geometrical models subsequently taylor aris tracer dispersion has been broadly studied considering newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in conduits with different wall conditions which can be applied to numerous naturally and manually occurring processes in engineering and science including contamination of water in underground fractured rock aquifers dejam et al 2014 energy and rare element extraction from fractured geothermal porous media wei et al 2022 hydrocarbon production from fractured limestone and dolomite reservoirs jamili et al 2011 taking up nutrients in soils by plants through their root hairs gilroy and jones 2000 membrane separation of emulsions gu et al 2006 and delivery of drugs in vessel tissue systems beard and wu 2009 nevertheless the derivation of the tracer dispersion due to non newtonian fluid flows in porous walled hydraulic fractures with different geometries has not been addressed yet in literature therefore this is the objective of this study in the current work first the velocity profile for laminar non newtonian fluid flows across and along the hydraulic fracture is presented power law model and rectangular triangular and elliptical models are considered to describe the non newtonian fluid rheology and the hydraulic fracture geometry respectively then the two dimensional transient advection diffusion and one dimensional transient diffusion equations are used for addressing the tracer transport in the hydraulic fracture and rock matrix where these two media communicate through the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux at their interface applying the reynolds decomposition and cross sectional averaging techniques leads to a reduced order one dimensional transient advection dispersion tracer transport model due to non newtonian fluid flows in hydraulic fractures with different geometries and porous walls incorporating the tracer dispersion coefficient the resultant model can also provide the tracer dispersion coefficient for non newtonian fluid flows in nonporous walled hydraulic fractures which is in agreement with the previously reported one in literature finally different geometrical models rectangular triangular and elliptical are utilized to determine the expressions for the tracer dispersion caused by non newtonian fluid flows in hydraulic fractures with nonporous and porous walls the main applications of this study can be for characterization of tracer test mahadevan 2018 and evaluation of mass transfer during gas injection moridis and reagan 2021 in hydraulically fractured reservoirs this mathematical modeling along with its findings can be utilized as a new tool to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the tracer dispersion caused by non newtonian fluid flows through hydraulic fractures with different geometries and porous walls it can also be used for implementation in the existing simulators for better predictions in addition it can pave the way for further works on the tracer dispersion in a hydraulic fracture network considering the rough and porous nature of walls the rest of the study is structured as follows the mathematical model is first developed then the results are discussed followed by the conclusions 2 developed model 2 1 system and assumptions under study the system under study is a hydraulically fractured reservoir which is composed of a hydraulic fracture with a porosity of ϕf a half aperture of hf and a half length of ℓf and a rock matrix with a porosity of ϕm and a half thickness of hm the origins of dimensions x and z are assigned to the inlet and center of the hydraulic fracture which is symmetric about z 0 respectively rectangular triangular and elliptical geometries are considered for the hydraulic fracture as displayed in fig 1 a 1 c where hf and hm are constant for the first geometrical model while they vary along the hydraulic fracture for the other geometrical models as hf x and hm x regardless of the geometry the summation of hf and hm remains unchanged and equal to h the flowing single phase and incompressible fluid in the hydraulic fracture is non newtonian which is described by the power law model as the most user friendly and popular rheological model that represents a variety of non newtonian fluids the velocity profile in this model is controlled by the flow behavior index n 0 the fluid will exhibit shear thinning behavior if 0 n 1 examples are heavy oils drilling muds polymer solutions and colloidal suspensions the fluid will exhibit newtonian behavior if n 1 the fluid will exhibit shear thickening behavior if n 1 examples are water sand mixtures and water corn starch munson et al 2006 a non newtonian fluid carrying a tracer with a constant concentration cf 0 is introduced at the inlet of the hydraulic fracture 2 2 velocity profile under the action of laminar flow for non newtonian fluids which are described by the power law model the velocity profile across and along the hydraulic fracture uf can be found as follows 1 u f x z u f x 2 n 1 n 1 1 z h f x n 1 n where u f x is the cross sectional average velocity at each x along the hydraulic fracture and expressed by the following equation 2 u f x 0 h f x u f x z d z h f x u f ℓ f h f x n 1 n 0 ℓ f h f x n 1 n d x where u f is the total average velocity in the hydraulic fracture which can be derived by taking the axial average of u f x over ℓf and defined as 3 u f 1 ℓ f 0 ℓ f u f x d x 2 3 tracer transport the two dimensional transient advection diffusion equation for addressing the tracer transport due to non newtonian fluid flows in the hydraulic fracture can be derived as follows using the mass balance 4 t c f u f x z x c f d f xx c f zz c f where cf is the tracer concentration in the hydraulic fracture df is the effective molecular diffusivity in the hydraulic fracture and t is the time the one dimensional transient diffusion equation for addressing the tracer transport in the rock matrix can be derived as follows using the mass balance 5 t c m d m zz c m where cm is the tracer concentration in the rock matrix and dm is the effective molecular diffusivity in the rock matrix 2 4 conditions the description of the conditions for the tracer concentrations in the hydraulic fracture equation 1 and the rock matrix equation 5 is as follows initially the tracer concentrations in the system are zero which implies that cf x z t 0 cm z t 0 0 at the inlet of the hydraulic fracture the tracer concentration is constant resulting in cf x 0 z t cf 0 at the far end of the hydraulic fracture the tracer concentration is zero which leads to cf x z t 0 at the center of the hydraulic fracture the transversal tracer concentration gradient is zero implying that zcf x z 0 t 0 at the interface between the hydraulic fracture and the rock matrix there is the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux which results in cf x z hf x t cm z hf x t and dfϕf zcf x z hf x t dmϕm zcm z hf x t at the top boundary of the rock matrix the transversal tracer concentration gradient is zero leading to zcm z h t 0 2 5 reynolds decomposition and cross sectional averaging the reynolds decomposition bird et al 1960 of the tracer concentration and the velocity in the hydraulic fracture into the cross sectional average and the fluctuation is defined as follows to reduce the two dimensional transient advection diffusion tracer transport model due to non newtonian fluid flows in the hydraulic fracture equation 1 to a one dimensional transient advection dispersion tracer transport model due to non newtonian fluid flows in the hydraulic fracture 6 c f x z t u f x z c f x z t u f x c f x z t u f x z where c f 1 b x 0 b x c f d z is the cross sectional average of the tracer concentration in the hydraulic fracture and c f and u f are the fluctuations of the tracer concentration and the velocity in the hydraulic fracture where bird

the same order is followed at the beginning it turns first to triangular rectangular elliptical then to rectangular triangular elliptical and finally to rectangular elliptical triangular it is worth noting that the value of anp becomes stabilized as n approaches infinity this constant value of anp for each geometry of the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture can be derived mathematically using equations 32 34 as follows 44 lim a n p n 1 30 45 lim a n p n 2 75 46 lim a n p n 64 225 π 2 to obtain anp for the elliptical hydraulic fracture as n approaches infinity one should note that γ 3 2 π 2 γ 2 1 γ 3 2 and γ 7 2 15 π 8 spiegel et al 2012 the description of the coefficient of the shear dispersion term as a function of the flow behavior index due to newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in a nonporous walled rectangular hydraulic fracture using equation 32 was previously reported in literature dejam 2018 generally the value of anp grows sharply for each geometrical model of the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture when the fluid is shear thinning 0 n 1 while it first increases slightly and then flattens when the fluid is shear thickening n 1 the coefficient of the shear dispersion term ap versus the flow behavior index n due to newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in porous walled rectangular triangular and elliptical hydraulic fractures using equations 41 43 respectively is displayed in fig 3 it is revealed that for the shear thinning 0 n 1 and newtonian n 1 fluids in different hydraulic fracture geometries the magnitude of ap follows an order of triangular elliptical rectangular for the case of the newtonian fluid n 1 in porous walled triangular elliptical and rectangular hydraulic fractures ap 9 1225 36 6125 and 1 175 respectively dejam 2019 if the fluid shows shear thickening behavior n 1 while the same order will be followed at the beginning it will turn first to triangular rectangular elliptical then to rectangular triangular elliptical and finally to rectangular elliptical triangular as n becomes larger when n approaches infinity ap turns to flat using equations 41 43 the stabilized value of ap for each geometry of porous walled hydraulic fracture can be derived mathematically as follows 47 lim a p n 1 80 48 lim a p n 1 100 49 lim a p n 8 75 π 2 the coefficient of the shear dispersion term as a function of the flow behavior index due to newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in a porous walled rectangular hydraulic fracture using equation 41 was developed in the past dejam 2018 as a general outcome for each geometrical model of the porous walled hydraulic fracture the value of ap increases sharply in the case of the shear thinning fluid 0 n 1 while it first grows slightly and then becomes flat in the case of the shear thickening fluid n 1 3 2 effect of walls the effect of the nonporous and porous walls of the hydraulic fractures on the coefficient of the shear dispersion term can be evaluated through the definition of the ratio r ap anp of the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the porous walled hydraulic fracture ap to the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture anp using equations 32 and 41 for nonporous walled and porous walled rectangular hydraulic fractures equations 33 and 42 for nonporous walled and porous walled triangular hydraulic fractures and equations 34 and 43 for nonporous walled and porous walled elliptical hydraulic fractures will all result in the following formula to express r 50 r a p a np 3 n 2 4 n 1 fig 4 demonstrates the ratio r versus the flow behavior index n the results reveal that the value of r will grow sharply if n becomes larger in the case that the fluid exhibits shear thinning behavior 0 n 1 when the fluid is newtonian n 1 r 0 3 which was previously reported in literature dejam 2019 for the shear thickening fluid n 1 r first increases slightly and then flattens using equation 50 r 3 8 as n approaches infinity which was presented in the past dejam 2018 as it is clear from fig 4 the ratio is smaller than unity for the entire range of the flow behavior index r 1 which implies that the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the porous walled hydraulic fracture is lower than the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture ap anp this is attributed to the depletion of the tracer in the region close to the walls of the hydraulic fracture where the shear rate or velocity gradient is higher than the one in the central region of the hydraulic fracture by the porous rock matrix which causes the reduction in the shear rate or velocity gradient it is noted that the tracer dispersion decreases as the shear rate or velocity gradient becomes smaller therefore the tracer dispersion will reduce if the hydraulic fracture rock matrix communication through the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux is taken into consideration sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 3 3 effect of peclet number the tracer dispersion due to non newtonian fluid flows in hydraulic fractures is controlled by the walls nonporous and porous the geometry rectangular triangular and elliptical the flow behavior index and the peclet number the effect of the first three parameters is incorporated into the coefficient of the shear dispersion term as it is described in the previous subsections here the impact of the peclet number is discussed as well the contour plot of the nondimensional average tracer dispersion coefficient k np versus the flow behavior index n and the peclet number pef due to newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in nonporous walled a rectangular b triangular and c elliptical hydraulic fractures using equations 32 34 respectively is illustrated in fig 5 it is revealed that the tracer dispersion coefficient as a function of the peclet number for the shear thinning fluid 0 n 1 is lower than the one for the newtonian fluid n 1 where the tracer transport will be totally controlled by the diffusion k np 1 if n approaches zero regardless of the geometry of the hydraulic fracture in addition the tracer dispersion coefficient as a function of the peclet number for the shear thickening fluid n 1 is higher than the one for the newtonian fluid n 1 where the tracer dispersion coefficient as a function of the peclet number for each geometrical model of the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture will remain fixed if n approaches infinity and can be derived mathematically using equations 32 34 as follows 51 lim k n p n 1 1 30 p e f 2 52 lim k n p n 1 2 75 p e f 2 53 lim k n p n 1 64 225 π 2 p e f 2 generally the tracer dispersion coefficient grows as the flow behavior index becomes larger for a constant value of the peclet number in the hydraulic fracture it is also found that the tracer dispersion coefficient increases with peclet number due to both newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in nonporous walled rectangular triangular and elliptical hydraulic fractures as k np p e f 2 nevertheless the growth in tracer dispersion coefficient for the shear thickening fluid n 1 is higher than the one for the shear thinning fluid 0 n 1 regardless of the newtonian or non newtonian behavior of the fluid and the geometry of the hydraulic fracture the tracer dispersion coefficient remains almost unchanged and equal to unity for low peclet numbers pef 1 fig 6 shows the contour plot of the nondimensional average tracer dispersion coefficient k p versus the flow behavior index n and the peclet number pef due to newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in porous walled a rectangular b triangular and c elliptical hydraulic fractures using equations 41 43 respectively the first extracted conclusion from a comparison between the contour plots in figs 5 and 6 is that the tracer dispersion coefficient for porous walled hydraulic fractures is lower than the one for nonporous walled hydraulic fractures it is also found that the magnitude of the tracer dispersion coefficient follows an order of shear thickening newtonian shear thinning for each geometrical model of the porous walled hydraulic fracture the role of the advection on the tracer transport becomes negligible as the flow behavior index approaches 0 which implies that k p 1 on the other hand k p as a function of pef for each geometry of the porous walled hydraulic fracture remains fixed as n approaches infinity and can be derived mathematically using equations 41 43 as follows 54 lim k p n 1 1 80 p e f 2 55 lim k p n 1 1 100 p e f 2 56 lim k p n 1 8 75 π 2 p e f 2 since k p p e f 2 the tracer dispersion due to both newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in hydraulic fractures with porous walls and different geometries will become larger if the peclet number grows however k p turns to 1 for peclet numbers equal or less than unity regardless of the fluid and geometry types the quantitative comparison between the tracer dispersion coefficients for nonporous walled and porous walled hydraulic fractures with different geometries can be performed through the definition of the ratio r k p k np of the average tracer dispersion coefficient for the porous walled hydraulic fracture k p to the average tracer dispersion coefficient for the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture k np using equations 32 34 and 41 43 the contour plot of the ratio r versus the flow behavior index n and the peclet number pef due to newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in a rectangular b triangular and c elliptical hydraulic fractures is demonstrated in fig 7 the results reveal that r r 1 as the peclet number varies from zero to infinity for a constant value of the flow behavior index r 1 refers to the diffusion dominated tracer transport at small peclet numbers r r 1 corresponds to the transition from the diffusion dominated to advection dominated tracer transport at intermediate peclet numbers and r r stands for the advection dominated tracer transport at large peclet numbers for the transition k p is r times smaller than k np where r r 1 depending on the values of the flow behavior index and the peclet number for the advection dominated tracer transport k p is r times lower than k np depending on the value of the flow behavior index and regardless of the value of the peclet number it is noted that r depends only on n as equation 50 indicates if both n and pef approach infinity r r 3 8 these results dictate that the hydraulic fracture rock matrix communication through the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux needs to be considered for determination of the tracer dispersion during the transition and the advection dominated tracer transport in general it is found from fig 7 that r as a function of n shrinks when pef becomes larger however the reduction in r for the shear thinning fluid 0 n 1 is higher than the one for the shear thickening fluid n 1 for pef 102 r as a function of n remains almost unchanged for the shear thickening fluid n 1 if the flow behavior index approaches infinity r will become only a function of the peclet number this relationship can be derived mathematically for each geometry of the hydraulic fracture using equations 32 34 and 41 43 as follows 57 lim r n 1 1 80 p e f 2 1 1 30 p e f 2 58 lim r n 1 1 100 p e f 2 1 2 75 p e f 2 59 lim r n 1 8 75 π 2 p e f 2 1 64 225 π 2 p e f 2 equations 57 59 reduce to 3 8 for high peclet numbers pef 102 4 summary and conclusions the tracer dispersion due to non newtonian power law fluid flows in hydraulic fractures with different geometries rectangular triangular and elliptical and porous walls is mathematically derived and studied in the current work the coefficients of the shear dispersion term due to newtonian and non newtonian power law fluid flows in hydraulic fractures with different geometries and nonporous and porous walls are summarized in table 1 the results reveal that as the flow behavior index grows the coefficients of the shear dispersion term for nonporous walled and porous walled hydraulic fractures which incorporate the effect of the walls the geometry and the flow behavior index in the case of the shear thinning 0 n 1 and newtonian n 1 fluids follow an order of triangular elliptical rectangular and in the case of the shear thickening fluid n 1 while the same order is followed at the beginning it turns first to triangular rectangular elliptical then to rectangular triangular elliptical and finally to rectangular elliptical triangular the coefficient of the shear dispersion term increases sharply for each geometrical model of the nonporous walled and porous walled hydraulic fractures with the flow behavior index when the fluid is shear thinning 0 n 1 while it first increases slightly and then flattens when the fluid is shear thickening n 1 however the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the porous walled hydraulic fracture is lower than the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture the contour plots of the average tracer dispersion coefficients due to newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in rectangular triangular and elliptical nonporous walled and porous walled hydraulic fractures and their ratio which incorporate the effect of the walls the geometry the flow behavior index and the peclet number dictate that the hydraulic fracture rock matrix communication through the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux needs to be considered for determination of the tracer dispersion during the transition for intermediate peclet numbers and the advection dominated tracer transport for large peclet

1771,tracer transport in hydraulic fractures is substantially affected by the rock matrix surrounding them nevertheless there is not yet an expression in literature to address the relationship among the transport coefficients porous walls hydraulic fracture geometries and non newtonian fluid properties therefore the tracer dispersion due to non newtonian fluid flows in hydraulic fractures with different geometries and porous walls is mathematically derived and studied in the current work rectangular triangular and elliptical models and power law model are considered here to describe the hydraulic fracture geometry and the non newtonian fluid rheology respectively the results reveal that as the flow behavior index grows the coefficient of the shear dispersion term in the case of the shear thinning and newtonian fluids follows an order of triangular elliptical rectangular and in the case of the shear thickening while the same order is followed at the beginning it turns first to triangular rectangular elliptical then to rectangular triangular elliptical and finally to rectangular elliptical triangular the coefficient of the shear dispersion term increases sharply for each geometrical model with the flow behavior index when the fluid is shear thinning while it first increases slightly and then flattens when the fluid is shear thickening however the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for porous walls is lower than the one for nonporous walls it is also found that the average tracer dispersion coefficients in rectangular triangular and elliptical nonporous walled and porous walled hydraulic fractures and their ratio dictate that the hydraulic fracture rock matrix communication through the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux needs to be considered for determination of the tracer dispersion during the transition for intermediate peclet numbers and the advection dominated tracer transport for large peclet numbers this study along with its findings can pave the way for future investigations on the tracer dispersion in a network of hydraulic fractures with rough and porous walls keywords shear dispersion non newtonian fluids hydraulic fractures geometries porous walls data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction hydraulically fracturing technology has become a substantial part of north america in recent years due to the low mobility of fluids toward the wells in unconventional resources such as shale rocks dejam et al 2018 recently hydraulic fracturing of wells in tight reservoirs has changed the energy environment in china chen and liu 2023 a significant area of research in both academia and industry is to improve the understanding of tracer transport and mobility of fluid flow in hydraulically fractured reservoirs to improve production dejam 2019 these reservoirs exhibit a double porosity system comprising of a hydraulic fracture and a rock matrix which communicate with each other this communication is because of the porous nature of the rock matrix while the hydraulic fracture walls are porous they are not necessarily parallel dontsov 2016 therefore the hydraulic fracture can potentially have other geometries triangular elliptical etc rather than rectangular due to the geomechanical properties mainly the horizontal principal stress difference and the angle between the perforation orientation and the maximum horizontal stress zhang and chen 2009 furthermore the fluid which is used for the purpose of the hydraulic fracturing can be either newtonian in the case of water or non newtonian in the case of polymer solutions tracer dispersion resulted from newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows through conduits fractures tubes etc with a variety of wall conditions nonporous porous impermeable permeable etc have been extensively studied in the past first taylor 1953 addressed the tracer dispersion due to pressure driven flows of a newtonian fluid in a tube and found that it is proportional to pe 2 where pe is the peclet number defined as the ratio of the advection to the diffusion later aris 1956 studied the technique of moments to determine the tracer dispersion for generalized geometrical models subsequently taylor aris tracer dispersion has been broadly studied considering newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in conduits with different wall conditions which can be applied to numerous naturally and manually occurring processes in engineering and science including contamination of water in underground fractured rock aquifers dejam et al 2014 energy and rare element extraction from fractured geothermal porous media wei et al 2022 hydrocarbon production from fractured limestone and dolomite reservoirs jamili et al 2011 taking up nutrients in soils by plants through their root hairs gilroy and jones 2000 membrane separation of emulsions gu et al 2006 and delivery of drugs in vessel tissue systems beard and wu 2009 nevertheless the derivation of the tracer dispersion due to non newtonian fluid flows in porous walled hydraulic fractures with different geometries has not been addressed yet in literature therefore this is the objective of this study in the current work first the velocity profile for laminar non newtonian fluid flows across and along the hydraulic fracture is presented power law model and rectangular triangular and elliptical models are considered to describe the non newtonian fluid rheology and the hydraulic fracture geometry respectively then the two dimensional transient advection diffusion and one dimensional transient diffusion equations are used for addressing the tracer transport in the hydraulic fracture and rock matrix where these two media communicate through the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux at their interface applying the reynolds decomposition and cross sectional averaging techniques leads to a reduced order one dimensional transient advection dispersion tracer transport model due to non newtonian fluid flows in hydraulic fractures with different geometries and porous walls incorporating the tracer dispersion coefficient the resultant model can also provide the tracer dispersion coefficient for non newtonian fluid flows in nonporous walled hydraulic fractures which is in agreement with the previously reported one in literature finally different geometrical models rectangular triangular and elliptical are utilized to determine the expressions for the tracer dispersion caused by non newtonian fluid flows in hydraulic fractures with nonporous and porous walls the main applications of this study can be for characterization of tracer test mahadevan 2018 and evaluation of mass transfer during gas injection moridis and reagan 2021 in hydraulically fractured reservoirs this mathematical modeling along with its findings can be utilized as a new tool to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the tracer dispersion caused by non newtonian fluid flows through hydraulic fractures with different geometries and porous walls it can also be used for implementation in the existing simulators for better predictions in addition it can pave the way for further works on the tracer dispersion in a hydraulic fracture network considering the rough and porous nature of walls the rest of the study is structured as follows the mathematical model is first developed then the results are discussed followed by the conclusions 2 developed model 2 1 system and assumptions under study the system under study is a hydraulically fractured reservoir which is composed of a hydraulic fracture with a porosity of ϕf a half aperture of hf and a half length of ℓf and a rock matrix with a porosity of ϕm and a half thickness of hm the origins of dimensions x and z are assigned to the inlet and center of the hydraulic fracture which is symmetric about z 0 respectively rectangular triangular and elliptical geometries are considered for the hydraulic fracture as displayed in fig 1 a 1 c where hf and hm are constant for the first geometrical model while they vary along the hydraulic fracture for the other geometrical models as hf x and hm x regardless of the geometry the summation of hf and hm remains unchanged and equal to h the flowing single phase and incompressible fluid in the hydraulic fracture is non newtonian which is described by the power law model as the most user friendly and popular rheological model that represents a variety of non newtonian fluids the velocity profile in this model is controlled by the flow behavior index n 0 the fluid will exhibit shear thinning behavior if 0 n 1 examples are heavy oils drilling muds polymer solutions and colloidal suspensions the fluid will exhibit newtonian behavior if n 1 the fluid will exhibit shear thickening behavior if n 1 examples are water sand mixtures and water corn starch munson et al 2006 a non newtonian fluid carrying a tracer with a constant concentration cf 0 is introduced at the inlet of the hydraulic fracture 2 2 velocity profile under the action of laminar flow for non newtonian fluids which are described by the power law model the velocity profile across and along the hydraulic fracture uf can be found as follows 1 u f x z u f x 2 n 1 n 1 1 z h f x n 1 n where u f x is the cross sectional average velocity at each x along the hydraulic fracture and expressed by the following equation 2 u f x 0 h f x u f x z d z h f x u f ℓ f h f x n 1 n 0 ℓ f h f x n 1 n d x where u f is the total average velocity in the

equation for addressing the tracer transport due to non newtonian fluid flows in the hydraulic fracture can be derived as follows using the mass balance 4 t c f u f x z x c f d f xx c f zz c f where cf is the tracer concentration in the hydraulic fracture df is the effective molecular diffusivity in the hydraulic fracture and t is the time the one dimensional transient diffusion equation for addressing the tracer transport in the rock matrix can be derived as follows using the mass balance 5 t c m d m zz c m where cm is the tracer concentration in the rock matrix and dm is the effective molecular diffusivity in the rock matrix 2 4 conditions the description of the conditions for the tracer concentrations in the hydraulic fracture equation 1 and the rock matrix equation 5 is as follows initially the tracer concentrations in the system are zero which implies that cf x z t 0 cm z t 0 0 at the inlet of the hydraulic fracture the tracer concentration is constant resulting in cf x 0 z t cf 0 at the far end of the hydraulic fracture the tracer concentration is zero which leads to cf x z t 0 at the center of the hydraulic fracture the transversal tracer concentration gradient is zero implying that zcf x z 0 t 0 at the interface between the hydraulic fracture and the rock matrix there is the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux which results in cf x z hf

the same order is followed at the beginning it turns first to triangular rectangular elliptical then to rectangular triangular elliptical and finally to rectangular elliptical triangular it is worth noting that the value of anp becomes stabilized as n approaches infinity this constant value of anp for each geometry of the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture can be derived mathematically using

respectively is displayed in fig 3 it is revealed that for the shear thinning 0 n 1 and newtonian n 1 fluids in different hydraulic fracture geometries the magnitude of ap follows an order of triangular elliptical rectangular for the case of the newtonian fluid n 1 in porous walled triangular elliptical and rectangular hydraulic fractures ap 9 1225 36 6125 and 1 175 respectively dejam 2019 if the fluid shows shear thickening behavior n 1 while the same order will be followed at the beginning it will turn first to triangular rectangular elliptical then to rectangular triangular elliptical and finally to rectangular elliptical triangular as n becomes larger when n approaches infinity ap turns to flat using equations 41 43 the stabilized value of ap for each geometry of porous walled hydraulic fracture can be derived mathematically as follows 47 lim a p n 1 80 48 lim a p n 1 100 49 lim a p n 8 75 π 2 the coefficient of the shear dispersion term as a function of the flow

geometrical model of the porous walled hydraulic fracture the value of ap increases sharply in the case of the shear thinning fluid 0 n 1 while it first grows slightly and then becomes flat in the case of the shear thickening fluid n 1 3 2 effect of walls the effect of the nonporous and porous walls of the hydraulic fractures on the coefficient of the shear dispersion term can be evaluated through the definition of the ratio r ap anp of the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the porous walled hydraulic fracture ap to the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture anp using equations 32 and 41 for nonporous walled and porous walled rectangular hydraulic fractures equations 33 and 42 for nonporous walled and porous walled triangular hydraulic fractures and equations 34 and 43 for nonporous walled and porous walled elliptical hydraulic fractures will all result in the following formula to express r 50 r a p a np 3 n 2 4 n 1 fig 4 demonstrates the ratio r versus the flow behavior index n the results reveal that the value of r will grow sharply if n becomes larger in the case that the fluid exhibits shear thinning behavior 0 n 1 when the fluid is newtonian n 1 r 0 3 which was previously reported in literature dejam 2019 for the shear thickening fluid n 1 r first increases slightly and then flattens using equation 50 r 3 8 as n approaches infinity which was presented in the past dejam 2018 as it is clear from fig 4 the ratio is smaller than unity for the entire range of the flow behavior index r 1 which implies that the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the porous walled hydraulic fracture is lower than the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture ap anp this is attributed to the depletion of the tracer in the region close to the walls of the hydraulic fracture where the shear rate or velocity gradient is higher than the one in the central region of the hydraulic fracture by the porous rock matrix which causes the reduction in the shear rate or velocity gradient it is noted that the tracer dispersion decreases as the shear rate or velocity gradient becomes smaller therefore the tracer dispersion will reduce if the hydraulic fracture rock matrix communication through the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux is taken into consideration sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 3 3 effect of peclet number the tracer dispersion due to non newtonian fluid flows in hydraulic fractures is controlled by the walls nonporous and porous the geometry rectangular triangular and elliptical the flow behavior index and the peclet number the effect of the first three parameters is incorporated into the coefficient of the shear dispersion term as it is described in the previous subsections here the impact of the peclet number is discussed as well the contour plot of the nondimensional average tracer dispersion coefficient k np versus the flow behavior index n and the peclet number pef due to newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in nonporous walled a rectangular b triangular and c elliptical hydraulic fractures using equations 32 34 respectively is illustrated in fig 5 it is revealed that the tracer dispersion coefficient as a function of the peclet number for the shear thinning fluid 0 n 1 is lower than the one for the newtonian fluid n 1 where the tracer transport will be totally controlled by the diffusion k np 1 if n approaches zero regardless of the geometry of the hydraulic fracture in addition the tracer dispersion coefficient as a function of the peclet number for the shear thickening fluid n 1 is higher than the one for the newtonian fluid n 1 where the tracer dispersion coefficient as a function of the peclet number for each geometrical model of the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture will remain fixed if n approaches infinity and can be derived mathematically using equations 32 34 as follows 51 lim k n p n 1 1 30 p e f 2 52 lim k n p n 1 2 75 p e f 2 53 lim k n p n 1 64 225 π 2 p e f 2 generally the tracer dispersion coefficient grows as the flow behavior index becomes larger for a constant value of the peclet number in the hydraulic fracture it is also found that the tracer dispersion coefficient increases with peclet number due to both newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in nonporous walled rectangular triangular and elliptical hydraulic fractures as k np p e f 2 nevertheless the growth in tracer dispersion coefficient for the shear thickening fluid n 1 is higher than the one for the shear thinning fluid 0 n 1 regardless of the newtonian or non newtonian behavior of the fluid and the geometry of the hydraulic fracture the tracer dispersion coefficient remains almost unchanged and equal to unity for low peclet numbers pef 1 fig 6 shows the contour plot of the nondimensional average tracer dispersion coefficient k p versus the flow behavior index n and the peclet number pef due to newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in porous walled a rectangular b triangular and c elliptical hydraulic fractures using equations 41 43 respectively the first extracted conclusion from a comparison between the contour plots in figs 5 and 6 is that the tracer dispersion coefficient for porous walled hydraulic fractures is lower than the one for nonporous walled hydraulic fractures it is also found that the magnitude of the tracer dispersion coefficient follows an order of shear thickening newtonian shear thinning for each geometrical model of the porous walled hydraulic fracture the role of the advection on the tracer transport becomes negligible as the flow behavior index approaches 0 which implies that k p 1 on the other hand k p as a function of pef for each geometry of the porous walled hydraulic fracture remains fixed as n approaches infinity and can be derived mathematically using equations 41 43 as follows 54 lim k p n 1 1 80 p e f 2 55 lim k p n 1 1 100 p e f 2 56 lim k p n 1 8 75 π 2 p e f 2 since k p p e f 2 the tracer dispersion due to both newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in hydraulic fractures with porous walls and different geometries will become larger if the peclet number grows however k p turns to 1 for peclet numbers equal or less than unity regardless of the fluid and geometry types the quantitative comparison between the tracer dispersion coefficients for nonporous walled and porous walled hydraulic fractures with different geometries can be performed through the definition of the ratio r k p k np of the average tracer dispersion coefficient for the porous walled hydraulic fracture k p to the average tracer dispersion coefficient for the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture k np using equations 32 34 and 41 43 the contour plot of the ratio r versus the flow behavior index n and the peclet number pef due to newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in a rectangular b triangular and c elliptical hydraulic fractures is demonstrated in fig 7 the results reveal that r r 1 as the peclet number varies from zero to infinity for a constant value of the flow behavior index r 1 refers to the diffusion dominated tracer transport at small peclet numbers r r 1 corresponds to the transition from the diffusion dominated to advection dominated tracer transport at intermediate peclet numbers and r r stands for the advection dominated tracer transport at large peclet numbers for the transition k p is r times smaller than k np where r r 1 depending on the values of the flow behavior index and the peclet number for the advection dominated tracer transport k p is r times lower than k np depending on the value of the flow behavior index and regardless of the value of the peclet number it is noted that r depends only on n as equation 50 indicates if both n and pef approach infinity r r 3 8 these results dictate that the hydraulic fracture rock matrix communication through the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux needs to be considered for determination of the tracer dispersion during the transition and the advection dominated tracer transport in general it is found from fig 7 that r as a function of n shrinks when pef becomes larger however the reduction in r for the shear thinning fluid 0 n 1 is higher than the one for the shear thickening fluid n 1 for pef 102 r as a function of n remains almost unchanged for the shear thickening fluid n 1 if the flow behavior index approaches infinity r will become only a function of the peclet number this relationship can be derived mathematically for each geometry of the hydraulic fracture using equations 32 34 and 41 43 as follows 57 lim r n 1 1 80 p e f 2 1 1 30 p e f 2 58

summarized in table 1 the results reveal that as the flow behavior index grows the coefficients of the shear dispersion term for nonporous walled and porous walled hydraulic fractures which incorporate the effect of the walls the geometry and the flow behavior index in the case of the shear thinning 0 n 1 and newtonian n 1 fluids follow an order of triangular elliptical rectangular and in the case of the shear thickening fluid n 1 while the same order is followed at the beginning it turns first to triangular rectangular elliptical then to rectangular triangular elliptical and finally to rectangular elliptical triangular the coefficient of the shear dispersion term increases sharply for each geometrical model of the nonporous walled and porous walled hydraulic fractures with the flow behavior index when the fluid is shear thinning 0 n 1 while it first increases slightly and then flattens when the fluid is shear thickening n 1 however the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the porous walled hydraulic fracture is lower than the coefficient of the shear dispersion term for the nonporous walled hydraulic fracture the contour plots of the average tracer dispersion coefficients due to newtonian and non newtonian fluid flows in rectangular triangular and elliptical nonporous walled and porous walled hydraulic fractures and their ratio which incorporate the effect of the walls the geometry the flow behavior index and the peclet number dictate that the hydraulic fracture rock matrix communication through the continuity of the tracer concentration and the mass flux needs to be considered for determination of the tracer dispersion during the transition for intermediate peclet numbers and the advection dominated tracer transport for large peclet numbers this study along with its findings can help to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the tracer dispersion due to non newtonian fluid flows in hydraulic fractures with different geometrical models and porous walls and pave the way for future investigations on the tracer dispersion in a network of hydraulic fractures with rough and porous walls credit authorship contribution

1772,accurate descriptions of soil hydraulic properties over the entire matric suction range require the consideration of both capillary and noncapillary processes this study extended the weibull distribution models of hydraulic properties to complete dryness by the modular frameworks of peters durner iden pdi and brunswick bw model data comparison results showed that the original weibull distribution models accounting solely for capillary phenomena provided inadequate descriptions of measurements in the dry range of water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity curve the improved models of pdi and bw accounting for both capillary and noncapillary processes effectively described the hydraulic properties data from saturation to complete dryness although the bw model violated the linearity requirement for water retention in dry soils with wide pore size distributions the pdi model overall performed better than the bw model in terms of their capability to fit the retention data and predict the conductivity data adopting the physically based approach developed recently the improved pdi and bw models can reliably predict the hydraulic conductivity along the complete matric suction range from water retention only without use of fitted conductivity parameters thus the improved pdi and bw models are applicable to cases where measured conductivity data particularly

shps soil hydraulic properties wrc water retention curve 1 introduction analytical and numerical solutions of the richardson richards equation richardson 1922 richards 1931 require an accurate representation of the soil hydraulic properties shps which mainly include the water retention curve wrc and the hydraulic conductivity curve hcc many empirical and conceptual models have been proposed to characterize the shps assouline and or 2013 the most widely employed wrcs e g brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 kosugi 1996 assouline et al 1998 are empirical semiempirical functions in which the fitting parameters are determined from experimental data according to the statistical approach hoffmann riem et al 1999 kosugi 1999 these wrcs can be combined with the burdine 1953 or mualem 1976a models to derive the hccs assouline and or 2013 and air permeabilities yang and mohanty 2015 assouline 2021 yang et al 2019 2021 these traditional soil hydraulic models conceptualize the pore spaces as an assembly of cylindrical capillary tubes of various diameters and neglect the adsorptive water in wrc and film flow in hcc tuller et al 1999 tuller and or 2001 zhang 2011 peters 2013 most conventional wrcs adopt a distinct residual water content which is either treated as a mere fitting parameter van genuchten and nielsen 1985 or viewed as water adsorbed onto the solid surfaces corey and brooks 1999 below the residual water content water is assumed to be immobile and irreducible luckner et al 1989 this concept was questioned by nimmo 1991 who stated that as soil suction continues increasing the water content continues decreasing until it reaches zero at oven dryness campbell and shiozawa 1992 firstly observed that in the dry end of wrcs the water content decreases linearly toward zero on a semilog plot such log linear form relationship was frequently used in the later developed retention models that cover the entire matric suction range rossi and nimmo 1994 fayer and simmons 1995 khlosi et al 2006 zhang 2011 nevertheless in case of soils with wide pore size distributions the retention functions of fayer and simmons 1995 khlosi et al 2006 and zhang 2011 often fail to reach zero water content at complete dryness peters 2013 to solve this physically inconsistent problem peters 2013 introduced a new retention model that describes the wrc as a weighted linear superposition of the capillary and adsorptive water the peters 2013 retention function despite its usefulness suffers from a mathematical discontinuity issue this problem was solved by iden and durner 2014 who suggested an empirical smoothed piecewise linear function for adsorptive water retention to yield a continuously differentiable wrc covering the full suction range the capillary bundle models like burdine 1953 and mualem 1976a are known to underestimate hydraulic conductivity under dry conditions peters et al 2015 because they overlook the contributions of film and corner flow or and tuller 2000 so far many researchers tuller and or 2001 lebeau and konrad 2010 zhang 2011 peters 2013 have shown that the improved description of hcc can be achieved using the total conductivity function that accounts for both capillary and noncapillary flow the model of tuller and or 2001 accounting for water flow in parallel plates ducts films and corners has received considerable scientific attention but it is seldom used in standard modeling this is due to its mathematical complexity and its exclusive coupling with the wrc of or and tuller 1999 which often fails to describe the measured retention data in the intermediate saturation range lebeau and konrad 2010 the film conductivity in zhang 2011 and peters 2013 is based on the physically based model of tokunaga 2009 which only considered water films larger than 10 nm mainly held by ionic electrostatic forces in contrast lebeau and konrad 2010 hereinafter referred to as lk extended the tokunaga 2009 model to films thinner than 10 nm where long range molecular van der waals forces dominate furthermore increasing liquid viscosity close to solid surfaces which occurs in films thinner than 10 nm or and tuller 2000 is also considered in the lk model although tuller and or 2001 and lk demonstrated that diverse mechanisms are responsible for noncapillary conductivity e g water in thick 10 nm and thin 10 nm films corners and edges of pore spaces it is common practice to sum up all the noncapillary effects and refer to them as film conductivity for simplicity peters and durner 2008 peters et al 2021 therefore the terms noncapillary conductivity and film conductivity are used synonymously in this study the modular framework of the wrc proposed by peters 2013 and improved by iden and durner 2014 together with the related hcc expressions derived by peters 2013 2014 is termed as the peters durner iden pdi model recently weber et al 2019 presented the brunswick bw modular framework that partitions the shps into a capillary and noncapillary part in a similar manner as the pdi model however the bw model differs from the pdi model in that the former introduced a new formulation for the noncapillary water retention which is derived from the integral of capillary saturation function in log space the integral can be calculated numerically weber et al 2019 2020 or by analytical expressions streck and weber 2020 depending on the given capillary retention models note that the noncapillary conductivity function of the pdi and bw models based on the film conductivity model of tokunaga 2009 and peters 2013 respectively is a great simplification compared to the comprehensive physically based lk model this is because the noncapillary conductivity in the pdi and bw models neglects two physical processes 1 molecular component of disjoining pressure isotherm and 2 increasing liquid viscosity in the vicinity of mineral surfaces both physical processes become important in the thin films nonetheless peters et al 2021 demonstrated that the noncapillary conductivity matric suction relation of the pdi model is very similar to that of the lk model because two omitted physical processes effectively counter balance each other based on this finding and the work of tuller and or 2005 tokunaga 2009 and lk peters et al 2021 developed a physically based method to predict the saturated noncapillary conductivity solely from the wrc this improved pdi model denoted as pdi increases the original pdi model s practical applicability since it removes the saturated noncapillary conductivity as a fitting parameter peters et al 2021 the approach developed by peters et al 2021 in the pdi model is expected to apply to the bw model as well which will be shown in section 4 the above introduced shps models covering the entire suction range are important for simulating water flow and biogeochemical processes in dry soils that are either in arid and semiarid areas or influenced by prolonged droughts mohanty and yang 2013 peters et al 2015 for instance luo et al 2020 and iden et al 2021 incorporated the pdi model into the hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 code to conduct the parameter estimation and numerical simulation studies for unsaturated water flow they found that the pdi model improves the soil moisture redistribution and evaporation simulations compared to the van genuchten mualem model to date the model frameworks of pdi peters 2013 2014 peters et al 2021 weber et al 2017 and bw weber et al 2019 2020 have included many widely used wrcs brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 kosugi 1996 fredlund and xing 1994 durner 1994 except for the weibull distribution wrc developed by assouline et al 1998 considering the frequent use of weibull distribution models of shps in modeling of infiltration assouline and selker 2017 and evaporation kamai and assouline 2018 to better simulate such hydrological processes in dry soils it is needed to derive the weibull distribution models for describing shps over the entire matric suction range which are currently not available yet motived by this research need in our study we aim to 1 extend the traditional capillary based weibull distribution models of shps to the oven dry conditions using the modular frameworks of pdi and bw and 2 compare the performance of the pdi and bw models for characterizing the shps from saturation to complete dryness in terms of their ability to describe the measured data 2 model formulation 2 1 traditional weibull distribution models for shps 2 1 1 assouline et al 1998 water retention function assuming that soil structure evolves from a uniform random fragmentation process assouline et al 1998 hereinafter referred to as atb abbreviation of assouline tessier bruand derived a weibull distribution model for wrc which describes the relationship between volumetric water content θ l3 l 3 and soil pressure head h l 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r t h where θ s l3 l 3 and θ r l3 l 3 are the saturated and the residual water content respectively and the dimensionless saturation function t h is given as assouline et al 1998 2 t h 1 e x p ξ 1 h 1 h l μ 0 h h l where h represents the soil suction head ξ l μ and μ are two empirical fitting parameters and h l l is the pressure head corresponding to a very low water content θ l l3 l 3 which represents the limit of interest for a particular wrc application and often corresponds to θ r assouline 2001 assouline and or 2013 yang et al 2019 this study focuses on the wrc within the entire suction range therefore h l is set to equal to h 0 l which is the pressure head at oven dryness where θ 0 according to schneider and goss 2012 h 0 10 6 8 cm notice that when setting h l h 0 10 6 8 cm in equation 2 the θ r in equation 1 correspondingly equals to 0 for the atb model the effective capillary saturation function s c h could be directly given by t h as follows 3 s c h t h 1 e x p ξ 1 h 1 h 0 μ 0 h h 0 notice that unlike the wrc of van genuchten 1980 or kosugi 1996 the rescaling approach introduced by iden and durner 2014 to ensure zero water content at oven dryness is not necessary for the wrc of atb this is because equation 3 naturally reaches zero when h h 0 2 1 2 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function the capillary based weibull distribution model for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k l t 1 is calculated as follows 4 k k s k rc s c where k s l t 1 is the saturated overall conductivity and k rc is the relative capillary conductivity shan et al 2022 and assouline and tartakovsky 2001 respectively derived the atb burdine atb b and atb mualem atb m models for k rc which are detailed in table a1 2 2 pdi modular framework for shps 2 2 1 pdi water retention function the pdi model assumes that the soil water retention is a superposition of capillary saturation function s c h and noncapillary saturation function s nc h 5 θ h θ c h θ nc h θ s θ r s c h θ r s nc h in which θ c l3 l 3 and θ nc l3 l 3 are respectively the volumetric water content of capillary and noncapillary part the residual water content θ r here is interpreted as the maximum adsorptive water content s c h is given by equation 3 and s nc h is denoted by a smoothed piecewise linear function iden and durner 2014 which is reformulated by peters et al 2021 as follows 6 s nc h l n h 0 h b l n 1 h a h 1 b l n h 0 h a where h 0 10 6 8 cm h a l is the pressure head where noncapillary water reaches its saturation and is set to ξ 1 21 1 μ here based on the parameters equivalence of wrcs between the van genuchten 1980 and atb models assouline and or 2013 and b is the smoothing parameter introduced by iden and durner 2014 to guarantee a continuously differentiable water capacity function which is denoted as 7 b b 0 1 0 2 μ 1 e b 1 in which b 0 0 1 l n 10 and b 1 θ r θ s θ r 2 as shown in fig 1 a s nc h namely θ nc θ r increases linearly from 0 at h 0 to its maximum value 1 at h a and afterwards remains constant toward saturation 2 2 2 pdi hydraulic conductivity function the pdi model represents k as the sum of capillary conductivity k c l t 1 and noncapillary conductivity k nc l t 1 if the isothermal vapor conductivity k v l t 1 is ignored peters 2013 peters et al 2021 8 k k c k nc k sc k rc s c k snc k rnc s nc where k sc l t 1 and k snc l t 1 are the saturated hydraulic conductivities for capillary and noncapillary water respectively and k rnc is the relative noncapillary conductivity based on peters 2013 k sc 1 ω k s and k snc ω k s in which ω is the weighting factor subjected to 0 ω 1 note that ω is mostly very small order of magnitude of 10 7 to 10 3 hence in practice k sc 1 ω k s k s peters 2013 since k s is usually measured or can be assumed to a reasonable value k sc is treated as known correspondingly peters et al 2021 the atb b and atb m models for k rc are given in table a1 tokunaga 2009 showed that the decrease of film conductivity with increasing matric suction in the double log scale is virtually linear with a slope of 1 5 based on that peters 2013 developed a simple equation describing the k rnc 9 k rnc s nc h 0 h a a 1 s nc similar to peters 2013 peters et al 2021 stanić et al 2020 and weber et al 2019 2020 a 1 5 is adopted in this work for the purpose of predicting rather than fitting the measurements the approach to predict k snc from wrc parameters in the improved pdi model i e pdi was derived via two steps first peters et al 2021 showed that the noncapillary conductivity in the pdi model which is based on the tokunaga 2009 model that ignores the molecular component of disjoining pressure and increasing viscosity close to mineral surfaces is in good agreement with the comprehensive film conductivity model of lk this is because the two neglected processes effectively counter balance each other second adopting the physical laws and constants used in tuller and or 2005 tokunaga 2009 and lk peters et al 2021 derived a physically based method to predict k snc from the wrc which is given by 10 k snc c θ m h a 1 5 where θ m l3 l 3 is the water content at h m 10 5 cm h a ξ 1 21 1 μ and the constant c is defined as peters et al 2021 11 c 2 3 π 7 3 η ρ g 1 6 6 a h 1 3 r 0 2 3 2 k b t e c z 3 h m 1 3 where η m l 1t 1 is the dynamic viscosity of the bulk liquid ρ m l 3 is the liquid density g l t 2 is the gravitational acceleration constant a h l2 m t 2 is the hamaker constant r and 0 m 1 l 3 t4 a2 are the static relative permittivity of water and the permittivity of free space respectively k b m l2 t 2 k 1 is the boltzmann constant t k is the absolute temperature e c c is the electron charge and z is the ion valence adopting the values used in peters et al 2021 and setting h m 10 5 cm c 103 cm5 2 d 1 or if pressure head is expressed in m and time in s c 1 19 10 8 m5 2 s 1 fig 1b shows the exemplary illustration of k k c and k nc curves of the pdi model in which k c is computed from atb m table a1 for k rc with k sc k s assumed to be known and k nc is calculated from equations 9 10 and 11 2 3 bw modular framework for shps 2 3 1 bw water retention function similar to the pdi model the bw modular framework developed by weber et al 2019 hypothesizes that the wrc is described by a weighted sum of the capillary s c h and noncapillary s nc h saturation function which is given as 12 θ h θ c h θ nc h θ sc s c h θ snc s nc h where θ sc l3 l 3 and θ snc l3 l 3 are respectively the saturated water content of the capillary and the noncapillary part analogous to equation 1 the θ s of the atb model is the sum of θ sc and θ snc θ s θ sc θ snc the s c h in the bw model is given by equation 3 the s nc h in the bw model is directly computed from the s c h by integrating s c h 1 in the pf log 10 h space and rescaling the resulting function s nc h to values between unity and zero 13 s nc h log 10 e 10 h s c h 1 h d h where e denotes the e constant 2 7183 h is the dummy variable of integration representing h and the upper boundary of the integral h 10 is a fixed pressure head very close to 0 which is mathematically necessary since the integral cannot be numerically calculated at zero pressure head according to weber et al 2019 2020 we set 3 leading to h 10 3 cm then we rescaled the equation 13 to obtain the s nc h expression 14 s nc h 1 s nc h s nc h 0 fig 1c shows that the s nc h i e θ nc θ snc curve of the bw model which is calculated based on the equations 13 and 14 remains unity from h to h a and then decreases log linearly from h a to 0 at h 0 2 3 2 bw hydraulic conductivity function the method of calculating the total hcc and its capillary and noncapillary conductivity curve in the bw model is practically the same to that of the pdi model except for two slight differences first the k rnc in the bw model is calculated by 15 k rnc s nc h 0 h r 1 5 1 s nc where pressure head h r is 1 cm introduced by weber et al 2019 2020 to purely ensure k rnc is dimensionless as pointed out by peters and iden 2021 equation 15 is not in agreement with the film conductivity model of tokunaga 2009 due to the constant h r and the subfunction s nc h calculated by equations 13 and 14 within the bw model to be consistent with the model of tokunaga 2009 replacing h r by h a in equation 15 is an effective remedy for soils with narrow pore size distributions unfortunately it is still ineffective for soils with wide pore size distributions in which the shape of s nc h is nonlinear and concave peters and iden 2021 for soils having wide pore size distributions peters and iden 2021 suggested decoupling the s nc and k rnc and directly expressing k rnc as function of h in this way the k rnc function of the bw model agrees with the theory of tokunaga 2009 although the shape of s nc h violates the linearity requirement campbell and shiozawa 1992 and theoretically convex consideration tuller and or 2005 thus in this study following the suggestion of peters and iden 2021 the k rnc within the bw model is evaluated by equation 16 below instead of equation 15 16 k rnc h h h a 1 5 f o r h h a 1 f o r h h a second the k snc in the original bw model is a fitting parameter considering the conductivity data particularly noncapillary dominated range are often missing optimization of k snc in the bw model using experimental data is infeasible to solve this issue we proposed the improved bw model denoted as bw in which k snc is calculated in the same way as in the pdi model i e equations 10 and 11 as shown in table a1 for the bw model we employed almost the same method as in the pdi model to compute the capillary noncapillary and total conductivity curve with the exception of using equation 16 rather than equation 9 or 15 to calculate the k rnc fig 1d displays the exemplified illustration of k k c and k nc curves of the bw model in which total conductivity is calculated from equation 8 capillary conductivity is calculated from atb m table a1 for k rc with k sc k s assumed known and noncapillary conductivity is computed from the equations 10 11 and 16 3 materials and methods 3 1 evaluation data sets sets of measured water retention and conductivity data covering the complete moisture range for 12 different soils were used to evaluate the wrc and hcc models introduced in section 2 the data sets for the shps presented in table 1 were taken from the supporting information of rudiyanto et al 2015 and stanić et al 2020 based on rudiyanto et al 2015 zhang 2011 stanić et al 2020 and peters and iden 2021 three soils in table 1 i e pachapa fine sandy clay sandy loam and clay loam have wide pore size distributions inferred by small values of van genuchten n n 3 whereas the other nine soils in table 1 have narrow pore size distributions large values of van genuchten n n 3 table 1 presents each soil s texture type and other details on the experimental data can be found in the references to the data sources 3 2 model testing procedure first the wrc parameters were determined by minimizing the objective function φ p which is given as wang et al 2016 2017 rudiyanto et al 2020 17 φ p i 1 n θ θ i θ i p 2 where n θ is the number of data points of the water retention θ i and θ i are respectively the measured and calculated water contents and p is the parameter vector adopted for optimization as shown in table a1 the parameter vector p for the atb atb pdi and atb bw retention curves includes θ s ξ μ θ s θ r ξ μ and θ sc θ snc ξ μ respectively the matlab optimization toolbox was adopted to optimize the parameter vector then the best fitted wrc parameters were used to predict the hydraulic conductivity based on the equations summarized in table a1 to be consistent with wang et al 2016 2017 and rudiyanto et al 2020 the root mean squared errors rmses namely rmseθ and rmselogk were calculated to evaluate the model performances rmseθ and rmselogk are defined respectively as 18 r m s e θ 1 n θ i 1 n θ θ i θ i 2 and 19 r m s e l o g k 1 n k i 1 n k l o g 10 k i l o g 10 k i 2 where k i and k i are respectively the measured and predicted hydraulic conductivities and n k is the number of hydraulic conductivity measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 fitting results of water retention curve table 1 shows that the atb pdi model has the smallest rmseθ value for 11 out of 12 evaluation data sets and the atb bw model has the lowest rmseθ for one soil pachappa loam whereas the atb model has the largest rmseθ for all 12 soils fig 2 compares the fitted wrcs by the atb atb pdi and atb bw models with experimental data for 12 soils as shown the atb model produces an inadequate description of the observed water retention data particularly in the dry range of the wrc even though it reaches zero water content at the pressure head corresponding to oven dryness i e h 0 10 6 8 cm this discrepancy can be ascribed to the atb model only considering the capillary water retention and ignoring the noncapillary adsorptive water retention that becomes dominant at low water content in contrast the atb pdi and atb bw models accounting for both the capillary and the adsorptive water retention show improved agreement with the experimental data over the entire range of matric suction in addition as can be seen from fig 2 semilog plot of wrc the atb pdi model and the atb bw model provide the linear decrease of water content to zero on the dry end for 12 soils and 9 soils with narrow pore size distributions respectively this to certain extent demonstrates the effectiveness of using the shape of the capillary saturation function to derive the shape of the noncapillary saturation function within the bw model however for 3 soils pachapa fine sandy clay sandy loam and clay loam that have a wide pore size distribution the atb bw model yields the behavior that the water content decreases concavely to zero on the dry end fig 2h 2k and 2l according to peters and iden 2021 such physically incorrect concave shape generated by the atb bw model not only contradicts the linear requirement campbell and shiozawa 1992 and convex consideration tuller and or 2005 it also affects the accuracy of the hydraulic conductivity prediction as described in section 4 2 this indicates that the connection between the capillary and noncapillary water retention can be deemed too strong in the bw model because the mechanisms causing these two physical phenomena are obviously different and unrelated lebeau and konrad 2010 peters and iden 2021 consequently as pointed out by peters and iden 2021 the approach of deriving the shape of the adsorptive saturation function from the shape of the capillary saturation function in the bw model i e equations 13 and 14 should be used very cautiously and only for soils having narrow pore size distributions it is known that finer soil textures usually result in larger solid specific surfaces on which adsorption of water molecules takes place schneider and goss 2011 peters 2013 as a result the adsorptive water component in the coarse textured sands fig 2a 2f is generally smaller than that in the fine textured loams and clays fig 2g 2j table 1 also shows that θ r maximum adsorptive water content and θ snc saturated noncapillary water content of coarse textured sands are typically lower than that of fine textured loams and clays however for the sandy loam fig 2k and clay loam fig 2l the adsorptive water retention only accounts for a small percentage compared to the capillary water retention which can be clearly inferred from table 1 that shows the very small θ snc of the atb bw model in fact the smallest θ snc of the clay loam implies that capillary water retention predominates and noncapillary water retention plays a negligible role for this soil consequently the wrc fitted by the atb model accounting for capillary water retention only is very close to that of the atb pdi and the atb bw models that consider both capillary and noncapillary water retention fig 2l even fig 2l is zoomed in see fig s1 in the supplementary data one can still find that the wrcs fitted by the three models almost overlap each other in general the atb pdi model performs slightly better than the atb bw model e g fig 2e 2g and 2h the rmseθ values presented in table 1 also demonstrates that the atb pdi model provides the best overall agreement with the measured water retention data followed by the atb bw model and atb model 4 2 prediction of hydraulic conductivity curve with the best fitted wrc parameters obtained in table 1 the hydraulic conductivity can be predicted using the equations summarized in table a1 particularly k s is usually measured and known as a result k sc k s is taken as known k snc is calculated based on the equations 10 and 11 in the pdi and bw models here pdi and bw instead of pdi and bw are used to emphasize that k snc is predicted not fitted in the pdi and bw models the k sc and k snc values for each soil sample are given in table 2 the k snc of the pdi model is slightly different with that of the bw model table 2 for some soils e g shonai sand and pachapa fine sandy clay this is because different fitted wrc parameters between the atb pdi and atb bw models are obtained for these soils table 1 meanwhile table 2 lists the rmselogk for hydraulic conductivity as can be seen in table 2 the atb b pdi atb b bw atb m pdi and atb m bw models give the lowest rmselogk values for two three six and one soil out of the 12 soils respectively the atb b and atb m models on the other hand typically have significantly large rmselogk values for all 12 soils figs 3 and 4 compare the predicted hccs by the burdine based model atb b and its extensions atb b pdi and atb b bw as well as the mualem based model atb m and its extensions atb m pdi and atb m bw with measured data for 12 soils respectively as illustrated in figs 3 and 4 the performance of the burdine based model and its extensions is correspondingly very similar to that of the mualem based model and its extensions the atb b and atb m models based on the capillary bundle theory generally describe the 12 soils data in the medium to wet moisture range well but they significantly underestimate the hydraulic conductivity data in the dry range because they neglect the noncapillary phenomena such as the film flow in contrast the pdi based atb b pdi and atb m pdi and bw based atb b bw and atb m bw models accounting for both capillary and noncapillary flow yield improved and good agreement with the measured conductivity data for most soils although they to some extent overestimate the hydraulic conductivity for tottori dune sand fig 3a and 4a and shonai sand fig 3e and 4e in the dry range as well as for rehovot sand fig 3f and 4f in the intermediate saturation range considering that no fitting of any conductivity parameters is involved in this study figs 3 and 4 illustrate that the pdi and bw models are able to predict the hydraulic conductivity data along the entire matric suction range reasonably well for all the 12 soils in addition since equation 9 adopted in the pdi model can be derived from equation 16 used in the bw model peters 2013 peters et al 2021 the pdi and bw models are deemed to calculate predict the k essentially in the same manner as clearly shown in table a1 as a result the differences between the atb b pdi and atb b bw models fig 3 as well as between the atb m pdi and atb m bw models fig 4 are negligible meanwhile it should be noted that for coarse textured sands the transition zones between capillary dominated and film dominated conductivity generally occur at soil matric suction h 10 2 5 cm fig 3a 3f and fig 4a 4f for fine textured loams and clays such transition zones typically happen at matric suction h 10 2 5 cm fig 3g 3l and fig 4g 4l this is consistent with the findings of peters 2013 as analyzed by peters and iden 2021 when using equation 15 suggested by the original bw model figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary data show that the slope of noncapillary conductivity predicted by the atb b bw and atb m bw models would significantly deviate overestimate a 1 5 as derived by tokunaga 2009 replacing h r by h a in equation 15 that is using equation 9 leads to the slope of noncapillary conductivity predicted by the atb b bw and atb m bw models conforming to the theory of tokunaga 2009 for narrow pore size distribution soils figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary data however for soils with wide pore size distributions fig s4h s4k s4l s5h s5k and s5l the slope is nonlinear because of the incorrect concave shape of the adsorptive saturation function and this again contradicts the physical model of tokunaga 2009 when adopting equation 16 that directly expresses k rnc as function of h the noncapillary conductivity predicted by the atb b bw and atb m bw models is very close to that by the atb b pdi and atb m pdi models for all 12 soils figs 3 and 4 and agrees with the tokunaga 2009 s film conductivity model this indicates that using equation 16 within the bw model can ensure that the calculated noncapillary conductivity is consistent with the theory of tokunaga 2009 for any soils although the adsorptive saturation function of the bw model violates the linearity requirement for wide pore size distribution soils peters and iden 2021 as shown in fig 5 compared to the capillary based atb b and atb m models the pdi based atb b pdi and atb m pdi and bw based atb b bw and atb m bw models display a better 1 1 relation between the predicted and measured hydraulic conductivity moreover the average rmselogk for 12 soils avermselogk of the atb b pdi and atb b bw models is 7 7 and 7 1 times smaller than that of atb b model and the avermselogk of the atb m pdi and atb m bw models is 6 5 and 5 8 times smaller than that of atb m model this implies that the pdi model performs slightly better than the bw model and significantly better than the capillary based atb b and atb m models in terms of their capability to predict the measured hydraulic conductivity data on the whole table 2 and figs 3 5 demonstrate that when equations 10 and 11 proposed by peters et al 2021 are used both the pdi and bw models are able to provide a good prediction of hcc along the entire matric suction range from the fitted wrc parameters and the former performs slightly better 4 3 limitations of the study in this study for the prediction purpose we adopt a 1 5 in the equations 9 and 16 however the parameter a governing the slope of k rnc may deviate from 1 5 particularly for real soils that consist of polydisperse grains with differing surface properties because a 1 5 was derived by tokunaga 2009 based on the case of monodisperse smooth grains this is why rudiyanto et al 2015 incorporated parameter a into the optimization process and wang et al 2016 suggested to use a 2 for sand soils the predicted hydraulic conductivity results of using a 1 5 and a 2 for tottori dune sand are shown in fig 6 compared to adopting a 1 5 fig 6a using a 2 provides a better agreement with the slope of observed noncapillary conductivity data in the high suction range fig 6b however employing a 2 still significantly underestimates the noncapillary conductivity measurements of tottori dune sand for the further improvement another two parameters h m 10 5 cm and hamaker constant a h 6 0 10 20 j which are related with the prediction of k snc may need to be revisited in future h m 10 5 cm corresponding to approximately two to three molecular water layers was adopted based on the work of tuller and or 2005 to refer the transition point where capillary forces can be neglected and noncapillary forces begin to dominate peters et al 2021 by contrast wang et al 2017 suggested to use the h m value that corresponds to the monolayer of water molecules meanwhile based on the findings of resurreccion et al 2011 they recommended to adopt a value of a h 1 0 10 20 j instead of a h 6 0 10 20 j for the hamaker constant as such careful investigations on these three parameters a related to k rnc h m and a h related to k snc in future may help improve the prediction ability for the hcc across the complete suction range for various soils 5 summary and conclusion accurate characterizations of shps along the whole matric suction range require the accounting of both capillary and noncapillary phenomena in this study we extended the weibull distribution models of shps wrc of atb and hcc of atb b and atb m to oven dry conditions via the modular frameworks of pdi and bw the unextended and extended models were then compared with the published data sets of 12 different soils the unextended weibull distribution models of shps yielded inadequate descriptions of the measured data in the dry range of wrc and hcc because they consider the capillary phenomena only and neglect the noncapillary processes that become dominant at low water content by contrast the extended models of shps pdi and bw accounting for both capillary and noncapillary phenomena were able to describe the water retention and hydraulic conductivity data over the entire suction range well the bw model violated the linearity requirement for wrc in dry soils with wide pore size distributions however it agrees with the theory of tokunaga 2009 if relative noncapillary conductivity in the bw model was directly formulated as a function of pressure head peters and iden 2021 in addition the pdi model overall performed better than the bw model in terms of its ability to fit the water retention data and predict the hydraulic conductivity data therefore it is preferable to use the pdi model rather than the bw model to derive the weibull distribution models for shps from full saturation to oven dryness using the physically based approach developed recently by peters et al 2021 the pdi and bw models can provide reliable prediction of hcc across the complete suction range from the wrc solely without use of adjustable conductivity curve parameters this means that the pdi and bw models have practical applicability potential since they are applicable to the scenarios where no conductivity measurements particularly noncapillary dominated range exist which is often the case credit authorship contribution statement

1772,accurate descriptions of soil hydraulic properties over the entire matric suction range require the consideration of both capillary and noncapillary processes this study extended the weibull distribution models of hydraulic properties to complete dryness by the modular frameworks of peters durner iden pdi and brunswick bw model data comparison results showed that the original weibull

shps soil hydraulic properties wrc water retention curve 1 introduction analytical and numerical solutions of the richardson richards equation richardson 1922 richards 1931 require an accurate representation of the soil hydraulic properties shps which mainly include the water retention curve wrc and the hydraulic conductivity curve hcc many empirical and conceptual models have been proposed to characterize the shps assouline and or 2013 the most widely employed wrcs e g brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 kosugi 1996 assouline et al 1998 are empirical semiempirical functions in which the fitting parameters are determined from experimental data according to the statistical approach hoffmann riem et al 1999 kosugi 1999 these wrcs can be combined with the burdine 1953 or mualem 1976a models to derive the hccs assouline and or 2013 and air permeabilities yang and mohanty 2015 assouline 2021 yang et al 2019 2021 these traditional soil hydraulic models conceptualize the pore spaces as an assembly of cylindrical capillary tubes of various diameters and neglect the adsorptive water in wrc and film flow in hcc tuller et al 1999 tuller and or 2001 zhang 2011 peters 2013 most conventional wrcs adopt a distinct residual water content which is either treated as a mere fitting parameter van genuchten and nielsen 1985 or viewed as water adsorbed onto the solid surfaces corey and brooks 1999 below the residual water content water is assumed to be immobile and irreducible luckner et al 1989 this concept was questioned by nimmo 1991 who stated that as soil suction continues increasing the water content continues decreasing until it reaches zero at oven dryness campbell and shiozawa 1992 firstly observed that in the dry end of wrcs the water content decreases linearly toward zero on a semilog plot such log linear form relationship was frequently used in the later developed retention models that cover the entire matric suction range rossi and nimmo 1994 fayer and simmons 1995 khlosi et al 2006 zhang 2011 nevertheless in case of soils with wide pore size distributions the retention functions of fayer and simmons 1995 khlosi et al 2006 and zhang 2011 often fail to reach zero water content at complete dryness peters 2013 to solve this physically inconsistent problem peters 2013 introduced a new retention model that describes the wrc as a weighted linear superposition of the capillary and adsorptive water the peters 2013 retention function despite its usefulness suffers from a mathematical discontinuity issue this problem was solved by iden and durner 2014 who suggested an empirical smoothed piecewise linear function for adsorptive water retention to yield a continuously differentiable wrc covering the full suction range the capillary bundle models like burdine 1953 and mualem 1976a are known to underestimate hydraulic conductivity under dry conditions peters et al 2015 because they overlook the contributions of film and corner flow or and tuller 2000 so far many researchers tuller and or 2001 lebeau and konrad 2010 zhang 2011 peters 2013 have shown that the improved description of hcc can be achieved using the total conductivity function that accounts for both capillary and noncapillary flow the model of tuller and or 2001 accounting for water flow in parallel plates ducts films and corners has received considerable scientific attention but it is seldom used in standard modeling this is due to its mathematical complexity and its exclusive coupling with the wrc of or and tuller 1999 which often fails to describe the measured retention data in the intermediate saturation range lebeau and konrad 2010 the film conductivity in zhang 2011 and peters 2013 is based on the physically based model of tokunaga 2009 which only considered water films larger than 10 nm mainly held by ionic electrostatic forces in contrast lebeau and konrad 2010 hereinafter referred to as lk extended the tokunaga 2009 model to films thinner than 10 nm where long range molecular van der waals forces dominate furthermore increasing liquid viscosity close to solid surfaces which occurs in films thinner than 10 nm or and tuller 2000 is also considered in the lk model although tuller and or 2001 and lk demonstrated that diverse mechanisms are responsible for noncapillary conductivity e g water in thick 10 nm and thin 10 nm films corners and edges of pore spaces it is common practice to sum up all the noncapillary effects and refer to them as film conductivity for simplicity peters and durner 2008 peters et al 2021 therefore the terms noncapillary conductivity and film conductivity are used synonymously in this study the modular framework of the wrc proposed by peters 2013 and improved by iden and durner 2014 together with the related hcc expressions derived by peters 2013 2014 is termed as the peters durner iden pdi model recently weber et al 2019 presented the brunswick bw modular framework that partitions the shps into a capillary and noncapillary part in a similar manner as the pdi model however the bw model differs from the pdi model in that the former introduced a new formulation for the noncapillary water retention which is derived from the integral of capillary saturation function in log space the integral can be calculated numerically weber et al 2019 2020 or by analytical expressions streck and weber 2020 depending on the given capillary retention models note that the noncapillary conductivity function of the pdi and bw models based on the film conductivity model of tokunaga 2009 and peters 2013 respectively is a great simplification compared to the comprehensive physically based lk model this is because the noncapillary conductivity in the pdi and bw models neglects two physical processes 1 molecular component of disjoining pressure isotherm and 2 increasing liquid viscosity in the vicinity of mineral surfaces both physical processes become important in the thin films nonetheless peters et al 2021 demonstrated that the noncapillary conductivity matric suction relation of the pdi model is very similar to that of the lk model because two omitted physical processes effectively counter balance each other based on this finding and the work of tuller and or 2005 tokunaga 2009 and lk peters et al 2021 developed a physically based method to predict the saturated noncapillary conductivity solely from the wrc this improved pdi model denoted as pdi increases the original pdi model s practical applicability since it removes the saturated noncapillary conductivity as a fitting parameter peters et al 2021 the approach developed by peters et al 2021 in the pdi model is expected to apply to the bw model as well which will be shown in section 4 the above introduced shps models covering the entire suction range are important for simulating water flow and biogeochemical processes in dry soils that are either in arid and semiarid areas or influenced by prolonged droughts mohanty and yang 2013 peters et al 2015 for instance luo et al 2020 and iden et al 2021 incorporated the pdi model into the hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 code to conduct the parameter estimation and numerical simulation studies for unsaturated water flow they found that the pdi model improves the soil moisture redistribution and evaporation simulations compared to the van genuchten mualem model to date the model frameworks of pdi peters 2013 2014 peters et al 2021 weber et al 2017 and bw weber et al 2019 2020 have included many widely used wrcs brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 kosugi 1996 fredlund and xing 1994 durner 1994 except for the weibull distribution wrc developed by assouline et al 1998 considering the frequent use of weibull distribution models of shps in modeling of infiltration assouline and selker 2017 and evaporation kamai and assouline 2018 to better simulate such hydrological processes in dry soils it is needed to derive the weibull distribution models for describing shps over the entire matric suction range which are currently not available yet motived by this research need in our study we aim to 1 extend the traditional capillary based weibull distribution models of shps to the oven dry conditions using the modular frameworks of pdi and bw and 2 compare the performance of the pdi and bw models for characterizing the shps from saturation to complete dryness in terms of their ability to describe the measured data 2 model formulation 2 1 traditional weibull distribution models for shps 2 1 1 assouline et al 1998 water retention function assuming that soil structure evolves from a uniform random fragmentation process assouline et al 1998 hereinafter referred to as atb abbreviation of assouline tessier bruand derived a weibull distribution model for wrc which describes the relationship between volumetric water content θ l3 l 3 and soil pressure head h l 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r t h where θ s l3 l 3 and θ r l3 l 3 are the saturated and the residual water content respectively and the dimensionless saturation function t h is given as assouline et al 1998 2 t h 1 e x p ξ 1 h 1 h l μ 0 h h l where h represents the soil suction head ξ l μ and μ are two empirical fitting parameters and h l l is the pressure head corresponding to a very low water content θ l l3 l 3 which represents the limit of interest for a particular wrc application and often corresponds to θ r assouline 2001 assouline and or 2013 yang et al 2019 this study focuses on the wrc within the entire suction range therefore h l is set to equal to h 0 l which is the pressure head at oven dryness where θ 0 according to schneider and goss 2012 h 0 10 6 8 cm notice that when setting h l h 0 10 6 8 cm in equation 2 the θ r in equation 1 correspondingly equals to 0 for the atb model the effective capillary saturation function s c h could be directly given by t h as follows 3 s c h t h 1 e x p ξ 1 h 1 h 0 μ 0 h h 0 notice that unlike the wrc of van genuchten 1980 or kosugi 1996 the rescaling approach introduced by iden and durner 2014 to ensure zero water content at oven dryness is not necessary for the wrc of atb this is because equation 3 naturally reaches zero when h h 0 2 1 2 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function the capillary based weibull distribution model for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k l t 1 is calculated as follows 4 k k s k rc s c where k s l t 1 is the saturated overall conductivity and k rc is the relative capillary conductivity shan et al 2022 and assouline and tartakovsky 2001 respectively derived the atb burdine atb b and atb mualem atb m models for k rc which are detailed in table a1 2 2 pdi modular framework for shps 2 2 1 pdi water retention function the pdi model assumes that the soil water retention is a superposition of capillary saturation function s c h and noncapillary saturation function s nc h 5 θ h θ c h θ nc h θ s θ r s c h θ r s nc h in which θ c l3 l 3 and θ nc l3 l 3 are respectively the volumetric water content of capillary and noncapillary part the residual water content θ r here is interpreted as the maximum adsorptive water content s c h is given by equation 3 and s nc h is denoted by a smoothed piecewise linear function iden and durner 2014 which is reformulated by peters et al 2021 as follows 6 s nc h l n h 0 h b l n 1 h a h 1 b l n h 0 h a where h 0 10 6 8 cm h a l is the pressure head where noncapillary water reaches its saturation and is set to ξ 1 21 1 μ here based on the parameters equivalence of wrcs between the van genuchten 1980 and atb models assouline and or 2013 and b is the smoothing parameter introduced by iden and durner 2014 to guarantee a continuously differentiable water capacity function which is denoted as 7 b b 0 1 0 2 μ 1 e b 1 in which b 0 0 1 l n 10 and b 1 θ r θ s θ r 2 as shown in fig 1 a s nc h namely θ nc θ r increases linearly from 0 at h 0 to its maximum value 1 at h a and afterwards remains constant toward saturation 2 2 2 pdi hydraulic conductivity function the pdi model represents k as the sum of capillary conductivity k c l t 1 and noncapillary conductivity k nc l t 1 if the isothermal vapor conductivity k v l t 1 is ignored peters 2013 peters et al 2021 8 k k c k nc k sc k rc s c k snc k rnc s nc where k sc l t 1 and k snc l t 1 are the saturated hydraulic conductivities for capillary and noncapillary water respectively and k rnc is the relative noncapillary conductivity based on peters 2013 k sc 1 ω k s and k snc ω k s in which ω is the weighting factor subjected to 0 ω 1 note that ω is mostly very small order of magnitude of 10 7 to 10 3 hence in practice k sc 1 ω k s k s peters 2013 since k s is usually measured or can be assumed to a reasonable value k sc is treated as known correspondingly peters et al 2021 the atb b and atb m models for k rc are given in table a1 tokunaga 2009 showed that the decrease of film conductivity with increasing matric suction in the double log scale is virtually linear with a slope of 1 5 based on that peters 2013 developed a simple equation describing the k rnc 9 k rnc s nc h 0 h a a 1 s nc similar to peters 2013 peters et al 2021 stanić et al 2020 and weber et al 2019 2020 a 1 5 is adopted in this work for the purpose of predicting rather than fitting the measurements the approach to predict k snc from wrc parameters in the improved pdi model i e pdi was derived via two steps first peters et al 2021 showed that the noncapillary conductivity in the pdi model which is based on the tokunaga 2009 model that ignores the molecular component of disjoining pressure and increasing viscosity close to mineral surfaces is in good agreement with the comprehensive film conductivity model of lk this is because the two neglected processes effectively counter balance each other second adopting the physical laws and constants used in tuller and or 2005 tokunaga 2009 and lk peters et al 2021 derived a physically based method to predict k snc from the wrc which is given by 10 k snc c θ m h a 1 5 where θ m l3 l 3 is the water content at h m 10 5 cm h a ξ 1 21 1 μ and the constant c is defined as peters et al 2021 11 c 2 3 π 7 3 η ρ g 1 6 6 a h 1 3 r 0 2 3 2 k b t e c z 3 h m 1 3 where η m l 1t 1 is the dynamic viscosity of the bulk liquid ρ m l 3 is the liquid density g l t 2 is the gravitational acceleration constant a h l2 m t 2 is the hamaker constant r and 0 m 1 l 3 t4 a2 are the static relative permittivity of water and the permittivity of free space respectively k b m l2 t 2 k 1 is the boltzmann constant t k is the absolute temperature e c c is the electron charge and z is the ion valence adopting the values used in peters et al 2021 and setting h m 10 5 cm c 103 cm5 2 d 1 or if pressure head is expressed in m and time in s c 1 19 10 8 m5 2 s 1 fig 1b shows the exemplary illustration of k k c and k nc curves of the pdi model in which k c is computed from atb m table a1 for k rc with k sc k s assumed to be known and k nc is calculated from equations 9 10 and 11 2 3 bw modular framework for shps 2 3 1 bw water retention function similar to the pdi model the bw modular framework developed by weber et al 2019 hypothesizes that the wrc is described by a weighted sum of the capillary s c h and noncapillary s nc h saturation function which is given as 12 θ h θ c h θ nc h θ sc s c h θ snc s nc h where θ sc l3 l 3 and θ snc l3 l 3 are respectively the saturated water content of the capillary and the noncapillary part analogous to equation 1 the θ s of the atb model is the sum of θ sc and θ snc θ s θ sc θ snc the s c h in the bw model is given by equation 3 the s nc h in the bw model is directly computed from the s c h by integrating s c h 1 in the pf log 10 h space and rescaling the resulting function s nc h to values between unity and zero 13 s nc h log 10 e 10 h s c h 1 h d h where e denotes the e constant 2 7183 h is the dummy variable of integration representing h and the upper boundary of the integral h 10 is a fixed pressure head very close to 0 which is mathematically necessary since the integral cannot be numerically calculated at zero pressure head according to weber et al 2019 2020 we set 3 leading to h 10 3 cm then we rescaled the equation 13 to obtain the s nc h expression 14 s nc h 1 s nc h s nc h 0 fig 1c shows that the s nc h i e θ nc θ snc curve of the bw model which is calculated based on the equations 13 and 14 remains unity from h to h a and then decreases log linearly from h a to 0 at h 0 2 3 2 bw hydraulic conductivity function the method of calculating the total hcc and its capillary and noncapillary conductivity curve in the bw model is practically the same to that of the pdi model except for two slight differences first the k rnc in the bw model is calculated by 15 k rnc s nc h 0 h r 1 5 1 s nc where pressure head h r is 1 cm introduced by weber et al 2019 2020 to purely ensure k rnc is dimensionless as pointed out by peters and iden 2021 equation 15 is not in agreement with the film conductivity model of tokunaga 2009 due to the constant h r and the subfunction s nc h calculated by equations 13 and 14 within the bw model to be consistent with the model of tokunaga 2009 replacing h r by h a in equation 15 is an effective remedy for soils with narrow pore size distributions unfortunately it is still ineffective for soils with wide pore size distributions in which the shape of s nc h is nonlinear and concave peters and iden 2021 for soils having wide pore size distributions peters and iden 2021 suggested decoupling the s nc and k rnc and directly expressing k rnc as function of h in this way the k rnc function of the bw model agrees with the theory of tokunaga 2009 although the shape of s nc h violates the linearity requirement campbell and shiozawa 1992 and theoretically convex consideration tuller and or 2005 thus in this study following the suggestion of peters and iden 2021 the k rnc within the bw model is evaluated by equation 16 below instead of equation 15 16 k rnc h h h a 1 5 f o r h h a 1 f o r h h a second the k snc in the original bw model is a fitting parameter considering the conductivity data particularly noncapillary dominated range are often missing optimization of k snc in the bw model using experimental data is infeasible to solve this issue we proposed the improved bw model denoted as bw in which k snc is calculated in the same way as in the pdi model i e equations 10 and 11 as shown in table a1 for the bw model we employed almost the same method as in the pdi model to compute the capillary noncapillary and total conductivity curve with the exception of using equation 16 rather than equation 9 or 15 to calculate the k rnc fig 1d displays the exemplified illustration of k k c and k nc curves of the bw model in which total conductivity is calculated from equation 8 capillary conductivity is calculated from atb m table a1 for k rc with k sc k s assumed known and noncapillary conductivity is computed from the equations 10 11 and 16 3 materials and methods 3 1 evaluation data sets sets of measured water retention and conductivity data covering the complete moisture range for 12 different soils were used to evaluate the wrc and hcc models introduced in section 2 the data sets for the shps presented in table 1 were taken from the supporting information of rudiyanto et al 2015 and stanić et al 2020 based on rudiyanto et al 2015 zhang 2011 stanić et al 2020 and peters and iden 2021 three soils in table 1 i e pachapa fine sandy clay sandy loam and clay loam have wide pore size distributions inferred by small values of van genuchten n n 3 whereas the other nine soils in table 1 have narrow pore size distributions large values of van genuchten n n 3 table 1 presents each soil s texture type and other details on the experimental data can be found in the references to the data sources 3 2 model testing procedure first the wrc parameters were determined by minimizing the objective function φ p which is given as wang et al 2016 2017 rudiyanto et al 2020 17 φ p i 1 n θ θ i θ i p 2 where n θ is the number of data points of the water retention θ i and θ i are respectively the measured and calculated water contents and p is the parameter vector adopted for optimization as shown in table a1 the parameter vector p for the atb atb pdi and atb bw retention curves includes θ s ξ μ θ s θ r ξ μ and θ sc θ snc ξ μ respectively the matlab optimization toolbox was adopted to optimize the parameter vector then the best fitted wrc parameters were used to predict the hydraulic conductivity based on the equations summarized in table a1 to be consistent with wang et al 2016 2017 and rudiyanto et al 2020 the root mean squared errors rmses namely rmseθ and rmselogk were calculated to evaluate the model performances rmseθ and rmselogk are defined respectively as 18 r m s e θ 1 n θ i 1 n θ θ i θ i 2 and 19 r m s e l o g k 1 n k i 1 n k l o g 10 k i l o g 10 k i 2 where k i and k i are respectively the measured and predicted hydraulic conductivities and n k is the number of hydraulic conductivity measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 fitting results of water retention curve table 1 shows that the atb pdi model has the smallest rmseθ value for 11 out of 12 evaluation data sets and the atb bw model has the lowest rmseθ for one soil pachappa loam whereas the atb model has the largest rmseθ for all 12 soils fig 2 compares the fitted wrcs by the atb atb pdi and atb bw models with experimental data for 12 soils as shown the atb model produces an inadequate description of the observed water retention data particularly in the dry range of the wrc even though it reaches zero water content at the pressure head corresponding to oven dryness i e h 0 10 6 8 cm this discrepancy can be ascribed to the atb model only considering the capillary water retention and ignoring the noncapillary adsorptive water retention that becomes dominant at low water content in contrast the atb pdi and atb bw models accounting for both the capillary and the adsorptive water retention show improved agreement with the experimental data over the entire range of matric suction in addition as can be seen from fig 2 semilog plot of wrc the atb pdi model and the atb bw model provide the linear decrease of water content to zero on the dry end for 12 soils and 9 soils with narrow pore size distributions respectively this to certain extent demonstrates the effectiveness of using the shape of the capillary saturation function to derive the shape of the noncapillary saturation function within the bw model however for 3 soils pachapa fine sandy clay sandy loam and clay loam that have a wide pore size distribution the atb bw model yields the behavior that the water content decreases concavely to zero on the dry end fig 2h 2k and 2l according to peters and iden 2021 such physically incorrect concave shape generated by the atb bw model not only contradicts the linear requirement campbell and shiozawa 1992 and convex consideration tuller and or 2005 it also affects the accuracy of the hydraulic conductivity prediction as described in section 4 2 this indicates that the connection between the capillary and noncapillary water retention can be deemed too strong in the bw model because the mechanisms causing these two physical phenomena are obviously different and unrelated lebeau and konrad 2010 peters and iden 2021 consequently as pointed out by peters and iden 2021 the approach of deriving the shape of the adsorptive saturation function from the shape of the capillary saturation function in the bw model i e equations 13 and 14 should be used very cautiously and only for soils having narrow pore size distributions it is known that finer soil textures usually result in larger solid specific surfaces on which adsorption of water molecules takes place schneider and goss 2011 peters 2013 as a result the adsorptive water component in the coarse textured sands fig 2a 2f is generally smaller than that in the fine textured loams and clays fig 2g 2j table 1 also shows that θ r maximum adsorptive water content and θ snc saturated noncapillary water content of coarse textured sands are typically lower than that of fine textured loams and clays however for the sandy loam fig 2k and clay loam fig 2l the adsorptive water retention only accounts for a small percentage compared to the capillary water retention which can be clearly inferred from table 1 that shows the very small θ snc of the atb bw model in fact the smallest θ snc of the clay loam implies that capillary water retention predominates and noncapillary water retention plays a negligible role for this soil consequently the wrc fitted by the atb model accounting for capillary water retention only is very close to that of the atb pdi and the atb bw models that consider both capillary and noncapillary water retention fig 2l even fig 2l is zoomed in see fig s1 in the supplementary data one can still find that the wrcs fitted by the three models almost overlap each other in general the atb pdi model performs slightly better than the atb bw model e g fig 2e 2g and 2h the rmseθ values presented in table 1 also demonstrates that the atb pdi model provides the best overall agreement with the measured water retention data followed by the atb bw model and atb model 4 2 prediction of hydraulic conductivity curve with the best fitted wrc parameters obtained in table 1 the hydraulic conductivity can be predicted using the equations summarized in table a1 particularly k s is usually measured and known as a result k sc k s is taken as known k snc is calculated based on the equations 10 and 11 in the pdi and bw models here pdi and bw instead of pdi and bw are used to emphasize that k snc is predicted not fitted in the pdi and bw models the k sc and k snc values for each soil sample are given in table 2 the k snc of the pdi model is slightly different with that of the bw model table 2 for some soils e g shonai sand and pachapa fine sandy clay this is because different fitted wrc parameters between the atb pdi and atb bw models are obtained for these soils table 1 meanwhile table 2 lists the rmselogk for hydraulic conductivity as can be seen in table 2 the atb b pdi atb b bw atb m pdi and atb m bw models give the lowest rmselogk values for two three six and one soil out of the 12 soils respectively the atb b and atb m models on the other hand typically have significantly large rmselogk values for all 12 soils figs 3 and 4 compare the predicted hccs by the burdine based model atb b and its extensions atb b pdi and atb b bw as well as the mualem based model atb m and its extensions atb m pdi and atb m bw with measured data for 12 soils respectively as illustrated in figs 3 and 4 the performance of the burdine based model and its extensions is correspondingly very similar to that of the mualem based model and its extensions the atb b and atb m models based on the capillary bundle theory generally describe the 12 soils data in the medium to wet moisture range well but they significantly underestimate the hydraulic conductivity data in the dry range because they neglect the noncapillary phenomena such as the film flow in contrast the pdi based atb b pdi and atb m pdi and bw based atb b bw and atb m bw models accounting for both capillary and noncapillary flow yield improved and good agreement with the measured conductivity data for most soils although they to some extent overestimate the hydraulic conductivity for tottori dune sand fig 3a and 4a and shonai sand fig 3e and 4e in the dry range as well as for rehovot sand fig 3f and 4f in the intermediate saturation range considering that no fitting of any conductivity parameters is involved in this study figs 3 and 4 illustrate that the pdi and bw models are able to predict the hydraulic conductivity data along the entire matric suction range reasonably well for all the 12 soils in addition since equation 9 adopted in the pdi model can be derived from equation 16 used in the bw model peters 2013 peters et al 2021 the pdi and bw models are deemed to calculate predict the k essentially in the same manner as clearly shown in table a1 as a result the differences between the atb b pdi and atb b bw models fig 3 as well as between the atb m pdi and atb m bw models fig 4 are negligible meanwhile it should be noted that for coarse textured sands the transition zones between capillary dominated and film dominated conductivity generally occur at soil matric suction h 10 2 5 cm fig 3a 3f and fig 4a 4f for fine textured loams and clays such transition zones typically happen at matric suction h 10 2 5 cm fig 3g 3l and fig 4g 4l this is consistent with the findings of peters 2013 as analyzed by peters and iden 2021 when using equation 15 suggested by the original bw model figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary data show that the slope of noncapillary conductivity predicted by the atb b bw and atb m bw models would significantly deviate overestimate a 1 5 as derived by tokunaga 2009 replacing h r by h a in equation 15 that is using equation 9 leads to the slope of noncapillary conductivity predicted by the atb b bw and atb m bw models conforming to the theory of tokunaga 2009 for narrow pore size distribution soils figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary data however for soils with wide pore size distributions fig s4h s4k s4l s5h s5k and s5l the slope is nonlinear because of the incorrect concave shape of the adsorptive saturation function and this again contradicts the physical model of tokunaga 2009 when adopting equation 16 that directly expresses k rnc as function of h the noncapillary conductivity predicted by the atb b bw and atb m bw models is very close to that by the atb b pdi and atb m pdi models for all 12 soils figs 3 and 4 and agrees with the tokunaga 2009 s film conductivity model this indicates that using equation 16 within the bw model can ensure that the calculated noncapillary conductivity is consistent with the theory of tokunaga 2009 for any soils although the adsorptive saturation function of the bw model violates the linearity requirement for wide pore size distribution soils peters and iden 2021 as shown in fig 5 compared to the capillary based atb b and atb m models the pdi based atb b pdi and atb m pdi and bw based atb b bw and atb m bw models display a better 1 1 relation between the predicted and measured hydraulic conductivity moreover the average rmselogk for 12 soils avermselogk of the atb b pdi and atb b bw models is 7 7 and 7 1 times smaller than that of atb b model and the avermselogk of the atb m pdi and atb m bw models is 6 5 and 5 8 times smaller than that of atb m model this implies that the pdi model performs slightly better than the bw model and significantly better than the capillary based atb b and atb m models in terms of their capability to predict the measured hydraulic conductivity data on the whole table 2 and figs 3 5 demonstrate that when equations 10 and 11 proposed by peters et al 2021 are used both the pdi and bw models are able to provide a good prediction of hcc along the entire matric suction range from the fitted wrc parameters and the former performs slightly better 4 3 limitations of the study in this study for the prediction purpose we adopt a 1 5 in the equations 9 and 16 however the parameter a governing the slope of k rnc may deviate from 1 5 particularly for real soils that consist of polydisperse grains with differing surface properties because a 1 5 was derived by tokunaga 2009 based on the case of monodisperse smooth grains this is why rudiyanto et al 2015 incorporated parameter a into the optimization process and wang et al 2016 suggested to use a 2 for sand soils the predicted hydraulic conductivity results of using a 1 5 and a 2 for tottori dune sand are shown in fig 6 compared to adopting a 1 5 fig 6a using a 2 provides a better agreement with the slope of observed noncapillary conductivity data in the high suction range fig 6b however employing a 2 still significantly underestimates the noncapillary conductivity measurements of tottori dune sand for the further improvement another two parameters h m 10 5 cm and hamaker constant a h 6 0 10 20 j which are related with the prediction of k snc may need to be revisited in future h m 10 5 cm corresponding to approximately two to three molecular water layers was adopted based on the work of tuller and or 2005 to refer the transition point where capillary forces can be neglected and noncapillary forces begin to dominate peters et al 2021 by contrast wang et al 2017 suggested to use the h m value that corresponds to the monolayer of water molecules meanwhile based on the findings of resurreccion et al 2011 they recommended to adopt a value of a h 1 0 10 20 j instead of a h 6 0 10 20 j for the hamaker constant as such careful investigations on these three parameters a related to k rnc h m and a h related to k snc in future may help improve the prediction ability for the hcc across the complete suction range for various soils 5 summary and conclusion accurate characterizations of shps along the whole matric suction range require the accounting of both capillary and noncapillary phenomena in this study we extended the weibull distribution models of shps wrc of atb and hcc of atb b and atb m to oven dry conditions via the modular frameworks of pdi and bw the unextended and extended models were then compared with the published data sets of 12 different soils the unextended weibull distribution models of shps yielded inadequate descriptions of the measured data in the dry range of wrc and hcc because they consider the capillary phenomena only and neglect the noncapillary processes that become dominant at low water content by contrast the extended models of shps pdi and bw accounting for both capillary and noncapillary phenomena were able to describe the water retention and hydraulic conductivity data over the entire suction range well the bw model violated the linearity requirement for wrc in dry soils with wide pore size distributions however it agrees with the theory of tokunaga 2009 if relative noncapillary conductivity in the bw model was directly formulated as a function of pressure head peters and iden 2021 in addition the pdi model overall performed better than the bw model in terms of its ability to fit the water retention data and predict the hydraulic conductivity data therefore it is preferable to use the pdi model rather than the bw model to derive the weibull distribution models for shps from full saturation to oven dryness using the physically based approach developed recently by peters et al 2021 the pdi and bw models can provide reliable prediction of hcc across the complete suction range from the wrc solely without use of adjustable conductivity curve parameters this means that the pdi and bw models have practical applicability potential since they are applicable to the scenarios where no conductivity measurements particularly noncapillary dominated range exist which is often the case credit authorship contribution statement

1773,multiphase extraction mpe is widely used as an in situ method for the remediation of groundwater contaminated by light non aqueous liquid lnapl for the purpose of achieving the best performance of mpe remediation it is critical to accurately characterize the lnapl transport processes above the groundwater table with an easy to use model in this study we developed an improved sharp interface model considering constant head at the well screen and shark fin distribution of lnapl saturation above groundwater table the model was successfully validated using the test data of lari et al 2018 the results indicate the lnapl extraction rate is most sensitive to the properties of fluid and media also this improved model was used to analyze the effects of technical parameters such as submersible position of oil pump and water extraction rate on remediation performance we observed that in the case of a single pump mpe even after changing the hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the media the optimized location of the submersible lnapl pump is halfway inside the well similarly in the case of dual pump mpe an increasing pump rate of water qw promotes the lnapl extraction rate and an empirical relationship between the optimized lnapl pump position ms varies with the qw exhibiting a certain pattern overall the improved sharp interface model better interprets the field mpe data compared to the interphase mass transport model proposed by lari et al 2018 therefore the proposed model characterizes lanpl transport during lnapl extraction better and can also be utilized to optimize the mpe more comprehensively keywords sharp interface model oil layer migration multiphase extraction technical optimization constant head data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls are able to penetrate unsaturated water bearing zones as lnalps are lighter than water they easily form a floating mound lens of lnapl on the surface of groundwater after a subsurface leakage lari et al 2016 jugnia et al 2019 lari et al 2021 generating a secondary persistent contaminant source multi phase extraction mpe is the most widely used technology for in situ remediation of seriously contaminated soil by lnapl the mpe technology has two advantages including having a high removal efficiency for a large number of free lnapl in the early stages of in situ remediation and being able to extract gaseous dissolved and lnapl contaminants in both saturated and phreatic zones bortoni et al 2019 kacem and benadda 2018 to achieve the best performance in mpe remediation it is important to accurately characterize the lnapl transport processes above the groundwater table besides being an easy to use model the mpe is also essential for optimizing the design of lnapl extraction previous models of lanpl migration above groundwater table mainly include interphase mass transfer imt model qi et al 2020 immiscible phase flow ipf model abriola 1989 kaluarachchi and parker 1989 el kadi 1994 and sharp interface model corapcioglu et al 1994 the imt model calculates the saturation of each phase first for the subsequent application of constitutive relationship between permeability k saturation s and pressure p providing the velocity of each phase essential for the advection dispersion simulation in the second step qi et al 2020 without the concept concentration in the imt model the ipf model is characterized by the continuity equations composed of the partial derivatives of the pressure of each phase with time which assumes that the saturation variation of each phase will directly influence the saturation of the other one abriola 1989 kaluarachchi and parker 1989 imt and ipf models are typically solved by finite element or finite difference methods kaluarachchi and parker 1989 qi et al 202 which suffer from computational cost and numerical errors in addition due to the uncertainties of the great number of input parameters needed in the model the imt model yielded unsatisfactory fitting with the measured values from the field lari et al 2018 due to the dissolved contaminants beneath the large slope phreatic surface that are not accounted for qi et al 2020 unlike the imt and ipf models the sharp interface model assumes a piston or plug flow with a sharp transition between napl saturated and dry conditions corapcioglu et al 1994 kim and corapcioglu 2003 liao and aral 2000 furthermore the sharp interface model can be solved semi analytically with this assumption the sharp interface model has an appealing application due to its low data requirements however it is important to note that its assumptions are not as rigorous as the imt and ipf models el kadi 1994 overall the sharp interface model characterizes strictly the shape of the phreatic surface which enables it to simulate different scenarios of oil extraction facilitated by pumping water corapcioglu et al 1994 the current studies of lnapl extraction using sharp interface model have been simplified in two ways on one hand the lnapl extraction rate is assumed to be constant on the other hand the lnapl saturation is assumed to be uniformly distributed in the vertical profile of vadose zone corapcioglu et al 1994 1996 liao and aral 2000 however the observed lnapl extraction rate is temporally decreasing with a fixed pump position lari et al 2018 indicating that the current model with constant lnapl extraction rate is no longer applicable in addition saturation is a function of capillary pressure and fluid properties as for the vertical distribution of lnapl saturation in the vadose zone more specifically from the vicinity above the phreatic surface upwards to the upper contaminated boundary extensive remediation studies of subsurface lnapl contamination have reported that the lnapl saturation profile shows a shark fin distribution above the phreatic surface under unconfined conditions at vertical mechanical equilibrium adamski et al 2005 beckett and huntley 1998 hartsock 2014 lenhard et al 2017 this phenomenon is apparently caused due to the bottom and top of the capillary zones being dominated by water and air respectively in terms of the intrinsic mechanism this is because the saturation is function of air lnapl and lnapl water capillary heads which are elevation dependent under the equilibrium state between gravity and capillary head lenhard et al 2017 therefore the assumption of a uniformly distributed lnapl saturation along the vertical profile will generate errors when using the sharp interface model for mpe design lenhard and parker 1990 huntley et al 1994 frollini and petitta 2018 therefore in this study we extended the sharp interface model by assuming a vertical shark fin distribution of lnapl saturation which is more realistic for the purpose of optimizing the mpe technology the effects of artificially controlled parameters such as the lnapl extraction rate the water extraction rate and the submersible location of the lnapl pump on the remediation efficiency has to be quantitatively estimated however such parameters have not been well investigated in previous mpe modeling studies it is noteworthy that qi et al 2020 investigated the effects of liquid pumping rate and pump position on the mpe performance their numerical results indicate distinct fitting errors with the field data and did not consider the existence of sloping phreatic surface besides qi et al 2020 only compared the costs of mpe and chemical oxidation approach but did not provide specific optimization strategies for an application scenario especially in designing the water extraction rate in a dual pump mpe to develop a lnapl extraction model with high computational efficiency and accuracy as well as provide optimization strategies for the mpe this study will develop an improved sharp interface model considering constant head at well screen and shark fin distribution of lnapl saturation above groundwater table a semi analytical solution of the model will be obtained by using the laplace transform and inversely transformed with the stehfest method instead of the approximation method used in corapcioglu et al 1994 with the analytical results the effects of technical parameters such as submersible pump position and water extraction rate on remediation performance will be analyzed then the optimization strategies for both single pump skimming and dual pump extraction will be theoretically provided with the assistance of this improved model 2 problem statement and mathematical model as shown in fig 1 the origin of the cylindrical coordinates is located at the center of the extraction well the positive z axis extends to the top of the well and z 0 is centered at the bottom of the wellbore while the positive r axis extends in the radial direction the wellbore radius is rw and the outer boundary of the lens radius is ro this paper analyzes the vertical shark fin saturation distribution and pump technology there are several assumptions in this improved sharp interface model and they include the following 1 the phreatic aquifer is homogeneous isotropic and incompressible 2 the volatile and extracted amount of gas phase is negligible 3 a piston displacement of fluids is assumed considering a sharp transition at the interface between napl and the surrounding dry environment 4 the lnapl saturation profile above the phreatic surface has a shark fin shape and this shape will persist during the lnapl extraction with a slow multi phase transport lenhard and parker 1990 adamski et al 2005 hartsock 2014 2 1 governing equation for the movement of lnapl during extraction based on the above assumptions a mass balance equation with lnapl saturation as the core index can be established as follows corapcioglu et al 1994 1 h r t l r t ρ o q 0 ρ o s o n t d z 0 where r and t represent radial distance l from the well

corapcioglu et al 1994 assumed however in this study the soo and ko represent the so called equivalent lnapl saturation degree and hydraulic conductivity of lnapl respectively which should be a weighted average value along the vertical profile above the phreatic surface by introducing an average thickness of lnapl denoted as m o which is defined as the volume of lnapl per unit area of the aquifer divided by the porosity corapcioglu et al 1994 eq 2 is transformed into a form in the axis symmetric radial coordinates as 2 m r 2 1 r m r 2 h r 2 1 r h r q o k o m o δ r a 3 n s oo s oun k o m o m t n s oun s ow k o m o h t note that eq 3 indicates a universal form of the transport equation for the lnapl mound accounting for the geometrical morphology of water table in this study a relatively uniform lnapl lens is laid above the water table resulting in groundwater being confined therefore the depression cone of water level can be described by the theis equation corapcioglu et al 1994 4 h r t h 0 q w 4 π k w h 0 w u where h0 is initial head of aquifer l w u is the theis well function theis 1935 u r 2 s y 4 k w h 0 t and sy is the specific yield of the aquifer substitution eq 4 into eq 3 yields the governing equation of free product thickness as 5 2 m r 2 1 r m r n s oo s oun k o m o m t q w 4 π k w h 0 s y k w h 0 n s oun s ow k o m o exp r 2 s y 4 k w h o t t where a qw equal and unequal to zero represent single pump skimming and dual pump extraction respectively 2 2 constant head boundary as the field data from lari et al 2018 indicates the lnapl extraction rate decreases with time and eventually tends to be relatively stable this is because the pressure gradient decreases with the out diffusion of the depression cone of lnapl head in the case of fixed submersible location and power of lnapl pump based on this reality in field mpe this study proposes a relative pump position which is expressed as ms mb ml where mb is the distance between the submersible pump and the lnapl layer bottom in well while ml is the lnapl layer thickness then a constant head boundary at the well screen can be written as 6 lim r r w m m b the initial condition and the boundary condition at a radially finite extent are 7 m r 0 m l and 8 l r t r r r o 0 respectively where ro and rw are the radius of lnapl lens and the pumping well l now for a simplicity of the notation we define b n s oo s oun k o m o f q w 4 π k w h 0 s y k w h 0 n s oun s ow k o m o d s y k w h 0 a continuity equation for the lnapl extraction using sharp interface model considering constant head boundary in a laplace domain can be yielded as 9 d 2 m d r 2 1 r d m dr p b m 2 f k 0 r dp 1 2 b m l the solution of eq 9 can be expressed as 10 m c 1 i 0 r bp 1 2 c 2 k 0 r bp 1 2 2 f d

are zero order modified bessel functions of the first and second kind respectively the well discharge with constant head can be calculated as 11 q 2 π r w m s m l k o b p 1 2 c 1 i 1 r w b p 1 2 c 2 k 1 r w b p 1 2 q w 2 π k w h 0 2 f d b d p 1 2 k 1 r w d p 1 2 where i 1 and k 1 are first order modified bessel functions of the first and second kind respectively the detailed derivation for eq 8 10 can be found in the appendix eq 9 is difficult to be inverted analytically to yield the solution in the real time domain accordingly we employed a numerical inversion method stehfest method stehfest 1970a stehfest 1970b by developing a matalb program for such calculation 2 3 weighted average of lnapl saturation degree along the vertical profile as mentioned above the key parameters soo and ko in eq 2 should be equivalent values that can represent the sharp fin distribution of lnapl saturation along the vertical profile above groundwater table this implies that the value of each parameter in each horizontal slice should be assembled into a more comprehensively vertical average value for the purpose of solving the sharp interface model similar to the concept of a vertical average for generating the continuity equation of lnapl thickness this study conducts a weighted average of lnapl saturation degree along the vertical profile we employed the lnapl saturation degree data observed in the field site as the of lari et al 2018 indicates then the weighted average along the vertical axis is performed to obtain the equivalent values of soo and ko in eq 9 12 s oo 1 l r t h r t h r t l r t s d z in order to calculate the relative permeability the concept of effective saturation proposed by lenhard and parker 1987 was introduced the apparent saturation of total liquid s t and water s w can be expressed as lenhard and parker 1987 lenhard et al 2004 13 s t s w s oo s wr 1 s wr 14 s w s w s wr 1 s wr respectively where s t is the sum of the apparent saturations of lnapl and water in the soil s w is the water phase apparent saturation s t s w and s oo are the actual saturation degrees of liquid water and lnapl phases respectively s wr is the residual saturation of water based on the relationship between the relative permeability and saturation degree proposed by parker et al 1987 which is an adaptation of van genuchten s expression van genuchten and nielsen 1985 the relative permeability of lnapl phase k r o can be calculated as 15 k r o s of 0 5 1 s w s or 1 m m 1 s t 1 m m 2 where m is a parameter of the van genuchten 1980 saturation pressure s p equation m 1 1 n n is the saturation pressure s p curve shape parameter s of and s or are effective free and residual lnapl saturations respectively which are defined as 16 s of s of 1 s wr 17 s or s or 1 s wr where s oo s of s or s or is the actual residual saturation of lnapl s of is actual free mobile lnapl saturation then the weighted average hydraulic conductivity is calculated as 18 k o k s k r o ρ o g μ o where k s is the absolute permeability l2 μ o is the lnapl phase viscosity coefficient mt 1l 1 with the calculated average lnapl saturation degree and hydraulic conductivity the results of lanpl thickness and extraction rate in eqs 10 and 11 with sharp interface model will be refined 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the proposed model to test the proposed analytical model a finite element analysis and simulation software comsol multiphysics was used to establish a two dimensional axisymmetric model with radius 50 m height 10 m and well radius 0 203 m through darcy s law and modified lnapl hydraulic conductivity the upper and lower boundary conditions were non flux and the left and right boundary conditions were controlled by lnapl head fig 2 shows the result of the analytical and numerical solutions the two blue lines are the fitting of field data of lari et al 2018 furthermore we altered the sensitive lnapl hydraulic conductivity k shown in red k 2 81 10 5m s and it is clear that the lnapl recovery rate in both groups has a phenomenon that the numerical solution is slightly higher than the analytical solution the numerical solution is the model s approximate answer but it is utilized to assess the correctness of the new analytical model s derivation the data from lari et al 2018 field experiment and numerical model will be used to test the performance of the improved shape interface model the mpe field data that was obtained from the work conducted in western australia as reported by lari et al 2018 was employed to verify the performance of the improved sharp interface model proposed in this study the mpe process of lari et al 2018 included six successive stages of lnapl remediation such as skimming vacuum and skimming slurping etc in their study the first stage of mpe the groundwater table was kept stable without any drawdown during skimming the lnapl was extracted with a submersible pump in a fixed position additionally the vertical saturation profile was initially shark fin shaped therefore the setup of the field test was well suited to verify the improvements of the model in two aspects constant head boundary and vertical equivalent saturation of lnapl the parameters used to verify the improved sharp interface model are shown in table 1 all the parameters related to the properties of media and lnapl are the same as those reported in the field mpe of lari et al 2018 since lari et al 2018 addressed that the skimming point was located near the lnapl water interface inside the well this study sets the value of ms to be approximately zero which is 0 01 as table 1 indicates it is nothworthy that when adjusting the value of ms to be 0 001 0 005 0 02 which also approache zero but have multiple differences compared with ms 0 01 the thickness of lnapl in the aquifer has very limited change that is less than 0 1 with the vertical distribution of lnapl saturation degree reported by lari et al 2018 the weighted average lnapl saturation degree and hydraulic conductivity in the vertical profile are calculated to be 0 23 and 3 03 respectively using eqs 12 18 in section 2 3 fig 3 shows the application performances of the improved sharp interface model in field lnapl extraction the red dots dotted black dotted line and the blue solid line represent the lnapl extraction rates qo measured in field site simulated by the numerical model in lari et al 2018 and the improved sharp interface model in this study respectively as fig 3 shows the observed lnapl extraction rate decreased sharply from 5 to 6 ml s to 0 1 ml s on the second day which is due to the rapidly decreasing lnapl thickness and limited residual lnapl mass this undoubtedly indicates the necessity of revising the inner boundary in the traditional constant rate sharp interface model for lnapl extraction in addition fig 3 also indicates that the improved sharp interface model performs better than the previous numerical model especially when predicting the decreasing lnapl extraction rate in the middle and late stages which indicates that the sharp interface model performs better than numerical model due to lower number of variable values and numerical errors furthermore fig 3 shows that the enhancement with regard to a constant head boundary as well as vertical nonuniform lnapl distribution clearly promotes the applicability of the sharp interface model it should also be noted that the numerical model employed by lari et al 2018 overestimated the lnapl extraction rate in the late stage of lnapl skimming which should be directly from the overestimation of the relative permeability of lnapl in fact the misestimation in the study is due to the use of the k s p constitutive relationship which neglects the existence of residual lnapl saturation due to mall or dead end pore channels and pore wedges lenhard et al 2004 considering that residual degree of lnapl is common during field mpe and strongly affects the actual transport of lnapl this study employed the k s p constitutive relationship considering residual lnapl saturation lenhard et al 2004 in the sharp interface model this approach promotes the prediction accuracy of lnapl extraction by decreasing 20 mean square error as fig 3 indicates 3 2 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted in this study to estimate the effects of technical parameters and the properties of aquifer and contaminants on the lnapl extraction rate as proposed by huang and yeh 2007 the normalized sensitivity of parameters can be defined as 19 x i j p j r i p j where x i j is the normalized sensitivity of the j th parameter p j at the i th time r i is the dependent variable at the i th time step huang and yeh 2007 proposed a finite difference formula to approximate the partial derivation as 20 r i p j r i p j δ p j r i p j δ p j where δ p j is a small increment which is chosen as 10 2 p j the following parameters are given as ks 1 10 9 m2 ρ o μ o 6 25 10 5 s m ms 0 3 sy 0 2 qw 100 m3 d the sensitivity analysis of the parameters was performed and the result is shown in fig 4 which indicates that the properties of the fluid ρ o μ o and medium ks are most sensitive to lnapl extraction rate as eq 18 shows the hydraulic conductivity of the lnapl lens is directly affected by ρ o μ o and ks while an inaccurate characterization of the relative permeability of lnapl phase k r o will amplify the misestimation of the hydraulic conductivity of lnapl lens based on this understanding fig 3 indicates that the improved sharp interface model has more accurate characterization of the relative permeability of lnapl phase than the numerical model in lari et al 2018 since both of them employ the same values of parameters as table 1 indicates besides the vertically weighted average in the improved model also proves to characterize the relative permeability of the lnapl phase more accurately than the traditional sharp interface model this also illustrates the necessity and accuracy of the improved sharp interface model from both theoretical and modeling aspects secondly the sensitivities of the technical parameters water extraction rate qw and relative pump position ms are not as high as those of ks and ρ o μ o which indicates that water extraction and the adjustment of pump position can only act as an auxiliary tool for lnapl extraction and will probably not perform well if the properties of lnapl and soil are not conductive for lnapl transport therefore we can only maximize the lnapl extraction rate by adjusting the technical parameters as much as possible besides the normalized sensitivity of sy is almost zero meaning sy will not greatly impact the estimation accuracy of lnapl extraction therefore the value of sy taken from corapcioglu et al 1994 is also reasonable for this study though the value of sy does not necessarily represent the actual situation of the site lari et al 2018 3 3 optimization of technical parameters 3 3 1 optimization of submersible pump position the submersible pump position is an important technical parameter which is especially critical for skimming with a single pump this is because a deeper submergence of the lnapl pump leads to a thinner cross section area of lnapl layer at the well screen and a greater amount of extracted water meanwhile a shallower submerge will lead to a smaller hydraulic gradient of lnapl near the well and a greater amount of gas therefore it is necessary to analyze the effects of different pump positions on the lnapl extraction rate with the parameters given in table 1 the effects of pump location on the lnapl extraction rate are shown in fig 5 the relative pump position ms is given as 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 respectively the results indicate that a deeper or a shallower pump position decreases lnapl extraction rate to determine the optimized location of the submersible lnapl pump for best performance of the lnapl extraction fig 6 represents the simulated lnapl extraction volumes versus pump locations in the case of a single pump skimming with different porosity n and hydraulic conductivity ko in fig 6 a and 6 b respectively it can be found that the lnapl extraction volume vo is greater with increasing porosity or hydraulic conductivity besides the curve of the lnapl extraction volume shows a symmetric phenomenon at the position of ms 0 5 while the lnapl extraction volumes are same in the cases of ms 0 2 and 0 8 as well as ms 0 4 and 0 6 even when the default values of n 0 35 and ko 3 03 are expanded or shrunk by 20 and 40 within reason this phenomenon still exists in addition consistent with the results of the sensitivity analysis the change in the volume of lnapl extraction caused by the changing hydraulic conductivity ko is much greater than by the changing the porosity n in general the middle position in the lnapl layer inside the wellbore is established as the optimal location for best lnapl extraction rate in the case of single pump skimming and this optimized location is not affected by the property of the media in the case of dual pump extraction a pumping induced groundwater cone of depression will increase the area of cross section of lnapl at the well faces which may strongly affect the optimal position of the submersible pump fig 7 shows the lnapl extraction volume versus lnapl pump locations represented by ms with different water extraction rates qw in the case of dual pump the value of ms with the maximum vo indicates the optimized location of submersible lnapl pump it can be clearly observed that an increasing water extraction rate promotes lnapl extraction meanwhile the optimized submersible lnapl pump approaches the lnapl air interface as qw increases and will no longer change after the qw exceeds 200 m3 d since the vo ms curve is monotonically increasing after then this also indicates an interesting finding that slurping is unexpectedly the best operation of skimming with a considerable groundwater table drawdown and both of the two extraction modes have been investigated in lari et al 2018 fig 8 shows the optimized pump position ms with respect to each given water extraction rate qw an empirical relationship can be obtained by fitting the ms and qw using the weighted least squares method 21 m s 0 0025 q w 0 50 m s 1 in general the optimal lnapl pump location gets closer to the lnapl gas interface with an increasing water extraction rate in the case of the dual pump the pressure gradient of lnapl at the well face is no longer a limiting factor to the lnapl extraction rate anymore due to the cone of depression in both groundwater and lnapl layers especially when the water extraction rate is relatively high instead the cross section area of lnapl becomes the limiting factor under this circumstance therefore properly lifting the submersible lnapl pump will increase distinctly the cross section area of lnapl which is also indicated by the above empirical formula after all unlike the single pump case in which the optimized pump location should always be placed in the middle depth of the lnapl layer the optimized lnapl pump location in the dual pump case should be closer to the upper lnapl face with an increasing water extraction rate it should be noted that this study proposes an empirical linear relationship between the submersible pump location and the water extraction rate with given parameters which has strong potential to provide quantitative inference on how to optimize the location of the lnapl pump during field based mpe with both single and dual pump systems 3 3 2 optimization of water extraction rate extensive studies have emphasized the necessity of pumping water during the process of lnapl extraction however few have quantitatively investigated the effects of water extraction rate on the performance of lnapl extraction besides due to the dissolution of lnapl the water extracted is often contaminated and a greater water extraction rate will lead to a higher cost of wastewater treatment therefore there should theoretically be an optimized pumping rate that accounts for both the facilitation for lnapl extraction and wastewater treatment cost which can also be computed by the improved sharp interface model in this study as fig 7 indicates though a higher rate of water extraction will promote lnapl extraction a greater amount of water extraction means a higher cost of wastewater treatment this study takes the benzene contaminants as an example and assumes that all the extracted water needs to be treated at a certain price then the costs for the treatment of both wastewater and benzene during mpe can be calculated as 22 m 0 t q w p w q o p o ρ o d t where m is remediation costs po is the cost to treat lnapl as hazardous waste po 15 rmb kg lnapl lnapl pw is the cost to treat water as industrial water pw 20 rmb m3 wastewater to determine the optimized water extraction rate in the dual pump case we compared the growth rates of both lnapl extraction rate and economic cost by increasing the water extraction rate as fig 8 indicates both remediation cost and lnapl extraction rate increase which means the economic cost is the price that has to be paid for the improvements of remediation performance note that the increasing rate of cost decreases faster than that of extraction rate when pumping rate of water is small therefore it is reasonably assumed that when the growth rate of economic cost begins to approaches that of lnapl extraction rate with an increasing water extraction rate the optimized water extraction rate has been reached this optimized rate which is about 800 m3 d as fig 9 indicates can prevent more contaminated water from being extracted out meanwhile an increasing water pumping rate can accelerate the balance between pumping efficiency and economic consumption until it becomes lower than the optimized value 4 limitations and future prospects though this improved sharp interface model has high computational efficiency and accuracy as well as potential for technology optimization it should be noted that the model still has some limitations on one hand the assumptions of this model are not that rigorous in some scenarios since the sharp interface model is generally suitable for coarse medium near dry conditions abriola and pinder 1985 on the other hand the optimized water pumping rate is not strictly universal for all lnapl extraction cases in practice some project director may have different criterions such as an upper limit of remediation budget or a lower limit of extraction rate of lnapl that has to be guaranteed and these criterions can also be applied into our improved model this study just wants to represent a relatively sophisticated comparison relationship between cost and performance and take it as an example to reveal how our model can be applied into the determination of optimal pumping rate of water in future research it is needed to account for more interphase factors such as the mass transfer processes between air lnapl and lnapl water in the simulation besides more laboratory experiments should be conducted to testify the simulation accuracy moreover capillary end effect and well loss which means the water phase accumulates near well face and energy loss inside well should be paid more attention since they may affect the lnapl extraction efficiency 5 summary and conclusions in this study an analytical model was developed to characterize the lnapl extraction in mpe with both single pump skimming and dual pump extraction the model employed the mass conservation equation solved by sharpinterface method to depict the transport of lnapl constant head boundary conditions and shark fin distribution of lnapl saturation with depth are taken into consideration in the developed model when compared to previous mpe models results from validation tests indicate that the new model performs better in fitting the field mpe lnapl extraction rate from the work by lari et al 2018 in addition we evaluated the influences of technical parameters and aquifer properties on the lnapl extraction rate the optimal location of the lnapl pump as well as the water extraction rate were determined using the improved sharp interface model overall the following conclusions were drawn 1 considering the constant head boundary conditions and the shark fin distribution of lnapl saturation with depth the improved sharp interface model represents a 20 improvement over the interphase transfer model in the prediction of the lnapl extraction rate in field mpe 2 the lnapl extraction rate is most sensitive to the properties of the fluid such as ρ o μ o and soil media such as ks however it is less sensitive to the water extraction and pump position and least sensitive to the specific yield sy 3 in the case of a single pump the optimized location of the submersible lnapl pump is the middle of the lnapl layer while for a dual pump the optimized location of the submersible lnapl pump should be lifted until to the lnapl gas interface as the water extraction rate increases 4 combining both the lnapl extraction efficiency and the economic cost into consideration there exists an optimized water extraction rate of

1773,multiphase extraction mpe is widely used as an in situ method for the remediation of groundwater contaminated by light non aqueous liquid lnapl for the purpose of achieving the best performance of mpe remediation it is critical to accurately characterize the lnapl transport processes above the groundwater table with an easy to use model in this study we developed an improved sharp interface model considering constant head at the well screen and shark fin distribution of lnapl saturation above groundwater table the model was successfully validated using the test data of lari et al 2018 the results indicate the lnapl extraction rate is most sensitive to the properties of fluid and media also this improved model was used to analyze the effects of technical parameters such as submersible position of oil pump and water extraction rate on remediation performance we observed that in the case of a single pump mpe even after changing the hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the media the optimized location of the submersible lnapl pump is halfway inside the well similarly in the case of dual pump mpe an increasing pump rate of water qw promotes the lnapl extraction rate and an empirical relationship between the optimized lnapl pump position ms varies with the qw exhibiting a certain pattern overall the improved sharp interface model better interprets the field mpe data compared to the interphase mass transport model proposed by lari et al 2018 therefore the proposed model characterizes lanpl transport during lnapl extraction better and can also be utilized to optimize the mpe more comprehensively keywords sharp interface model oil layer migration multiphase extraction technical optimization constant head data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls are able to penetrate unsaturated water bearing zones as lnalps are lighter than water they easily form a floating mound lens of lnapl on the surface of groundwater after a subsurface leakage lari et al 2016 jugnia et al 2019 lari et al 2021 generating a secondary persistent contaminant source multi phase extraction mpe is the most widely used technology for in situ remediation of seriously contaminated soil by lnapl the mpe technology has two advantages including having a high removal efficiency for a large number of free lnapl in the early stages of in situ remediation and being able to extract gaseous dissolved and lnapl contaminants in both saturated and phreatic zones bortoni et al 2019 kacem and benadda 2018 to achieve the best performance in mpe remediation it is important to accurately characterize the lnapl transport processes above the groundwater table besides being an easy to use model the mpe is also essential for optimizing the design of lnapl extraction previous models of lanpl migration above groundwater table mainly include interphase mass transfer imt model qi et al 2020 immiscible phase flow ipf model abriola 1989 kaluarachchi and parker 1989 el kadi 1994 and sharp interface model corapcioglu et al 1994 the imt model calculates the saturation of each phase first for the subsequent application of constitutive relationship between permeability k saturation s and pressure p providing the velocity of each phase essential for the advection dispersion simulation in the second step qi et al 2020 without the concept concentration in the imt model the ipf model is characterized by the continuity equations composed of the partial derivatives of the pressure of each phase with time which assumes that the saturation variation of each phase will directly influence the saturation of the other one abriola 1989 kaluarachchi and parker 1989 imt and ipf models are typically solved by finite element or finite difference methods kaluarachchi and parker 1989 qi et al 202 which suffer from computational cost and numerical errors in addition due to the uncertainties of the great number of input parameters needed in the model the imt model yielded unsatisfactory fitting with the measured values from the field lari et al 2018 due to the dissolved contaminants beneath the large slope phreatic surface that are not accounted for qi et al 2020 unlike the imt and ipf models the sharp interface model assumes a piston or plug flow with a sharp transition between napl saturated and dry conditions corapcioglu et al 1994 kim and corapcioglu 2003 liao and aral 2000 furthermore the sharp interface model can be solved semi analytically with this assumption the sharp interface model has an appealing application due to its low data requirements however it is important to note that its assumptions are not as rigorous as the imt and ipf models el kadi 1994 overall the sharp interface model characterizes strictly the shape of the phreatic surface which enables it to simulate different scenarios of oil extraction facilitated by pumping water corapcioglu et al 1994 the current studies of lnapl extraction using sharp interface model have been simplified in two ways on one hand the lnapl extraction rate is assumed to be constant on the other hand the lnapl saturation is assumed to be uniformly distributed in the vertical profile of vadose zone corapcioglu et al 1994 1996 liao and aral 2000 however the observed lnapl extraction rate is temporally decreasing with a fixed pump position lari et al 2018 indicating that the current model with constant lnapl extraction rate is no longer applicable in addition saturation is a function of capillary pressure and fluid properties as for the vertical distribution of lnapl saturation in the vadose zone more specifically from the vicinity above the phreatic surface upwards to the upper contaminated boundary extensive remediation studies of subsurface lnapl contamination have reported that the lnapl saturation profile shows a shark fin distribution above the phreatic surface under unconfined conditions at vertical mechanical equilibrium adamski et al 2005 beckett and huntley 1998 hartsock 2014 lenhard et al 2017 this phenomenon is apparently caused due to the bottom and top of the capillary zones being dominated by water and air respectively in terms of the intrinsic mechanism this is because the saturation is function of air lnapl and lnapl water capillary heads which are elevation dependent under the equilibrium state between gravity and capillary head lenhard et al 2017 therefore the assumption of a uniformly distributed lnapl saturation along the vertical profile will generate errors when using the sharp interface model for mpe design lenhard and parker 1990 huntley et al 1994 frollini and petitta 2018 therefore in this study we extended the sharp interface model by assuming a vertical shark fin distribution of lnapl saturation which is more realistic for the purpose of optimizing the mpe technology the effects of artificially controlled parameters such as the lnapl extraction rate the water extraction rate and the submersible location of the lnapl pump on the remediation efficiency has to be quantitatively estimated however such parameters have not been well investigated in previous mpe modeling studies it is noteworthy that qi et al 2020 investigated the effects of liquid pumping rate and pump position on the mpe performance their numerical results indicate distinct fitting errors with the field data and did not consider the existence of sloping phreatic surface besides qi et al 2020 only compared the costs of mpe and chemical oxidation approach but did not provide specific optimization strategies for an application scenario especially in designing the water extraction rate in a dual pump mpe to develop a lnapl extraction model with high computational efficiency and accuracy as well as provide optimization strategies for the mpe this study will develop an improved sharp interface model considering constant head at well screen and shark fin distribution of lnapl saturation above groundwater table a semi analytical solution of the model will be obtained by using the laplace transform and inversely transformed with the stehfest method instead of the approximation method used in corapcioglu et al 1994 with the analytical results the effects of technical parameters such as submersible pump position and water extraction rate on remediation performance will be analyzed then the optimization strategies for both single pump skimming and dual pump extraction will be theoretically provided with the assistance of this improved model 2 problem statement and mathematical model as shown in fig 1 the origin of the cylindrical coordinates is located at the center of the extraction well the positive z axis extends to the top of the well and z 0 is centered at the bottom of the wellbore while the positive r axis extends in the radial direction the wellbore radius is rw and the outer boundary of the lens radius is ro this paper analyzes the vertical shark fin saturation distribution and pump technology there are several assumptions in this improved sharp interface model and they include the following 1 the phreatic aquifer is homogeneous isotropic and incompressible 2 the volatile and extracted amount of gas phase is negligible 3 a piston displacement of fluids is assumed considering a sharp transition at the interface between napl and the surrounding dry environment 4 the lnapl saturation profile above the phreatic surface has a shark fin shape and this shape will persist during the lnapl extraction with a slow multi phase transport lenhard and parker 1990 adamski et al 2005 hartsock 2014 2 1 governing equation for the movement of lnapl during extraction based on the above assumptions a mass balance equation with lnapl saturation as the core index can be established as follows corapcioglu et al 1994 1 h r t l r t ρ o q 0 ρ o s o n t d z 0 where r and t represent radial distance l from the well center and time t respectively ρo is the density of the lnapl phase ml 3 so is the saturation degree of the lnapl phase n is the effective porosity l r t and h r t represent the heights of the lnapl gas interface and lnapl water interface over time and position respectively l qo is the specific discharge of lnapl phase lt 1 in the sharp interface model capillary forces can be neglected and the qo can be calculated by darcy s law as q o k 0 l in which ko is the hydraulic conductivity of lnapl lt 1 according to leibnitz s rules and vertical averaging rules which are shown in appendix a corapcioglu et al 1994 yielded the governing equation describing lnapl transport above the groundwater table with spatiotemporal lnapl mound thickness as follows ρ o k o m m ρ o k o m h ρ o q o δ r a 2 n ρ o s oo s oun m t n ρ o s oun s ow h t where m is the lnapl thickness in the pumping well l the first term on the right hand side represents location at the point r a l q o is the distributed rate of lnapl leak l3t 1 δ is the dirac delta function used to represent point sources or sinks s oo s oun and s ow are the saturation in the lnapl layer unsaturation zone and groundwater zone respectively flux conditions at both the moving upper lnapl gas boundary and the phreatic surface are considered to have constant porosity and fluid density note that in eq 2 the soo is constant as corapcioglu et al 1994 assumed however in this study the soo and ko represent the so called equivalent lnapl saturation degree and hydraulic conductivity of lnapl respectively which should be a weighted average value along the vertical profile above the phreatic surface by introducing an average thickness of lnapl denoted as m o which is defined as the volume of lnapl per unit area of the aquifer divided by the porosity corapcioglu et al 1994 eq 2 is transformed into a form in the axis symmetric radial coordinates as 2 m r 2 1 r m r 2 h r 2 1 r h r q o k o m o δ r a 3 n s oo s oun k o m o m t n s oun s ow k o m o h t note that eq 3 indicates a universal form of the transport equation for the lnapl mound accounting for the geometrical morphology of water table in this study a relatively uniform lnapl lens is laid above the water table resulting in groundwater being confined therefore the depression cone of water level can be described by the theis equation corapcioglu et al 1994 4 h r t h 0 q w 4 π k w h 0 w u where h0 is initial head of aquifer l w u is the theis well function theis 1935 u r 2 s y 4 k w h 0 t and sy is the specific yield of the aquifer substitution eq 4 into eq 3 yields the governing equation of free product thickness as 5 2 m r 2 1 r m r n s oo s oun k o m o m t q w 4 π k w h 0 s y k w h 0 n s oun s ow k o m o exp r 2 s y 4 k w h o t t where a qw equal and unequal to zero represent single pump skimming and dual pump extraction respectively 2 2 constant head boundary as the field data from lari et al 2018 indicates the lnapl extraction rate decreases with time and eventually tends to be relatively stable this is because the pressure gradient decreases with the out diffusion of the depression cone of lnapl head in the case of fixed submersible location and power of lnapl pump based on this reality in field mpe this study proposes a relative pump position which is expressed as ms mb ml where mb is the distance between the submersible pump and the lnapl layer bottom in well while ml is the lnapl layer thickness then a constant head boundary at the well screen can be written as 6 lim r r w m m b the initial condition and the boundary condition at a radially finite extent are 7 m r 0 m l and 8 l r t r r r o 0 respectively where ro and rw are the radius of lnapl lens and the pumping well l now for a simplicity of the notation we define b n s oo s oun k o m o f q w 4 π k w h 0 s y k w h 0 n s oun s ow k o m o d s y k w h 0 a continuity equation for the lnapl extraction using sharp interface model considering constant head boundary in a laplace domain can be yielded as 9 d 2 m d r 2 1 r d m dr p b m 2 f k 0 r dp 1 2 b m l the solution of eq 9 can be expressed as 10 m c 1 i 0 r bp 1 2 c 2 k 0 r bp 1 2 2 f d

are zero order modified bessel functions of the first and second kind respectively the well discharge with constant head can be calculated as 11 q 2 π r w m s m l k o b p 1 2 c 1 i 1 r w b p 1 2 c 2 k 1 r w b p 1 2 q w 2 π k w h 0 2 f d b d p 1 2 k 1 r w d p 1 2 where i 1 and k 1 are first order modified bessel functions of the first and second kind respectively the detailed derivation for eq 8 10 can be found in the appendix eq 9 is difficult to be inverted analytically to yield the solution in the real time domain accordingly we employed a numerical inversion method stehfest method stehfest 1970a stehfest 1970b by developing a matalb program for such calculation 2 3 weighted average of lnapl saturation degree along the vertical profile as mentioned above the key parameters soo and ko in eq 2 should be equivalent values that can represent the sharp fin distribution of lnapl saturation along the vertical profile above groundwater table this implies that the value of each parameter in each horizontal slice should be assembled into a more comprehensively vertical average value for the purpose of solving the sharp interface model similar to the concept of a vertical average for generating the continuity equation of lnapl thickness this study conducts a weighted average of lnapl saturation degree along the vertical profile we employed the lnapl saturation degree data observed in the field site as the of lari et al 2018 indicates then the weighted average along the vertical axis is performed to obtain the equivalent values of soo and ko in eq 9 12 s oo 1 l r t h r t h r t l r t s d z in order to calculate the relative permeability the concept of effective saturation proposed by lenhard and parker 1987 was introduced the apparent saturation of total liquid s t and water s w can be expressed as lenhard and parker 1987 lenhard et al 2004 13 s t s w s oo s wr 1 s wr 14 s w s w s wr 1 s wr respectively where s t is the sum of the apparent saturations of lnapl and water in the soil s w is the water phase apparent saturation s t s w and s oo are the actual saturation degrees of liquid water and lnapl phases respectively s wr is the residual saturation of water based on the relationship between the relative permeability and saturation degree proposed by parker et al 1987 which is an adaptation of van genuchten s expression van genuchten and nielsen 1985 the relative permeability of lnapl phase k r o can be calculated as 15 k r o s of 0 5 1 s w s or 1 m m 1 s t 1 m m 2 where m is a parameter of the van genuchten 1980 saturation pressure s p equation m 1 1 n n is the saturation pressure s p curve shape parameter s of and s or are effective free and residual lnapl saturations respectively which are defined as 16 s of s of 1 s wr 17 s or s or 1 s wr where s oo s of s or s or is the actual residual saturation of lnapl s of is actual free mobile lnapl saturation then the weighted average hydraulic conductivity is calculated as 18 k o k s k r o ρ o g μ o where k s is the absolute permeability l2 μ o is the lnapl phase viscosity coefficient mt 1l 1 with the calculated average lnapl saturation degree and hydraulic conductivity the results of lanpl thickness and extraction rate in eqs 10 and 11 with sharp interface model will be refined 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the proposed model to test the proposed analytical model a finite element analysis and simulation software comsol multiphysics was used to establish a two dimensional axisymmetric model with radius 50 m height 10 m and well radius 0 203 m through darcy s law and modified lnapl hydraulic conductivity the upper and lower boundary conditions were non flux and the left and right boundary conditions were controlled by lnapl head fig 2 shows the result of the analytical and numerical solutions the two blue lines are the fitting of field data of lari et al 2018 furthermore we altered the sensitive lnapl hydraulic conductivity k shown in red k 2 81 10 5m s and it is clear that the lnapl recovery rate in both groups has a phenomenon that the numerical solution is slightly higher than the analytical solution the numerical solution is the model s approximate answer but it is utilized to assess the correctness of the new analytical model s derivation the data from lari et al 2018 field experiment and numerical model will be used to test the performance of the improved shape interface model the mpe field data that was obtained from the work conducted in western australia as reported by lari et al 2018 was employed to verify the performance of the improved sharp interface model proposed in this study the mpe process of lari et al 2018 included six successive stages of lnapl remediation such as skimming vacuum and skimming slurping etc in their study the first stage of mpe the groundwater table was kept stable without any drawdown during skimming the lnapl was extracted with a submersible pump in a fixed position additionally the vertical saturation profile was initially shark fin shaped therefore the setup of the field test was well suited to verify the improvements of the model in two aspects constant head boundary and vertical equivalent saturation of lnapl the parameters used to verify the improved sharp interface model are shown in table 1 all the parameters related to the properties of media and lnapl are the same as those reported in the field mpe of lari et al 2018 since lari et al 2018 addressed that the skimming point was located near the lnapl water interface inside the well this study sets the value of ms to be approximately zero which is 0 01 as table 1 indicates it is nothworthy that when adjusting the value of ms to be 0 001 0 005 0 02 which also approache zero but have multiple differences compared with ms 0 01 the thickness of lnapl in the aquifer has very limited change that is less than 0 1 with the vertical distribution of lnapl saturation degree reported by lari et al 2018 the weighted average lnapl saturation degree and hydraulic conductivity in the vertical profile are calculated to be 0 23 and 3 03 respectively using eqs 12 18 in section 2 3 fig 3 shows the application performances of the improved sharp interface model in field lnapl extraction the red dots dotted black dotted line and the blue solid line represent the lnapl extraction rates qo measured in field site simulated by the numerical model in lari et al 2018 and the improved sharp interface model in this study respectively as fig 3 shows the observed lnapl extraction rate decreased sharply from 5 to 6 ml s to 0 1 ml s on the second day which is due to the rapidly decreasing lnapl thickness and limited residual lnapl mass this undoubtedly indicates the necessity of revising the inner boundary in the traditional constant rate sharp interface model for lnapl extraction in addition fig 3 also indicates that the improved sharp interface model performs better than the previous numerical model especially when predicting the decreasing lnapl extraction rate in the middle and late stages which indicates that the sharp interface model performs better than numerical model due to lower number of variable values and numerical errors furthermore fig 3 shows that the enhancement with regard to a constant head boundary as well as vertical nonuniform lnapl distribution clearly promotes the applicability of the sharp interface model it should also be noted that the numerical model employed by lari et al 2018 overestimated the lnapl extraction rate in the late stage of lnapl skimming which should be directly from the overestimation of the relative permeability of lnapl in fact the misestimation in the study is due to the use of the k s p constitutive relationship which neglects the existence of residual lnapl saturation due to mall or dead end pore channels and pore wedges lenhard et al 2004 considering that residual degree of lnapl is common during field mpe and strongly affects the actual transport of lnapl this study employed the k s p constitutive relationship considering residual lnapl saturation lenhard et al 2004 in the sharp interface model this approach promotes the prediction accuracy of lnapl extraction by decreasing 20 mean square error as fig 3 indicates 3 2 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted in this study to estimate the effects of technical parameters and the properties of aquifer and contaminants on the lnapl extraction rate as proposed by huang and yeh 2007 the normalized sensitivity of parameters can be defined as 19 x i j p j r i p j where x i j is the normalized sensitivity of the j th parameter p j at the i th time r i is the dependent variable at the i th time step huang and yeh 2007 proposed a finite difference formula to approximate the partial derivation as 20 r i p j r i p j δ p j r i p j δ p j where δ p j is a small increment which is chosen as 10 2 p j the following parameters are given as ks 1 10 9 m2 ρ o μ o 6 25 10 5 s m ms 0 3 sy 0 2 qw 100 m3 d the sensitivity analysis of the parameters was performed and the result is shown in fig 4 which indicates that the properties of the fluid ρ o μ o and medium ks are most sensitive to lnapl extraction rate as eq 18 shows the hydraulic conductivity of the lnapl lens is directly affected by ρ o μ o and ks while an inaccurate characterization of the relative permeability of lnapl phase k r o will amplify the misestimation of the hydraulic conductivity of lnapl lens based on this understanding fig 3 indicates that the improved sharp interface model has more accurate characterization of the relative permeability of lnapl phase than the numerical model in lari et al 2018 since both of them employ the same values of parameters as table 1 indicates besides the vertically weighted average in the improved model also proves to characterize the relative permeability of the lnapl phase more accurately than the traditional sharp interface model this also illustrates the necessity and accuracy of the improved sharp interface model from both theoretical and modeling aspects secondly the sensitivities of the technical parameters water extraction rate qw and relative pump position ms are not as high as those of ks and ρ o μ o which indicates that water extraction and the adjustment of pump position can only act as an auxiliary tool for lnapl extraction and will probably not perform well if the properties of lnapl and soil are not conductive for lnapl transport therefore we can only maximize the lnapl extraction rate by adjusting the technical parameters as much as possible besides the normalized sensitivity of sy is almost zero meaning sy will not greatly impact the estimation accuracy of lnapl extraction therefore the value of sy taken from corapcioglu et al 1994 is also reasonable for this study though the value of sy does not necessarily represent the actual situation of the site lari et al 2018 3 3 optimization of technical parameters 3 3 1 optimization of submersible pump position the submersible pump position is an important technical parameter which is especially critical for skimming with a single pump this is because a deeper submergence of the lnapl pump leads to a thinner cross section area of lnapl layer at the well screen and a greater amount of extracted water meanwhile a shallower submerge will lead to a smaller hydraulic gradient of lnapl near the well and a greater amount of gas therefore it is necessary to analyze the effects of different pump positions on the lnapl extraction rate with the parameters given in table 1 the effects of pump location on the lnapl extraction rate are shown in fig 5 the relative pump position ms is given as 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 respectively the results indicate that a deeper or a shallower pump position decreases lnapl extraction rate to determine the optimized location of the submersible lnapl pump for best performance of the lnapl extraction fig 6 represents the simulated lnapl extraction volumes versus pump locations in the case of a single pump skimming with different porosity n and hydraulic conductivity ko in fig 6 a and 6 b respectively it can be found that the lnapl extraction volume vo is greater with increasing porosity or hydraulic conductivity besides the curve of the lnapl extraction volume shows a symmetric phenomenon at the position of ms 0 5 while the lnapl extraction volumes are same in the cases of ms 0 2 and 0 8 as well as ms 0 4 and 0 6 even when the default values of n 0 35 and ko 3 03 are expanded or shrunk by 20 and 40 within reason this phenomenon still exists in addition consistent with the results of the sensitivity analysis the change in the volume of lnapl extraction caused by the changing hydraulic conductivity ko is much greater than by the changing the porosity n in general the middle position in the lnapl layer inside the wellbore is established as the optimal location for best lnapl extraction rate in the case of single pump skimming and this optimized location is not affected by the property of the media in the case of dual pump extraction a pumping induced groundwater cone of depression will increase the area of cross section of lnapl at the well faces which may strongly affect the optimal position of the submersible pump fig 7 shows the lnapl extraction volume versus lnapl pump locations represented by ms with different water extraction rates qw in the case of dual pump the value of ms with the maximum vo indicates the optimized location of submersible lnapl pump it can be clearly observed that an increasing water extraction rate promotes lnapl extraction meanwhile the optimized submersible lnapl pump approaches the lnapl air interface as qw increases and will no longer change after the qw exceeds 200 m3 d since the vo ms curve is monotonically increasing after then this also indicates an interesting finding that slurping is unexpectedly the best operation of skimming with a considerable groundwater table drawdown and both of the two extraction modes have been investigated in lari et al 2018 fig 8 shows the optimized pump position ms with respect to each given water extraction rate qw an empirical relationship can be obtained by fitting the ms and qw using the weighted least squares method 21 m s 0 0025 q w 0 50 m s 1 in general the optimal lnapl pump location gets closer to the lnapl gas interface with an increasing water extraction rate in the case of the dual pump the pressure gradient of lnapl at the well face is no longer a limiting factor to the lnapl extraction rate anymore due to the cone of depression in both groundwater and lnapl layers especially when the water extraction rate is relatively high instead the cross section area of lnapl becomes the limiting factor under this circumstance therefore properly lifting the submersible lnapl pump will increase distinctly the cross section area of lnapl which is also indicated by the above empirical formula after all unlike the single pump case in which the optimized pump location should always be placed in the middle depth of the lnapl layer the optimized lnapl pump location in the dual pump case should be closer to the upper lnapl face with an increasing water extraction rate it should be noted that this study proposes an empirical linear relationship between the submersible pump location and the water extraction rate with given parameters which has strong potential to provide quantitative inference on how to optimize the location of the lnapl pump during field based mpe with both single and dual pump systems 3 3 2 optimization of water extraction rate extensive studies have emphasized the necessity of pumping water during the process of lnapl extraction however few have quantitatively investigated the effects of water extraction rate on the performance of lnapl extraction besides due to the dissolution of lnapl the water extracted is often contaminated and a greater water extraction rate will lead to a higher cost of wastewater treatment therefore there should theoretically be an optimized pumping rate that accounts for both the facilitation for lnapl extraction and wastewater treatment cost which can also be computed by the improved sharp interface model in this study as fig 7 indicates though a higher rate of water extraction will promote lnapl extraction a greater amount of water extraction means a higher cost of wastewater treatment this study takes the benzene contaminants as an example and assumes that all the extracted water needs to be treated at a certain price then the costs for the treatment of both wastewater and benzene during mpe can be calculated as 22 m 0 t q w p w q o p o ρ o d t where m is remediation costs po is the cost to treat lnapl as hazardous waste po 15 rmb kg lnapl lnapl pw is the cost to treat water as industrial water pw 20 rmb m3 wastewater to determine the optimized water extraction rate in the dual pump case we compared the growth rates of both lnapl extraction rate and economic cost by increasing the water extraction rate as fig 8 indicates both remediation cost and lnapl extraction rate increase which means the economic cost is the price that has to be paid for the improvements of remediation performance note that the increasing rate of cost decreases faster than that of extraction rate when pumping rate of water is small therefore it is reasonably assumed that when the growth rate of economic cost begins to approaches that of lnapl extraction rate with an increasing water extraction rate the optimized water extraction rate has been reached this optimized rate which is about 800 m3 d as fig 9 indicates can prevent more contaminated water from being extracted out meanwhile an increasing water pumping rate can accelerate the balance between pumping efficiency and economic consumption until it becomes lower than the optimized value 4 limitations and future prospects though this improved sharp interface model has high computational efficiency and accuracy as well as potential for technology optimization it should be noted that the model still has some limitations on one hand the assumptions of this model are not that rigorous in some scenarios since the sharp interface model is generally suitable for coarse medium near dry conditions abriola and pinder 1985 on the other hand the optimized water pumping rate is not strictly universal for all lnapl extraction cases in practice some project director may have different criterions such as an upper limit of remediation budget or a lower limit of extraction rate of lnapl that has to be guaranteed and these criterions can also be applied into our improved model this study just wants to represent a relatively sophisticated comparison relationship between cost and performance and take it as an example to reveal how our model can be applied into the determination of optimal pumping rate of water in future research it is needed to account for more interphase factors such as the mass transfer processes between air lnapl and lnapl water in the simulation besides more laboratory experiments should be conducted to testify the simulation accuracy moreover capillary end effect and well loss which means the water phase accumulates near well face and energy loss inside well should be paid more attention since they may affect the lnapl extraction efficiency 5 summary and conclusions in this study an analytical model was developed to characterize the lnapl extraction in mpe with both single pump skimming and dual pump extraction the model employed the mass conservation equation solved by sharpinterface method to depict the transport of lnapl constant head boundary conditions and shark fin distribution of lnapl saturation with depth are taken into consideration in the developed model when compared to previous mpe models results from validation tests indicate that the new model performs better in fitting the field mpe lnapl extraction rate from the work by lari et al 2018 in addition we evaluated the influences of technical parameters and aquifer properties on the lnapl extraction rate the optimal location of the lnapl pump as well as the water extraction rate were determined using the improved sharp interface model overall the following conclusions were drawn 1 considering the constant head boundary conditions and the shark fin distribution of lnapl saturation with depth the improved sharp interface model represents a 20 improvement over the interphase transfer model in the prediction of the lnapl extraction rate in field mpe 2 the lnapl extraction rate is most sensitive to the properties of the fluid such as ρ o μ o and soil media such as ks however it is less sensitive to the water extraction and pump position and least sensitive to the specific yield sy 3 in the case of a single pump the optimized location of the submersible lnapl pump is the middle of the lnapl layer while for a dual pump the optimized location of the submersible lnapl pump should be lifted until to the lnapl gas interface as the water extraction rate increases 4 combining both the lnapl extraction efficiency and the economic cost into consideration there exists an optimized water extraction rate of approximately 800 m3 d in this study credit authorship contribution statement yan cui conceptualization methodology writing original draft qi zhu supervision writing review editing zhang wen

1774,greenhouse gas ghg emissions from riparian zones affect the global ghg balance contribute to global warming and climate change and generate adverse effects on ecological health as well as environmental economic and social sustainable development however the influence of water level fluctuations on depth dependent soil properties nitrogen transformation and ghg emissions in riparian zone ecosystems during wetting drying cycles remains unclear in this study we analyzed seasonal nitrogen dynamics under seasonal water level fluctuations at seven different depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 120 and 120 140 cm along a typical transect in the jianghan plain central china for 2018 2019 changes in depth dependent soil physical and chemical properties soil textural characteristics and mineralogy potential nitrification rate pnr and potential denitrification rate pdr as well as soil ghg emission rates were determined across a range of meteorological conditions and surface water and groundwater level fluctuations groundwater levels varied significantly between seasons with rising water levels during the wet seasons and falling water levels during the dry seasons the physicochemical properties and chemical composition in the three studied riparian soil textures revealed higher spatiotemporal variability during the wet seasons as compared to the dry seasons our results showed that groundwater level depth was a crucial influencing factor controlling the microbial nitrogen transformation in the soil profiles the pnr values were characterized by substantial seasonal variation with the same or higher metabolic activity in the dry season than in the wet season owing to water level fluctuations while they declined with depth compared to the wet season the pdr values in the studied riparian zone were typically lower in the dry season due to extremely low soil water content constrained by fluctuating water levels besides the pdr values in the silt loam layers were higher than that in the sandy loam layer for most of the monitoring period the depth dependent ghg flux rates highlighted that the riparian zone ecosystem was a key source of co2 and n2o and a sink for ch4 in summary our findings suggest that fluctuating water table management in riparian ecosystems must be considered to more effectively control seasonal fluctuations of nitrogen dynamics and mitigate ghg emissions thus a suitable riparian groundwater quality control and management scheme is urgently necessary to bring awareness of seasonal water level fluctuations of riparian zones to catchment managers and policy makers keywords riparian zone soil profile nitrogen transformation greenhouse gas emissions seasonal water level fluctuations wetting drying cycles data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the past decades riparian corridors bordering intensively managed agricultural fields have received large amounts of reactive nitrogen including ammonium nh 4 nitrite no 2 and nitrate no 3 hefting et al 2003 jurado et al 2017 krause et al 2008 su et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 and increased reactive nitrogen loads in riparian sediments have been found to cause a series of ecological and environmental problems szymczycha et al 2017 therefore understanding and predicting the processes controlling the fate and transport of nitrogen compounds is crucial with regards to the management of groundwater quality the riparian zone represents an important terrestrial carbon and nitrogen reservoir in which precipitation surface water and groundwater actively interact krause et al 2022 krause et al 2011 krause et al 2017 riparian corridors act as a source sink for main greenhouse gases ghgs i e carbon dioxide co2 nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 krause et al 2022 oertel et al 2016 although further research is required to reduce uncertainty as to their role within global ghg budgets shi et al 2021 n2o is considered one of the most harmful ghgs as its 100 year global warming potential contributing to climate change is approximately 265 times higher than that of co2 ipcc 2014 as elevated n2o emissions from riparian zone exacerbate global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion pärn et al 2018 studying their seasonal emission dynamics and related nitrogen transformation processes in the riparian zone is imperative microbial nitrification and denitrification in the riparian zone are the leading nitrogen transformation processes controlling the nitrogen balance cannavo et al 2004 ma et al 2020 zhang and ji 2018 and these processes are susceptible to changes in the riparian subsurface redox conditions and soil environment landon et al 2011 liang et al 2020 yabusaki et al 2017 nitrification dominates n2o production under aerobic soil conditions whereas denitrification is the prevailing process contributing to n2o emission under anaerobic conditions stevens et al 1997 well et al 2003 wolf and russow 2000 some key soil environmental factors such as water filled pore space wfps ph water content oxygen availability temperature and the availability of carbon and nitrogen have been shown to affect the soil microbial community structure evolution and functionality fierer et al 2012 supramaniam et al 2016 yang et al 2017 as such they impact the nitrogen leaching and biogeochemical transformation processes while the riparian ghg production and consumption patterns related to microbial activities strongly correlate with depth chen et al 2022 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 thus understanding the vertical distribution of ghg production consumption patterns associated with carbon and nitrogen transformation in the riparian soil profile is a vital step for improving estimates of the riparian zone carbon and nitrogen dynamics in response to climate change in addition to precipitation and irrigation water management induced and seasonal fluctuations in surface water and groundwater levels have been found to affect water saturation and redox conditions in the riparian zone which in turn influence vertical nitrogen leaching and transformation hefting et al 2004 krause et al 2009 mcguire and reid 2019 meng et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 this becomes ever more relevant as reactive nitrogen in the riparian zone has been found to increasingly percolate from the surface soil or vadose zone into local groundwater bodies owing to abundant precipitation river impoundment and frequent irrigation deng et al 2014 liang et al 2020 zang et al 2022 additionally nitrogen removal from a soil profile might be stimulated by changing soil physicochemical properties and environmental condition during drying and wetting cycles pinto et al 2021 however under the influence of seasonal water level fluctuations vertical heterogeneity in nitrogen transformation processes and their key regulating factors in the riparian soil profile have not been exhaustively studied and depth dependent ghg production consumption and emission in the riparian soil profile under fluctuating water levels caused by the slow alternation of the wet and dry seasons remain poorly understood to specifically study the spatiotemporal dynamics of depth dependent nitrogen transformation and ghg emissions influenced by seasonal water level fluctuations we selected a typical riparian zone system in the wider jianghan plain the jianghan plain is a major rice growing area and aquaculture zone in central china and contributes 30 of the annual rice production in hubei province yu et al 2022 over the last decades nitrogen fertilizer has been extensively utilized and elevated concentrations of ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n nitrite nitrogen no 2 n and nitrate nitrogen no 3 n have been discovered in local groundwater of the jianghan plain shen et al 2019 in addition the availability of abundant nutrients and pollutants in groundwater duan et al 2015 shen et al 2019 shallow groundwater level duan et al 2015 gan et al 2014 periodic and frequent groundwater level fluctuations liang et al 2020 and strong groundwater river interaction are the unique characteristics regulating the transport and fate of riparian reactive nitrogen in the subsurface environment in the jianghan plain however the response mechanisms of hydrogeological controls on soil property nitrogen transformation and ghg emissions in the soil profile to fluctuating water levels leading to wetting drying cycles remained unclear hence determining the role of water level fluctuations as well as their effects on nitrogen transformation and ghg emissions are very important for predicting the regional ghg budgets in the typical riparian zone of the jianghan plain we hypothesize that riparian wetting drying cycles caused by water level fluctuations influence the vertical distribution of soil properties and microbial communities which in turn affect microbial nitrogen transformation processes and ghg production consumption and emission in the riparian profile of the jianghan plain the main objectives of our study were to i analyze the spatiotemporal variability of depth dependent multiple edaphic variables and microbial nitrogen transformation processes in the soil profile of the riparian zone during the wet and dry seasons ii study the vertical distribution of soil air ghg emissions from the soil profile and iii estimate the influence of seasonal water level fluctuations on the soil ghg emissions related microbial nitrogen transformation process including nitrification and denitrification using principal component analysis pca and pearson correlation analysis the results of this study can promote the understanding of the response of riparian nitrogen biogeochemical processes to seasonal variations in groundwater level and improve the comprehensions of riparian groundwater quality control and management in the jianghan plain 2 materials and methods

conditions and water level fluctuations the daily precipitation mean daily temperature and groundwater level fluctuations in the investigated riparian zone during the sampling periods are shown in fig 2 with additional information in table s1 the annual precipitation and mean temperature in 2018 and 2019 were 1057 5 and 1135 9 mm 17 6 and 18 1 respectively the maximum and minimum monthly precipitation in 2018 occurred in may 196 mm and october 15 2 mm respectively and the highest and lowest monthly mean temperatures in 2018 occurred in july 30 1 and january 2 5 respectively the maximum and minimum monthly precipitation in 2019 were recorded in june 283 1 mm and september 0 4 mm respectively and the highest and lowest monthly mean temperatures in 2019 were recorded in august 31 1 and january 4 0 respectively we selected the köppen climate classification kottek et al 2006 to define the wet and dry seasons in the riparian zone to seek the relationships between the changes in dryness and wetness and groundwater level variations the wet season monthly precipitation 60 mm of the riparian zone in 2018 and 2019 started in march and february respectively and continued until the end of august while the dry season mainly occurred from september 2018 to october 2018 january 2019 and from september 2019 to december 2019 groundwater level fluctuations are caused by changes in precipitation between seasons and years water level records from wells sy01 sy02 sy03 and sy04 showed that the amplitudes of the seasonal groundwater level fluctuations were impacted by variations in climate and meteorological drivers the magnitudes of the water level fluctuations were greater near the river than farther away from river indicating that groundwater surface water interactions played an important role in the near stream zone in addition owing to the impact of seasonal climatic drivers the groundwater level drops faster in the dry season than it rises in the wet season 3 2 soil texture and mineralogy the particle size distribution indicated that the soil texture in the riparian zone mainly comprised silt loam and sandy loam according to the usda soil classification bockheim and hartemink 2013 twarakavi et al 2010 soil composition was spatially highly heterogeneous with depth fig 3 and table s2 at the greatest depths of sy03 120 140 cm silt texture was observed while the texture of sy01 40 60 60 80 and 120 140 cm sy02 0 20 cm sy03 40 60 cm and sy04 0 20 and 80 100 cm were characterized by sandy loam with silty loam in the other soil horizons of the riparian zone the soil bd values ranged from 1 309 to 1 560 g cm 3 and the average bd was 1 413 0 065 g cm 3 n 28 table s2 the average bd of sandy loam 1 476 0 077 g cm 3 was larger than those of silt loam 1 393 0 045 g cm 3 and bd values decreased with the increasing clay and silt content plasticity of loamy soils was usually low when compared to clay fig 4 shows the xrd patterns of three depth dependent soil textures obtained from the riparian zone profiles sy01 sy02 sy03 and sy04 the mineralogical composition mainly includes quartz albite amphibole illite montmorillonite and chlorite serpentine major elemental contents in included si al fe k mg na and ca determined using xrf table s3 and mean major elemental contents were as follows weight sio2 65 00 al2o3 14 62 fe2o3 5 24 k2o 2 46 mgo 1 80 na2o 1 50 cao 1 47 and others 7 65 the gwc and wfps results of the soil horizons in the riparian zone during the observation period are presented in table s4 3 3 soil physicochemical properties and chemical composition the soil physicochemical properties ph ec st and sm at different depths are shown in fig 5 mean soil ph values were lower in the wet season august 2018 than in the dry season september 2019 fig s1a and soil ph fluctuated more strongly nearer to the river than farther away from it fig 5a1 a4 soil ec values initially decreased and then increased from august 2018 to september 2019 fig s1b and fig 5b1 b4 influenced by the air temperature the st values exhibited a decreasing trend with depth in summer however the st values exhibited an increasing trend with depth in winter fig 5c1 c4 spatial heterogeneity of riparian sm distribution in both wet and dry seasons are shown in fig 5 d1 d4 the spatial variability of the sm in the wet season was less significant than that in the dry season which was consistent with previous studies li et al 2016 in addition the soil texture is an important control on the vertical distribution of sm contents in the riparian sites depth and soil texture dependent profiles of soil carbon and nitrogen species including tc tn toc nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n and c n ratio toc tn are shown in fig 6 tc and toc contents showed decreasing trends with increasing depths at all four sites and toc variations revealed relatively inconsistent vertical distribution in contrast to tc variations further toc was characterized by substantial seasonal variability with higher average contents in the wet season august 2018 february 2019 and may 2019 than dry season september 2019 fig s2c and a similar trend in toc content was observed in profile sy01 closest to the river fig 6c1 there was significant variability in tn at each depth across the four sites and the tn was lowest in both wet and dry seasons at the 60 80 cm deep silt loam layer of sy02 fig 6b2 as for the overall spatiotemporal distribution the nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n contents were higher in the wet season than in the dry season in addition the no 3 n content decreased from the topsoil with increasing depth whereas the nh 4 n content followed an opposite trend as shown in fig 6f1 the no 3 n attenuation was faster at sy01 near the river channel and increased with depth affected by the rising groundwater level the no 2 n content increased significantly with depth in may 2019 fig 6e1 e4 compared with soil profiles farther away from river the c n ratio closest to the river had a more apparent declining trend with increasing depth all of these findings indicated depth dependent nitrogen transport and transformation in the riparian zone influenced by water level fluctuations 3 4 depth dependent pnr values the soil pnr values for the three soil textures silt silt loam and sandy loam varied substantially in time and space fig 7 the soil pnr values at sy01 ranged from 4 957 to 19 327 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in august 2018 wet season from 10 990 to 65 627 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in november 2018 a period of dry to wet transition from 5 307 to 24 951 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in february 2019 wet season from 7 988 to 47 968 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in may 2019 wet season and from 3 564 to 30 675 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in september 2019 dry season respectively the soil pnr values at sy02 in august 2018 november 2018 february 2019 may 2019 and september 2019 varied between 1 993 37 677 5 314 28 928 2 841 21 760 4 851 19 143 and 4 848 18 832 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively the soil pnr values at sy03 and sy04 were 5 490 9 255 and 5 087 12 904 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in august 2018 respectively and 3 878 38 238 and 4 500 37 415 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in november 2018 respectively and 7 779 40 493 and 5 824 35 300 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in february 2019 respectively and 7 568 33 936 and 4 219 21 740 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in may 2019 respectively and 4 531 9 588 and 4 454 38 651 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in september 2019 respectively in addition differences in soil pnr values at sy04 among the vertical depths in may 2019 were significant and showed a somewhat declining trend 3 5 depth dependent pdr values the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of soil pdr for the three soil textures silt silt loam and sandy loam across the four sites are shown in fig 8 the soil pdr values in august 2018 wet season from sy01 near river to sy04 away from the river were 0 154 0 458 0 052 1 781 0 031 0 794 and 0 161 1 560 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively in november 2018 dry to wet transition pdr values from sy01 to sy04 were 0 297 1 164 0 151 0 369 0 313 1 693 and 0 116 1 739 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively while in in february 2019 wet season from sy01 to sy04 pdr values varied between 0 039 1 045 0 018 4 750 0 057 3 322 and 0 509 7 369 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively in may 2019 wet season pdr values from sy01 to sy04 varied between 0 088 1 386 0 240 0 810 0 082 1 070 and 0 012 0 809 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively the soil pdr values for september 2019 dry season from sy01 to sy04 ranged from 0 032 0 816 0 036 0 846 0 327 1 155 and 0 063 2 248 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively in general mean soil pdr values showed the following trend during most of the monitoring periods silt loam sandy loam which might indicate that soil denitrification activity in the silt loam texture layer was highest 3 6 depth dependent ghg fluxes in november 2018 a period of dry to wet transition soil air co2 emissions significantly decreased with increasing depth and the co2 emissions for all depth ranges exhibited statistically significant differences p 0 05 fig 9 a emissions in november were highest in the shallowest layer with slight fluctuations of 0 00 0 43 mg c kg 1 soil day 1 at depths 20 cm fig 9a similarly a significant interaction was observed between soil depth and n2o emissions with considerably higher emissions for depths of 0 20 cm at sy01 than for other depths in november p 0 05 fig 9b n2o emissions decreased significantly from the surface to a depth of 60 cm with a small increase at 60 80 cm followed by a continued decline fig 9b emissions were approximately 49 times higher at the soil surface than at depths of 120 140 cm fig 9b throughout the observation period soil air ch4 flux rates increased with profile depth and the ch4 concentrations for depths of 0 20 60 80 and 100 120 cm varied significantly p 0 05 fig 9c in addition during november 2018 the net flux rates of soil air ch4 in the topsoil layers i e 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm were less than zero fig 9c indicating that ch4 consumption occurred at depths ranging from 0 to 60 cm the ch4 vertical concentration at depths 60 cm were negligible throughout the observation period 3 7 effects of soil nutrients soil physicochemical properties and the soil environment on microbial nitrogen transformation processes the microbial nitrogen transformation processes including the soil nitrification denitrification and n2o production reduction and emission were affected by meteorological factors and soil variables including nutrient content soil physicochemical properties and soil redox environment fig 10 shows results of the pca and pearson correlations for the relationships between various soil properties and soil n2o emission in the riparian zone in november 2018 a period of dry to wet transition the pca revealed that strong n2o emission significantly occurred in regions near the river channel such as sy01 and sy02 as compared to further away sy03 and sy04 presumably related to strong water level fluctuations and increased groundwater surface water interaction furthermore soil n2o emission was positively correlated with bd wfps ph no 3 n pnr and pdr while it was negatively correlated with the other soil parameters e g st ec sm in addition the pca and pearson correlation between soil physicochemical properties and microbial nitrogen transformation processes pnr and pdr in november 2018 are shown in fig 10 and for august 2018 february 2019 may 2019 and september 2019 in fig s3 in the period of dry to wet transition november 2018 compared with other soil factors most significant positive correlations r2 0 67 p 0 001 occurred between soil pdr and no 3 n which indicates that riparian denitrification played a key role in nitrogen transformation and n2o emission during this time in the wet season february 2019 both pnr and pdr positively correlated with the availability of carbon and nitrogen sources as tn or toc while the pnr had more significant negative correlations with ph ec sm as compared to pdr in the dry season september 2019 the pnr had significant positive correlations with ph toc no 2 n no 3 n and c n ratio and had significant negative correlations with sm but the pdr had no significant relationship with any soil parameters in conclusion a conceptual structural equation model sem could be set up identifying the expected indirect pathways for vertical multiple meteorological and edaphic variables to affect riparian potential biogeochemical processes and ghg emission rates in the studied riparian zone fig s4 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal variability in riparian water level fluctuations water level fluctuations and soil structure in the riparian zone control the hydrological connectivity between upland riparian and wetland systems and are the most influential factors regulating riparian soil microbial structure and function burt et al 2002 groundwater level fluctuations in the studied riparian zone expressed significant seasonal variations with rising trends for november 2018 july 2019 and descending trends before november and after july fig 2 as a result of dynamics in precipitation evaporation and irrigation however compared with groundwater level data of sy01 sy02 sy03 and sy04 data from the official nearby hydrological station about than 30 km of the han river and the more distant hydrological station of the dongjing river revealed a discrepancy between the dynamic changes in river stage and groundwater level during some part of the observation period fig 2 although the rivers are all part of the jianghan plain and connected via the same large scale unconfined aquifer very localized factors such as spatial variability in precipitation intensity most likely caused the respective stream stages to react faster and would have led to a delayed groundwater level response under the studied riparian zone direct long term data collection on stream stage in the tongshun river which is closest to the studied riparian zone was not permitted recent studies have shown that the periodically alternating wet and dry periods attributable to water level fluctuations can have a critical influence on soil properties such as soil porosity and moisture content de oliveira et al 2021 or soil aggregate disintegration nsabimana et al 2023 they can also impact long term seasonal trends of the main sediment associated contaminant fluxes and nutrient budgets including phosphorus and nitrogen budgets coppens et al 2016 exchanges of nitrogen and phosphorus across the sediment water interface liu et al 2019 hyporheic exchanges and organic carbon mineralization in the riparian zone shi et al 2020 and biogeochemical processes including carbon and nitrogen retention and microbial community structure reverey et al 2018 4 2 factors influencing the vertical distribution of microbial nitrogen transformation in the riparian zone the riparian zone is attracting increasing attention and various studies have evaluated the effects of vertical heterogeneity on biogeochemical processes especially in the riparian vadose zone ma et al 2017 wang et al 2019 yabusaki et al 2017 in the present study we comprehensively examined the influence of vertical heterogeneity in soil physicochemical properties soil nutrient content and soil texture on nitrogen transformation processes in the riparian zone of the jianghan plain analysis of soil profile mineralogy fig 4 showed that soil minerals in the riparian zone particularly in the clay size 4 μm particle fraction were dominated by 2 1 type clay mineral including montmorillonite and illite due to their net negative charge and higher cation exchange capacity 2 1 type clay mineral can influence physical soil fractions chemical structures and the decomposition of organic amendments microbial residues and alter the microbial community composition xu et al 2022 which in turn have the potential to affect riparian biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification in addition the vertical distribution of soil elemental contents table s3 demonstrates abruptly changing redox and geochemical conditions that were influenced by water level fluctuations in the riparian zone and affected redox controlled nitrogen transformation processes of fe oxides and fe bearing clay minerals vogelsang et al 2016 for example organic matter acting as the main electron donor among other constituents like si and al can promote structural changes in hydrous fe oxides and retard fe mineral transformation into more crystalline phases jones et al 2009 vogelsang et al 2016 our results revealed that vertical gradients of soil parameters such as ph ec sm and the availability of carbon and nitrogen sources all played important roles in soil nitrification in the riparian zone in wet season and dry season we found that in the dry season nitrification was positively correlated with ph meaning that higher ph levels were associated with higher nitrification the conclusion is consistent with previous research about very low soil ph being found to reduce the growth of nitrifying bacteria and increase fungal growth robertson 1989 soil ec was influenced by the concentration of dissolved ions in the soil solution and we found that in the wet season nitrification was negatively correlated with ec i e higher ec levels were associated with lower nitrification we suggest that this is caused by high levels of dissolved ions being toxic to the nitrifying bacteria adviento borbe et al 2006 in addition it is worth mentioning that the spatial and temporal sm distribution at our site plays an important role in controlling surface ecological processes and management for ecological restoration we found that the sm was the most common significant negative factor to explain soil nitrification rates in soils in general activity of the nitrifying bacteria might be limited by sm levels because sm can affect soil aeration nutrient diffusion and microbial activity which can in turn impact nitrification rates abera et al 2012 ma et al 2020 a fluctuating groundwater level would likely increase the vertical heterogeneity of sm in the riparian zone harms and grimm 2008 and impact soil nitrification processes sm changes induced by water level fluctuations in the riparian zone can affect the availability of oxygen to nitrifying bacteria chen et al 2022 rising riparian water levels are inhibiting the aeration of moist soils which can in turn reduce the availability of oxygen driving the metabolism of nitrifying bacteria in contrast declining riparian water levels and resulting dryer soils can also inhibit decomposition due to lower solute diffusion and water stress and limit nitrifying bacteria activity rubol et al 2013 hence soil nitrification in the riparian zone can be limited by too high or too low sm content this supports the findings of kiese et al 2008 who found that the association between sm and nitrification rate was best described by the o neill function stating that moderate soil moisture levels can provide conditions that are most favorable to potential nitrification processes overall water level fluctuations in the riparian zone can have complex and multi faceted effects on soil nitrification and the interplay of a range of factors such as the duration and frequency of groundwater level fluctuations soil texture and other environmental factors need to be considered to gain a better understanding of the riparian system understanding these relationships can be important for managing soil processes and promoting healthy ecosystems in addition to investigating soil nitrification we have also investigated the thermal response of n2o emissions due to the denitrification of denitrifying bacteria tan et al 2018 in the present study we only observed significant positive linear correlations of the pdr with the availability of carbon and nitrogen sources such as tc tn toc etc in the wet season and there were no significant relations between the pdr and other soil parameters in order for denitrification to occur the denitrifying bacteria require a source of carbon and nitrogen which they can use as energy and building blocks for their metabolic processes robertson 1989 therefore if the availability of carbon and nitrogen sources is limited so will be limit the activity of the denitrifying bacteria defining denitrification in contrast a high availability of carbon and nitrogen sources will potentially promote denitrification the lack of significant relationships between pdr and soil parameters in our study may suggest that other factors such as temperature ph or the composition of the microbial community may also be important in regulating denitrification rates in this specific riparian zone it is also possible that the sample size or sampling frequency may have influenced the observed results therefore further research is needed to fully understand the factors that regulate denitrification in this specific riparian zone 4 3 drivers of ghg flux rates for various soil depths in the riparian zone elevated ghg emissions from riparian zone may increase the atmospheric concentrations of ghg thus exacerbating global warming liu et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 soils in the riparian zone serve as critical sources and sinks for ghgs such as co2 n2o and ch4 oertel et al 2016 ghg flux rates are primarily determined by proximal drivers that control soil emissions into the direct environment e g local climate regional climate and soil type and distal drivers that influence soil emissions at larger scales e g temperature humidity nutrient availability and ph robertson 1989 in addition we examined changes in ghg flux rates at various soil depths in the riparian zone and found that co2 and n2o emission rates decreased with soil depth with maximum values at depths of 0 20 cm the decreasing concentrations of ch4 mainly occurred at depths of 0 60 cm and the potential soil air ch4 uptake rates decreased with depth in the soil profile we also found that depth dependent ghg fluxes in the riparian zone were 0 00 0 90 mg c kg 1 day 1 for co2 emissions 0 00 0 21 µg n kg 1 day 1 for n2o emissions and 0 00 1 29 µg c kg 1 day 1 for ch4 uptake as the riparian zone is a type of wetland ecosystem its nutrient rich soils may become a significant source of co2 and n2o however should be considered a ch4 sink in addition our findings also emphasize that riparian soil properties and chemical composition play an important role in regulating n2o emissions from the riparian zone of the jianghan plain due to their effects on soil microbial activity and resulting nitrification or denitrification rates for example soil organic matter content nitrogen availability and ph can all influence the abundance and diversity of soil microorganisms involved in nitrification or denitrification and other nitrogen cycling processes furthermore riparian soil physical properties such as soil porosity and soil density affect gas diffusion and water movement which can further impact n2o emissions riparian soils may have higher porosity or lower bulk density than upland soils allowing for greater gas exchange and oxygen availability which can limit n2o production however the increased soil porosity in riparian soils can lead to increased rates of gas diffusion which can facilitate the transport of n2o from the soil to the atmosphere overall the finding that riparian soil properties and chemical composition play an important role in regulating n2o emissions highlights the need to consider both biotic and abiotic factors when studying nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in riparian zone this knowledge can help inform management strategies aimed at reducing n2o emissions from these critical habitats 4 4 water level fluctuations drive rapid changes in nitrogen transformation in the riparian zone as discussed previously in the riparian zone groundwater level fluctuations are driven by variations in precipitation infiltration caused by the alternation of seasons in our study groundwater levels fluctuated regularly with alternating wet dry seasons fig 2 and table s1 through influencing soil temperature moisture and redox conditions groundwater level fluctuations also impact nitrogen transformation processes and control n2o production reduction and emission in the riparian zone considering that denitrification is one of the important nitrogen transformation processes of n2o production in the riparian zone some previous studies have focused on the impact of riparian water level fluctuations on soil denitrification song et al 2010 wang et al 2019 ye et al 2015 ye et al 2017 for example it was found that periodic wetting drying cycles derived from water level fluctuations further enhanced hyporheic exchange which had been shown to increase the carbon source supply for denitrification by accelerating organic carbon mineralization shi et al 2020 similarly geistlinger et al 2010 found a negative correlation between groundwater level and n2o concentration in a shallow riparian aquifer in northern germany mander et al 2014 used the isotopic ratios of n2o to n2 to estimate the importance of denitrification in estonian forest riparian zones as a source of n2o other studies have also found that n2o in the riparian zone tends to accumulate at the saturated unsaturated interface deurer et al 2008 ronen et al 1988 spalding and parrott 1994 however only few studies consider nitrification as the main source of n2o in riparian zones for example vilain et al 2012 found a positive correlation between dissolved n2o and no3 in the shallow groundwater of the riparian zone in the orgeval basin france which indicated that n2o in the shallow groundwater mainly came from riparian nitrification that occurred in the eutrophic unsaturated zone the current study in the jianghan plain with its alternating wet and dry periods indicates that the drying process in the riparian zone provided suitable aerobic conditions for nitrification and the anaerobic microdomains in the oxygenated sediment reduced the no2 and no3 produced by nitrification through denitrification in addition the present study also found that the mean pnr in the dry season september 2019 was as high or significantly higher than that in the wet season august 2018 these findings confirmed previous research sullivan et al 2012 and except for higher pnr values in the dry season parker and schimel 2011 also evidenced that microbial biomass in the dry season was greater than in the wet season a recent study investigated the response of riparian ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob to water level fluctuations and their relative contributions to nitrification through indoor soil column experiment simulations li et al 2021 furthermore the community size of aob aoa is at least as high in the dry season as in the wet season despite the soil water content being extremely low during the dry season sullivan et al 2012 5 conclusions the spatiotemporal variability in soil nitrogen transformation processes and ghg emission fluxes under the effects of water level fluctuations during alternating wet and dry seasons was investigated for selected vertical profiles of the riparian zone of the jianghan plain central china therefore the impact of fluctuating water levels between seasonal nitrogen dynamics and multiple edaphic variables including soil textural and mineralogy physical and chemical properties and chemical compositions was evaluated by pca and pearson correlation analysis the soil physicochemical properties chemical compositions and nitrogen transformation rates including pnr and pdr at different soil depths revealed clear spatiotemporal variability in both wet and dry seasons vertical soil mineralogy and elemental results indicate abruptly changing redox and geochemical conditions influenced by water level fluctuations in the riparian zone that can affect physical soil properties chemical structures as well as the decomposition of soil nutrient content and redox related nitrogen transformation processes of fe oxides and fe bearing clay minerals furthermore the vertical pnr values somewhat declined with increasing depth and the mean pdr values from high to low among the soil textures was silt loam sandy loam during most of the monitoring periods the rates of co2 and n2o emissions from soil into the air significantly decreased with increasing soil depth the fluxes in soil air co2 and n2o production peaked in the top 0 20 cm of the soil whereas soil air ch4 consumption mainly occurred at soil depths of 0 60 cm multiple edaphic variables under the influence of water level fluctuations had substantial influences on the role of the soil as a source of n2o as well as on the various feedback processes involved overall investigating response characteristics of vertical soil nitrogen dynamics to alternating wetting drying cycles under fluctuating water levels and the detailed relationships between nitrogen transformation including ghg emissions and multiple soil variables will help decision makers and scientists to better manage nitrogen losses and ghg budgets in the riparian zone which has great implications for decelerating global warming consequently seasonal water level fluctuations in riparian zones need to be carefully considered when studying riparian groundwater quality and establishing long term groundwater management practices our findings provide an important reference for riparian groundwater management when periodic and frequent fluctuations in surface water and groundwater levels are greatly elevated by external factors such as precipitation irrigation and water management induced human activity however due to lack the characterization of the soil microbial community and its nitrogen transformation functional genes our knowledge regarding the microbial community in the riparian profile at our study site as a result of water level fluctuations is limited additionally laboratory soil column experiments and related nitrogen transport and transformation models for the riparian vadose zone groundwater coupled system will be the

1774,greenhouse gas ghg emissions from riparian zones affect the global ghg balance contribute to global warming and climate change and generate adverse effects on ecological health as well as environmental economic and social sustainable development however the influence of water level fluctuations on depth dependent soil properties nitrogen transformation and ghg emissions in riparian zone ecosystems during wetting drying cycles remains unclear in this study we analyzed seasonal nitrogen dynamics under seasonal water level fluctuations at seven different depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 120 and 120 140 cm along a typical transect in the jianghan plain central china for 2018 2019 changes in depth dependent soil physical and chemical properties soil textural characteristics and mineralogy potential nitrification rate pnr and potential denitrification rate pdr as well as soil ghg emission rates were determined across a range of meteorological conditions and surface water and groundwater level fluctuations groundwater levels varied significantly between seasons with rising water levels during the wet seasons and falling water levels during the dry seasons the physicochemical properties and chemical composition in the three studied riparian soil textures revealed higher spatiotemporal variability during the wet seasons as compared to the dry seasons our results showed that groundwater level depth was a crucial influencing factor controlling the microbial nitrogen transformation in the soil profiles the pnr values were characterized by substantial seasonal variation with the same or higher metabolic activity in the dry season than in the wet season owing to water level fluctuations while they declined with depth compared to the wet season the pdr values in the studied riparian zone were typically lower in the dry season due to extremely low soil water content constrained by fluctuating water levels besides the pdr values in the silt loam layers were higher than that in the sandy loam layer for most of the monitoring period the depth dependent ghg flux rates highlighted that the riparian zone ecosystem was a key source of co2 and n2o and a sink for ch4 in summary our findings suggest that fluctuating water table management in riparian ecosystems must be considered to more effectively control seasonal fluctuations of nitrogen dynamics and mitigate ghg emissions thus a suitable riparian groundwater quality control and management scheme is urgently necessary to bring awareness of seasonal water level fluctuations of riparian zones to catchment managers and policy makers keywords riparian zone soil profile nitrogen transformation greenhouse gas emissions seasonal water level fluctuations wetting drying cycles data

nitrogen including ammonium nh 4 nitrite no 2 and nitrate no 3 hefting et al 2003 jurado et al 2017 krause et al 2008 su et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 and increased reactive nitrogen loads in riparian sediments have been found to cause a series of ecological and environmental problems szymczycha et al 2017 therefore understanding and predicting the processes controlling the fate and transport of nitrogen compounds is crucial with regards to the management of groundwater quality the riparian zone represents an important terrestrial carbon and nitrogen reservoir in which precipitation surface water and groundwater actively interact krause et al 2022 krause et al 2011 krause et al 2017 riparian corridors act as a source sink for main greenhouse gases ghgs i e carbon dioxide co2 nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 krause et al 2022 oertel et al 2016 although further research is required to reduce uncertainty as to their role within global ghg budgets shi et al 2021 n2o is considered one of the most harmful ghgs as its 100 year global warming potential contributing to climate change is approximately 265 times higher than that of co2 ipcc 2014 as elevated n2o emissions from riparian zone exacerbate global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion pärn et al 2018 studying their seasonal emission dynamics and related nitrogen transformation processes in the riparian zone is imperative microbial nitrification and denitrification in the riparian zone are the leading nitrogen transformation processes controlling the nitrogen balance cannavo et al 2004 ma et al 2020 zhang and ji 2018 and these processes are susceptible to changes in the riparian subsurface redox conditions and soil environment landon et al 2011 liang et al 2020 yabusaki et al 2017 nitrification dominates n2o production under aerobic soil conditions whereas denitrification is the prevailing process contributing to n2o emission under anaerobic conditions stevens et al 1997 well et al 2003 wolf and russow 2000 some key soil environmental factors such as water filled pore space wfps ph water content oxygen availability temperature and the availability of carbon and nitrogen have been shown to affect the soil microbial community structure evolution and functionality fierer et al 2012 supramaniam et al 2016 yang et al 2017 as such they impact the nitrogen leaching and biogeochemical transformation processes while the riparian ghg production and consumption patterns related to microbial activities strongly correlate with depth chen et al 2022 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 thus understanding the vertical distribution of ghg production consumption patterns associated with carbon and nitrogen transformation in the riparian soil profile is a vital step for improving estimates of the riparian zone carbon and nitrogen dynamics in response to climate change in addition to precipitation and irrigation water management induced and seasonal fluctuations in surface water and groundwater levels have been found to affect water saturation and redox conditions in the riparian zone which in turn influence vertical nitrogen leaching and transformation hefting et al 2004 krause et al 2009 mcguire and reid 2019 meng et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 this becomes ever more relevant as reactive nitrogen in the riparian zone has been found to increasingly percolate from the surface soil or vadose zone into local groundwater bodies owing to abundant precipitation river impoundment and frequent irrigation deng et al 2014 liang et al 2020 zang et al 2022 additionally nitrogen removal from a soil profile might be stimulated by changing soil physicochemical properties and environmental condition during drying and wetting cycles pinto et al 2021 however under the influence of seasonal water level fluctuations vertical heterogeneity in nitrogen transformation processes and their key regulating factors in the riparian soil profile have not been exhaustively studied and depth dependent ghg production consumption and emission in the riparian soil profile under fluctuating water levels caused by the slow alternation of the wet and dry seasons remain poorly understood to specifically study the spatiotemporal dynamics of depth dependent nitrogen transformation and ghg emissions influenced by seasonal water level fluctuations we selected a typical riparian zone system in the wider jianghan plain the jianghan plain is a major rice growing area and aquaculture zone in central china and contributes 30 of the annual rice production in hubei province yu et al 2022 over the last decades nitrogen fertilizer has been extensively utilized and elevated concentrations of ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n nitrite nitrogen no 2 n and nitrate nitrogen no 3 n have been discovered in local groundwater of the jianghan plain shen et al 2019 in addition the availability of abundant nutrients and pollutants in groundwater duan et al 2015 shen et al 2019 shallow groundwater level duan et al 2015 gan et al 2014 periodic and frequent groundwater level fluctuations liang et al 2020 and strong groundwater river interaction are the unique characteristics regulating the transport and fate of riparian reactive nitrogen in the subsurface environment in the jianghan plain however the response mechanisms of hydrogeological controls on soil property nitrogen transformation and ghg emissions in the soil profile to fluctuating water levels leading to wetting drying cycles remained unclear hence determining the role of water level fluctuations as well as their effects on nitrogen transformation and ghg emissions are very important for predicting the regional ghg budgets in the typical riparian zone of the jianghan plain we hypothesize that riparian wetting drying cycles caused by water level fluctuations influence the vertical distribution of soil properties and microbial communities which in turn affect microbial nitrogen transformation processes and ghg production consumption and emission in the riparian profile of the jianghan plain the main objectives of our study were to i analyze the spatiotemporal variability of depth dependent multiple edaphic variables and microbial nitrogen transformation processes in the soil profile of the riparian zone during the wet and dry seasons ii study the vertical distribution of soil air ghg emissions from the soil profile and iii estimate the influence of seasonal water level fluctuations on the soil ghg emissions related microbial nitrogen transformation process including nitrification and denitrification using principal component analysis pca and pearson correlation analysis the results of this study can promote the understanding of the response of riparian nitrogen biogeochemical processes to seasonal variations in groundwater level and improve the comprehensions of riparian groundwater quality control and management in the jianghan plain 2 materials and methods

conditions and water level fluctuations the daily precipitation mean daily temperature and groundwater level fluctuations in the investigated riparian zone during the sampling periods are shown in fig 2 with additional information in table s1 the annual precipitation and mean temperature in 2018 and 2019 were 1057 5 and 1135 9 mm 17 6 and 18 1 respectively the maximum and minimum monthly precipitation in 2018 occurred in may 196 mm and october 15 2 mm respectively and the highest and lowest monthly mean temperatures in 2018 occurred in july 30 1 and january 2 5 respectively the maximum and minimum monthly precipitation in 2019 were recorded in june 283 1 mm and september 0 4 mm respectively and the highest and lowest monthly mean temperatures in 2019 were recorded in august 31 1 and january 4 0 respectively we selected the köppen climate classification kottek et al 2006 to define the wet and dry seasons in the riparian zone to seek the relationships between the changes in dryness and wetness and groundwater level variations the wet season monthly precipitation 60 mm of the riparian zone in 2018 and 2019 started in march and february respectively and continued until the end of august while the dry season mainly occurred from september 2018 to october 2018 january 2019 and from september 2019 to december 2019 groundwater level fluctuations are caused by changes in precipitation between seasons and years water level records from wells sy01 sy02 sy03 and sy04 showed that the amplitudes of the seasonal groundwater level fluctuations were impacted by variations in climate and meteorological drivers the magnitudes of the water level fluctuations were greater near the river than farther away from river indicating that groundwater surface water interactions played an important role in the near stream zone in addition owing to the impact of seasonal climatic drivers the groundwater level drops faster in the dry season than it rises in the wet season 3 2 soil texture and mineralogy the particle size distribution indicated that the soil texture in the riparian zone mainly comprised silt loam and sandy loam according to the usda soil classification bockheim and hartemink 2013 twarakavi et al 2010 soil composition was spatially highly heterogeneous with depth fig 3 and table s2 at the greatest depths of sy03 120 140 cm silt texture was observed while the texture of sy01 40 60 60 80 and 120 140 cm sy02 0 20 cm sy03 40 60 cm and sy04 0 20 and 80 100 cm were characterized by sandy loam with silty loam in the other soil horizons of the riparian zone the soil bd values ranged from 1 309 to 1 560 g cm 3 and the average bd was 1 413 0 065 g cm 3 n 28 table s2 the average bd of sandy loam 1 476 0 077 g cm 3 was larger than those of silt loam 1 393 0 045 g cm 3 and bd values decreased with the increasing clay and silt content plasticity of loamy soils was usually low when compared to clay fig 4 shows the xrd patterns of three depth dependent soil

composition the soil physicochemical properties ph ec st and sm at different depths are shown in fig 5 mean soil ph values were lower in the wet season august 2018 than in the dry season september 2019 fig s1a and soil ph fluctuated more strongly nearer to the river than farther away from it fig 5a1 a4 soil ec values initially decreased and then increased from august 2018 to september 2019 fig s1b and fig 5b1 b4 influenced by the air temperature the st values exhibited a decreasing trend with depth in summer however the st values exhibited an increasing trend with depth in winter fig 5c1 c4 spatial heterogeneity of riparian sm distribution in both wet and dry seasons are shown in fig 5 d1 d4 the spatial variability of the sm in the wet season was less significant than that in the dry season which was consistent with previous studies li et al 2016 in addition the soil texture is an important control on the vertical distribution of sm contents in the riparian sites depth and soil texture dependent profiles of soil carbon and nitrogen species including tc tn toc nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n and c n ratio toc tn are shown in fig 6 tc and toc contents showed decreasing trends with increasing depths at all four sites and toc variations revealed relatively inconsistent vertical distribution in contrast to tc variations further toc was characterized by substantial seasonal variability with higher average contents in the wet season august 2018 february 2019 and may 2019 than dry season september 2019 fig s2c and a similar trend in toc content was observed in profile sy01 closest to the river fig 6c1 there was significant variability in tn at each depth across the four sites and the tn was lowest in both wet and dry seasons at the 60 80 cm deep silt loam layer of sy02 fig 6b2 as for the overall spatiotemporal distribution the nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n contents were higher in the wet season than in the dry season in addition the no 3 n content decreased from the topsoil with increasing depth whereas the nh 4 n content followed an opposite trend as shown in fig 6f1 the no 3 n attenuation was faster at sy01 near the river channel and increased with depth affected by the rising groundwater level the no 2 n content increased significantly with depth in may 2019 fig 6e1 e4 compared with soil profiles farther away from river the c n ratio closest to the river had a more apparent declining trend with increasing depth all of these findings indicated depth dependent nitrogen transport and transformation in the riparian zone influenced by water level fluctuations 3 4 depth dependent pnr values the soil pnr values for the three soil textures silt silt loam and sandy loam varied substantially in time and space fig 7 the soil pnr values at sy01 ranged from 4 957 to 19 327 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in august 2018 wet season from 10 990 to 65 627 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in november 2018 a period of dry to wet transition from 5 307 to 24 951 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in february 2019 wet season from 7 988 to 47 968 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in may 2019 wet season and from 3 564 to 30 675 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in september 2019 dry season respectively the soil pnr values at sy02 in august 2018 november 2018 february 2019 may 2019 and september 2019 varied between 1 993 37 677 5 314 28 928 2 841 21 760 4 851 19 143 and 4 848 18 832 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively the soil pnr values at sy03 and sy04 were 5 490 9 255 and 5 087 12 904 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in august 2018 respectively and 3 878 38 238 and 4 500 37 415 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in november 2018 respectively and 7 779 40 493 and 5 824 35 300 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in february 2019 respectively and 7 568 33 936 and 4 219 21 740 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in may 2019 respectively and 4 531 9 588 and 4 454 38 651 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 in september 2019 respectively in addition differences in soil pnr values at sy04 among the vertical depths in may 2019 were significant and showed a somewhat declining trend 3 5 depth dependent pdr values the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of soil pdr for the three soil textures silt silt loam and sandy loam across the four sites are shown in fig 8 the soil pdr values in august 2018 wet season from sy01 near river to sy04 away from the river were 0 154 0 458 0 052 1 781 0 031 0 794 and 0 161 1 560 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively in november 2018 dry to wet transition pdr values from sy01 to sy04 were 0 297 1 164 0 151 0 369 0 313 1 693 and 0 116 1 739 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively while in in february 2019 wet season from sy01 to sy04 pdr values varied between 0 039 1 045 0 018 4 750 0 057 3 322 and 0 509 7 369 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively in may 2019 wet season pdr values from sy01 to sy04 varied between 0 088 1 386 0 240 0 810 0 082 1 070 and 0 012 0 809 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively the soil pdr values for september 2019 dry season from sy01 to sy04 ranged from 0 032 0 816 0 036 0 846 0 327 1 155 and 0 063 2 248 mg n kg 1 sdw day 1 respectively in general mean soil pdr values showed the following trend during most of the monitoring periods silt loam sandy loam which might indicate that soil denitrification activity in the silt loam texture layer was highest 3 6 depth dependent ghg fluxes in november 2018 a period of dry to wet transition soil air co2 emissions significantly decreased with increasing depth and the co2 emissions for all depth ranges exhibited statistically significant differences p 0 05 fig 9 a emissions in november were highest in the shallowest layer with slight fluctuations of 0 00 0 43 mg c kg 1 soil day 1 at depths 20 cm fig 9a similarly a significant interaction was observed between soil depth and n2o emissions with considerably higher emissions for depths of 0 20 cm at sy01 than for other depths in november p 0 05 fig 9b n2o emissions decreased significantly from the surface to a depth of 60 cm with a small increase at 60 80 cm followed by a continued decline fig 9b emissions were approximately 49 times higher at the soil surface than at depths of 120 140 cm fig 9b throughout the observation period soil air ch4 flux rates increased with profile depth and the ch4 concentrations for depths of 0 20 60 80 and 100 120 cm varied significantly p 0 05 fig 9c in addition during november 2018 the net flux rates of soil air ch4 in the topsoil layers i e 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm were less than zero fig 9c indicating that ch4 consumption occurred at depths ranging from 0 to 60 cm the ch4 vertical concentration at depths 60 cm were negligible throughout the observation period 3 7 effects of soil nutrients soil physicochemical properties and the soil environment on microbial nitrogen transformation processes the microbial nitrogen transformation processes including the soil nitrification denitrification and n2o production reduction and emission were affected by meteorological factors and soil variables including nutrient content soil physicochemical properties and soil redox environment fig 10 shows results of the pca and pearson correlations for the relationships between various soil properties and soil n2o emission in the riparian zone in november 2018 a period of dry to wet transition the pca revealed that strong n2o emission significantly occurred in regions near the river channel such as sy01 and sy02 as compared to further away sy03 and sy04 presumably related to strong water level fluctuations and increased groundwater surface water interaction furthermore soil n2o emission was positively correlated with bd wfps ph no 3 n pnr and pdr while it was negatively correlated with the other soil parameters e g st ec sm in addition the pca and pearson correlation between soil physicochemical properties and microbial nitrogen transformation processes pnr and pdr in november 2018 are shown in fig 10 and for august 2018 february 2019 may 2019 and september 2019 in fig s3 in the period of dry to wet transition november 2018 compared with other soil factors most significant positive correlations r2 0 67 p 0 001 occurred between soil pdr and no 3 n which indicates that riparian denitrification played a key role in nitrogen transformation and n2o emission during this time in the wet season february 2019 both pnr and pdr positively correlated with the availability of carbon and nitrogen sources as tn or toc while the pnr had more significant negative correlations with ph ec sm as compared to pdr in the dry season september 2019 the pnr had significant positive correlations with ph toc no 2 n no 3 n and c n ratio and had significant negative correlations with sm but the pdr had no significant relationship with any soil parameters in conclusion a conceptual structural equation model sem could be set up identifying the expected indirect pathways for vertical multiple meteorological and edaphic variables to affect riparian potential biogeochemical processes and ghg emission rates in the studied riparian zone fig s4 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal variability in riparian water level fluctuations water level fluctuations and soil structure in the riparian zone control the hydrological connectivity between upland riparian and wetland systems and are the most influential factors regulating riparian soil microbial structure and function burt et al 2002 groundwater level fluctuations in the studied riparian zone expressed significant seasonal variations with rising trends for november 2018 july 2019 and descending trends before november and after july fig 2 as a result of dynamics in precipitation evaporation and irrigation however compared with groundwater level data of sy01 sy02 sy03 and sy04 data from the official nearby hydrological station about than 30 km of the han river and the more distant hydrological station of the dongjing river revealed a discrepancy between the dynamic changes in river stage and groundwater level during some part of the observation period fig 2 although the rivers are all part of the jianghan plain and connected via the same large scale unconfined aquifer very localized factors such as spatial variability in precipitation intensity most likely caused the respective stream stages to react faster and would have led to a delayed groundwater level response under the studied riparian zone direct long term data collection on stream stage in the tongshun river which is closest to the studied riparian zone was not permitted recent studies have shown that the periodically alternating wet and dry periods attributable to water level fluctuations can have a critical influence on soil properties such as soil porosity and moisture content de oliveira et al 2021 or soil aggregate disintegration nsabimana et al 2023 they can also impact long term seasonal trends of the main sediment associated contaminant fluxes and nutrient budgets including phosphorus and nitrogen budgets coppens et al 2016 exchanges of nitrogen and phosphorus across the sediment water interface liu et al 2019 hyporheic exchanges and organic carbon mineralization in the riparian zone shi et al 2020 and biogeochemical processes including carbon and nitrogen retention and microbial community structure reverey et al 2018 4 2 factors influencing the vertical distribution of microbial nitrogen transformation in the riparian zone the riparian zone is attracting increasing attention and various studies have evaluated the effects of vertical heterogeneity on biogeochemical processes especially in the riparian vadose zone ma et al 2017 wang et al 2019 yabusaki et al 2017 in the present study we comprehensively examined the influence of vertical heterogeneity in soil physicochemical properties soil nutrient content and soil texture on nitrogen transformation processes in the riparian zone of the jianghan plain analysis of soil profile mineralogy fig 4 showed that soil minerals in the riparian zone particularly in the clay size 4 μm particle fraction were dominated by 2 1 type clay mineral including montmorillonite and illite due to their net negative charge and higher cation exchange capacity 2 1 type clay mineral can influence physical soil fractions chemical structures and the decomposition of organic amendments microbial residues and alter the microbial community composition xu et al 2022 which in turn have the potential to affect riparian biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification in addition the vertical distribution of soil elemental contents table s3 demonstrates abruptly changing redox and geochemical conditions that were influenced by water level fluctuations in the riparian zone and affected redox controlled nitrogen transformation processes of fe oxides and fe bearing clay minerals vogelsang et al 2016 for example organic matter acting as the main electron donor among other constituents like si and al can promote structural changes in hydrous fe oxides and retard fe mineral transformation into more crystalline phases jones et al 2009 vogelsang et al 2016 our results revealed that vertical gradients of soil parameters such as ph ec sm and the availability of carbon and nitrogen sources all played important roles in soil nitrification in the riparian zone in wet season and dry season we found that in the dry season nitrification was positively correlated with ph meaning that higher ph levels were associated with higher nitrification the conclusion is consistent with previous research about very low soil ph being found to reduce the growth of nitrifying bacteria and increase fungal growth robertson 1989 soil ec was influenced by the concentration of dissolved ions in the soil solution and we found that in the wet season nitrification was negatively correlated with ec i e higher ec levels were associated with lower nitrification we suggest that this is caused by high levels of dissolved ions being toxic to the nitrifying bacteria adviento borbe et al 2006 in addition it is worth mentioning that the spatial and temporal sm distribution at our site plays an important role in controlling surface ecological processes and management for ecological restoration we found that the sm was the most common significant negative factor to explain soil nitrification rates in soils in general activity of the nitrifying bacteria might be limited by sm levels because sm can affect soil aeration nutrient diffusion and microbial activity which can in turn impact nitrification rates abera et al 2012 ma et al 2020 a fluctuating groundwater level would likely increase the vertical heterogeneity of sm in the riparian zone harms and grimm 2008 and impact soil nitrification processes sm changes induced by water level fluctuations in the riparian zone can affect the availability of oxygen to nitrifying bacteria chen et al 2022 rising riparian water levels are inhibiting the aeration of moist soils which can in turn reduce the availability of oxygen driving the metabolism of nitrifying bacteria in contrast declining riparian water levels and resulting dryer soils can also inhibit decomposition due to lower solute diffusion and water stress and limit nitrifying bacteria activity rubol et al 2013 hence soil nitrification in the riparian zone can be limited by too high or too low sm content this supports the findings of kiese et al 2008 who found that the association between sm and nitrification rate was best described by the o neill function stating that moderate soil moisture levels can provide conditions that are most favorable to potential nitrification processes overall water level fluctuations in the riparian zone can have complex and multi faceted effects on soil nitrification and the interplay of a range of factors such as the duration and frequency of groundwater level fluctuations soil texture and other environmental factors need to be considered to gain a better understanding of the riparian system understanding these relationships can be important for managing soil processes and promoting healthy ecosystems in addition to investigating soil nitrification we have also investigated the thermal response of n2o emissions due to the denitrification of denitrifying bacteria tan et al 2018 in the present study we only observed significant positive linear correlations of the pdr with the availability of carbon and nitrogen sources such as tc tn toc etc in the wet season and there were no significant relations between the pdr and other soil parameters in order for denitrification to occur the denitrifying bacteria require a source of carbon and nitrogen which they can use as energy and building blocks for their metabolic processes robertson 1989 therefore if the availability of carbon and nitrogen sources is limited so will be limit the activity of the denitrifying bacteria defining denitrification in contrast a high availability of carbon and nitrogen sources will potentially promote denitrification the lack of significant relationships between pdr and soil parameters in our study may suggest that other factors such as temperature ph or the composition of the microbial community may also be important in regulating denitrification rates in this specific riparian zone it is also possible that the sample size or sampling frequency may have influenced the observed results therefore further research is needed to fully understand the factors that regulate denitrification in this specific riparian zone 4 3 drivers of ghg flux rates for various soil depths in the riparian zone elevated ghg emissions from riparian zone may increase the atmospheric concentrations of ghg thus exacerbating global warming liu et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 soils in the riparian zone serve as critical sources and sinks for ghgs such as co2 n2o and ch4 oertel et al 2016 ghg flux rates are primarily determined by proximal drivers that control soil emissions into the direct environment e g local climate regional climate and soil type and distal drivers that influence soil emissions at larger scales e g temperature humidity nutrient availability and ph robertson 1989 in addition we examined changes in ghg flux rates at various soil depths in the riparian zone and found that co2 and n2o emission rates decreased with soil depth with maximum values at depths of 0 20 cm the decreasing concentrations of ch4 mainly occurred at depths of 0 60 cm and the potential soil air ch4 uptake rates decreased with depth in the soil profile we also found that depth dependent ghg fluxes in the riparian zone were 0 00 0 90 mg c kg 1 day 1 for co2 emissions 0 00 0 21 µg n kg 1 day 1 for n2o emissions and 0 00 1 29 µg c kg 1 day 1 for ch4 uptake as the riparian zone is a type of wetland ecosystem its nutrient rich soils may become a significant source of co2 and n2o however should be considered a ch4 sink in addition our findings also emphasize that riparian soil properties and chemical composition play an important role in regulating n2o emissions from the riparian zone of the jianghan plain due to their effects on soil microbial activity and resulting nitrification or denitrification rates for example soil organic matter content nitrogen availability and ph can all influence the abundance and diversity of soil microorganisms involved in nitrification or denitrification and other nitrogen cycling processes furthermore riparian soil physical properties such as soil porosity and soil density affect gas diffusion and water movement which can further impact n2o emissions riparian soils may have higher porosity or lower bulk density than upland soils allowing for greater gas exchange and oxygen availability which can limit n2o production however the increased soil porosity in riparian soils can lead to increased rates of gas diffusion which can facilitate the transport of n2o from the soil to the atmosphere overall the finding that riparian soil properties and chemical composition play an important role in regulating n2o emissions highlights the need to consider both biotic and abiotic factors when studying nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in riparian zone this knowledge can help inform management strategies aimed at reducing n2o emissions from these critical habitats 4 4 water level fluctuations drive rapid changes in nitrogen transformation in the riparian zone as discussed previously in the riparian zone groundwater level fluctuations are driven by variations in precipitation infiltration caused by the alternation of seasons in our study groundwater levels fluctuated regularly with alternating wet dry seasons fig 2 and table s1 through influencing soil temperature moisture and redox conditions groundwater level fluctuations also impact nitrogen transformation processes and control n2o production reduction and emission in the riparian zone considering that denitrification is one of the important nitrogen transformation processes of n2o production in the riparian zone some previous studies have focused on the impact of riparian water level fluctuations on soil denitrification song et al 2010 wang et al 2019 ye et al 2015 ye et al 2017 for example it was found that periodic wetting drying cycles derived from water level fluctuations further enhanced hyporheic exchange which had been shown to increase the carbon source supply for denitrification by accelerating organic carbon mineralization shi et al 2020 similarly geistlinger et al 2010 found a negative correlation between groundwater level and n2o concentration in a shallow riparian aquifer in northern germany mander et al 2014 used the isotopic ratios of n2o to n2 to estimate the importance of denitrification in estonian forest riparian zones as a source of n2o other studies have also found that n2o in the riparian zone tends to accumulate at the saturated unsaturated interface deurer et al 2008 ronen et al 1988 spalding and parrott 1994 however only few studies consider nitrification as the main source of n2o in riparian zones for example vilain et al 2012 found a positive correlation between dissolved n2o and no3 in the shallow groundwater of the riparian zone in the orgeval basin france which indicated that n2o in the shallow groundwater mainly came from riparian nitrification that occurred in the eutrophic unsaturated zone the current study in the jianghan plain with its alternating wet and dry periods indicates that the drying process in the riparian zone provided suitable aerobic conditions for nitrification and the anaerobic microdomains in the oxygenated sediment reduced the no2 and no3 produced by nitrification through denitrification in addition the present study also found that the mean pnr in the dry season september 2019 was as high or significantly higher than that in the wet season august 2018 these findings confirmed previous research sullivan et al 2012 and except for higher pnr values in the dry season parker and schimel 2011 also evidenced that microbial biomass in the dry season was greater than in the wet season a recent study investigated the response of riparian ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob to water level fluctuations and their relative contributions to nitrification through indoor soil column experiment simulations li et al 2021 furthermore the community size of aob aoa is at least as high in the dry season as in the wet season despite the soil water content being extremely low during the dry season sullivan et al 2012 5 conclusions the spatiotemporal variability in soil nitrogen transformation processes and ghg emission fluxes under the effects of water level fluctuations during alternating wet and dry seasons was investigated for selected vertical profiles of the riparian zone of the jianghan plain central china therefore the impact of fluctuating water levels between seasonal nitrogen dynamics and multiple edaphic variables including soil textural and mineralogy physical and chemical properties and chemical compositions was evaluated by pca and pearson correlation analysis the soil physicochemical properties chemical compositions and nitrogen transformation rates including pnr and pdr at different soil depths revealed clear spatiotemporal variability in both wet and dry seasons vertical soil mineralogy and elemental results indicate abruptly changing redox and geochemical conditions influenced by water level fluctuations in the riparian zone that can affect physical soil properties chemical structures as well as the decomposition of soil nutrient content and redox related nitrogen transformation processes of fe oxides and fe bearing clay minerals furthermore the vertical pnr values somewhat declined with increasing depth and the mean pdr values from high to low among the soil textures was silt loam sandy loam during most of the monitoring periods the rates of co2 and n2o emissions from soil into the air significantly decreased with increasing soil depth the fluxes in soil air co2 and n2o production peaked in the top 0 20 cm of the soil whereas soil air ch4 consumption mainly occurred at soil depths of 0 60 cm multiple edaphic variables under the influence of water level fluctuations had substantial influences on the role of the soil as a source of n2o as well as on the various feedback processes involved overall investigating response characteristics of vertical soil nitrogen dynamics to alternating wetting drying cycles under fluctuating water levels and the detailed relationships between nitrogen transformation including ghg emissions and multiple soil variables will help decision makers and scientists to better manage nitrogen losses and ghg budgets in the riparian zone which has great implications for decelerating global warming consequently seasonal water level fluctuations in riparian zones need to be carefully considered when studying riparian groundwater quality and establishing long term groundwater management practices our findings provide an important reference for riparian groundwater management when periodic and frequent fluctuations in surface water and groundwater levels are greatly elevated by external factors such as precipitation irrigation and water management induced human activity however due to lack the characterization of the soil microbial community and its nitrogen transformation functional genes our knowledge regarding the microbial community in the riparian profile at our study site as a result of water level fluctuations is limited additionally laboratory soil column experiments and related nitrogen transport and transformation models for the riparian vadose zone groundwater coupled system will be the
