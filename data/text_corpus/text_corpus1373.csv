6865,according to the hydrological characteristics of a multi source irrigation system with paddy rice the soil and water assessment tool swat is improved to develop a distributed hydro agronomic model a technique with three critical depths is incorporated to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields in addition the evapotranspiration et of a paddy field is estimated based on two types of water storage conditions within swat specifically we propose a multi source auto irrigation framework for swat to estimate agricultural irrigation water consumptions aiwcs from different water sources furthermore we apply the improved swat to the yangshudang ysd basin located in the zhanghe irrigation system zis of southern china and the simulation results are compared with the observed data as well as with those of the original swat the results indicate that compared with the original swat the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of daily discharge increases from 0 48 to 0 80 in the calibration period and from 0 68 to 0 84 in the validation period in addition the nse of the daily et increases from 0 09 to 0 90 and other evaluation metrics also increase moreover the percent bias pbias between the total aiwc simulated by the improved swat and the observed value is 2 75 and that is 48 59 for the original swat in particular the improved swat estimates aiwcs from local water sources ponds and rivers and the main zhanghe reservoir and the simulated aiwcs approximate the observed values therefore the improved swat is more effective and suitable for the simulation of hydrological processes than the original swat in the multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice and it can estimate the aiwcs from different water sources which can provide irrigation management decision support for irrigation managers keywords swat improvement multi source auto irrigation irrigation system paddy rice 1 introduction paddy rice is a major food crop in china and it consumes large amounts of water for agricultural irrigation it is necessary to estimate agricultural irrigation water consumption aiwc from different water sources to create a reasonable framework to manage these resources in irrigation systems where the different water sources e g ponds rivers and reservoirs are highly distributed and are used to irrigate crops through irrigation canals in addition land cover types and soil types are different in different parts of the irrigation systems thus the irrigation system is a human nature composite ecosystem where the hydrologic cycle depends not only on natural factors but also on human activities grismer and wallender 2002 wang and yang 2005 xie and cui 2011 ferguson and maxwell 2012 therefore a distributed hydro agronomic model is needed to simulate the macroscopic hydrological processes in a basin but also simulate the field water cycle and investigate the effects of irrigation and drainage practices on hydrological processes which can provide irrigation management decision support for irrigation managers the soil and water assessment tool swat is a basin scale continuous time spatially semi distributed and physically based model arnold et al 1998 it is considered to be a robust interdisciplinary tool appropriate for agricultural management simulation panagopoulos and makropoulos 2014 moreover swat can simulate irrigation applications for crops via an auto irrigation module neitsch et al 2011 thus swat is regarded as a preferred and reasonable tool for a human nature basin such as an irrigation system and it was widely used to examine water cycles in irrigation systems ahmad et al 2002 gosain et al 2005 ahmadzadeh et al 2015 which showed the capability of swat to address water cycle problems in a large scale basin as well as the possibility of being applied to irrigation systems since the source code of the swat model is open in order to completely represent the characteristics of the irrigation system and simulate its hydrological processes more reasonably there have been some studies concerning the modification or improvement of the swat model according to the characteristics of the irrigation system in terms of the irrigation systems with paddy rice xie and cui 2011 developed the swat2000 framework by incorporating new processes for the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields improving the actual evapotranspiration et calculation and adding the real time irrigation function of ponds for paddy rice sakaguchi et al 2014 introduced a potential percolation rate of paddy fields to simulate the percolation processes in paddy fields and the irrigation process was modified to avoid overflows from paddy fields during irrigation management in addition they added an evaporation coefficient to calculate evaporation from the water surface of the paddy field dai et al 2016 revised the command loop of the land phase of the hydrologic cycle in swat and modified the movement of the irrigation water in paddy fields calculation of rice yield and water balance modules e g et seepage and capillary rise for paddy rice fields to develop the rice irrigation system soil and water assessment tool ris swat ris swat can also address the seepage of irrigation canals dai et al 2016 moreover other scholars have also modified the swat model luo et al 2008 dechmi et al 2012 although the simulation of hydrological processes of paddy field in the swat model have been improved by some researchers xie and cui 2011 sakaguchi et al 2014 dai et al 2016 these improvements do not involve the method for using water from different water sources for irrigation in addition the auto irrigation module of the original swat model cannot simulate the multi source irrigation for fields neitsch et al 2011 however the water from different water sources is used to irrigate crops in irrigation systems for example the melon on the vine irrigation system in southern china a multi source water supply irrigation system in which the types of irrigation water sources are rivers large or small reservoirs and numerous ponds guo 1965 in addition from the perspective of irrigation managers while carrying out the water cycle simulation of an irrigation system they hope to obtain the aiwc processes from different water sources under the premise of ensuring the crop water requirement to be satisfied therefore a multi source auto irrigation module msaim must be added to swat to more accurately simulate the water cycle and benefit water management in multi source irrigation systems in this study the swat model is further improved for simulating the hydrologic cycle and aiwc processes in multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice the objectives of this study are 1 to integrate the developments of paddy field proposed by predecessors xie and cui 2011 dai et al 2016 and further improve the simulation of paddy field et on the basis of swat2012 2 to propose a multi source auto irrigation framework for the swat model and 3 to evaluate the capabilities of improved swat in modeling water flow et and aiwc 2 methodology 2 1 swat model description as the hydrological processes of a basin are simulated using a swat model the basin is divided into multiple sub basins and further subdivided into hydrologic response units hrus the water balance elements are simulated separately and eventually routed for the total runoff for the basin the two steps are the land phase of the hydrologic cycle and the routing phase of the hydrologic cycle respectively neitsch et al 2011 in addition swat allows the irrigation applications to be simulated through an auto irrigation module 2 1 1 hydrologic cycle the land phase of the hydrologic cycle is simulated using a swat model on the basis of the water balance equation described by neitsch et al 2011 the calculations of water balance elements include runoff soil conservation service scs 1972 green and ampt 1911 et ritchie 1972 percolation bypass flow and lateral flow neitsch et al 2011 the et consists of canopy storage ecan soil evaporation es and plant transpiration ep where ep is estimated based on the water content and potential plant transpiration epmax that is simulated as a linear function of eto and the leaf area index ritchie 1972 and the swat model ensures the potential soil evaporation esmax and epmax do not exceed the reference crop evapotranspiration eto in terms of the routing phase of the hydrologic cycle the muskingum routing method cunge 1969 is used to route flow through the stream network 2 1 2 auto irrigation with regard to the simulation of irrigation the user can specify a water stress threshold that triggers irrigation auto wstr through the auto irrigation module when water stress is based on plant water demand auto wstr is a fraction threshold of potential plant growth the fraction of potential plant growth is calculated as follows 1 strsw e p ep max where strsw is the fraction of potential plant growth achieved on the day where the reduction is caused by water stress whenever strsw is below auto wstr the model will automatically apply water to the hru in addition when water stress is based on the soil water deficit auto wstr is the soil water deficit threshold below the field capacity fc anytime the water content of the soil profile falls below fc auto wstr the model will automatically apply water to the hru for both auto wstrs if enough water is available from the irrigation source the model will add water to the soil until it is at fc or add the water of a user defined amount irr mx to the soil beyond that the user must specify the source of irrigation water in the swat a reach a reservoir a shallow aquifer a deep aquifer or a source outside the basin however the user can only choose one of them in an hru and must specify the location of the water source neitsch et al 2011 2 2 model improvement 2 2 1 the developed components of paddy field water balance this study combines the developments of paddy fields proposed by xie and cui 2011 with those developed by dai et al 2016 and it further improves the simulation of the paddy field et for an improved swat a pothole originally meaning a closed depression area can store water in the related hru the original swat model assumes that paddy rice can grow in the pothole which is assumed to be cone shaped and the surface area varies with changes in the volume of water storage neitsch et al 2011 however according to the true paddy field it is assumed that the area of a paddy field is equal to that of an hru covered by paddy rice xie and cui 2011 a technique with three critical depths the minimum fitting depth h min the maximum fitting depth h max and the maximum allowable depth of impoundment after rainfall h p guo 1997 is incorporated to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields that is the irrigation is triggered when the water depth in the paddy field is less than h min and the net amount of water that needs to be poured into the field is the difference between h max and the current water depth in the paddy field in addition the drainage will occur once the water depth in the paddy field is more than h p the three critical depths change in relation to time during the growth period of the paddy rice mao 1997 where the growth period is divided according to the physiological characteristics of paddy rice growth into different growth stages such as the recovering stage which refers to the time period from transplantation until plants with a newborn tiller tip exposed leaf sheath account for 10 of all plants in the field dai et al 2016 introduced a water utilization coefficient of the canal system to compute the canal seepage loss that supplies shallow aquifers and simultaneously used two methods to calculate the seepage for the ponding and no ponding water stage respectively furthermore dai et al 2016 added the calculation of the lateral flow for paddy fields with the equation described by neitsch et al 2011 the improved swat incorporates the abovementioned developments according to fao 56 allen et al 1998 the et and epmax of paddy rice can be greater than eto during some growth stages however the swat model limits epmax and esmax to eto and the evaporation of water is not included in the et of paddy fields in the original swat model neitsch et al 2011 which causes the et of paddy fields to be underestimated thus in this study we improve the et algorithm by removing the limitation that the epmax of a paddy rice must be less than or equal to eto furthermore a crop coefficient allen et al 1998 is employed together with eto to limit epmax as follows 2 ep max k c et o where k c is the crop coefficient which is obtained from a field test and is different in different growth stages and if field test data are not available k c can be determined with reference to fao 56 and corrected according to local weather and soil moisture conditions the specific method is described by allen et al 1998 moreover the improved swat calculates et with the formula and conditions described by xie and cui 2011 as follows 1 if the paddy field is in an upland state and the hru is not an impounded area or a drained area then 3a et e can e p e s 2 if the paddy field is in a wet state and the hru is impounded then 3b et e can e p e pot where e pot is the evaporation from the water surface on a given day mm in terms of the original swat model es is calculated before the pothole water balance and epot is estimated after infiltration in the pothole when the fields are impounded and water is stored es is zero and if the water depth in a field is very small after infiltration the water depth is smaller or even zero which causes epot to be small or zero this phenomenon will cause the et to be smaller than the true value thus we exchange the simulation order of the epot and infiltration of fields in the improved swat through adjusting the order of subroutines 2 2 2 multi source auto irrigation module the original swat model only uses a single irrigation water source in an irrigation application and the water stored in ponds is not used for irrigation however an irrigation system can use water from more than one source especially in irrigation systems of melon on the vine such as zis mushtaq et al 2007a and b therefore a msaim is added to swat to simulate irrigation applications and a pond is considered one of the types of irrigation water sources with regard to the msaim the improved swat classifies the types of irrigation water sources from the perspective of a sub basin namely a river the pond inside this sub basin which is a comprehensive pond that brings together all ponds in this sub basin a reservoir an aquifer and a source outside the basin then a condition that triggers irrigation application is set for each hru once this occurs the water stored in different water sources specified by the user are fetched to irrigate crops growing in hrus from the first water source to the last one in that order as shown in fig 1 combined with fig 1 there are several explanations described as follows 1 defining irrigation condition and calculating irrigation water requirements the irrigation condition is a condition that triggers automatic irrigation when it occurs multi source auto irrigation begins irrigation water requirement m is the maximum irrigation water amount in a whole irrigation application an hru covered by paddy rice and an hru covered by upland crops have different irrigation conditions and different methods are used for their irrigation water requirement calculations for an hru covered by upland crops an auto wstr is set as its irrigation condition m is a user defined value according to the irrigation experiment for upland crops a detailed description is provided by neitsch et al 2011 for an hru covered by paddy rice the irrigation condition and m are described as follows if the water depth in field h is less than or equal to h min and the daily precipitation on the current day is less than a constant value 5 mm then 4 m i h i m a x h i where m i is the irrigation water requirement on day i mm and h i m a x and h i are the maximum fitting depth and water depth in the field on day i respectively mm here the irrigation condition takes into account both the water depth in the field and the precipitation if it rains the farmers or managers scarcely irrigate the paddy rice in the irrigation systems e g zis 2 specifying water sources and their orders in terms of a sub basin the river inside the sub basin and the pond inside the sub basin are the first and second water sources respectively the river inside the sub basin can be specified on the software interface and the real time irrigation function of the pond is extended in the improved swat model however for the latter water sources e g a reservoir or a source outside the basin a new input file is created to specify them specifically if there are a few reservoirs within the irrigation system and their water can be used for irrigation of the hrus in this sub basin according to distances from small to large between the reservoirs and the sub basin then the reservoirs are designated the third water source the fourth water source etc a source outside the basin is the last water source if its water can be transferred for irrigation of the hrus in this sub basin all hrus belonging to the same sub basin have the same irrigation water sources and orders but the irrigation water sources and orders can be changed according to the characteristics of the hrus for example if a particular hru is only taking water from the reservoir we can only specify the reservoir as its irrigation source on the software interface or set the available water of the river and pond to zero 3 estimating water availability from water sources the water availability from a water source refers to the net amount of water that can reach the field which is converted from the maximum gross amount of water in the water source considering the irrigation efficiency the calculation methods for water availability differ depending on the type of water source as follows if the type of water source is a river then 5a a w t r 86 400 q min β η 1 10 s if the type of water source is the pond inside a sub basin then 5b a v o l β η 1 10 s if the type of water source is a reservoir then 5c a v o l β η 2 10 s if the type of water source is a source outside the basin then m is specified as the available water as follows 5d a m where a is the water availability of a water source on the day of irrigation mm wtr is the river water amount on the day of irrigation which is simulated daily in the model so it can be used directly when calculating the available water for a river m3 q min is the minimum in stream flow which can be obtained from the survey but in the absence of relative information is set as the model default value m3 s 1 vol is the water amount of a reservoir or the pond inside a sub basin on the day of irrigation which is calculated daily and can be obtained directly m3 s is the area of the hru requiring irrigation ha β is the fraction of available water allowed to be used for irrigation which is used to limit irrigation amounts from the pond if the pond needs to retain some water for aquaculture or ecological landscapes and it is obtained according to the experiences of farmers and managers or determined when calibrating the model and η 1 η 2 are the irrigation efficiencies that are the ratios between the net irrigation amount and the gross irrigation amount where η 1 mainly considers water sources that are close to the field such as the river inside a sub basin and the pond inside a sub basin since there is no need for a canal system and is equivalent to the water efficiency in field and η 2 is for the reservoir and source outside the basin taking into account both the water utilization coefficient of the canal system and the water efficiency in the field moreover we can obtain η 1 and η 2 from the management department of the irrigation systems 4 estimating irrigation water deficit for the first water source when the available water a 1 is less than m in an irrigation application the irrigation water deficit is computed as 6a wd 1 m a 1 however for the second and the latter water sources if their available water a k is less than the irrigation water deficit wd k 1 of the previous water source the irrigation water deficit is represented as 6b wd k wd k 1 a k where wd is the irrigation water deficit mm and k k 2 is the water source order number 5 estimating the gross irrigation amount when irrigating crops the irrigation supply is the minimum value between the water availability and the irrigation water requirement or the deficit as follows 7a b 1 m i n a 1 m k 1 7b b k m i n a k wd k 1 k 2 where b is the irrigation supply mm furthermore we can calculate the gross irrigation amount for each source according to the irrigation supply and the irrigation efficiency as follows if the type of water source is the river or pond inside the sub basin then 8a i b η 1 if the type of water source is a reservoir or a source outside the basin then 8b i b η 2 where i is the gross irrigation amount from a water source mm additionally the aiwcs from different water sources can be obtained by summing the gross irrigation amount according to the type of water source 2 3 model application 2 3 1 study area description ysd is a closed basin irrigation system in zis in hubei province china which is a typical melon on the vine system dong et al 2009 fig 2 it has a total drainage area of 43 km2 with elevations ranging from 72 m to 137 m above mean sea level and an average land surface slope of 2 4 the soil in ysd consists of yellow brown earth paddy soil 84 9 yellow brown earth soil 6 99 and others 8 11 and it has a heavy texture and poor drainage six types of land cover are distributed in the ysd paddy rice accounts for 55 72 followed by upland crops 14 36 water 12 2 bare land 10 83 forest 5 66 and urban areas 1 23 thus the paddy rice is the main crop in the study area the climate is a subtropical continental monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 965 mm and a mean annual temperature of 17 c there are numerous medium sized and small ponds that provide water for irrigation in the ysd in addition the water of the zhanghe reservoir is transferred to irrigate crops through the two main canals if required for ysd the zhanghe reservoir is a source outside the basin of course if there is water in the river inside ysd when the crops require irrigation the water of the river is used preferentially 2 3 2 data and model setup three basic spatial data files were utilized for delineating ysd into sub basins and further hrus a digital elevation model dem a soil map and a land cover use map among them the dem with a 25 m resolution was obtained from changjiang river scientific research institute the soil map was obtained by scanning a paper map of soil distribution provided by the local agriculture department of zis the land use map with a resolution of 14 25 m was derived from a 30 m resolution grid format landsat tm image and a 15 m resolution grid format landsat etm image cai 2007 ysd was divided into 10 sub basins fig 2 based on dem and subdivided into 105 hrus determined by the soil land use and slope data where the slope is divided into two categories with a sorting threshold value of 2 the meteorological data including maximum and minimum daily air temperature solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and precipitation from january 2003 to december 2009 were obtained from tuanlin experimental station fig 2 the paddy field management operations including plant growth season fertilization system harvest and kill operations were obtained through surveys from local farmers the paddy rice is transplanted on may 30 and harvested on september 3 referring to xie and cui 2011 the three critical depths in the different growing stages are shown in table 1 and k c table 1 were obtained from tuanlin experimental station the η 1 and η 2 in ysd are 0 90 and 0 65 respectively as provided by tuanlin experimental station in addition the daily discharge series of the outlet of ysd were observed at a temporary hydrometric station in the paddy growth period from may 20 to september 10 from 2005 to 2009 and the daily et was measured during the paddy growth period from 2007 to 2008 through lysimeters of 2 m 2 m in tuanlin experimental station moreover the measured aiwcs from the local sources ponds and rivers and zhanghe reservoir in ysd from 2005 to 2008 were provided by the management bureau of zis finally the msaim is used to simulate irrigation of paddy rice and the types of water sources in each sub basin should be specified beforehand according to the actual situation of ysd the river and pond inside a sub basin are specified as the first and second water source respectively for the hrus belonging to this sub basin and the zhanghe reservoir is the third water source after specifying the types of water sources for hrus the irrigation application will operate as shown in fig 1 2 3 3 model calibration and validation setting 2003 to 2004 as a warm up period we use the observed daily discharge series in the outlet of ysd to calibrate 2005 2007 and validate 2008 2009 the discharge via swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 before calibrating an important step is to replace the executable program swat exe in swat cup with the improved executable program after calibrating and achieving an acceptable simulation for the daily discharge in the calibration period the same modeling environment is applied in the validation period additionally the observed et data sets in the paddy growth period from 2007 to 2008 are used to verify the simulated result of et and we compare the simulated aiwcs from different sources in 2005 2008 with measured values 2 3 4 model evaluation metrics four quantitative statistics are used to evaluate the efficiency of the improved swat model the first one is the nes nash and sutcliffe 1970 which indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fit the 1 1 line the second one is the rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr legates and mccabe 1999 which varies from the optimal value of 0 indicating zero rmse and therefore perfect simulation to a large positive value that shows unsatisfactory performance the third one is the pbias which shows the average tendency of the simulated value to be larger or smaller than the observed value gupta et al 1999 in addition the coefficient of determination r2 is the fourth indicator typically values larger than 0 5 are considered acceptable santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2007 furthermore model performance can be judged based on general performance ratings on a monthly basis as shown in table 2 moriasi et al 2007 which can also be used for a daily time step 3 results 3 1 discharge calibration and validation in the calibration process we first choose three parameters of the initial scs runoff curve number c n 2 the available water capacity of the soil layers s o l a w c and the soil evaporation compensation factor e s c o which are identical to those selected by xie and cui 2011 and proven to be the most sensitive parameters for the model runoff in a few studies immerzeel and droogers 2008 shen et al 2008 referring to cibin et al 2010 and mengistu and sorteberg 2012 we add some additional parameters as the sensitive parameters the base flow recession coefficient a l p h a b f the groundwater delay time g w d e l a y and the surface lag s u r l a g the observed and simulated daily discharges in the paddy growth period of ysd are shown in figs 3 and 4 in the calibration period we display the results in 2007 separately from 2005 to 2006 because a large discharge occurred in 2007 the improved swat model adapts well to the selected basin in terms of discharge in the validation period however in 2005 to 2006 and a period in 2007 the simulated daily discharges do not fit well with the observed values and larger simulation error occurs when the three critical depths change especially at the final tillering and ripening stages the main reason for this phenomenon may be that the model controls irrigation and drainage through three critical depths and assumes that all paddy fields within the hru drain on the same day which is different from the actual situation in fact the farmers may drain the field randomly some on the first day others on the second day and so on which are not unified to further demonstrate the performance of the model simulation the four evaluation criteria described above are calculated for the discharge as shown in table 3 compared with the corresponding indicators in table 2 we observe that the performance rating of the improved swat model is satisfactory or better in the study by xie and cui 2011 only a 2 year 2005 2006 discharge data set was used to test the developed swat model and the precipitation in the paddy growth period for 2005 and 2006 was 358 mm and 371 mm respectively that is xie and cui 2011 tested the developed swat model only in years with low precipitation additionally regarding this study a 5 year 2005 2009 discharge data set was used to test the improved model among these years the precipitation in the paddy growth period for 2007 2008 2009 was 578 mm 597 mm and 503 mm respectively that is the improved swat model was tested in different hydrological years moreover to illustrate whether the improved swat model is superior to the original swat model for ysd in zis we perform a comparative simulation based on the original swat the simulation conditions are identical except that the fraction of potholes in the hrus is set to 0 90 to represent the fraction of paddy fields and a maximum water depth in the pothole p o t v o l x is set to the average of h p in different growing stages of paddy rice with a value of 60 mm in addition an auto wstr of 0 95 is set based on plant water demand for hrus covered by paddy rice as shown in figs 3 and 4 and table 3 the performance of the original swat is not as good as the improved model specifically the original swat underestimates the discharge as almost all the simulated discharge peaks are lower than the observed values and the absolute value of pbias is high in terms of the original swat the main reason for this phenomenon is that the original model sets a p o t v o l x for the whole growth period of paddy rice which does not vary in different growing stages in addition it does not recognize the impoundment and drainage operations of the paddy field but defaults to the impoundment operation so that drainage occurs only when the water depth exceeds the p o t v o l x wang and cui 2011 however in reality the drainage operation takes place at the final tillering stage and the final ripening stage to improve the aerating and temperature conditions li et al 2003 therefore most of the precipitation is stored in the pothole resulting in a significant reduction in discharge 3 2 evapotranspiration verification an hru located in the sub basin of tuanlin experimental station fig 2 was selected to compare its simulated et with the value observed in tuanlin experimental station as shown in fig 5 and table 4 the improved swat model simulates the et of paddy fields well while the simulation of the original swat is unacceptable this result may be because the original model only uses the same method to calculate the et of the paddy field for the ponding water stage and the no ponding water stage and limits that epmax must be less than or equal to eto in addition the evaporation of water is not included in the evapotranspiration of paddy fields in the original swat model neitsch et al 2011 wang and cui 2011 3 3 estimation of agricultural irrigation water consumption the aiwcs of ysd are calculated by the msaim of the improved swat model and the auto irrigation module of the original swat model where we adjust the β of the river and pond to 0 9 for the improved swat the simulated aiwcs from 2005 to 2008 are compared with the measured values as shown in fig 6 in addition the pbais between the simulated values and observed values of aiwc is shown in table 5 we can see that the total aiwc simulated by the improved swat and the measured value are almost identical and the pbias between the simulated aiwcs from different water sources and the measured values are less than 20 however as shown in fig 6 the estimated result is not accurate in 2005 potentially because the precipitation in the paddy growth period was low in that year a drought year the river water and pond water were depleted during irrigation and zhanghe reservoir failed to deliver sufficient water to ysd while the model makes a necessary assumption that zhanghe reservoir as a source outside ysd can meet the irrigation demand furthermore the simulated total aiwc from the original swat is much less than the measured value because the original swat uses an auto wstr to trigger irrigation but in practice farmers irrigate paddy rice once h is less than or equal to h min at which time auto wstr is not reached moreover the lower simulation of aiwc from the original swat is also one of the reasons why the simulated discharge is lower than the observed discharge 4 discussion the improved swat model can simulate the hydrological processes and aiwc in the irrigation systems under different scenarios for example the climate change has led to the changing response of paddy water consumption and irrigation requirement water wang et al 2017 the improved swat model can predict them under climate change which can provide decision support for irrigation managers to develop future water use plans moreover in practice the three critical depths of paddy fields are different in different growing stages and the improved swat model can meet this requirement when simulate the paddy water balance but some crop models such as oryza model bouman et al 2001 in which the h max and h p of paddy fields are constant therefore the paddy water balance can be simulated to be more consistent with the actual situation if the water balance simulation module of the improved swat model is used to replace that of oryza model in addition this paper argues that a distributed hydro agronomic model should be tested by using the et data sets measured at the field scale because the accuracy of the et simulation directly affects the calculation of crop yield letey et al 1985 and et is a main component of the hydrologic cycle therefore compared with xie and cui 2011 we observe the daily et of the paddy field in tuanlin experimental station and compare the simulated et with the observed values as shown in fig 5 the results demonstrate good performance of the et simulation furthermore current simulation models can be used as analytical tools to improve water management in irrigation systems singh et al 2006 such as the ris swat proposed by dai et al 2016 the improved swat model can simulate irrigation application of crops through a msaim and compute aiwcs from different water sources e g rivers ponds and reservoirs from which the managers of irrigation systems can obtain a clear understanding of the aiwc situation concurrently this model can assist researchers and practitioners in investigating water management alternatives and the aiwcs from different water sources of different hydrological years can be simulated so that administrators of the reservoirs can formulate water use plans according to the predicted precipitation in future years for example in ysd if the predicted precipitation is high in one year then the manager of zhanghe reservoir can plan a small amount of water from zhanghe reservoir for ysd in addition the manager may increase the pond project to store rainfall or runoff for irrigation to reduce the water supply pressure of backbone water sources in the case of multi source irrigation this study only considers surface water e g river pond and reservoir and does not involve groundwater irrigation because the study area is located in the irrigation system in southern china where farmers rarely use groundwater for irrigation nevertheless the improved swat model can further consider groundwater as a water source for irrigation and include it in a msaim as shown in fig 1 furthermore this study specifies that the priority order of different water sources for irrigation is rivers ponds reservoirs and sources outside the basin according to the situation of the study area however the improved swat model can adjust the priority order according to the characteristics of the irrigation systems and use more than a river or reservoir to irrigate the same hru through further modification it should be noted that the msaim of the improved swat model still needs further verification studies to construct a comprehensive hydro agronomic simulation tool in this paper the observed aiwc from the local water sources ponds and rivers has not been carried out classified statistics according to the different types of water sources so we do not compare the simulated aiwcs from rivers and ponds respectively with the corresponding observed values however this paper shows the function of a msaim and as far as calibration and testing the improved swat model introduces β of ponds reservoirs and rivers users can adjust β to make the simulated aiwcs from different water sources fit with the corresponding observed values taking ysd as an example if the β of rivers and ponds decreases then the corresponding aiwcs will be cut down so that aiwc from zhanghe reservoir will increase 5 conclusion considering the hydrological characteristics of irrigation systems with paddy rice in southern china we implement improvements on the swat model the paddy field is assumed to be an independent hru rather than a depression in the related hru and a technique with three critical depths is incorporated to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields moreover a crop coefficient is employed together with et0 to limit the epmax of paddy rice and the et of a paddy field is estimated for two types of water storage conditions in particular a msaim is added as one of the components of swat which can estimate the aiwcs from different water sources ysd in the zis in southern china a multi source irrigation system with paddy rice is utilized as the demonstration area to test these improvements the simulated discharge et and aiwc from the improved swat are in good agreement with the corresponding observed values and the improved swat model has much better performance than the original one specifically the improved model estimates aiwcs from different water sources through its msaim the result of the irrigation simulation shows the reasonableness and function of the msaim consequently this study significantly improves the simulation accuracy of swat for hydrological processes in multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice and extends the function of swat to simulate irrigation moreover further measurements are needed to test the improved swat and improvements of other modules should be further considered such as groundwater simulation and crop growth simulation for the purpose of constructing a highly effective tool for the agricultural basin declaration of interest statement we

6865,according to the hydrological characteristics of a multi source irrigation system with paddy rice the soil and water assessment tool swat is improved to develop a distributed hydro agronomic model a technique with three critical depths is incorporated to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields in addition the evapotranspiration et of a paddy field is estimated based on two types of water storage conditions within swat specifically we propose a multi source auto irrigation framework for swat to estimate agricultural irrigation water consumptions aiwcs from different water sources furthermore we apply the improved swat to the yangshudang ysd basin located in the zhanghe irrigation system zis of southern china and the simulation results are compared with the observed data as well as with those of the original swat the results indicate that compared with the original swat the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of daily discharge increases from 0 48 to 0 80 in the calibration period and from 0 68 to 0 84 in the validation period in addition the nse of the daily et increases from 0 09 to 0 90 and other evaluation metrics also increase moreover the percent bias pbias between the total aiwc simulated by the improved swat and the observed value is 2 75 and that is 48 59 for the original swat in particular the improved swat estimates aiwcs from local water sources ponds and rivers and the main zhanghe reservoir and the simulated aiwcs approximate the observed values therefore the improved swat is more effective and suitable for the simulation of hydrological processes than the original swat in the multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice and it can estimate the aiwcs from different water sources which can provide irrigation management decision support for irrigation managers keywords swat improvement multi source auto irrigation irrigation system paddy rice 1 introduction paddy rice is a major food crop in china and it consumes large amounts of water for agricultural irrigation it is necessary to estimate agricultural irrigation water consumption aiwc from different water sources to create a reasonable framework to manage these resources in irrigation systems where the different water sources e g ponds rivers and reservoirs are highly distributed and are used to irrigate crops through irrigation canals in addition land cover types and soil types are different in different parts of the irrigation systems thus the irrigation system is a human nature composite ecosystem where the hydrologic cycle depends not only on natural factors but also on human activities grismer and wallender 2002 wang and yang 2005 xie and cui 2011 ferguson and maxwell 2012 therefore a distributed hydro agronomic model is needed to simulate the macroscopic hydrological processes in a basin but also simulate the field water cycle and investigate the effects of irrigation and drainage practices on hydrological processes which can provide irrigation management decision support for irrigation managers the soil and water assessment tool swat is a basin scale continuous time spatially semi distributed and physically based model arnold et al 1998 it is considered to be a robust interdisciplinary tool appropriate for agricultural management simulation panagopoulos and makropoulos 2014 moreover swat can simulate irrigation applications for crops via an auto irrigation module neitsch et al 2011 thus swat is regarded as a preferred and reasonable tool for a human nature basin such as an irrigation system and it was widely used to examine water cycles in irrigation systems ahmad et al 2002 gosain et al 2005 ahmadzadeh et al 2015 which showed the capability of swat to address water cycle problems in a large scale basin as well as the possibility of being applied to irrigation systems since the source code of the swat model is open in order to completely represent the characteristics of the irrigation system and simulate its hydrological processes more reasonably there have been some studies concerning the modification or improvement of the swat model according to the characteristics of the irrigation system in terms of the irrigation systems with paddy rice xie and cui 2011 developed the swat2000 framework by incorporating new processes for the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields improving the actual evapotranspiration et calculation and adding the real time irrigation function of ponds for paddy rice sakaguchi et al 2014 introduced a potential percolation rate of paddy fields to simulate the percolation processes in paddy fields and the irrigation process was modified to avoid overflows from paddy fields during irrigation management in addition they added an evaporation coefficient to calculate evaporation from the water surface of the paddy field dai et al 2016 revised the command loop of the land phase of the hydrologic cycle in swat and modified the movement of the irrigation water in paddy fields calculation of rice yield and water balance modules e g et seepage and capillary rise for paddy rice fields to develop the rice irrigation system soil and water assessment tool ris swat ris swat can also address the seepage of irrigation canals dai et al 2016 moreover other scholars have also modified the swat model luo et al 2008 dechmi et al 2012 although the simulation of hydrological processes of paddy field in the swat model have been improved by some researchers xie and cui 2011 sakaguchi et al 2014 dai et al 2016 these improvements do not involve the method for using water from different water sources for irrigation in addition the auto irrigation module of the original swat model cannot simulate the multi source irrigation for fields neitsch et al 2011 however the water from different water sources is used to irrigate crops in irrigation systems for example the melon on the vine irrigation system in southern china a multi source water supply irrigation system in which the types of irrigation water sources are rivers large or small reservoirs and numerous ponds guo 1965 in addition from the perspective of irrigation managers while carrying out the water cycle simulation of an irrigation system they hope to obtain the aiwc processes from different water sources under the premise of ensuring the crop water requirement to be satisfied therefore a multi source auto irrigation module msaim must be added to swat to more accurately simulate the water cycle and benefit water management in multi source irrigation systems in this study the swat model is further improved for simulating the hydrologic cycle and aiwc processes in multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice the objectives of this study are 1 to integrate the developments of paddy field proposed by predecessors xie and cui 2011 dai et al 2016 and further improve the simulation of paddy field et on the basis of swat2012 2 to propose a multi source auto irrigation framework for the swat model and 3 to evaluate the capabilities of improved swat in modeling water flow et and aiwc 2 methodology 2 1 swat model description as the hydrological processes of a basin are simulated using a swat model the basin is divided into multiple sub basins and further subdivided into hydrologic response units hrus the water balance elements are simulated separately and eventually routed for the total runoff for the basin the two steps are the land phase of the hydrologic cycle and the routing phase of the hydrologic cycle respectively neitsch et al 2011 in addition swat allows the irrigation applications to be simulated through an auto irrigation module 2 1 1 hydrologic cycle the land phase of the hydrologic cycle is simulated using a swat model on the basis of the water balance equation described by neitsch et al 2011 the calculations of water balance elements include runoff soil conservation service scs 1972 green and ampt 1911 et ritchie 1972 percolation bypass flow and lateral flow neitsch et al 2011 the et consists of canopy storage ecan soil evaporation es and plant transpiration ep where ep is estimated based on the water content and potential plant transpiration epmax that is simulated as a linear function of eto and the leaf area index ritchie 1972 and the swat model ensures the potential soil evaporation esmax and epmax do not exceed the reference crop evapotranspiration eto in terms of the routing phase of the hydrologic cycle the muskingum routing method cunge 1969 is used to route flow through the stream network 2 1 2 auto irrigation with regard to the simulation of irrigation the user can specify a water stress threshold that triggers irrigation auto wstr through the auto irrigation module when water stress is based on plant water demand auto wstr is a fraction threshold of potential plant growth the fraction of potential plant growth is calculated as follows 1 strsw e p ep max where strsw is the fraction of potential plant growth achieved on the day where the reduction is caused by water stress whenever strsw is below auto wstr the model will automatically apply water to the hru in addition when water stress is based on the soil water deficit auto wstr is the soil water deficit threshold below the field capacity fc anytime the water content of the soil profile falls below fc auto wstr the model will automatically apply water to the hru for both auto wstrs if enough water is available from the irrigation source the model will add water to the soil until it is at fc or add the water of a user defined amount irr mx to the soil beyond that the user must specify the source of irrigation water in the swat a reach a reservoir a shallow aquifer a deep aquifer or a source outside the basin however the user can only choose one of them in an hru and must specify the location of the water source neitsch et al 2011 2 2 model improvement 2 2 1 the developed components of paddy field water balance this study combines the developments of paddy fields proposed by xie and cui 2011 with those developed by dai et al 2016 and it further improves the simulation of the paddy field et for an improved swat a pothole originally meaning a closed depression area can store water in the related hru the original swat model assumes that paddy rice can grow in the pothole which is assumed to be cone shaped and the surface area varies with changes in the volume of water storage neitsch et al 2011 however according to the true paddy field it is assumed that the area of a paddy field is equal to that of an hru covered by paddy rice xie and cui 2011 a technique with three critical depths the minimum fitting depth h min the maximum fitting depth h max and the maximum allowable depth of impoundment after rainfall h p guo 1997 is incorporated to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields that is the irrigation is triggered when the water depth in the paddy field is less than h min and the net amount of water that needs to be poured into the field is the difference between h max and the current water depth in the paddy field in addition the drainage will occur once the water depth in the paddy field is more than h p the three critical depths change in relation to time during the growth period of the paddy rice mao 1997 where the growth period is divided according to the physiological characteristics of paddy rice growth into different growth stages such as the recovering stage which refers to the time period from transplantation until plants with a newborn tiller tip exposed leaf sheath account for 10 of all plants in the field dai et al 2016 introduced a water utilization coefficient of the canal system to compute the canal seepage loss that supplies shallow aquifers and simultaneously used two methods to calculate the seepage for the ponding and no ponding water stage respectively furthermore dai et al 2016 added the calculation of the lateral flow for paddy fields with the equation described by neitsch et al 2011 the improved swat incorporates the abovementioned developments according to fao 56 allen et al 1998 the et and epmax of paddy rice can be greater than eto during some growth stages however the swat model limits epmax and esmax to eto and the evaporation of water is not included in the et of paddy fields in the original swat model neitsch et al 2011 which causes the et of paddy fields to be underestimated thus in this study we improve the et algorithm by removing the limitation that the epmax of a paddy rice must be less than or equal to eto furthermore a crop coefficient allen et al 1998 is employed together with eto to limit epmax as follows 2 ep max k c et o where k c is the crop coefficient which is obtained from a field test and is different in different growth stages and if field test data are not available k c can be determined with reference to fao 56 and corrected according to local weather and soil moisture conditions the specific method is described by allen et al 1998 moreover the improved swat calculates et with the formula and conditions described by xie and cui 2011 as follows 1 if the paddy field is in an upland state and the hru is not an impounded area or a drained area then 3a et e can e p e s 2 if the paddy field is in a wet state and the hru is impounded then 3b et e can e p e pot where e pot is the evaporation from the water surface on a given day mm in terms of the original swat model es is calculated before the pothole water balance and epot is estimated after infiltration in the pothole when the fields are impounded and water is stored es is zero and if the water depth in a field is very small after infiltration the water depth is smaller or even zero which causes epot to be small or zero this phenomenon will cause the et to be smaller than the true value thus we exchange the simulation order of the epot and infiltration of fields in the improved swat through adjusting the order of subroutines 2 2 2 multi source auto irrigation module the original swat model only uses a single irrigation water source in an irrigation application and the water stored in ponds is not used for irrigation however an irrigation system can use water from more than one source especially in irrigation systems of melon on the vine such as zis mushtaq et al 2007a and b therefore a msaim is added to swat to simulate irrigation applications and a pond is considered one of the types of irrigation water sources with regard to the msaim the improved swat classifies the types of irrigation water sources from the perspective of a sub basin namely a river the pond inside this sub basin which is a comprehensive pond that brings together all ponds in this sub basin a reservoir an aquifer and a source outside the basin then a condition that triggers irrigation application is set for each hru once this occurs the water stored in different water sources specified by the user are fetched to irrigate crops growing in hrus from the first water source to the last one in that order as shown in fig 1 combined with fig 1 there are several explanations described as follows 1 defining irrigation condition and calculating irrigation water requirements the irrigation condition is a condition that triggers automatic irrigation when it occurs multi source auto irrigation begins irrigation water requirement m is the maximum irrigation water amount in a whole irrigation application an hru covered by paddy rice and an hru covered by upland crops have different irrigation conditions and different methods are used for their irrigation water requirement calculations for an hru covered by upland crops an auto wstr is set as its irrigation condition m is a user defined value according to the irrigation experiment for upland crops a detailed description is provided by neitsch et al 2011 for an hru covered by paddy rice the irrigation condition and m are described as follows if the water depth in field h is less than or equal to h min and the daily precipitation on the current day is less than a constant value 5 mm then 4 m i h i m a x h i where m i is the irrigation water requirement on day i mm and h i m a x and h i are the maximum fitting depth and water depth in the field on day i respectively mm here the irrigation condition takes into account both the water depth in the field and the precipitation if it rains the farmers or managers scarcely irrigate the paddy rice in the irrigation systems e g zis 2 specifying water sources and their orders in terms of a sub basin the river inside the sub basin and the pond inside the sub basin are the first and second water sources respectively the river inside the sub basin can be specified on the software interface and the real time irrigation function of the pond is extended in the improved swat model however for the latter water sources e g a reservoir or a source outside the basin a new input file is created to specify them specifically if there are a few reservoirs within the irrigation system and their water can be used for irrigation of the hrus in this sub basin according to distances from small to large between the reservoirs and the sub basin then the reservoirs are designated the third water source the fourth water source etc a source outside the basin is the last water source if its water can be transferred for irrigation of the hrus in this sub basin all hrus belonging to the same sub basin have the same irrigation water sources and orders but the irrigation water sources and orders can be changed according to the characteristics of the hrus for example if a particular hru is only taking water from the reservoir we can only specify the reservoir as its irrigation source on the software interface or set the available water of the river and pond to zero 3 estimating water availability from water sources the water availability from a water source refers to the net amount of water that can reach the field which is converted from the maximum gross amount of water in the water source considering the irrigation efficiency the calculation methods for water availability differ depending on the type of water source as follows if the type of water source is a river then 5a a w t r 86 400 q min β η 1 10 s if the type of water source is the pond inside a sub basin then 5b a v o l β η 1 10 s if the type of water source is a reservoir then 5c a v o l β η 2 10 s if the type of water source is a source outside the basin then m is specified as the available water as follows 5d a m where a is the water availability of a water source on the day of irrigation mm wtr is the river water amount on the day of irrigation which is simulated daily in the model so it can be used directly when calculating the available water for a river m3 q min is the minimum in stream flow which can be obtained from the survey but in the absence of relative information is set as the model default value m3 s 1 vol is the water amount of a reservoir or the pond inside a sub basin on the day of irrigation which is calculated daily and can be obtained directly m3 s is the area of the hru requiring irrigation ha β is the fraction of available water allowed to be used for irrigation which is used to limit irrigation amounts from the pond if the pond needs to retain some water for aquaculture or ecological landscapes and it is obtained according to the experiences of farmers and managers or determined when calibrating the model and η 1 η 2 are the irrigation efficiencies that are the ratios between the net irrigation amount and the gross irrigation amount where η 1 mainly considers water sources that are close to the field such as the river inside a sub basin and the pond inside a sub basin since there is no need for a canal system and is equivalent to the water efficiency in field and η 2 is for the reservoir and source outside the basin taking into account both the water utilization coefficient of the canal system and the water efficiency in the field moreover we can obtain η 1 and η 2 from the management department of the irrigation systems 4 estimating irrigation water deficit for the first water source when the available water a 1 is less than m in an irrigation application the irrigation water deficit is computed as 6a wd 1 m a 1 however for the second and the latter water sources if their available water a k is less than the irrigation water deficit wd k 1 of the previous water source the irrigation water deficit is represented as 6b wd k wd k 1 a k where wd is the irrigation water deficit mm and k k 2 is the water source order number 5 estimating the gross irrigation amount when irrigating crops the irrigation supply is the minimum value between the water availability and the irrigation water requirement or the deficit as follows 7a b 1 m i n a 1 m k 1 7b b k m i n a k wd k 1 k 2 where b is the irrigation supply mm furthermore we can calculate the gross irrigation amount for each source according to the irrigation supply and the irrigation efficiency as follows if the type of water source is the river or pond inside the sub basin then 8a i b η 1 if the type of water source is a reservoir or a source outside the basin then 8b i b η 2 where i is the gross irrigation amount from a water source mm additionally the aiwcs from different water sources can be obtained by summing the gross irrigation amount according to the type of water source 2 3 model application 2 3 1 study area description ysd is a closed basin irrigation system in zis in hubei province china which is a typical melon on the vine system dong et al 2009 fig 2 it has a total drainage area of 43 km2 with elevations ranging from 72 m to 137 m above mean sea level and an average land surface slope of 2 4 the soil in ysd consists of yellow brown earth paddy soil 84 9 yellow brown earth soil 6 99 and others 8 11 and it has a heavy texture and poor drainage six types of land cover are distributed in the ysd paddy rice accounts for 55 72 followed by upland crops 14 36 water 12 2 bare land 10 83 forest 5 66 and urban areas 1 23 thus the paddy rice is the main crop in the study area the climate is a subtropical continental monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 965 mm and a mean annual temperature of 17 c there are numerous medium sized and small ponds that provide water for irrigation in the ysd in addition the water of the zhanghe reservoir is transferred to irrigate crops through the two main canals if required for ysd the zhanghe reservoir is a source outside the basin of course if there is water in the river inside ysd when the crops require irrigation the water of the river is used preferentially 2 3 2 data and model setup three basic spatial data files were utilized for delineating ysd into sub basins and further hrus a digital elevation model dem a soil map and a land cover use map among them the dem with a 25 m resolution was obtained from changjiang river scientific research institute the soil map was obtained by scanning a paper map of soil distribution provided by the local agriculture department of zis the land use map with a resolution of 14 25 m was derived from a 30 m resolution grid format landsat tm image and a 15 m resolution grid format landsat etm image cai 2007 ysd was divided into 10 sub basins fig 2 based on dem and subdivided into 105 hrus determined by the soil land use and slope data where the slope is divided into two categories with a sorting threshold value of 2 the meteorological data including maximum and minimum daily air temperature solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and precipitation from january 2003 to december 2009 were obtained from tuanlin experimental station fig 2 the paddy field management operations including plant growth season fertilization system harvest and kill operations were obtained through surveys from local farmers the paddy rice is transplanted on may 30 and harvested on september 3 referring to xie and cui 2011 the three critical depths in the different growing stages are shown in table 1 and k c table 1 were obtained from tuanlin experimental station the η 1 and η 2 in ysd are 0 90 and 0 65 respectively as provided by tuanlin experimental station in addition the daily discharge series of the outlet of ysd were observed at a temporary hydrometric station in the paddy growth period from may 20 to september 10 from 2005 to 2009 and the daily et was measured during the paddy growth period from 2007 to 2008 through lysimeters of 2 m 2 m in tuanlin experimental station moreover the measured aiwcs from the local sources ponds and rivers and zhanghe reservoir in ysd from 2005 to 2008 were provided by the management bureau of zis finally the msaim is used to simulate irrigation of paddy rice and the types of water sources in each sub basin should be specified beforehand according to the actual situation of ysd the river and pond inside a sub basin are specified as the first and second water source respectively for the hrus belonging to this sub basin and the zhanghe reservoir is the third water source after specifying the types of water sources for hrus the irrigation application will operate as shown in fig 1 2 3 3 model calibration and validation setting 2003 to 2004 as a warm up period we use the observed daily discharge series in the outlet of ysd to calibrate 2005 2007 and validate 2008 2009 the discharge via swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 before calibrating an important step is to replace the executable program swat exe in swat cup with the improved executable program after calibrating and achieving an acceptable simulation for the daily discharge in the calibration period the same modeling environment is applied in the validation period additionally the observed et data sets in the paddy growth period from 2007 to 2008 are used to verify the simulated result of et and we compare the simulated aiwcs from different sources in 2005 2008 with measured values 2 3 4 model evaluation metrics four quantitative statistics are used to evaluate the efficiency of the improved swat model the first one is the nes nash and sutcliffe 1970 which indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fit the 1 1 line the second one is the rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr legates and mccabe 1999 which varies from the optimal value of 0 indicating zero rmse and therefore perfect simulation to a large positive value that shows unsatisfactory performance the third one is the pbias which shows the average tendency of the simulated value to be larger or smaller than the observed value gupta et al 1999 in addition the coefficient of determination r2 is the fourth indicator typically values larger than 0 5 are considered acceptable santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2007 furthermore model performance can be judged based on general performance ratings on a monthly basis as shown in table 2 moriasi et al 2007 which can also be used for a daily time step 3 results 3 1 discharge calibration and validation in the calibration process we first choose three parameters of the initial scs runoff curve number c n 2 the available water capacity of the soil layers s o l a w c and the soil evaporation compensation factor e s c o which are identical to those selected by xie and cui 2011 and proven to be the most sensitive parameters for the model runoff in a few studies immerzeel and droogers 2008 shen et al 2008 referring to cibin et al 2010 and mengistu and sorteberg 2012 we add some additional parameters as the sensitive parameters the base flow recession coefficient a l p h a b f the groundwater delay time g w d e l a y and the surface lag s u r l a g the observed and simulated daily discharges in the paddy growth period of ysd are shown in figs 3 and 4 in the calibration period we display the results in 2007 separately from 2005 to 2006 because a large discharge occurred in 2007 the improved swat model adapts well to the selected basin in terms of discharge in the validation period however in 2005 to 2006 and a period in 2007 the simulated daily discharges do not fit well with the observed values and larger simulation error occurs when the three critical depths change especially at the final tillering and ripening stages the main reason for this phenomenon may be that the model controls irrigation and drainage through three critical depths and assumes that all paddy fields within the hru drain on the same day which is different from the actual situation in fact the farmers may drain the field randomly some on the first day others on the second day and so on which are not unified to further demonstrate the performance of the model simulation the four evaluation criteria described above are calculated for the discharge as shown in table 3 compared with the corresponding indicators in table 2 we observe that the performance rating of the improved swat model is satisfactory or better in the study by xie and cui 2011 only a 2 year 2005 2006 discharge data set was used to test the developed swat model and the precipitation in the paddy growth period for 2005 and 2006 was 358 mm and 371 mm respectively that is xie and cui 2011 tested the developed swat model only in years with low precipitation additionally regarding this study a 5 year 2005 2009 discharge data set was used to test the improved model among these years the precipitation in the paddy growth period for 2007 2008 2009 was 578 mm 597 mm and 503 mm respectively that is the improved swat model was tested in different hydrological years moreover to illustrate whether the improved swat model is superior to the original swat model for ysd in zis we perform a comparative simulation based on the original swat the simulation conditions are identical except that the fraction of potholes in the hrus is set to 0 90 to represent the fraction of paddy fields and a maximum water depth in the pothole p o t v o l x is set to the average of h p in different growing stages of paddy rice with a value of 60 mm in addition an auto wstr of 0 95 is set based on plant water demand for hrus covered by paddy rice as shown in figs 3 and 4 and table 3 the performance of the original swat is not as good as the improved model specifically the original swat underestimates the discharge as almost all the simulated discharge peaks are lower than the observed values and the absolute value of pbias is high in terms of the original swat the main reason for this phenomenon is that the original model sets a p o t v o l x for the whole growth period of paddy rice which does not vary in different growing stages in addition it does not recognize the impoundment and drainage operations of the paddy field but defaults to the impoundment operation so that drainage occurs only when the water depth exceeds the p o t v o l x wang and cui 2011 however in reality the drainage operation takes place at the final tillering stage and the final ripening stage to improve the aerating and temperature conditions li et al 2003 therefore most of the precipitation is stored in the pothole resulting in a significant reduction in discharge 3 2 evapotranspiration verification an hru located in the sub basin of tuanlin experimental station fig 2 was selected to compare its simulated et with the value observed in tuanlin experimental station as shown in fig 5 and table 4 the improved swat model simulates the et of paddy fields well while the simulation of the original swat is unacceptable this result may be because the original model only uses the same method to calculate the et of the paddy field for the ponding water stage and the no ponding water stage and limits that epmax must be less than or equal to eto in addition the evaporation of water is not included in the evapotranspiration of paddy fields in the original swat model neitsch et al 2011 wang and cui 2011 3 3 estimation of agricultural irrigation water consumption the aiwcs of ysd are calculated by the msaim of the improved swat model and the auto irrigation module of the original swat model where we adjust the β of the river and pond to 0 9 for the improved swat the simulated aiwcs from 2005 to 2008 are compared with the measured values as shown in fig 6 in addition the pbais between the simulated values and observed values of aiwc is shown in table 5 we can see that the total aiwc simulated by the improved swat and the measured value are almost identical and the pbias between the simulated aiwcs from different water sources and the measured values are less than 20 however as shown in fig 6 the estimated result is not accurate in 2005 potentially because the precipitation in the paddy growth period was low in that year a drought year the river water and pond water were depleted during irrigation and zhanghe reservoir failed to deliver sufficient water to ysd while the model makes a necessary assumption that zhanghe reservoir as a source outside ysd can meet the irrigation demand furthermore the simulated total aiwc from the original swat is much less than the measured value because the original swat uses an auto wstr to trigger irrigation but in practice farmers irrigate paddy rice once h is less than or equal to h min at which time auto wstr is not reached moreover the lower simulation of aiwc from the original swat is also one of the reasons why the simulated discharge is lower than the observed discharge 4 discussion the improved swat model can simulate the hydrological processes and aiwc in the irrigation systems under different scenarios for example the climate change has led to the changing response of paddy water consumption and irrigation requirement water wang et al 2017 the improved swat model can predict them under climate change which can provide decision support for irrigation managers to develop future water use plans moreover in practice the three critical depths of paddy fields are different in different growing stages and the improved swat model can meet this requirement when simulate the paddy water balance but some crop models such as oryza model bouman et al 2001 in which the h max and h p of paddy fields are constant therefore the paddy water balance can be simulated to be more consistent with the actual situation if the water balance simulation module of the improved swat model is used to replace that of oryza model in addition this paper argues that a distributed hydro agronomic model should be tested by using the et data sets measured at the field scale because the accuracy of the et simulation directly affects the calculation of crop yield letey et al 1985 and et is a main component of the hydrologic cycle therefore compared with xie and cui 2011 we observe the daily et of the paddy field in tuanlin experimental station and compare the simulated et with the observed values as shown in fig 5 the results demonstrate good performance of the et simulation furthermore current simulation models can be used as analytical tools to improve water management in irrigation systems singh et al 2006 such as the ris swat proposed by dai et al 2016 the improved swat model can simulate irrigation application of crops through a msaim and compute aiwcs from different water sources e g rivers ponds and reservoirs from which the managers of irrigation systems can obtain a clear understanding of the aiwc situation concurrently this model can assist researchers and practitioners in investigating water management alternatives and the aiwcs from different water sources of different hydrological years can be simulated so that administrators of the reservoirs can formulate water use plans according to the predicted precipitation in future years for example in ysd if the predicted precipitation is high in one year then the manager of zhanghe reservoir can plan a small amount of water from zhanghe reservoir for ysd in addition the manager may increase the pond project to store rainfall or runoff for irrigation to reduce the water supply pressure of backbone water sources in the case of multi source irrigation this study only considers surface water e g river pond and reservoir and does not involve groundwater irrigation because the study area is located in the irrigation system in southern china where farmers rarely use groundwater for irrigation nevertheless the improved swat model can further consider groundwater as a water source for irrigation and include it in a msaim as shown in fig 1 furthermore this study specifies that the priority order of different water sources for irrigation is rivers ponds reservoirs and sources outside the basin according to the situation of the study area however the improved swat model can adjust the priority order according to the characteristics of the irrigation systems and use more than a river or reservoir to irrigate the same hru through further modification it should be noted that the msaim of the improved swat model still needs further verification studies to construct a comprehensive hydro agronomic simulation tool in this paper the observed aiwc from the local water sources ponds and rivers has not been carried out classified statistics according to the different types of water sources so we do not compare the simulated aiwcs from rivers and ponds respectively with the corresponding observed values however this paper shows the function of a msaim and as far as calibration and testing the improved swat model introduces β of ponds reservoirs and rivers users can adjust β to make the simulated aiwcs from different water sources fit with the corresponding observed values taking ysd as an example if the β of rivers and ponds decreases then the corresponding aiwcs will be cut down so that aiwc from zhanghe reservoir will increase 5 conclusion considering the hydrological characteristics of irrigation systems with paddy rice in southern china we implement improvements on the swat model the paddy field is assumed to be an independent hru rather than a depression in the related hru and a technique with three critical depths is incorporated to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields moreover a crop coefficient is employed together with et0 to limit the epmax of paddy rice and the et of a paddy field is estimated for two types of water storage conditions in particular a msaim is added as one of the components of swat which can estimate the aiwcs from different water sources ysd in the zis in southern china a multi source irrigation system with paddy rice is utilized as the demonstration area to test these improvements the simulated discharge et and aiwc from the improved swat are in good agreement with the corresponding observed values and the improved swat model has much better performance than the original one specifically the improved model estimates aiwcs from different water sources through its msaim the result of the irrigation simulation shows the reasonableness and function of the msaim consequently this study significantly improves the simulation accuracy of swat for hydrological processes in multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice and extends the function of swat to simulate irrigation moreover further measurements are needed to test the improved swat and improvements of other modules should be further considered such as groundwater simulation and crop growth simulation for the purpose of constructing a highly effective tool for the agricultural basin declaration of interest statement we

6866,the purpose of an early warning system ews is to issue warning signals prior to extreme events extreme weather events however are hard to predict due to their chaotic behavior this paper suggests a method for an effective ews for very short term heavy rainfall with machine learning techniques the ews produces a warning signal when it is expected to reach the criterion for a heavy rain advisory within the next 3 h we devised a selective discretization method that converts a subset of continuous input variables to nominal ones meteorological data obtained from automatic weather stations are preprocessed by the selective discretization and principal component analysis as a classifier logistic regression is used to predict whether or not a warning is required a comparative evaluation was performed on the ews models generated by various classifiers the tests were run for 652 locations in south korea from 2007 to 2012 the empirical results showed that the preprocessing methods improved the prediction quality and logistic regression works well on heavy rainfall nowcasting in terms of f measure and equitable threat score keywords early warning system heavy rainfall nowcasting machine learning discretization classification 1 introduction heavy precipitation causes serious losses of life and property and often triggers natural disasters such as landslides and flash floods in south korea a heavy rain advisory is issued when the expected amount of precipitation is over 70 mm in 6 h or 110 mm in 12 h korea meteorological administration 2018 kim et al 2011 reported that the damage caused by heavy rainfall occurred most frequently at these intensities from 2005 to 2009 accurate and timely warning information is needed to minimize the damage an ews produces a warning signal before a dangerous event occurs so that we can prepare for the event alfieri et al 2012 reviewed operational ewss for water related hazards such as floods and landslides in europe an ews for heavy rain using meteorological radar and pluviometers was successfully operated in rio de janeiro heffer 2013 in japan an ews for heavy rain using multi parameter phased array weather radar is tested for use in the tokyo 2020 olympics kobayashi 2018 to the best of our knowledge however there has been no quantitative performance evaluation of ewss for heavy rainfall in this paper an ews for heavy precipitation using meteorological data from automatic weather stations awss is proposed and its performance is measured by various criteria a short term weather forecast within the next 3 h is often referred to as nowcasting glossary of meteorology 2018 and it plays an important role in the crisis management of natural disasters numerical weather prediction is a traditional method to predict precipitation given the current weather conditions it uses mathematical models to simulate the atmosphere and forecasts the future state of the weather this method however is not appropriate for regional nowcasting because of a spin up problem and a low spatial and temporal resolution mecklenburg et al 2000 an alternative approach is needed to complement the numerical predictions on a smaller spatial and temporal scale supervised learning is a machine learning method of creating a mapping between input and output from given examples the mapping is used to predict the output of unseen data and is called a classifier if the output is discrete or a regression function if the output is continuous to illustrate the difference consider a rainfall forecast problem the classifier predicts whether or not it will rain whereas the regression function predicts the expected amount of precipitation in millimeters recently machine learning techniques have been used to forecast rainfall with the progress in the field of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence classifiers can be used in the rain no rain classification liu et al 2001 meyer et al 2016 or the prediction of heavy rainfall lee et al 2012 seo et al 2014 and regression functions can be used to predict the amount of precipitation toth et al 2000 ramírez et al 2005 hong 2008 chattopadhyay and chattopadhyay 2010 nastos et al 2014 and to detect anomalies in meteorological data lee et al 2018 in particular regression functions based on artificial neural networks are prevalently used to predict hydrological time series data for example a nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx was used to forecast flood chang et al 2014 nanda et al 2016 chang et al 2018 and groundwater levels wunsch et al 2018 an adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis was used in real time reservoir operation model hsu et al 2015 flood forecasting chang and tsai 2016 and streamflow forecasting yaseen et al 2017 self organizing map som was used to forecast monthly precipitation rivera et al 2012 and long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru are used to predict combined sewer overflow zhang et al 2018 the performance of a machine learning algorithm is often measured by the accuracy or equivalently the error rate accordingly it is common to evaluate classifiers by the rate of correct classification and regression functions by the mean squared error when data set is highly imbalanced however the overall prediction accuracy may be misleading chawla et al 2002 he and garcia 2009 liu et al 2009 su et al 2006 sun et al 2007 for example seoul the capital of south korea needed heavy rain advisories for 58 h while it did not for the other 52608 hours from 2007 to 2012 a learning algorithm could decide not to issue heavy rain advisories at all so that it can achieve 99 89 accuracy which is meaningless the ews needs a proper performance criterion other than the accuracy in machine learning discretization is the process of converting continuous attributes to nominal ones many studies have reported that learning algorithms can benefit from the discretization due to the enhanced learning speed and predictive accuracy dougherty et al 1995 liu et al 2002 however information loss is inevitable in the discretization process jin et al 2009 which may degrade the performance of specific learning algorithms we devised a discretization method that selectively discretizes attributes to prevent information loss caused by inappropriate discretization of specific numeric attributes this paper investigates the possibility of employing machine learning techniques in constructing an ews for heavy rainfall with a lead time of 3 h meteorological data are preprocessed by the selective discretization and principal component analysis pca and logistic regression is used as a classifier a comparative analysis was conducted on various classifiers with a conventional discretization method the selective discretization pca and their combinations as far as we know our selective discretization which applies discretization to only a few selected input variables was the first attempt and it could help to predict very short term heavy rainfall it is expected that the comparative experiments of the various techniques in this paper will be helpful in constructing a system for predicting various meteorological elements using machine learning techniques the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the ews model for very short term heavy rainfall section 3 provides the details of the data preprocessing methods and logistic regression section 4 presents the experimental setup and results finally section 5 gives a conclusion and discusses future research directions 2 the ews model this section describes the ews model for heavy rainfall nowcasting more precisely the functionality architecture input variables and performance criteria of the ews are discussed 2 1 functionality as mentioned earlier a heavy rain advisory is issued when the precipitation for 6 h is expected to be more than 70 mm or the precipitation for 12 h to be over 110 mm in this work the purpose of the ews is to issue a warning signal when the heavy rain advisory condition is likely to be satisfied within the next 3 h let π t 1 t 2 be the amount of precipitation in millimeters between time t 1 and t 2 and for integer h t h be the time h hours later from the time t if h is positive or earlier if negative at the prediction time t 0 the ews should issue a warning signal if and only if π t 0 3 t 0 3 70 or π t 0 9 t 0 3 110 fig 1 provides an alternative representation of the warning criterion for the ews 2 2 architecture in south korea there are over 600 awss that measure and report weather conditions automatically as shown in fig 2 the stations are located all over the country and provide real time meteorological data a dedicated ews for heavy rainfall nowcasting is constructed for each station the architecture of the ews is depicted in fig 3 meteorological data are preprocessed by selective discretization and principal component analysis and classification is performed by logistic regression the details of each process are described in section 3 2 3 input variables an ews takes input from its connected aws regional meteorological data such as wind temperature humidity atmospheric pressure and the amount of precipitation are provided to the ews every hour the input variables used in this study are listed in table 1 2 4 performance criteria a confusion matrix is typically used to visualize the performance of machine learning algorithms the confusion matrix of the ews is illustrated in table 2 in the matrix true positive tp is the number of correct warnings and false positive fp is the number of incorrect warnings in contrast true negative tn is the number of the correct predictions that did not issue a warning and false negative fn is the number of the incorrect predictions that failed to issue a warning when it was needed in pattern recognition many performance criteria are the functions of the confusion matrix precision and recall are commonly used metrics to quantify the performance of learning algorithms forman 2003 caruana and niculescu mizil 2006 davis and goadrich 2006 and they are defined as precision tp tp fp recall tp tp fn precision denotes the percentage of warning signals that are correct but does not take into account fn recall is the percentage of advisory instances that are correctly classified but false alarms are not taken into account since there is an inverse relationship between the two measures these metrics need to be considered together for example issuing warning signals all the time achieves recall of 100 whereas it reduces precision significantly in most cases f measure which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall provides a balanced measure f measure 2 precision recall precision recall since f measure is often used as the ultimate measure of performance of classifiers forman 2003 it is also used to measure the performance of learning algorithms in imbalanced classification sun et al 2007 liu et al 2009 rainfall forecasts are often verified by the probability of detection pod and the false alarm rate far which are closely related to precision and recall the pod is equivalent to recall and the far equals to 1 precision the threat score ts provides a more balanced measure than the pod and the far by taking account into both fp and fn ts tp tp fp fn qian et al 2016 used the ts for assessing the detection of heavy precipitation area in china and used the pod and the far for providing a better understanding of a given ts value however the ts is sensitive to climatological frequency of events and is not appropriate for the forecasts of rare events due to the number of the correct predictions that occurred by random chance the equitable threat score ets adjusts the ts by excluding the expected number of correct forecasts that happened by chance ets tp α tp fp fn α where α tp fp tp fn tp fp fn tn the ets is often used to assess the quality of forecasts of rare events such as precipitation above a large threshold jolliffe and stephenson 2003 and meyer et al 2016 used the pod far ts and ets for the validation of rainfall area predictions in this work we use f measure and ets to measure the performance of ewss since the f measure is suitable for evaluating the performance of classifiers and the ets is suitable for assessing the quality of forecasts the two criteria are appropriate for forecasting rare events as opposed to accuracy which is highly affected by tn which can be very large in imbalanced classification higher scores of both measures mean better performance and they equal to 1 when all predictions are correct since the two criteria treat fp and fn equally however they can be inappropriate when one is more critical than the other please refer to jolliffe and stephenson 2003 and wilks 2011 for general guidance on forecast verification 3 proposed method this section describes machine learning techniques used in this study input data is preprocessed by selective discretization and principal component analysis pca and logistic regression is employed to predict whether or not a warning is required the preprocessing techniques and logistic regression are applied separately for each station to reflect the characteristics of each site 3 1 nomenclature the nomenclature that would be used in the remainder of this section is given in the list below t x n y n n 1 n the training set with n instances where x n is the m tuple of attribute values each instance has m attributes and y n is the class label of the n th instance when there are k classes y n has values from 0 to k 1 in this work each instance has 23 numeric attributes presented in table 1 and its class label is either 0 advisory or 1 no advisory d t m d v d v 1 v 1 v the v discrete intervals induced from the discretization method d by discretizing the m th attribute of t where 1 m m and d v d v 1 for v 1 2 v c t m d c kv the 2 v the number of classes the number of intervals contingency table derived from t and d t m 3 2 selective discretization discretization partitions continuous attributes to discretized intervals as an example the contingency table for the discretized intervals of precipitation 1 is shown in table 3 one can see that the more the amount of precipitation for the last one hour is the higher the chances are that a heavy rain advisory will be needed after the discretization however the difference between two values within the same interval e g 5 mm and 10 mm will be ignored thus we devised a selective discretization method that performs discretization only on the attributes of which the numerical values are not critical within each interval definition 1 let c kv be the element of the contingency table c t m d i e the number of the instances in t of which the class labels are k and the values of the m th attribute fall into the v th interval the class label k is monotonically predictable on the m th attribute if the sequence of c kv h c hv is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing for all 1 m m for example the class advisory in table 3 is monotonically predictable on precipitation 1 since the advisory ratio c 0 v h c hv is monotonically increasing for all v 65 65 41949 61 61 4714 60 60 1363 94 94 632 77 77 139 or equivalently 0 002 0 013 0 042 0 129 0 356 more precipitation leads to a higher probability of meeting the advisory criterion for heavy rainfall the loss of numerical information is not desirable in predicting class labels that are monotonically predictable on the other hand table 4 shows the contingency table for the discretized intervals of temperature we can see that advisory ratio does not increase or decrease monotonically as temperature increases in this case the discretized value was used instead of the numerical value of the attribute the numerical value of monotonic attributes is important to all class labels it is easy to see that if one class is monotonically predictable the other one is also monotonically predictable in binary classification problems selective discretization first converts all continuous attributes to discrete ones determines which attributes are monotonic and undo the discretization of monotonic attributes selective discretization scheme s is a binary string of length m where the m th character denotes whether the m th attribute is monotonic 1 or not 0 monotonic attributes are used as numeric attributes without discretization the pseudocode for the selective discretization is provided in appendix a the rationales for the selective discretization are that a it is better to let classifiers handle monotonic attributes directly than to give them discretized ones since the discrete values of monotonic attributes cannot fully utilize information between numerical values and class labels and b discretizing attributes that have a nonlinear relationship with class labels can help linear models that have difficulty in processing nonlinear attributes the effectiveness of the selective discretization is supported by the empirical results in section 4 as a discretization method we used the minimum description length mdl method fayyad and irani 1993 which is an entropy based supervised discretization method the class entropy of an instance set t with k class labels is defined as h t k 0 k 1 p t k log p t k where p t k is the proportion of instances in t of which class labels are k the class entropy measures the amount of information needed to specify the classes in t given an interval boundary d on the m th attribute of the instance set t let t 1 be the subset of instances in t with the values of the m th attribute is less than or equal to d and t 2 t t 1 the class information entropy of the partition induced by d h m d t is defined as h m d t t 1 t h t 1 t 2 t h t 2 a binary discretization for the m th attribute is determined by selecting the boundary d min for which h m d min t is minimal among all the possible interval boundaries this binary discretization is applied recursively to both of the partitions induced by d min until the stopping criterion based on the mdl principle is met a detailed account of the stopping criterion can be found in fayyad and irani 1993 liu et al 2002 compared eight discretization methods using eleven benchmark data sets among the methods the mdl method had the highest classification accuracy 3 3 principal component analysis when the number of input variables is unnecessarily large the performance of machine learning algorithms may deteriorate due to the curse of dimensionality theodoridis and koutroumbas 2008 in addition a large number of input variables in machine learning can significantly increase computational time and memory usage and can cause overfitting which causes performance degradation on unseen data there are two types of dimensional reduction techniques to resolve this issue feature extraction and feature selection li et al 2017 feature extraction projects high dimensional attributes to a lower dimensional space while feature selection selects a subset of attributes based on the results of preliminary experiments which are beyond the scope of this paper we decided to use principal component analysis pca as feature extraction because the performance of the pca was better than other dimensional reduction techniques tested on our data when raw input data have little classification power feature extraction tends to be preferred to feature selection abe 2010 li et al 2017 the pca is a feature extraction technique that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert possibly correlated attributes into principal components pcs which are linearly uncorrelated attributes the pca provides an informative view of the data by introducing a new coordinate system and also provides a way to reduce the dimensionality of the data for example pca is widely used to extract features from facial images cavalcanti et al 2013 and can be used in wavelet denoising by discarding insignificant features from feature space yang and ren 2011 let w p w 1 w 2 w m be the p th pc and x n a 1 a 2 a m be the attribute values of the n th instance in a training set t where m is the number of attributes associated with t and a m is the value of the m th attribute for all 1 m m the first pc w 1 is computed so that it has the largest variance w 1 argmax w 1 n x n w 2 the remaining pcs are in turn constructed so that they have the highest variance under the constraint that they should be orthogonal to the previous components the number of pcs is less than or equal to m and the dimensionality of the data is reduced by selecting the first s m pcs without serious loss of information after selecting s pcs x n is converted to x n w 1 x n w 2 x n w s x n the computation of the pcs can be carried out by the covariance method or the singular value decomposition jolliffe 2002 with conventional implementations the time complexity of pca is o m 2 n where m is the number of attributes and n is the number of instances an illustrative example of the pca is shown in fig 4 the most common criterion for choosing s is using the cumulative percentage of total variation i e s is determined as small as possible while the percentage of variation accounted for by the first s pcs is over the specified cutoff percentage although a sensible cutoff lies in the range from 70 to 90 it can be higher or lower depending on the properties of a data set jolliffe 2002 in this study we set the cutoff to 95 through our preliminary experiments lowering the cutoff from 95 to 90 reduced s by 1 7 on average and decreased predictive performance we standardized numerical attributes as standard practice murphy 2012 witten et al 2016 and converted nominal attributes to binary numeric attributes before applying pca an attribute with q categorical values is converted to q binary 0 and 1 attributes each of which indicates whether or not the value of the attribute falls into a certain category since the pca was applied separately to the data of each station the number of used attributes is different for each station 3 4 logistic regression logistic regression is a classifier that is a type of regression analysis for binary classification it assumes a linear relationship between the log odds of the dependent variable and the independent variables logistic regression is used widely in many areas including the medical and social science engineering and econometrics in particular there have been many studies on ewss based on logistic regression for instance bussiere and fratzscher 2006 developed an ews to predict currency crises in emerging markets goldhill and mcnarry 2004 constructed early warning scores to identify ward patients who may become critically ill lokosang et al 2011 established a technique for early warning of food insecurity in post conflict south sudan and verween et al 2007 constructed an ews against biofouling in the cooling water system of basf antwerpen n v a chemical company in belgium logistic regression uses a logistic function to predict binary outcomes from continuous ones produced by regression analysis logistic function is a sigmoid function with the equation f x 1 1 e x where e is the base of the natural logarithm the graph of the logistic function is shown in fig 5 logistic regression substitutes x with a linear function in the feature space such that x α 0 α 1 a 1 α 2 a 2 α m a m where m is the number of attributes α 0 is the intercept coefficient α m is the m th regression coefficient and a m is the value of the m th attribute for all 1 m m the value of the logistic function can be interpreted as the probability that the criterion for a heavy rain advisory will be met within the next 3 h the regression coefficients are generally estimated by the maximum likelihood method hosmer et al 2013 in this work the ridge estimator cessie and houwelingen 1992 is used to prevent overfitting and unstable estimates and nominal attributes are converted to binary numeric attributes just as in pca 4 experiments we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method the experimental setup the comparative analysis of various ews models the effect of the preprocessing methods and the running time analysis of the ews models are presented in this section 4 1 experimental setup we used hourly meteorological data from 652 awss in south korea from 2007 to 2012 the total amount of the data is approximately 3 gb the average number of instances for each station is 46200 while the average number of advisory instances which will satisfy the criterion for a heavy rain advisory within the next 3 h is only 36 a classifier that never predicts a warning achieves 99 9 accuracy instances that met the heavy rainfall criterion without future precipitation i e the advisory instances with the value of precipitation 3 greater than 70 mm or the value of precipitation 9 greater than 110 mm were excluded from the experiment instances with missing values in more than three attributes were also excluded in the evaluation of time series forecasting it is very common to use the last block evaluation which uses the first part of the time series as a training set and the rest as a testing set however cross validation is a more robust method than the last block evaluation for the model selection in time series forecasting bergmeir and benitez 2012 we performed stratified 3 fold cross validations so that each fold contains roughly the same number of advisory instances the cross validation process was repeated for 30 times with different random samples of 3 folds the no free lunch nfl theorem wolpert and macready 1997 states that there is no single learning algorithm that works best on all purposes thus we tested various types of classifiers to determine which one is better suited for very short term heavy rain prediction the classifiers used in the experiments were logistic regression artificial neural network ann 1 nearest neighbor 1 nn aha and kibler 1991 c4 5 quinlan 1993 random forests breiman 2001 libsvm a library for support vector machines chang and lin 2011 smo sequential minimal optimization platt 1999 and ripper repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction cohen 1995 multilayer perceptron mlp is used as a feedforward ann the mlp uses back propagation to train the network rumelhart et al 1986 the universal approximation theorem hornik 1991 states that feedforward networks with as few as a single hidden layer are universal approximators under some general conditions the 1 nn is an instance based learning algorithm that assigns an instance to the class of its closest neighbor in the attribute space in the large sample case the error rate of 1 nn is less than twice the bayes error rate which is the minimum probability of error given the distribution of the data cover and hart 1967 the c4 5 is a decision tree learner that builds a decision tree using the concept of information entropy it generates a tree by recursively choosing the attribute that best differentiates instances of the training set at each node of the tree to avoid overfitting pruning is carried out from leaves to the root the c4 5 was selected for the top 10 algorithms in data mining wu et al 2007 random forests is an ensemble learning technique that constructs a number of decision trees on various subsamples of the training set and takes a majority vote to classify an instance it can be seen as a bagging algorithm breiman 1996 for decision trees that uses only a random subset of attributes for splitting each node the bagging improves the predictive accuracy and helps to avoid overfitting libsvm and smo are support vector machines svms burges 1998 which try to seek the hyperplane that separates training instances according to their class labels with the largest margin the maximum margin hyperplane is expected to have good generalization on unseen data the smo uses the algorithm of platt 1999 and the libsvm uses the smo type method proposed in fan et al 2005 to train svms the ripper is a classifier that learns propositional rules and is designed to perform efficiently on large noisy datasets it uses repeated grow and simplify approach to build a rule set cohen 1995 showed that the ripper was generally better than c4 5 rules quinlan 1993 which derives rules from a decision tree the implementations in the weka waikato environment for knowledge analysis package hall et al 2009 were used for the classifiers the mdl method and pca except the selective discretization method which we implemented in c default settings were used for all programs except ann and libsvm the training time of the ann was reduced from 500 to 50 for speedup and the normalization and the probability estimation options of the libsvm were turned on to improve predictive accuracy the number of available options for each classifier can be found in appendix b 4 2 comparative analysis of various ews models the performance of the proposed method was compared to various ews models the results are summarized in table 5 as stated previously precision and recall have an inverse relationship and f measure and ets are more balanced measures all measures were computed over all stations for each run and the results were averaged over 30 runs when both selective discretization and pca were used together the performances of all classifiers were improved in terms of f measure and ets the proposed method which is the logistic regression with the selective discretization and the pca achieved the highest f measure and ets the ets values of the proposed method is shown by the heat map in fig 6 the performances of the classifiers for each station are compared in table 6 for each classifier the ews model with the highest f measure and ets was selected each cell in table 6 contains win tie loss information according to the wilcoxon signed rank test the test is a non parametric alternative to the paired t test and suitable for comparison of two classifiers demšar 2006 based on the results of 30 runs of the 3 fold cross validation on a station it is decided whether or not one classifier performs significantly better than the other at the station only statistically significant wins and losses are accepted and when there is no significant difference in performance it is counted as a tie the results showed that the proposed method overall outperforms all the others and one can see that there is no notable difference between the f measure and the ets one may wonder why simple logistic regression was superior to other more sophisticated techniques in fact the performances of all the techniques were almost the same in terms of accuracy which is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of classifications the accuracies of all the techniques used in this paper ranged from 99 90 to 99 93 for example the accuracy of the proposed method and the smo model with the lowest ets in table 5 was almost the same at 99 92 the nfl theorem implies that there is a classifier that is appropriate for a particular field and the logistic regression seems to be suited to the ews for very short term heavy rainfall evaluated by f measure and ets 4 3 effect of the preprocessing methods as preprocessing we selectively discretized input variables all continuous variables were first discretized by the mdl method and checked to see if they were monotonic the variables that were not monotonic remained discretized and the discretization of monotonic variables were rolled back table 7 shows the result of selective discretization the number of intervals of each variable and whether or not the variable is selected in the selective discretization are shown the result indicates that time and wind were not helpful in predicting very short term heavy rainfall since the number of intervals is close to one when the number of intervals of a variable is one the variable always has the same value regardless of the weather conditions on the other hand date and temperature were selected to remain discretized over a half of the stations the selected variables have a nonlinear relationship with the very short term heavy rainfall the performance analysis of the selective discretization is shown in table 8 in general the percentage of stations that were improved by the selective discretization was greater than the percentage of stations that were worsened the pca reduces the dimensionality of input variables by introducing a new coordinate system in the experiments the average number of available input variables was 20 8 and it was reduced to 9 6 by the pca when the mdl method was used together the number increased to 22 3 while it decreased to 12 3 in the case that the selective discretization was used instead as stated earlier the number of input variables can be increased by the pca since the nominal to binary filter is applied to nominal variables the performance analysis of the pca is shown in table 9 while logistic regression and svms benefited much from the pca the others did not when selective discretization and pca used together the overall performances of all classifiers were improved as shown in table 5 the performance analysis of the ews models that use both methods in the data preprocessing step is presented in table 10 the percentage of improved stations was greater than the percentage of stations that were worsened by both methods and the wilcoxon signed rank test indicates that more than 60 percent of all stations were significantly improved in logistic regression and smo in logistic regression both the selective discretization and the pca significantly improved predictive accuracy in terms of f measure and ets the effect of the preprocessing methods on the regions in south korea is shown in fig 7 one can see that each method helps to predict very short term heavy rainfall in many regions 4 4 running time analysis of the ews models the computation time of the ews models consists of data preprocessing time training time and testing time the data preprocessing is performed prior to both training and testing therefore the data preprocessing time is independent of the classifier used a running time analysis of the ews models is shown in table 11 although the data processing methods take some additional time they reduce the total computation time in some cases for example the mdl method significantly reduced the training time of decision tree learners by replacing the built in discretization methods of their own and the pca reduced the computation time of some classifiers by decreasing the number of input variables however the mdl method did not match well with the pca since the nominal to binary filter of the pca increased the number of input variables which resulted in long preprocessing time on the other hand the selective discretization matched well with the pca because they provided a good trade off between the computation time and the predictive accuracy one can see that the proposed method which is the logistic regression with the selective discretization and the pca runs at a reasonable speed 5 conclusions and future work in this study various machine learning techniques were applied to the ews for heavy rainfall nowcasting the ews that uses the logistic regression with selective discretization and pca was proposed the selective discretization method selectively discretized input variables that have a nonlinear relationship with the very short term heavy rainfall and the pca reduced the dimensionality of input variables by creating a new coordinate system that provides an informative view of the data the preprocessing methods could improve the prediction quality of the ews further when used together than used separately empirical results indicated that the proposed method works well on the very short term heavy rainfall prediction in terms of f measure and ets it may be more natural to use regression functions than to use classifiers in predicting heavy rainfall and the regression functions showed promising results in our preliminary work however most of the regression functions we tried were slow compared to the classifiers we used in this study our future work aims to further improve both the computation time and the prediction quality of the ewss that use regression functions declaration of interests none acknowledgments we would like to thank dr seung kyu lee and the

6866,the purpose of an early warning system ews is to issue warning signals prior to extreme events extreme weather events however are hard to predict due to their chaotic behavior this paper suggests a method for an effective ews for very short term heavy rainfall with machine learning techniques the ews produces a warning signal when it is expected to reach the criterion for a heavy rain advisory within the next 3 h we devised a selective discretization method that converts a subset of continuous input variables to nominal ones meteorological data obtained from automatic weather stations are preprocessed by the selective discretization and principal component analysis as a classifier logistic regression is used to predict whether or not a warning is required a comparative evaluation was performed on the ews models generated by various classifiers the tests were run for 652 locations in south korea from 2007 to 2012 the empirical results showed that the preprocessing methods improved the prediction quality and logistic regression works well on heavy rainfall nowcasting in terms of f measure and equitable threat score keywords early warning system heavy rainfall nowcasting machine learning discretization classification 1 introduction heavy precipitation causes serious losses of life and property and often triggers natural disasters such as landslides and flash floods in south korea a heavy rain advisory is issued when the expected amount of precipitation is over 70 mm in 6 h or 110 mm in 12 h korea meteorological administration 2018 kim et al 2011 reported that the damage caused by heavy rainfall occurred most frequently at these intensities from 2005 to 2009 accurate and timely warning information is needed to minimize the damage an ews produces a warning signal before a dangerous event occurs so that we can prepare for the event alfieri et al 2012 reviewed operational ewss for water related hazards such as floods and landslides in europe an ews for heavy rain using meteorological radar and pluviometers was successfully operated in rio de janeiro heffer 2013 in japan an ews for heavy rain using multi parameter phased array weather radar is tested for use in the tokyo 2020 olympics kobayashi 2018 to the best of our knowledge however there has been no quantitative performance evaluation of ewss for heavy rainfall in this paper an ews for heavy precipitation using meteorological data from automatic weather stations awss is proposed and its performance is measured by various criteria a short term weather forecast within the next 3 h is often referred to as nowcasting glossary of meteorology 2018 and it plays an important role in the crisis management of natural disasters numerical weather prediction is a traditional method to predict precipitation given the current weather conditions it uses mathematical models to simulate the atmosphere and forecasts the future state of the weather this method however is not appropriate for regional nowcasting because of a spin up problem and a low spatial and temporal resolution mecklenburg et al 2000 an alternative approach is needed to complement the numerical predictions on a smaller spatial and temporal scale supervised learning is a machine learning method of creating a mapping between input and output from given examples the mapping is used to predict the output of unseen data and is called a classifier if the output is discrete or a regression function if the output is continuous to illustrate the difference consider a rainfall forecast problem the classifier predicts whether or not it will rain whereas the regression function predicts the expected amount of precipitation in millimeters recently machine learning techniques have been used to forecast rainfall with the progress in the field of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence classifiers can be used in the rain no rain classification liu et al 2001 meyer et al 2016 or the prediction of heavy rainfall lee et al 2012 seo et al 2014 and regression functions can be used to predict the amount of precipitation toth et al 2000 ramírez et al 2005 hong 2008 chattopadhyay and chattopadhyay 2010 nastos et al 2014 and to detect anomalies in meteorological data lee et al 2018 in particular regression functions based on artificial neural networks are prevalently used to predict hydrological time series data for example a nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx was used to forecast flood chang et al 2014 nanda et al 2016 chang et al 2018 and groundwater levels wunsch et al 2018 an adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis was used in real time reservoir operation model hsu et al 2015 flood forecasting chang and tsai 2016 and streamflow forecasting yaseen et al 2017 self organizing map som was used to forecast monthly precipitation rivera et al 2012 and long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru are used to predict combined sewer overflow zhang et al 2018 the performance of a machine learning algorithm is often measured by the accuracy or equivalently the error rate accordingly it is common to evaluate classifiers by the rate of correct classification and regression functions by the mean squared error when data set is highly imbalanced however the overall prediction accuracy may be misleading chawla et al 2002 he and garcia 2009 liu et al 2009 su et al 2006 sun et al 2007 for example seoul the capital of south korea needed heavy rain advisories for 58 h while it did not for the other 52608 hours from 2007 to 2012 a learning algorithm could decide not to issue heavy rain advisories at all so that it can achieve 99 89 accuracy which is meaningless the ews needs a proper performance criterion other than the accuracy in machine learning discretization is the process of converting continuous attributes to nominal ones many studies have reported that learning algorithms can benefit from the discretization due to the enhanced learning speed and predictive accuracy dougherty et al 1995 liu et al 2002 however information loss is inevitable in the discretization process jin et al 2009 which may degrade the performance of specific learning algorithms we devised a discretization method that selectively discretizes attributes to prevent information loss caused by inappropriate discretization of specific numeric attributes this paper investigates the possibility of employing machine learning techniques in constructing an ews for heavy rainfall with a lead time of 3 h meteorological data are preprocessed by the selective discretization and principal component analysis pca and logistic regression is used as a classifier a comparative analysis was conducted on various classifiers with a conventional discretization method the selective discretization pca and their combinations as far as we know our selective discretization which applies discretization to only a few selected input variables was the first attempt and it could help to predict very short term heavy rainfall it is expected that the comparative experiments of the various techniques in this paper will be helpful in constructing a system for predicting various meteorological elements using machine learning techniques the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the ews model for very short term heavy rainfall section 3 provides the details of the data preprocessing methods and logistic regression section 4 presents the experimental setup and results finally section 5 gives a conclusion and discusses future research directions 2 the ews model this section describes the ews model for heavy rainfall nowcasting more precisely the functionality architecture input variables and performance criteria of the ews are discussed 2 1 functionality as mentioned earlier a heavy rain advisory is issued when the precipitation for 6 h is expected to be more than 70 mm or the precipitation for 12 h to be over 110 mm in this work the purpose of the ews is to issue a warning signal when the heavy rain advisory condition is likely to be satisfied within the next 3 h let π t 1 t 2 be the amount of precipitation in millimeters between time t 1 and t 2 and for integer h t h be the time h hours later from the time t if h is positive or earlier if negative at the prediction time t 0 the ews should issue a warning signal if and only if π t 0 3 t 0 3 70 or π t 0 9 t 0 3 110 fig 1 provides an alternative representation of the warning criterion for the ews 2 2 architecture in south korea there are over 600 awss that measure and report weather conditions automatically as shown in fig 2 the stations are located all over the country and provide real time meteorological data a dedicated ews for heavy rainfall nowcasting is constructed for each station the architecture of the ews is depicted in fig 3 meteorological data are preprocessed by selective discretization and principal component analysis and classification is performed by logistic regression the details of each process are described in section 3 2 3 input variables an ews takes input from its connected aws regional meteorological data such as wind temperature humidity atmospheric pressure and the amount of precipitation are provided to the ews every hour the input variables used in this study are listed in table 1 2 4 performance criteria a confusion matrix is typically used to visualize the performance of machine learning algorithms the confusion matrix of the ews is illustrated in table 2 in the matrix true positive tp is the number of correct warnings and false positive fp is the number of incorrect warnings in contrast true negative tn is the number of the correct predictions that did not issue a warning and false negative fn is the number of the incorrect predictions that failed to issue a warning when it was needed in pattern recognition many performance criteria are the functions of the confusion matrix precision and recall are commonly used metrics to quantify the performance of learning algorithms forman 2003 caruana and niculescu mizil 2006 davis and goadrich 2006 and they are defined as precision tp tp fp recall tp tp fn precision denotes the percentage of warning signals that are correct but does not take into account fn recall is the percentage of advisory instances that are correctly classified but false alarms are not taken into account since there is an inverse relationship between the two measures these metrics need to be considered together for example issuing warning signals all the time achieves recall of 100 whereas it reduces precision significantly in most cases f measure which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall provides a balanced measure f measure 2 precision recall precision recall since f measure is often used as the ultimate measure of performance of classifiers forman 2003 it is also used to measure the performance of learning algorithms in imbalanced classification sun et al 2007 liu et al 2009 rainfall forecasts are often verified by the probability of detection pod and the false alarm rate far which are closely related to precision and recall the pod is equivalent to recall and the far equals to 1 precision the threat score ts provides a more balanced measure than the pod and the far by taking account into both fp and fn ts tp tp fp fn qian et al 2016 used the ts for assessing the detection of heavy precipitation area in china and used the pod and the far for providing a better understanding of a given ts value however the ts is sensitive to climatological frequency of events and is not appropriate for the forecasts of rare events due to the number of the correct predictions that occurred by random chance the equitable threat score ets adjusts the ts by excluding the expected number of correct forecasts that happened by chance ets tp α tp fp fn α where α tp fp tp fn tp fp fn tn the ets is often used to assess the quality of forecasts of rare events such as precipitation above a large threshold jolliffe and stephenson 2003 and meyer et al 2016 used the pod far ts and ets for the validation of rainfall area predictions in this work we use f measure and ets to measure the performance of ewss since the f measure is suitable for evaluating the performance of classifiers and the ets is suitable for assessing the quality of forecasts the two criteria are appropriate for forecasting rare events as opposed to accuracy which is highly affected by tn which can be very large in imbalanced classification higher scores of both measures mean better performance and they equal to 1 when all predictions are correct since the two criteria treat fp and fn equally however they can be inappropriate when one is more critical than the other please refer to jolliffe and stephenson 2003 and wilks 2011 for general guidance on forecast verification 3 proposed method this section describes machine learning techniques used in this study input data is preprocessed by selective discretization and principal component analysis pca and logistic regression is employed to predict whether or not a warning is required the preprocessing techniques and logistic regression are applied separately for each station to reflect the characteristics of each site 3 1 nomenclature the nomenclature that would be used in the remainder of this section is given in the list below t x n y n n 1 n the training set with n instances where x n is the m tuple of attribute values each instance has m attributes and y n is the class label of the n th instance when there are k classes y n has values from 0 to k 1 in this work each instance has 23 numeric attributes presented in table 1 and its class label is either 0 advisory or 1 no advisory d t m d v d v 1 v 1 v the v discrete intervals induced from the discretization method d by discretizing the m th attribute of t where 1 m m and d v d v 1 for v 1 2 v c t m d c kv the 2 v the number of classes the number of intervals contingency table derived from t and d t m 3 2 selective discretization discretization partitions continuous attributes to discretized intervals as an example the contingency table for the discretized intervals of precipitation 1 is shown in table 3 one can see that the more the amount of precipitation for the last one hour is the higher the chances are that a heavy rain advisory will be needed after the discretization however the difference between two values within the same interval e g 5 mm and 10 mm will be ignored thus we devised a selective discretization method that performs discretization only on the attributes of which the numerical values are not critical within each interval definition 1 let c kv be the element of the contingency table c t m d i e the number of the instances in t of which the class labels are k and the values of the m th attribute fall into the v th interval the class label k is monotonically predictable on the m th attribute if the sequence of c kv h c hv is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing for all 1 m m for example the class advisory in table 3 is monotonically predictable on precipitation 1 since the advisory ratio c 0 v h c hv is monotonically increasing for all v 65 65 41949 61 61 4714 60 60 1363 94 94 632 77 77 139 or equivalently 0 002 0 013 0 042 0 129 0 356 more precipitation leads to a higher probability of meeting the advisory criterion for heavy rainfall the loss of numerical information is not desirable in predicting class labels that are monotonically predictable on the other hand table 4 shows the contingency table for the discretized intervals of temperature we can see that advisory ratio does not increase or decrease monotonically as temperature increases in this case the discretized value was used instead of the numerical value of the attribute the numerical value of monotonic attributes is important to all class labels it is easy to see that if one class is monotonically predictable the other one is also monotonically predictable in binary classification problems selective discretization first converts all continuous attributes to discrete ones determines which attributes are monotonic and undo the discretization of monotonic attributes selective discretization scheme s is a binary string of length m where the m th character denotes whether the m th attribute is monotonic 1 or not 0 monotonic attributes are used as numeric attributes without discretization the pseudocode for the selective discretization is provided in appendix a the rationales for the selective discretization are that a it is better to let classifiers handle monotonic attributes directly than to give them discretized ones since the discrete values of monotonic attributes cannot fully utilize information between numerical values and class labels and b discretizing attributes that have a nonlinear relationship with class labels can help linear models that have difficulty in processing nonlinear attributes the effectiveness of the selective discretization is supported by the empirical results in section 4 as a discretization method we used the minimum description length mdl method fayyad and irani 1993 which is an entropy based supervised discretization method the class entropy of an instance set t with k class labels is defined as h t k 0 k 1 p t k log p t k where p t k is the proportion of instances in t of which class labels are k the class entropy measures the amount of information needed to specify the classes in t given an interval boundary d on the m th attribute of the instance set t let t 1 be the subset of instances in t with the values of the m th attribute is less than or equal to d and t 2 t t 1 the class information entropy of the partition induced by d h m d t is defined as h m d t t 1 t h t 1 t 2 t h t 2 a binary discretization for the m th attribute is determined by selecting the boundary d min for which h m d min t is minimal among all the possible interval boundaries this binary discretization is applied recursively to both of the partitions induced by d min until the stopping criterion based on the mdl principle is met a detailed account of the stopping criterion can be found in fayyad and irani 1993 liu et al 2002 compared eight discretization methods using eleven benchmark data sets among the methods the mdl method had the highest classification accuracy 3 3 principal component analysis when the number of input variables is unnecessarily large the performance of machine learning algorithms may deteriorate due to the curse of dimensionality theodoridis and koutroumbas 2008 in addition a large number of input variables in machine learning can significantly increase computational time and memory usage and can cause overfitting which causes performance degradation on unseen data there are two types of dimensional reduction techniques to resolve this issue feature extraction and feature selection li et al 2017 feature extraction projects high dimensional attributes to a lower dimensional space while feature selection selects a subset of attributes based on the results of preliminary experiments which are beyond the scope of this paper we decided to use principal component analysis pca as feature extraction because the performance of the pca was better than other dimensional reduction techniques tested on our data when raw input data have little classification power feature extraction tends to be preferred to feature selection abe 2010 li et al 2017 the pca is a feature extraction technique that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert possibly correlated attributes into principal components pcs which are linearly uncorrelated attributes the pca provides an informative view of the data by introducing a new coordinate system and also provides a way to reduce the dimensionality of the data for example pca is widely used to extract features from facial images cavalcanti et al 2013 and can be used in wavelet denoising by discarding insignificant features from feature space yang and ren 2011 let w p w 1 w 2 w m be the p th pc and x n a 1 a 2 a m be the attribute values of the n th instance in a training set t where m is the number of attributes associated with t and a m is the value of the m th attribute for all 1 m m the first pc w 1 is computed so that it has the largest variance w 1 argmax w 1 n x n w 2 the remaining pcs are in turn constructed so that they have the highest variance under the constraint that they should be orthogonal to the previous components the number of pcs is less than or equal to m and the dimensionality of the data is reduced by selecting the first s m pcs without serious loss of information after selecting s pcs x n is converted to x n w 1 x n w 2 x n w s x n the computation of the pcs can be carried out by the covariance method or the singular value decomposition jolliffe 2002 with conventional implementations the time complexity of pca is o m 2 n where m is the number of attributes and n is the number of instances an illustrative example of the pca is shown in fig 4 the most common criterion for choosing s is using the cumulative percentage of total variation i e s is determined as small as possible while the percentage of variation accounted for by the first s pcs is over the specified cutoff percentage although a sensible cutoff lies in the range from 70 to 90 it can be higher or lower depending on the properties of a data set jolliffe 2002 in this study we set the cutoff to 95 through our preliminary experiments lowering the cutoff from 95 to 90 reduced s by 1 7 on average and decreased predictive performance we standardized numerical attributes as standard practice murphy 2012 witten et al 2016 and converted nominal attributes to binary numeric attributes before applying pca an attribute with q categorical values is converted to q binary 0 and 1 attributes each of which indicates whether or not the value of the attribute falls into a certain category since the pca was applied separately to the data of each station the number of used attributes is different for each station 3 4 logistic regression logistic regression is a classifier that is a type of regression analysis for binary classification it assumes a linear relationship between the log odds of the dependent variable and the independent variables logistic regression is used widely in many areas including the medical and social science engineering and econometrics in particular there have been many studies on ewss based on logistic regression for instance bussiere and fratzscher 2006 developed an ews to predict currency crises in emerging markets goldhill and mcnarry 2004 constructed early warning scores to identify ward patients who may become critically ill lokosang et al 2011 established a technique for early warning of food insecurity in post conflict south sudan and verween et al 2007 constructed an ews against biofouling in the cooling water system of basf antwerpen n v a chemical company in belgium logistic regression uses a logistic function to predict binary outcomes from continuous ones produced by regression analysis logistic function is a sigmoid function with the equation f x 1 1 e x where e is the base of the natural logarithm the graph of the logistic function is shown in fig 5 logistic regression substitutes x with a linear function in the feature space such that x α 0 α 1 a 1 α 2 a 2 α m a m where m is the number of attributes α 0 is the intercept coefficient α m is the m th regression coefficient and a m is the value of the m th attribute for all 1 m m the value of the logistic function can be interpreted as the probability that the criterion for a heavy rain advisory will be met within the next 3 h the regression coefficients are generally estimated by the maximum likelihood method hosmer et al 2013 in this work the ridge estimator cessie and houwelingen 1992 is used to prevent overfitting and unstable estimates and nominal attributes are converted to binary numeric attributes just as in pca 4 experiments we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method the experimental setup the comparative analysis of various ews models the effect of the preprocessing methods and the running time analysis of the ews models are presented in this section 4 1 experimental setup we used hourly meteorological data from 652 awss in south korea from 2007 to 2012 the total amount of the data is approximately 3 gb the average number of instances for each station is 46200 while the average number of advisory instances which will satisfy the criterion for a heavy rain advisory within the next 3 h is only 36 a classifier that never predicts a warning achieves 99 9 accuracy instances that met the heavy rainfall criterion without future precipitation i e the advisory instances with the value of precipitation 3 greater than 70 mm or the value of precipitation 9 greater than 110 mm were excluded from the experiment instances with missing values in more than three attributes were also excluded in the evaluation of time series forecasting it is very common to use the last block evaluation which uses the first part of the time series as a training set and the rest as a testing set however cross validation is a more robust method than the last block evaluation for the model selection in time series forecasting bergmeir and benitez 2012 we performed stratified 3 fold cross validations so that each fold contains roughly the same number of advisory instances the cross validation process was repeated for 30 times with different random samples of 3 folds the no free lunch nfl theorem wolpert and macready 1997 states that there is no single learning algorithm that works best on all purposes thus we tested various types of classifiers to determine which one is better suited for very short term heavy rain prediction the classifiers used in the experiments were logistic regression artificial neural network ann 1 nearest neighbor 1 nn aha and kibler 1991 c4 5 quinlan 1993 random forests breiman 2001 libsvm a library for support vector machines chang and lin 2011 smo sequential minimal optimization platt 1999 and ripper repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction cohen 1995 multilayer perceptron mlp is used as a feedforward ann the mlp uses back propagation to train the network rumelhart et al 1986 the universal approximation theorem hornik 1991 states that feedforward networks with as few as a single hidden layer are universal approximators under some general conditions the 1 nn is an instance based learning algorithm that assigns an instance to the class of its closest neighbor in the attribute space in the large sample case the error rate of 1 nn is less than twice the bayes error rate which is the minimum probability of error given the distribution of the data cover and hart 1967 the c4 5 is a decision tree learner that builds a decision tree using the concept of information entropy it generates a tree by recursively choosing the attribute that best differentiates instances of the training set at each node of the tree to avoid overfitting pruning is carried out from leaves to the root the c4 5 was selected for the top 10 algorithms in data mining wu et al 2007 random forests is an ensemble learning technique that constructs a number of decision trees on various subsamples of the training set and takes a majority vote to classify an instance it can be seen as a bagging algorithm breiman 1996 for decision trees that uses only a random subset of attributes for splitting each node the bagging improves the predictive accuracy and helps to avoid overfitting libsvm and smo are support vector machines svms burges 1998 which try to seek the hyperplane that separates training instances according to their class labels with the largest margin the maximum margin hyperplane is expected to have good generalization on unseen data the smo uses the algorithm of platt 1999 and the libsvm uses the smo type method proposed in fan et al 2005 to train svms the ripper is a classifier that learns propositional rules and is designed to perform efficiently on large noisy datasets it uses repeated grow and simplify approach to build a rule set cohen 1995 showed that the ripper was generally better than c4 5 rules quinlan 1993 which derives rules from a decision tree the implementations in the weka waikato environment for knowledge analysis package hall et al 2009 were used for the classifiers the mdl method and pca except the selective discretization method which we implemented in c default settings were used for all programs except ann and libsvm the training time of the ann was reduced from 500 to 50 for speedup and the normalization and the probability estimation options of the libsvm were turned on to improve predictive accuracy the number of available options for each classifier can be found in appendix b 4 2 comparative analysis of various ews models the performance of the proposed method was compared to various ews models the results are summarized in table 5 as stated previously precision and recall have an inverse relationship and f measure and ets are more balanced measures all measures were computed over all stations for each run and the results were averaged over 30 runs when both selective discretization and pca were used together the performances of all classifiers were improved in terms of f measure and ets the proposed method which is the logistic regression with the selective discretization and the pca achieved the highest f measure and ets the ets values of the proposed method is shown by the heat map in fig 6 the performances of the classifiers for each station are compared in table 6 for each classifier the ews model with the highest f measure and ets was selected each cell in table 6 contains win tie loss information according to the wilcoxon signed rank test the test is a non parametric alternative to the paired t test and suitable for comparison of two classifiers demšar 2006 based on the results of 30 runs of the 3 fold cross validation on a station it is decided whether or not one classifier performs significantly better than the other at the station only statistically significant wins and losses are accepted and when there is no significant difference in performance it is counted as a tie the results showed that the proposed method overall outperforms all the others and one can see that there is no notable difference between the f measure and the ets one may wonder why simple logistic regression was superior to other more sophisticated techniques in fact the performances of all the techniques were almost the same in terms of accuracy which is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of classifications the accuracies of all the techniques used in this paper ranged from 99 90 to 99 93 for example the accuracy of the proposed method and the smo model with the lowest ets in table 5 was almost the same at 99 92 the nfl theorem implies that there is a classifier that is appropriate for a particular field and the logistic regression seems to be suited to the ews for very short term heavy rainfall evaluated by f measure and ets 4 3 effect of the preprocessing methods as preprocessing we selectively discretized input variables all continuous variables were first discretized by the mdl method and checked to see if they were monotonic the variables that were not monotonic remained discretized and the discretization of monotonic variables were rolled back table 7 shows the result of selective discretization the number of intervals of each variable and whether or not the variable is selected in the selective discretization are shown the result indicates that time and wind were not helpful in predicting very short term heavy rainfall since the number of intervals is close to one when the number of intervals of a variable is one the variable always has the same value regardless of the weather conditions on the other hand date and temperature were selected to remain discretized over a half of the stations the selected variables have a nonlinear relationship with the very short term heavy rainfall the performance analysis of the selective discretization is shown in table 8 in general the percentage of stations that were improved by the selective discretization was greater than the percentage of stations that were worsened the pca reduces the dimensionality of input variables by introducing a new coordinate system in the experiments the average number of available input variables was 20 8 and it was reduced to 9 6 by the pca when the mdl method was used together the number increased to 22 3 while it decreased to 12 3 in the case that the selective discretization was used instead as stated earlier the number of input variables can be increased by the pca since the nominal to binary filter is applied to nominal variables the performance analysis of the pca is shown in table 9 while logistic regression and svms benefited much from the pca the others did not when selective discretization and pca used together the overall performances of all classifiers were improved as shown in table 5 the performance analysis of the ews models that use both methods in the data preprocessing step is presented in table 10 the percentage of improved stations was greater than the percentage of stations that were worsened by both methods and the wilcoxon signed rank test indicates that more than 60 percent of all stations were significantly improved in logistic regression and smo in logistic regression both the selective discretization and the pca significantly improved predictive accuracy in terms of f measure and ets the effect of the preprocessing methods on the regions in south korea is shown in fig 7 one can see that each method helps to predict very short term heavy rainfall in many regions 4 4 running time analysis of the ews models the computation time of the ews models consists of data preprocessing time training time and testing time the data preprocessing is performed prior to both training and testing therefore the data preprocessing time is independent of the classifier used a running time analysis of the ews models is shown in table 11 although the data processing methods take some additional time they reduce the total computation time in some cases for example the mdl method significantly reduced the training time of decision tree learners by replacing the built in discretization methods of their own and the pca reduced the computation time of some classifiers by decreasing the number of input variables however the mdl method did not match well with the pca since the nominal to binary filter of the pca increased the number of input variables which resulted in long preprocessing time on the other hand the selective discretization matched well with the pca because they provided a good trade off between the computation time and the predictive accuracy one can see that the proposed method which is the logistic regression with the selective discretization and the pca runs at a reasonable speed 5 conclusions and future work in this study various machine learning techniques were applied to the ews for heavy rainfall nowcasting the ews that uses the logistic regression with selective discretization and pca was proposed the selective discretization method selectively discretized input variables that have a nonlinear relationship with the very short term heavy rainfall and the pca reduced the dimensionality of input variables by creating a new coordinate system that provides an informative view of the data the preprocessing methods could improve the prediction quality of the ews further when used together than used separately empirical results indicated that the proposed method works well on the very short term heavy rainfall prediction in terms of f measure and ets it may be more natural to use regression functions than to use classifiers in predicting heavy rainfall and the regression functions showed promising results in our preliminary work however most of the regression functions we tried were slow compared to the classifiers we used in this study our future work aims to further improve both the computation time and the prediction quality of the ewss that use regression functions declaration of interests none acknowledgments we would like to thank dr seung kyu lee and the

6867,a proposal to increase wastewater infiltration at the kwinana wastewater treatment plant kwtp to an unconfined aquifer near a groundwater flow through wetland the spectacles in western australia prompted a study of the groundwater geochemistry and water levels to identify the water types and to develop a conceptual model for groundwater flow and geochemical evolution within the catchment the water table has dramatically declined e g up to 70 to 90 mm yr over three decades due to the drying climate and increasing demand for groundwater annual rainfall has declined by 9 mm decade on average or about 1 4 of the annual mean over the last three decadeswastewater infiltration began in 1975 and has increased to the current rate of 4 7 thousand cubic meters per day groundwater surface water interactions were interpreted using multivariate statistical analysis of major ion and stable isotope δ18o δd data rainwater infiltrating through the aquifer interacts with carbonate minerals while flowing westward to produce a ca hco3 type of water group 1 below the wetland groundwater has an evaporative signature group 2 that has higher concentrations of tds 1 g l and distinctively higher δ18o 2 5 per mil than groundwater derived from wastewater infiltration group 3 the ratio of ions k cl was used to understand the mixing of water types and to quantify the proportions of wastewater at the site water samples collected in 2014 reveal a high proportion 34 of wastewater within the uppermost 30 m of aquifer and generally decreasing proportions with distance away from the source further investigation of the spectacles water balance and hydrochemistry is needed to optimally manage and prevent degradation of the water quality proposed increases in wastewater recharge may continue to help offset the impact of the drying climate on lake levels keywords managed aquifer recharge australian wetlands wastewater reuse evapoconcentrated groundwater groundwater hydrochemistry deuterium excess 1 introduction recycled water reclaimed water or treated wastewater has become increasingly used in arid regions for agriculture irrigation and industrial purposes it is also used for aquifer recharge for later abstraction for reuse thereby reducing demands on potable sources for non potable purposes bekele et al 2018 page et al 2018 in situations where recycled water recharges groundwater i e managed aquifer recharge mar information is needed regarding the movement and fate of contaminants and pathogens present in the recycled water especially where groundwater is the dominant source of water previous studies have highlighted the need for careful planning and water quality control when implementing mar to avoid adverse effects on groundwater quality hartog and stuyfzand 2017 page et al 2018 vodyanitskii and yakovlev 2016 impacts on groundwater quality from wastewater recharge are rapid salinization due to increased concentrations of sodium and chloride and elevated concentrations of organic micropollutants dissolved organic carbon nitrate and heavy metals and high numbers of pathogenic microorganisms candela et al 2007 foster and chilton 2004 kass et al 2005 toze et al 2010 vodyanitskii and yakovlev 2016 in relation to human health microbial pathogens are the main health concern as a single exposure could lead to serious illness maliva and missimer 2012 determining water quality changes are also relevant where there are ecologically sensitive environments downstream from mar as there could be required protection of aquatic ecosystems with high conservation or ecological values within the target aquifer nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 moreover in aquifers recharged with wastewater there can be vulnerable protected flora and fauna which rely on mar water quality for survival and the impacts of changes to the mar operations must be considered in these situations stuyfzand and van der schans 2018 to assess the fate and impacts of wastewater contaminants it is first necessary to understand the physical extent of the wastewater migration in the subsurface the main processes controlling contaminant concentrations during migration of recycled water into groundwater are mixing sorption ion exchange and microbial degradation and transformation bekele et al 2011b ginige et al 2013 henzler et al 2014 page et al 2010 these processes can contribute to passive water quality treatment during managed aquifer recharge dillon et al 2005 page et al 2010 however the combined effects of these controlling factors on groundwater quality are complicated yu et al 2014 and will be influenced by local geochemical conditions and operating conditions including the choice of recharge method i e infiltration versus well injection the movement and effect of recharged recycled water can vary largely from site to site and thus a range of hydrochemical methods have been developed to trace water sources and determine the temporal and spatial variability of water quality changes in nature solutes and other constituents in groundwater can flow with the bulk movement of groundwater by advection due to a process referred to as forced convection i e driven by hydraulic gradients due to topography and other factors and free convection which refers to flow driven by fluid density contrasts burns et al 2015 domenico and schwartz 1998 interpretations of forced convection in unconfined aquifers typically relies on contouring water table elevations analyzing boundary conditions and modelling to determine flow directions with regard to assessing the potential for free convection in arid and semi arid environments rayleigh number analysis can be used to gain further insight in these environments evaporative concentration of salts can occur at the land surface simmons et al 2001 wooding et al 1997 and is further enhanced by transpiration in settings such as wetlands ashley et al 2013 biggs et al 2010 the onset of free convection is due to the formation of unstable fluid density configurations and depends on the permeability of the geological material and salt fluxes the rayleigh number is a dimensionless parameter which represents the ratio of buoyancy drive forces to viscous and dispersive forces domenico and schwartz 1998 to determine the likelihood of free convection the rayleigh number derived from field data is compared with a critical rayleigh number derived from linear stability analysis to check for exceedance of this value nield and bejan 2006 simmons et al 2001 to interpret migration pathways of groundwater quantitative flux calculations and hydrochemical data are often used these aid in the interpretation of groundwater provenance and mixing heat and dye tracers have also been demonstrated as effective tools for estimating the travel time of infiltrated water in studies of managed aquifer recharge bekele et al 2014 moeck et al 2017 several tracers or indicators are used in combination to provide support or independent lines of evidence for wastewater fluxes in groundwater bajjali et al 2017 gasser et al 2014 quiers et al 2014 tracers such as ions e g boron and chloride isotopes e g δ18o δ2h δ15n no3 and δ13c and organic compounds e g the artificial sweeteners acesulfame k and cyclamate d11 n n diethyl metatoluamide deet pharmaceutical compounds flame retardants fuel related compounds disinfectants solvents caffeine and detergent metabolites are potentially useful as quantitative indicators of the presence or absence of the wastewater source engelhardt et al 2014 henzler et al 2014 hillebrand et al 2015 huntscha et al 2012 katz and griffin 2008 graphical methods and multivariate statistical analysis can aid in analyzing the spatio temporal characteristics of groundwater chemistry masoud 2014 moeck et al 2016 yu et al 2013 these include plotting the interrelationships of different parameters to decide interaction between water and rocks rao et al 2013 srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 and constructing piper and stiff diagrams to interpret the migration and transformation of ions kaehler and belitz 2003 hierarchical cluster analysis hca is used to identify statistically significant clusters based on similarities of water quality characteristics previous studies have analysed the spatial clustering of samples to investigate recharge and pollution sources flow and transport and rock water interactions and to classify water chemistry data cloutier et al 2008 guler et al 2002 lin et al 2012 moeck et al 2016 montcoudiol et al 2015 this study was prompted by a need for greater knowledge of the groundwater flow system and hydrochemistry it has been proposed by the kwtp to discharge a larger volume of wastewater to the aquifer rather than disposal via ocean outfall the impacts of discharging large volumes of wastewater adjacent to a groundwater flow through wetland that undergoes evapotranspiration in a semi arid climate is not fully understood several different methods were applied including standard water table contouring calculating parameters to test for the onset of density dependent fluid flow and dominance of groundwater advection and standard graphical and multivariate statistical methods applied to hydrochemistry data major ion and the stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h water quality and hydrography data from a previous investigation 1995 96 by shams 2000 were compared with more recent measurements conducted for this study to better understand the nature of the system and how it has evolved this study provides estimates of the proportions of recycled water contributed by the kwtp in groundwater spatially relative to the infiltration ponds and the spectacles based on groundwater mixing calculations figs 1 and 2 a discussion is provided on the relative merits of different methods used to analyse the provenance and evolution of groundwater in a mar system in proximity to wetlands under evaporative conditions lastly the implications of increasing the volume of wastewater discharge to the aquifer are discussed in relation to a conceptual model developed for the spectacles 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site in the coastal region of kwinana western australia mean annual rainfall was 720 mm over the last five decades but it has as steadily deceased to 613 mm the average over the last 5 years based on rainfall data from meteorological station 9064 silo 2017 declining water levels in recent years in the coastal aquifer in the kwinana area of up to 3 m between 1995 and 2012 bekele et al 2015a have been attributed to groundwater abstraction due to industrial and agricultural use irrigation of public and private parks and gardens using groundwater and a substantial reduction in the mean annual rainfall ali et al 2012 mcfarlane et al 2015 groundwater in western australia is managed and allocated through licenses and permits issued by the government which clarify the volume of groundwater a license holder is entitled to abstract due to the decline in regional groundwater levels and anticipated reductions to licensed groundwater abstraction in the future there is a growing interest in wastewater reuse the kwinana water reclamation plant supplies microfiltration reverse osmosis treated wastewater to industry however groundwater still comprises 60 of water supply for industry french et al 2015 secondary treated wastewater is discharged to infiltration ponds at the kwinana wastewater treatment plant kwtp which has operated since 1975 marillier et al 2012 shams 2000 wastewater discharge to the aquifer increased from 0 77 ml day in 1975 to 1 1 ml day in 1984 2 2 ml day in 1994 and 3 6 ml day in 2004 nield 2004 daily discharge volumes steadily increased due to development in the kwinana area and is currently capped at 4 7 ml day with any additional wastewater discharged at an ocean outfall government of western australia 2015 mcfarlane et al 2015 the ponds are currently operated in pairs with a maximum infiltration area of approximately 4800 m2 bekele et al 2015a modelling of infiltration from the kwtp reveals that several industries downstream from the ponds have been abstracting a mixture of wastewater and groundwater bekele et al 2015a nield 1999 the concentration of total dissolved solids tds in the treated wastewater has remained fairly stable with average of about 447 mg l bekele et al 2015b the spectacles located approximately 500 m east of the kwtp fig 1 consists of two wetlands that periodically dry and have seasonal maximum water depths usually less than one metre department of water and environmental regulation 2017 the spectacles are listed in the directory of important wetlands in australia due to its ecological and hydrological significance environment australia 2001 a nutrient balance study of the spectacles identified the wetlands as playing a vital role in removing nutrients from a catchment with a history of excessive fertilizer use shams 2000 the peel main drain pmd installed mainly for removing excess water from surface water runoff flows north to south through the spectacles brookes 2009 marillier et al 2012 inflow from the pmd is a component of the water budget for the spectacles shams 2000 but mandogalup swamp which borders it to the north is a buffer for regional flood water storage and helps to reduce peak stormwater discharges entering the spectacles brookes 2009 water levels in the spectacles are mainly controlled by groundwater levels brookes 2009 despite significant water loss from evapotranspiration and decades of infiltrating wastewater 500 m to the west of the spectacles a groundwater dependent wetland in kwinana western australia the wetland is not currently degraded there has been reported temporary faecal contamination in shallow groundwater wells near the spectacles shams 2000 but water from the spectacles was not tested for faecal contamination given the wetland provides habitat for water birds there is no conclusive evidence for wastewater contamination superficial geological formations have been reviewed for the swan coastal plain by davidson 1995 and for the study area e g shams 2000 marillier et al 2012 briefly a layer of sandy silt lacustrine sediments underlies the spectacles and areas immediately adjacent marillier et al 2012 fig 1 beneath the spectacles the geology transitions from tamala limestone in the west to bassendean sand east as shown in fig 2 the tamala limestone is a carbonate aeolianite composed of variably lithified quartz sand shell fragments and minor clayey lenses davidson 1995 sections that are less lithified are referred to as tamala sand marillier et al 2012 tapsell et al 2003 the bassendean sand is composed predominantly of siliceous sands with fine grained black heavy minerals scattered throughout the formation davidson 1995 it conformably overlies the gnangara sand a quartz sand formation with abundant feldspar fig 2 beneath the gnangara sand is the ascot formation a calcarenite with thinly interbedded sand the ascot formation unconformably overlies the osborne formation an aquitard composed of interbedded siltstone and shale davidson 1995 the unconfined superficial aquifer is composed of the uppermost sediments of the coastal plain i e tamala limestone bassendean sand gnangara sand and ascot formations in the study area fig 2 confining beds within the underlying osborne formation separate the superficial aquifer from the deeper leederville aquifer davidson 1995 in the study area regional groundwater flow in the superficial aquifer is generally driven westward to discharge into the indian ocean by hydraulic gradients from the jandakot groundwater mound the crest of the jandakot mound is situated between 2 and 4 km northeast of the spectacles northeast of location a in fig 1 in areas that are not heavily affected by groundwater abstraction groundwater levels show a response to rainfall recharge in june shams 2000 2 2 groundwater level monitoring and estimated abstraction several decades of hydrograph data from wells were obtained from the water information reporting wir department of water and environmental regulation 2017 database and additional data were provided by the water corporation of western australia which operates the infiltration ponds at kwtp in addition the csiro undertook hourly logging of water levels using probes installed in a selection of wells between april and november 2014 well descriptions are provided in appendix a see supplementary information bekele et al 2018 groundwater license allocations i e annual volumes of groundwater that license holders were legally entitled to abstract from the aquifer were mapped to investigate changes in the spatial distribution of well bores pumping large volumes of groundwater at different times 1995 2004 and 2014 pumping was not metered i e measured using a device to monitor water usage and it is not known what portion of the licensed volume of groundwater a license holder abstracted from the aquifer therefore the license allocations provide only an indication of where abstraction likely occurred the collected data were used to interpret temporal variations in the water table in relation to pond infiltration of recycled water at the kwtp between 1987 and 2014 water table contour plots were prepared for the dry and wet seasons in 2014 corresponding to january february and august september respectively shams 2000 showed seasonal hydrograph data from 1995 that revealed water table fluctuations ranged from 0 5 m australian height datum ahd to the west to about 1 m ahd to the east of the spectacles with only minor fluctuations near the infiltration ponds the position of the water table is mainly in the bassendean sand and tamala sand to the east and west of the spectacles respectively shams 2000 fig 2 the analysis of hydraulic gradients and patterns of groundwater flow in the superficial aquifer was repeated for comparison using data collected in 2014 as described in the results the largest most complete sets of hydrography data for this area were for 1995 96 and 2014 therefore these dates were compared the main areas for comparison were hydraulic gradients east of the spectacles and west of the spectacles corresponding to locations a through d in fig 1 2 3 methods for evaluating density related convection the onset of density driven convection can be predicted using the rayleigh number a dimensionless parameter which represents the ratio of buoyancy driven forces to viscous and dispersive forces domenico and schwartz 1998 the rayleigh number indicates favourable conditions for convection when it exceeds a critical value rac nield and bejan 2006 the equation for the saline rayleigh number is as follows nield 1968 sheldon et al 2012 1 ra khg ρ 0 δ s β μ φ d where k is the permeability m2 h is the thickness of the porous layer m g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 ρ0 is the reference fluid density kg m3 taken as the density at top of layer δs is the salinity difference between top and bottom of layer kg m3 β is the saline expansion coefficient m kg3 μ is the dynamic viscosity kg m s φ is the porosity and d is the diffusivity of salt m2 s the mixed convection ratio m defined below is also useful in this analysis as it shows the ratio of buoyance driven flow to advection where m 1 indicates forced convection dominates over free convection and m 1 indicates free convection is the dominant process holzbecher and yusa 1995 holzbecher 1998 2 m k δ ρ g μ v adv where δρ is the maximum density difference kg m3 and v adv is the advective flow velocity m s v adv is the product of hydraulic conductivity and the hydraulic gradient 2 4 collection and analysis of water quality data historical groundwater quality data were evaluated as a precursor to planning the water sampling for 2014 to assess whether trends and seasonality were present as these could have affected the representativeness of the samples the only previous comprehensive study of the hydrochemistry in this area was conducted by shams 2000 before nearly two decades of recharging the aquifer with wastewater the historical data were obtained from the wir database beginning as early as 1974 and ending in 2010 the measurements that are most frequently represented in the dataset are nutrients chloride oxygen ca mg na fe total dissolved solids tds ph and temperature frequent monitoring was conducted in the 1990s and in 2008 2009 with up to several measurements per season the ngmp calculator developed by daughney et al 2010 was used to process the historical data to check for outliers and to calculate summary statistics it also provided insight into the temporal variations of data and potential for assessing seasonality and trends on a per site and per measured parameter basis according to user specified confidence levels twenty three parameters were considered across 43 wells n 989 datasets seasonal variations of groundwater levels from 1974 to 2010 were not significant aspects for designing the water sampling program appendix b see supplementary information bekele et al 2018 water sampling was conducted by the csiro in april autumn and november late spring 2014 to describe the current groundwater provenance and flow patterns surrounding the spectacles north wetland hydrochemistry data were obtained for groundwater rainwater and recycled water from the kwtp infiltration ponds water sampling was conducted using the techniques described in appendix c see supplementary information bekele et al 2018 and provided a dataset of concentrations of major ions nutrients and stable isotopes and measurements of other water quality parameters average rainwater chemistry data for the study area were obtained from crosbie et al 2012 which included seasonal sampling between 2007 and 2011 hydrochemistry data were analysed using traditional plotting methods and multivariate statistics as further described below historical water quality data from july and august 1995 and september 1996 were primarily obtained from the wir database which included major ions nutrients ph and temperature additional nutrient dissolved oxygen do redox potential electrical conductivity ec and stable isotope data were obtained from shams 2000 which reports these data from july august 1995 sampling the abovementioned data are representative of winter and were the most comprehensive historical data that could be used for comparison total alkalinity measurements were used to estimate bicarbonate for preparing piper and stiff diagrams using the following method total alkalinity as caco3 in meq l was equated to the difference between the sum of cations and the sum of anions in meq l when it was not measured it assumes electroneutrality of the water samples both anion and cation analysis had an analytical precision of 1 mg l for the 2014 water samples the precision of the historical water samples is less certain but charge balance for samples with complete analyses were generally less than 5 although the proportions of bicarbonate and carbonate contributing to alkalinity were unknown given ph 8 2 bicarbonate is presumably the dominant species thus the above estimate for total alkalinity as caco3 in meq l derived from the ion balance method was used and converted to mg l of bicarbonate appelo and postma 1993 total alkalinity was reported for some of the analyses and the above method provided a reasonable approximation the more recent groundwater sampling conducted by the csiro in april and november 2014 provided a dataset of major ion nutrient and stable isotope concentrations and other water quality parameters for many of the wells previously sampled in 1995 96 limited surface water sampling from the spectacles was conducted due to resource constraints and lack of evidence to suggest a well mixed system that would allow sampling to be fully representative piper and stiff diagrams were prepared with gw chart winston 2000 and zetaware 2017 software products respectively qgis v 2 16 3 quantum gis development team 2017 was used for plotting spatial distributions of hydrochemical data hierarchical cluster analysis hca was used to identify differences between the 1995 and 2014 water quality datasets the statistical calculations were performed using matlab the selected parameters in this study were ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl po4 p nh4 n ph deuterium oxygen 18 temperature ec do and eh datasets with low charge balance error i e 5 were used for the analysis the parameter no3 n was excluded due to several samples being below the detection limit due to limited sampling of wells for a full range of analytes only the wells shown in table 1 were compared for the parameters indicated firstly the statistical normality of the measured parameters was checked using the matlab skewness function the results showed skewness positive or negatively skewed thus all variables were standardised z scores prior to the classification analysis cloutier et al 2008 lanzante 1996 the measured parameters were shown to have relatively normal distributions based on the kolmogorov smirnov normality test kstest function in matlab q mode hca was used to classify the different samples into clusters according to the similarity of multiple parameters among samples the contributions from different sources to a mixture were quantified using an endmember mixing model a generalised form of the mass balance equations for water and tracers is f 1 f 2 f e 1 c 1 1 f 1 c 2 1 f 2 c e 1 f e c m 1 c 1 2 f 1 c 2 2 f 2 c e 2 f e c m 2 c 1 f 1 c 2 f 2 c e f e c m c 1 n f 1 c 2 n f 2 c e n f e c m n where c tracer concentration f fraction of different source in mixture with subscript m subscripts e and superscripts n refer to the number of endmember and tracers respectively the equations assume conservative mixing first an assessment of possible tracers and endmembers was conducted then the corresponding mass balance equations was solved an earlier study of water quality at the kwtp in relation to the spectacles identified a mixing zone consisting of three types of groundwater characterised by differences in salinity and nutrient levels woodward clyde 2000 in the case of three component mixing the following equations are applicable jenkins et al 1994 liu et al 2017 this approach has been used to define an evaporative isotopic signature in other studies of wastewater recharge in arid regions vanderzalm et al 2011 1 f 1 f 2 f 3 1 2 c 1 1 f 1 c 2 1 f 2 c 3 1 f 3 c t 1 3 c 1 2 f 1 c 2 2 f 2 c 3 2 f 3 c t 2 with solutions for the fractions as follows 4 f 1 c t 1 c 3 1

of groundwater was explored by calculating the deuterium excess d which relates the stables isotopes of deuterium and oxygen 18 the deuterium excess defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o by dansgaard 1964 is a linear relationship that arises due to kinetic conditions that prevail during evaporation and is used as an index of the evaporation effect on the hydrochemistry han et al 2009 a strong correlation between d and tds reveals evaporative concentration yuan et al 2011 as discussed by marfi et al 2004 and han et al 2009 the deuterium excess roughly corresponds with the y intercept of the gmwl of 10 for the global meteoric water line however there are global variations in d excess of precipitation several studies have documented d excess spatial variations in australian precipitation due to humidity and temperature controls guan et al 2013 liu et al 2010 in perth western australia d excess for precipitation is approximately 16 for the winter season when the majority of rainfall occurs liu et al 2010 3 results 3 1 general observations of groundwater flow from contouring a variety of results were analysed to understand groundwater provenance and the dominant controls on groundwater flow in the current system and how water levels responded historically to changes in rainfall abstraction from groundwater pumping in the aquifer and the discharge rate of wastewater from the kwtp from this knowledge a conceptual model for the spectacles was developed which is used in a discussion of the future implications of changes to further drying of the climate and increasing wastewater discharge to the aquifer this section begins with examination of the historical patterns of flow from water table contours the water table contours fig 3 show the north wetland has the characteristics of both a discharge and a flow through lake anderson and munter 1981 groundwater recharges the wetland from the east side of the spectacles and from the water table mound below kwtp west of the spectacles discharge from the wetland occurs in a north westerly and a south westerly direction e g near location d circumventing the water table mound below the kwtp a groundwater mound that develops downgradient from a discharge lake can cause groundwater to reverse flow and enter the lake possibly leading to a stagnation zone anderson and munter 1981 winter 1981 if a stagnation zone downgradient from a discharge lake is present as a continuous boundary or trough of low potentiometric heads it can lead to a lack of seepage or reduced seepage from the lake which effects the water and nutrient budgets winter 1981 while this may be the case east of the infiltration ponds due to the size of the spectacles discharge appears to still occur to the northwest and southwest in the next section the hydrochemistry data are presented to provide further support for a conceptual model for the study area 3 2 interpretation of groundwater provenance groundwater from the wells located close to the infiltration ponds kw and kwtp wells are compositionally similar to wastewater sampled from the infiltration ponds ip only the shallowest well in the sp1 1 series of wells sp1 1d resembles the infiltration pond sample fig 4 table 2 the deeper wells sp1 1 a thru c have much higher concentrations of major ions there is no resemblance to the groundwater samples from wells up gradient east north and northeast of spectacles nor is the composition of these groundwater samples ostensibly related to the lithology as shown in the geologic cross section fig 2 sp1 1b a are slotted in the gnangara sand and ascot formations respectively in comparison sp1 2 a is also slotted in the ascot formation but there is no similarity between these wells based on the distribution of major ions the results from the hca show the 1995 groundwater from sp1 2a b form a separate cluster from sp1 1d fig 5 deeper groundwater with high tds sampled from sp1 1a through 1c on the west side of the spectacles all cluster together the results from cluster analysis for the 2014 data show similar clusters except groundwater from sp1 1d is different from the hydrochemistry of the other wells considered for this analysis the most plausible explanation is that after nearly two decades of wastewater infiltration the shallow section of aquifer intercepted by sp1 1d is more influenced by the presence of wastewater recharge up gradient to the west of it than in 1995 the groundwater samples from sp1 1d 1995 and 2014 are more dilute than deeper groundwater samples from this location sp1 1a thru c table 2 the latter may have derived from evaporative concentration of water in the spectacles north wetland and subsequent infiltration to the water table data to support this concept is provided further below using stable isotope data fig 6 shows a cluster of groundwater samples in group 1 which include jm42 sp2 3a b sp1 3a b sp2 1 and sp2 2a thru c these are located north and east of the spectacles and are labelled as background groundwater or native groundwater resulting from rainfall recharge interactions with carbonate minerals present in the superficial aquifer the sample from jm41 is an outlier which may be due to mineral dissolution and or transpiration group 2 consisting of groundwater samples from deep and intermediate depths in the sp1 1 well series shows differences in the extent of evapoconcentration of groundwater between samples collected in 1995 and 2014 however they form a linear trend corresponding to evapoconcentration of groundwater derived from group 1 in contrast group 3 consists of water sampled from the infiltration pond and groundwater samples from many of the wells on the kwtp site groundwater from sp1 1d sampled in 1995 and 2014 is included in group 3 and suggests that much of this groundwater derives from wastewater recharge rather than mixing with the deeper groundwater that has derived from evapoconcentration the group 3 water samples do not fall along the evapoconcentration trend line the reason for this is not immediately apparent wastewater derives from a variety of sources and has passed through treatment which may have altered the isotopic composition and concentrations of tds a water sample from the spectacles wetland is included for reference in fig 6 and has the isotopic signature of surface water that has undergone transpiration and evapoconcentration 3 3 conservative groundwater mixing model the concentration of tds in fig 6 was useful for identifying possible endmembers for a mixing model however to apply the technique and estimate proportions of different water sources requires independent conservative tracers tds includes ions that are not conserved e g potassium which can be contributed to groundwater by fertilizers and wastewater from humans and animals and is affected by ion exchange and plant uptake appelo and postma 1993 rosen and white 2001 however chloride concentrations for possible endmembers native groundwater from further up gradient and infiltration pond water were similar table 2 making it difficult to distinguish the graph of k cl versus δ18o fig 7 suggests three components for the mixing model 1 native groundwater meaning water which derived from rainfall recharge and flowed through the superficial aquifer the chemical composition of this water plotted on a piper diagram see supplementary information bekele et al 2018 is consistent with other studies of the hydrochemistry of the superficial aquifer bekele et al 2009 department of water 2018 2 wastewater from the kwtp infiltration ponds and 3 evapoconcentrated groundwater the third endmember is the least accurately defined as there is large scatter between the samples from sp1 1a through c from 1995 to obtain greater confidence in the estimated endmember compositions would require a larger dataset of samples collected over time the composition of rainwater crosbie et al 2012 plots near the native groundwater sample the samples from sp1 1a through c from 2014 plot further from the samples taken in 1995 that define the evapoconcentrated endmember there has been a reduction in recharge to groundwater from the spectacles over time due to declining water levels within the wetland consequently groundwater beneath the wetland has reduced salinity and d excess as reflected in the shift in concentrations from 1995 to 2014 in the sp1 1 bores water samples from wells kw5 kw6 kw13 and some of the samples from kwtp1 and kwtp2 in april and or november 2014 were excluded from the estimation of source water components these samples did not plot within the three end member mixing model fig 7 the scatter of these points surrounding the infiltration pond endmember is due to there being only two water samples to define this endmember ideally there should be more samples from the infiltration ponds to show seasonal variations and provide uncertainty for this endmember the proportion of wastewater in the kw and kwtp wells between the infiltration ponds and the north wetland of the spectacles varies between 45 kwtp2d and 100 kwtp1 s i d wells based on the three component model with mainly native groundwater as an additional component fig 8 in the sp1 1 series of wells the proportion of evapoconcentrated groundwater increases with depth of the well screen 39 50 the shallowest well in this series sp1 1d has the highest proportion of wastewater 34 compared with the deeper wells at this location there was only one sample collected from the spectacles and the mixing model suggests 9 of its composition derived from wastewater given uncertainty in the endmember compositions the wastewater content of this sample is likely to be within the margin of error 3 4 dominant controls on water table variations there has been a dramatic decline in the water table historically trend lines through the hydrographs for jm42 je22c anketell 1 and 1a reveal declining water levels of the order of 70 to 90 mm yr over three decades fig 9 in part this is due to an increase in demand for groundwater due to development e g allocations of groundwater 100 kl yr however the area has experienced significant drying between 1987 and 2016 the mean annual rainfall was 675 mm but it has declined by 9 mm decade or about 1 4 of the annual mean over this period fig 10 wastewater recharge to the superficial aquifer increased from 3 to 4 ml between years 2004 and 2008 and then stabilised between years 2008 and 2011 from 2012 to 2014 recharge from both mean annual rainfall increased average rainfall was 675 mm and wastewater increased from 4 to 4 7 ml day but the water level in the spectacles continued to decline locally water levels near the spectacles are highly responsive to changes in wastewater discharge to the aquifer the hydrographs for sp1 1c and sp1 1d located between the infiltration ponds and the spectacles show variations in response to wastewater fig 10 labels a and b observed differences in rates of water table decline suggest that water levels in wells nearest the spectacles on its north and east margin i e t140 o and sp1 2b c compared with those farther away in these directions are being bolstered by infiltrated wastewater downstream despite absolute water level changes due to spatially heterogeneous groundwater abstraction and changes in wastewater recharge to the aquifer groundwater flow directions have remained relatively unchanged over time fig 3 depicts groundwater contour maps for two different seasons to compare years 1995 and 2014 in general comparing these years the groundwater flow directions are roughly the same at all four locations a to d the hydraulic gradients were higher in 2014 than that in 1995 due to the increased volume of wastewater discharge to the aquifer the hydraulic gradients for summer were reasonably similar to winter values as shown in table 3 in summary near the spectacles water table variations have been largely influenced by wastewater discharge and rainfall variations and to lesser extent abstraction due to pumping from the aquifer which is largely occurring farther away from the wetland in this semi arid climate fluid density variations arising from evaporative concentration of surface water could affect local scale flow beneath the spectacles this was explored using the following calculations the rayleigh number was calculated based on field values k h φ and physical constants from the literature β g d from sheldon et al 2012 μ ρ 0 from guo and langevin 2002 k 1 33e 11 m2 10 m day h 30 m g 9 81 m s2 ρ 0 1000 kg m3 δs 0 79 kg m3 based on the salinity difference estimated from groundwater tds sampled from wells screened near the top and bottom of the aquifer sp1 1d and sp1 1a respectively β 0 00075 m kg3 μ 0 9e 3 kg m s at 25 c haynes 2016 φ 0 3 and d 1e 9 m2 s at 25 c the critical rayleigh number ra c is a value that is typically derived from stability analysis according to nield and bejan 2006 the ra c value is of the order of 40 or less depending on the assumptions for the salinity gradient and pressure the calculated value of ra is 8606 which greatly exceeds the criterion for free convection relevant to the spectacles wetland system the exact value is not essential for this analysis due to the considerably larger value of ra derived for the site this shows the fluid density contrast would produce instability that could lead to free convection in proximity to the spectacles locations b and c values for the mixed convection ratio m are 0 15 and 0 1 respectively based on the hydraulic gradients from 2014 and assuming δ ρ is 0 6 kg m3 based on density derived from tds measurements from sp1 1a and sp1 2a and a hydraulic conductivity of 10 m day these values of m suggest advective flow is more likely to dominate than free convection the hydraulic gradient would need to be lower than 7 0e 4 to produce a value of m 1 force of advective flow comparable to the buoyancy force of free convection hydraulic gradients for 2014 and 1995 96 are not nearly this low table 3 alternatively to have free convection dominate m 1 the value of δ ρ would need to be 4 kg m3 7 larger than measured for the range of hydraulic conductivities measured above these results indicate groundwater flow by advection dominates over free convection 4 discussion 4 1 conceptual model for the spectacles the hydrochemistry data suggest a conceptual model for the dynamics of groundwater flow near the spectacles wetland fig 11 depicts a two dimensional cross section along a representative flow line following the regional hydraulic gradient from east to west and the local flow paths surrounding the spectacles north wetland different hydrogeological settings in the aquifer are depicted and labelled with typical water types group 1 2 or 3 the superficial aquifer is comprised of carbonate minerals rainwater infiltrates through this aquifer and interacts with the carbonate minerals while flowing westward to produce a ca hco3 type of water indicated by group 1 department of water 2018 supplementary information bekele et al 2018 below the spectacles there is groundwater with an evaporative signature group 2 that separates group 1 and group 3 water types the water type of group 2 contains higher concentrations of tds 1 g l and distinctively higher δ18o 2 5 per mil than groundwater derived from wastewater infiltration group 3 fig 7 in the conceptual model evaporative concentration of water occurs in the north wetland and shallow groundwater beneath it that sinks and migrates westward below a plume of fresher groundwater derived from the wastewater infiltration ponds the groundwater with a high evaporative concentration signal appears localised to an area of the superficial aquifer between the infiltration ponds and the north wetland of the spectacles it is unclear whether this extends westward at the bottom of the superficial aquifer as there are no bores that intersect this deeper groundwater the force of regional groundwater flow westward is possibly opposed by the influx of wastewater below the ponds at this location infiltrated wastewater being less dense than groundwater intercepts the shallow slotted interval of sp1 1d while denser groundwater sinks deeper and flows westward as suggested by the hydrochemistry of groundwater from sp1 1a thru 1c 4 2 comparison of methods used to infer groundwater dynamics this study provides an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods to characterise the groundwater dynamics in coastal aquifers near wastewater infiltration operations some methods provide more of a qualitative understanding of flow and origin of water sources while others provide more of a quantitative understanding effective management plans for surface water ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions often need both qualitative and quantitative insights for sustainable water use li et al 2016 su et al 2016 whilst standard water table contouring allows one to generalise about the directions of flow there would need to be a considerable data set of water level elevations and possibly for different seasons depending on the amount of annual variability to compute flow vectors in greater detail additionally using flow net analysis and permeability data one could estimate groundwater flow rates using darcy s law assuming two dimensional flow through a cross sectional area either manually or using groundwater modelling software such as modflow one can do the calculations to assess groundwater flow rates however it relies on assumptions about the aquifer heterogeneity estimates of recharge and evapotranspiration to effectively model fluxes bekele et al 2015a doble et al 2017 while the regional lithology of the coastal aquifer near the spectacles has been represented using uniform properties at a large scale e g marillier et al 2012 there may be clay lenses kaolinitic mud mixed with sand and other heterogeneities arising from processes in wetland basins semeniuk and semeniuk 2004 that are important for local scale movement of water in and around the wetland the evapotranspiration conditions existing in the coastal plain of western australia requires further consideration of salinity effects on the density of groundwater in some cases requiring density correct hydraulic heads prior to interpreting flow directions from water level data marimuthu et al 2005 the rayleigh number and the mixed convection ratio calculations were useful to gain further insight into potential flow from density related effects the stables isotopes of water deuterium and oxygen 18 were shown to be powerful tracers however it was by calculating the deuterium excess which relates these two isotopes and the ratio of conservative ions potassium and chloride that greater distinction between different sources of water and their provenance could be determined novel methods have recently been developed to aid in understanding the water balance and groundwater dependency of wetland ecosystems for example an isotope approach that utilises a δ18o and δ2h mixing model to calculate the proportion of local groundwater and precipitation in superficial pore water samples from wetlands aided the interpretation of an aerial thermal imaging survey of groundwater seepage isokangas et al 2017 cao et al 2018 assessed seasonal changes in groundwater inflow fluxes to a wetland system using isotope mass balance calculations isotopic fractionation operating during evaporation modifies the isotopic composition furthermore stagnant zones in wetlands will have enrichment in the heavier isotopes of δ18o and δ2h due to a high ratio of evaporation to inflow which can provide important information on the residence time and preferential flow of water in and around wetlands ronkanen and klove 2007 this isotopic signature occurs in the wetland as well as in the wastewater infiltration pond for this reason another independent tracer based on the ratio of ions k cl was needed to understand the mixing of water types and to quantify the proportions of wastewater at the spectacles site the classification of water chemistry data using piper and stiff diagrams and the identification of statistically significant clusters using hca were largely to obtain a qualitative understanding of the water sources as a starting point for doing the mixing calculations in studies that quantify wastewater recharge to aquifers a range of organic micropollutants existing in the wastewater stream have been used as passive tracers e g henzler et al 2014 hillebrand et al 2015 rather than conducting controlled tracer tests that involve injecting or infiltrating a known quantity of tracer into the flow system and monitoring for breakthrough downstream e g bekele et al 2014 ronkanen and klove 2007 used potassium bromide in winter and potassium iodide in summer to assess seasonal differences in the plant uptake of bromide hillebrand et al 2015 injected three tracers uranine acesulfame and carbamazepine as reference to compare with the fate of micropollutants in wastewater that are more reactive atenolol caffeine cyclamate ibuprofen and paracetamol the costs and resources required to analyse routinely for micropollutants can be prohibitive for some studies and the water sampling program for the spectacles does not include micropollutants department of water and environmental regulation 2017 according to a recent study of trends in water analysis of organic micropollutants schmidt 2018 included cost effective in situ or on site analysis by sensors as one of many possible areas for further research high resolution monitoring for water quality changes in aquatic systems is not routinely used but methods of adaptive sampling based on real time monitoring data are being developed for nutrients blaen et al 2016 and could be extended to micropollutants schmidt 2018 less cost for analytical methods and greater throughput of samples due to automation are cited among the major advantages of the latest improvements in analytical methods for organic micropollutants huntscha et al 2012 schmidt 2018 a major advancement in the quantification of micropollutants to support environmental management is the ability to simultaneously detect a range of micropollutants e g pesticides biocides pharmaceuticals corrosion inhibitors and artificial sweeteners at low concentrations e g 10 ng l as demonstrated by huntscha et al 2012 a newly developed automated enrichment method developed by huntscha et al 2012 involves online solid phase extraction coupled to a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer online spe hplc ms ms method the advantages of this method include smaller sample volumes due to enrichment of the sample using solid phase extraction now conducted online rather than manually offline and shorter total analysis times these improvements in analytical methods were critical in obtaining greater temporal resolution of pesticide risk in streams in a study by spycher et al 2018 where several hundred micropollutants were measured which had highly seasonal dynamic concentration profiles the benefits of obtaining highly resolved temporal concentration data in dynamic systems is that it facilitates studies of chemical exposure in aquatic ecosystems related to episodic peak concentration releases versus regular releases of micropollutants e g munz 2017 stamm 2016 the term ecohydrological interfaces was recently introduced to describe the complex interactions of hydrological biochemical and ecological processes for example groundwater surface water interfaces such as between a wetland and the benthic zone krause et al 2017 critical to this area of research is the use of innovative technologies to detect and trace fluxes of water energy and matter across ecohydrological interfaces to study dynamic ecosystem behaviour krause et al 2017 kraus et al 2017 demonstrated the valuable contribution of deploying in situ high frequency nitrate sensors to quantify nutrient concentrations and fluxes in a tidally affected river that receives treated wastewater continuous measurements revealed a significant benthic source of nitrate from sediments downstream of the wastewater treatment plant as suggested by kraus et al 2017 connectivity with a wetland habitat would add another layer of complexity to unravelling the sources and movement of nutrients within the system 4 3 future implications the rayleigh and mixed convection parameter calculations indicate the sensitivity of the system to changes such as increased aridity greater discharge of wastewater to the aquifer and or general lowering of the regional water table near the spectacles salinity gradients can increase or decrease as a result of greater evaporation and more dilute wastewater recharge to the aquifer in contrast to the plume of evapoconcentrated groundwater the hydraulic gradients can change due to general lowering of the water table due to greater abstraction up gradient the current system appears to have a subsurface dam created by the recharge of wastewater and this could be jeopardized if there are modifications as described above the result of greater dominance of flow by convection over advection could affect the water balance and quality of water in the spectacles modification of the local pore water flow has implications for plant growth nutrient exchange and other wetland ecosystem functions shen et al 2015 xin et al 2017 5 conclusions a groundwater assessment of a shallow wetland area in an unconfined aquifer adjacent to infiltration ponds for wastewater based on hydrochemistry and water level data showed three recognizable water sources wastewater recharge from the ponds native groundwater from rainfall recharge interaction with the carbonate aquifer and evapoconcentrated water derived from the wetland the latter is characterised by a high concentration of tds 1019 mg l on average and deuterium excess values that are consistent with the signature of evapoconcentrated water these results are supported by multivariate statistical analysis hca and stable isotope data the analysis of trends in water level data and hydraulic gradient provided further support for the groundwater vectors in and around the spectacles due to the drying climate wetlands in the south west of western australia face an uncertain future semeniuk and semeniuk 2013 moreover it is recognised in other parts of the world that an understanding of the interactions between groundwater and the wetlands is needed to protect these ecosystems particularly in arid and semi arid regions li et al 2016 su et al 2016 a recent large scale survey of wetlands globally by thorslund et al 2017 identified a continued and rapid decline in wetland areas despite many natural functions they provide that benefit society e g biodiversity support carbon sequestration water quality protection contamination removal by natural attenuation processes flood regulation and groundwater level and soil moisture regulation at the spectacles a unique hydraulic setting arises due to the juxtaposition of the kwtp infiltration ponds discharge of wastewater to the unconfined aquifer and the flow through of regional groundwater which slows the flow of regional groundwater such that water levels are maintained in the wetland in essence managed aquifer recharge assists in forming a subsurface dam that raises the water table beneath the wetlands the results are valuable for planning of other mar study sites such as a proposal for perry lakes in western australia which is similarly facing drying conditions bekele et al 2011a mcfarlane et al 2009 despite the increase in daily volumes of wastewater infiltrated to the superficial aquifer at the kwtp near the spectacles over the past three decades water depths in the north wetland have steadily declined and maximum water depths halved during this period the reduction in water levels and increased vegetation in the wetland could lead to the wetland becoming a recharge basin that is either entirely or partially perched above the water table rather than the combined flow through discharge wetland basin reduced flushing of the spectacles may increase salinization and nutrients in the wetland if the pmd fails to deliver sufficient volumes of inflow from surface runoff upstream while this could be used to support proposals to increase the discharge of wastewater to the infiltration ponds the hydrodynamics is complex and should be further investigated to optimally manage and prevent degradation of the water quality the calculations of rayleigh and mixing convection parameters were used to illustrate the sensitivity of the system to changes such as increased aridity greater discharge of wastewater to the aquifer and or general lowering of the regional water table near the spectacles greater knowledge of the spatial extent of the evapoconcentrated groundwater intercepted by the deep and intermediate sp1 1 wells is needed to determine whether it plays a role in impeding the eastward flow of wastewater by virtue of being denser than the surrounding groundwater additionally whether this would be compromised if rates of wastewater recharge were increased as wastewater has lower concentrations of tds than the evapoconcentrated groundwater this paper demonstrates the benefits of applying different qualitative and quantitative methods to effectively manage surface water ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions for sustainable water use generalised fluid flow directions were obtained by water table contouring given there was insufficient data to develop a well calibrated flow and transport model density related effects on flow directions were investigated with theoretical calculations whilst standard graphical and multivariate statistical methods provided understanding of water sources as a starting point for mixing calculations the stables isotopes of water deuterium and oxygen 18 were shown to be powerful tracers however it was by calculating the deuterium excess which relates these two isotopes and the ratio of potassium and chloride that greater distinction between different sources of water and their provenance could be determined acknowledgements this research was funded by the australian water

6867,a proposal to increase wastewater infiltration at the kwinana wastewater treatment plant kwtp to an unconfined aquifer near a groundwater flow through wetland the spectacles in western australia prompted a study of the groundwater geochemistry and water levels to identify the water types and to develop a conceptual model for groundwater flow and geochemical evolution within the catchment the water table has dramatically declined e g up to 70 to 90 mm yr over three decades due to the drying climate and increasing demand for groundwater annual rainfall has declined by 9 mm decade on average or about 1 4 of the annual mean over the last three decadeswastewater infiltration began in 1975 and has increased to the current rate of 4 7 thousand cubic meters per day groundwater surface water interactions were interpreted using multivariate statistical analysis of major ion and stable isotope δ18o δd data rainwater infiltrating through the aquifer interacts with carbonate minerals while flowing westward to produce a ca hco3 type of water group 1 below the wetland groundwater has an evaporative signature group 2 that has higher concentrations of tds 1 g l and distinctively higher δ18o 2 5 per mil than groundwater derived from wastewater infiltration group 3 the ratio of ions k cl was used to understand the mixing of water types and to quantify the proportions of wastewater at the site water samples collected in 2014 reveal a high proportion 34 of wastewater within the uppermost 30 m of aquifer and generally decreasing proportions with distance away from the source further investigation of the spectacles water balance and hydrochemistry is needed to optimally manage and prevent degradation of the water quality proposed increases in wastewater recharge may continue to help offset the impact of the drying climate on lake levels keywords managed aquifer recharge australian wetlands wastewater reuse evapoconcentrated groundwater groundwater hydrochemistry deuterium excess 1 introduction recycled water reclaimed water or treated wastewater has become increasingly used in arid regions for agriculture irrigation and industrial purposes it is also used for aquifer recharge for later abstraction for reuse thereby reducing demands on potable sources for non potable purposes bekele et al 2018 page et al 2018 in situations where recycled water recharges groundwater i e managed aquifer recharge mar information is needed regarding the movement and fate of contaminants and pathogens present in the recycled water especially where groundwater is the dominant source of water previous studies have highlighted the need for careful planning and water quality control when implementing mar to avoid adverse effects on groundwater quality hartog and stuyfzand 2017 page et al 2018 vodyanitskii and yakovlev 2016 impacts on groundwater quality from wastewater recharge are rapid salinization due to increased concentrations of sodium and chloride and elevated concentrations of organic micropollutants dissolved organic carbon nitrate and heavy metals and high numbers of pathogenic microorganisms candela et al 2007 foster and chilton 2004 kass et al 2005 toze et al 2010 vodyanitskii and yakovlev 2016 in relation to human health microbial pathogens are the main health concern as a single exposure could lead to serious illness maliva and missimer 2012 determining water quality changes are also relevant where there are ecologically sensitive environments downstream from mar as there could be required protection of aquatic ecosystems with high conservation or ecological values within the target aquifer nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 moreover in aquifers recharged with wastewater there can be vulnerable protected flora and fauna which rely on mar water quality for survival and the impacts of changes to the mar operations must be considered in these situations stuyfzand and van der schans 2018 to assess the fate and impacts of wastewater contaminants it is first necessary to understand the physical extent of the wastewater migration in the subsurface the main processes controlling contaminant concentrations during migration of recycled water into groundwater are mixing sorption ion exchange and microbial degradation and transformation bekele et al 2011b ginige et al 2013 henzler et al 2014 page et al 2010 these processes can contribute to passive water quality treatment during managed aquifer recharge dillon et al 2005 page et al 2010 however the combined effects of these controlling factors on groundwater quality are complicated yu et al 2014 and will be influenced by local geochemical conditions and operating conditions including the choice of recharge method i e infiltration versus well injection the movement and effect of recharged recycled water can vary largely from site to site and thus a range of hydrochemical methods have been developed to trace water sources and determine the temporal and spatial variability of water quality changes in nature solutes and other constituents in groundwater can flow with the bulk movement of groundwater by advection due to a process referred to as forced convection i e driven by hydraulic gradients due to topography and other factors and free convection which refers to flow driven by fluid density contrasts burns et al 2015 domenico and schwartz 1998 interpretations of forced convection in unconfined aquifers typically relies on contouring water table elevations analyzing boundary conditions and modelling to determine flow directions with regard to assessing the potential for free convection in arid and semi arid environments rayleigh number analysis can be used to gain further insight in these environments evaporative concentration of salts can occur at the land surface simmons et al 2001 wooding et al 1997 and is further enhanced by transpiration in settings such as wetlands ashley et al 2013 biggs et al 2010 the onset of free convection is due to the formation of unstable fluid density configurations and depends on the permeability of the geological material and salt fluxes the rayleigh number is a dimensionless parameter which represents the ratio of buoyancy drive forces to viscous and dispersive forces domenico and schwartz 1998 to determine the likelihood of free convection the rayleigh number derived from field data is compared with a critical rayleigh number derived from linear stability analysis to check for exceedance of this value nield and bejan 2006 simmons et al 2001 to interpret migration pathways of groundwater quantitative flux calculations and hydrochemical data are often used these aid in the interpretation of groundwater provenance and mixing heat and dye tracers have also been demonstrated as effective tools for estimating the travel time of infiltrated water in studies of managed aquifer recharge bekele et al 2014 moeck et al 2017 several tracers or indicators are used in combination to provide support or independent lines of evidence for wastewater fluxes in groundwater bajjali et al 2017 gasser et al 2014 quiers et al 2014 tracers such as ions e g boron and chloride isotopes e g

compounds disinfectants solvents caffeine and detergent metabolites are potentially useful as quantitative indicators of the presence or absence of the wastewater source engelhardt et al 2014 henzler et al 2014 hillebrand et al 2015 huntscha et al 2012 katz and griffin 2008 graphical methods and multivariate statistical analysis can aid in analyzing the spatio temporal characteristics of groundwater chemistry masoud 2014 moeck et al 2016 yu et al 2013 these include plotting the interrelationships of different parameters to decide interaction between water and rocks rao et al 2013 srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 and constructing piper and stiff diagrams to interpret the migration and transformation of ions kaehler and belitz 2003 hierarchical cluster analysis hca is used to identify statistically significant clusters based on similarities of water quality characteristics previous studies have analysed the spatial clustering of samples to investigate recharge and pollution sources flow and transport and rock water interactions and to classify water chemistry data cloutier et al 2008 guler et al 2002 lin et al 2012 moeck et al 2016 montcoudiol et al 2015 this study was prompted by a need for greater knowledge of the groundwater flow system and hydrochemistry it has been proposed by the kwtp to discharge a larger volume of wastewater to the aquifer rather than disposal via ocean outfall the impacts of discharging large volumes of wastewater adjacent to a groundwater flow through wetland that undergoes evapotranspiration in a semi arid climate is not fully understood several different methods were applied including standard water table contouring calculating parameters to test for the onset of density dependent fluid flow and dominance of groundwater advection and standard graphical and multivariate statistical methods applied to hydrochemistry data major ion and the stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h water quality and hydrography data from a previous investigation 1995 96 by shams 2000 were compared with more recent measurements conducted for this study to better understand the nature of the system and how it has evolved this study provides estimates of the proportions of recycled water contributed by the kwtp in groundwater spatially relative to the infiltration ponds and the spectacles based on groundwater mixing calculations figs 1 and 2 a discussion is provided on the relative merits of different methods used to analyse the provenance and evolution of groundwater in a mar system in proximity to wetlands under evaporative conditions lastly the implications of increasing the volume of wastewater discharge to the aquifer are discussed in relation to a conceptual model developed for the spectacles 2 materials and methods

mean annual rainfall ali et al 2012 mcfarlane et al 2015 groundwater in western australia is managed and allocated through licenses and permits issued by the government which clarify the volume of

reporting wir department of water and environmental regulation 2017 database and additional data were provided by the water corporation of western australia which operates the infiltration ponds at kwtp in addition the csiro undertook hourly logging of water levels using probes installed in a selection of wells between april and november 2014 well descriptions are provided in appendix a see supplementary information bekele et al 2018 groundwater license allocations i e annual volumes of groundwater that license holders were legally entitled to abstract from the aquifer were mapped to investigate changes in the spatial distribution of well bores pumping large volumes of groundwater at different times 1995 2004 and 2014 pumping was not metered i e measured using a device to monitor water usage and it is not known what portion of the licensed volume of groundwater a license holder abstracted from the aquifer therefore the license allocations provide only an indication of where abstraction likely occurred the collected data were used to interpret temporal variations in the water table in relation to pond infiltration of recycled water at the kwtp between 1987 and 2014 water table contour plots were prepared for the dry and wet seasons in 2014 corresponding to january february and august september respectively shams 2000 showed seasonal hydrograph data from 1995 that revealed water table fluctuations ranged from 0 5 m australian height datum ahd to the west to about 1 m ahd to the east of the spectacles with only minor fluctuations near the infiltration ponds the position of the water table is mainly in the bassendean sand and tamala sand to the east and west of the spectacles respectively shams 2000 fig 2 the analysis of hydraulic gradients and patterns of groundwater flow in the superficial aquifer was repeated for comparison using data collected in 2014 as described in the results the largest most complete sets of hydrography data for this area were for 1995 96 and 2014 therefore these dates were compared the main areas for comparison were hydraulic gradients east of the spectacles and west of the spectacles corresponding to locations a through d in fig 1 2 3 methods for evaluating density related convection the onset of density driven convection can be predicted using the rayleigh number a dimensionless parameter which represents the ratio of buoyancy driven forces to viscous and dispersive forces domenico and schwartz 1998 the rayleigh number indicates favourable conditions for convection when it exceeds a critical value rac nield and bejan 2006 the equation for the saline rayleigh number is as follows nield 1968 sheldon et al 2012 1 ra khg ρ 0 δ s β μ φ d where k is the permeability m2 h is the thickness of the porous layer m g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 ρ0 is the reference fluid density kg m3 taken as the density at top of layer δs is the salinity difference between top and bottom of layer kg m3 β is the saline expansion coefficient m kg3 μ is the dynamic viscosity kg m s φ is the porosity and d is the diffusivity of salt m2 s the mixed convection ratio m defined below is also useful in this analysis as it shows the ratio of buoyance driven flow to advection where m 1 indicates forced convection dominates over free convection and m 1 indicates free convection is the dominant process holzbecher and yusa 1995 holzbecher 1998 2 m k δ ρ g μ v adv where δρ is the maximum density difference kg m3 and v adv is the advective flow velocity m s v adv is the product of hydraulic conductivity and the hydraulic gradient 2 4 collection and analysis of water quality data historical groundwater quality data were evaluated as a precursor to planning the water sampling for 2014 to assess whether trends and seasonality were present as these could have affected the representativeness of the samples the only previous comprehensive study of the hydrochemistry in this area was conducted by shams 2000 before nearly two decades of recharging the aquifer with wastewater the historical data were obtained from the wir database beginning as early as 1974 and ending in 2010 the measurements that are most frequently represented in the dataset are nutrients chloride oxygen ca mg na fe total dissolved solids tds ph and temperature frequent monitoring was conducted in the 1990s and in 2008 2009 with up to several measurements per season the ngmp calculator developed by daughney et al 2010 was used to process the historical data to check for outliers and to calculate summary statistics it also provided insight into the temporal variations of data and potential for assessing seasonality and trends on a per site and per measured parameter basis according to user specified confidence levels twenty three parameters were considered across 43 wells n 989 datasets seasonal variations of groundwater levels from 1974 to 2010 were not significant aspects for designing the water sampling program appendix b see supplementary information bekele et al 2018 water sampling was conducted by the csiro in april autumn and november late spring 2014 to describe the current groundwater provenance and flow patterns surrounding the spectacles north wetland hydrochemistry data were obtained for groundwater rainwater and recycled water from the kwtp infiltration ponds water sampling was conducted using the techniques described in appendix c see supplementary information bekele et al 2018 and provided a dataset of concentrations of major ions nutrients and stable isotopes and measurements of other water quality parameters average rainwater chemistry data for the study area were obtained from crosbie et al 2012 which included seasonal sampling between 2007 and 2011 hydrochemistry data were analysed using traditional plotting methods and multivariate statistics as further described below historical water quality data from july and august 1995 and september 1996 were primarily obtained from the wir database which included major ions nutrients ph and temperature additional nutrient dissolved oxygen do redox potential electrical conductivity ec and stable isotope data were obtained from shams 2000 which reports these data from july august 1995 sampling the abovementioned data are representative of winter and were the most comprehensive historical data that could be used for comparison total alkalinity measurements were used to estimate bicarbonate for preparing piper and stiff diagrams using the following method total alkalinity as caco3 in meq l was equated to the difference between the sum of cations and the sum of anions in meq l when it was not measured it assumes electroneutrality of the water samples both anion and cation analysis had an analytical precision of 1 mg l for the 2014 water samples the precision of the historical water samples is less certain but charge balance for samples with complete analyses were generally less than 5 although the proportions of bicarbonate and carbonate contributing to alkalinity were unknown given ph 8 2 bicarbonate is presumably the dominant species thus the above estimate for total alkalinity as caco3 in meq l derived from the ion balance method was used and converted to mg l of bicarbonate appelo and postma 1993 total alkalinity was reported for some of the analyses and the above method provided a reasonable approximation the more recent groundwater sampling conducted by the csiro in april and november 2014 provided a dataset of major ion nutrient and stable isotope concentrations and other water quality parameters for many of the wells previously sampled in 1995 96 limited surface water sampling from the spectacles was conducted due to resource constraints and lack of evidence to suggest a well mixed system that would allow sampling to be fully representative piper and stiff diagrams were prepared with gw chart winston 2000 and zetaware 2017 software products respectively qgis v 2 16 3 quantum gis development team 2017 was used for plotting spatial distributions of hydrochemical data hierarchical cluster analysis hca was used to identify differences between the 1995 and 2014 water quality datasets the statistical calculations were performed using matlab the selected parameters in this study were ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl po4 p nh4 n ph deuterium oxygen 18 temperature ec do and eh datasets with low charge balance error i e 5 were used for the analysis the parameter no3 n was excluded due to several samples being below the detection limit due to limited sampling of wells for a full range of analytes only the wells shown in table 1 were compared for the parameters indicated firstly the statistical normality of the measured parameters was checked using the matlab skewness function the results showed skewness positive or negatively skewed thus all variables were standardised z scores prior to the classification analysis cloutier et al 2008 lanzante 1996 the measured parameters were shown to have relatively normal distributions based on the kolmogorov smirnov normality test kstest function in matlab q mode hca was used to classify the different samples into clusters according to the similarity of multiple parameters among samples the contributions from different sources to a mixture were quantified using an endmember mixing model a generalised form of the mass balance equations for water and tracers is f 1 f 2 f e 1 c 1 1 f 1 c 2 1 f 2 c e 1 f e c m 1 c 1 2 f 1 c 2 2 f 2 c e 2 f e c m 2 c 1 f 1 c 2 f 2 c e f e c m c 1 n f 1 c 2 n f 2 c e n f e c m n where c tracer concentration f fraction of different source in mixture with subscript m subscripts e and superscripts n refer to the number of endmember and tracers respectively the equations assume conservative mixing first an assessment of possible tracers and endmembers was conducted then the corresponding mass balance equations was solved an earlier study of water quality at the kwtp in relation to the spectacles identified a mixing zone consisting of three types of groundwater characterised by differences in salinity and nutrient levels woodward clyde 2000 in the case of three component mixing the following equations are applicable jenkins et al 1994 liu et al 2017 this approach has been used to define an evaporative isotopic signature in other studies of wastewater

of groundwater was explored by calculating the deuterium excess d which relates the stables isotopes of deuterium and oxygen 18 the deuterium excess defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o by dansgaard 1964 is a linear relationship that arises due to kinetic conditions that prevail during evaporation and is used as an index of the evaporation effect on the hydrochemistry han et al 2009 a strong correlation between d and tds reveals evaporative concentration yuan et al 2011 as discussed by marfi et al 2004 and han et al 2009 the deuterium excess roughly corresponds with the y intercept of the gmwl of 10 for the global meteoric water line however there are global variations in d excess of precipitation several studies have documented d excess spatial variations in australian precipitation due to humidity and temperature controls guan et al 2013 liu et al 2010 in perth western australia d excess for precipitation is approximately 16 for the winter season when the majority of rainfall occurs liu et al 2010 3 results 3 1 general observations of groundwater flow from contouring a variety of results were analysed to understand groundwater provenance and the dominant controls on groundwater flow in the current system and how water levels responded historically to changes in rainfall abstraction from groundwater pumping in the aquifer and the discharge rate of wastewater from the kwtp from this knowledge a conceptual model for the spectacles was developed which is used in a discussion of the future implications of changes to further drying of the climate and increasing wastewater discharge to the aquifer this section begins with examination of the historical patterns of flow from water table contours the water table contours fig 3 show the north wetland has the characteristics of both a discharge and a flow through lake anderson and munter 1981 groundwater recharges the wetland from the east side of the spectacles and from the water table mound below kwtp west of the spectacles discharge from the wetland occurs in a north westerly and a south westerly direction e g near location d circumventing the water table mound below the kwtp a groundwater mound that develops downgradient from a discharge lake can cause groundwater to reverse flow and enter the lake possibly leading to a stagnation zone anderson and munter 1981 winter 1981 if a stagnation zone downgradient from a discharge lake is present as a continuous boundary or trough of low potentiometric heads it can lead to a lack of seepage or reduced seepage from the lake which effects the water and nutrient budgets winter 1981 while this may be the case east of the infiltration ponds due to the size of the spectacles discharge appears to still occur to the northwest and southwest in the next section the hydrochemistry data are presented to provide further support for a conceptual model for the study area 3 2 interpretation of groundwater provenance groundwater from the wells located close to the infiltration ponds kw and kwtp wells are compositionally similar to wastewater sampled from the infiltration ponds ip only the shallowest well in the sp1 1 series of wells sp1 1d resembles the infiltration pond sample fig 4 table 2 the deeper wells sp1 1 a thru c have much higher concentrations of major ions there is no resemblance to the groundwater samples from wells up gradient east north and northeast of spectacles nor is the composition of these groundwater samples ostensibly related to the lithology as shown in the geologic cross section fig 2 sp1 1b a are slotted in the gnangara sand and ascot formations respectively in comparison sp1 2 a is also slotted in the ascot formation but there is no similarity between these wells based on the distribution of major ions the results from the hca show the 1995 groundwater from sp1 2a b form a separate cluster from sp1 1d fig 5 deeper groundwater with high tds sampled from sp1 1a through 1c on the west side of the spectacles all cluster together the results from cluster analysis for the 2014 data show similar clusters except groundwater from sp1 1d is different from the hydrochemistry of the other wells considered for this analysis the most plausible explanation is that after nearly two decades of wastewater infiltration the shallow section of aquifer intercepted by sp1 1d is more influenced by the presence of wastewater recharge up gradient to the west of it than in 1995 the groundwater samples from sp1 1d 1995 and 2014 are more dilute than deeper groundwater samples from this location sp1 1a thru c table 2 the latter may have derived from evaporative concentration of water in the spectacles north wetland and subsequent infiltration to the water table data to support this concept is provided further below using stable isotope data fig 6 shows a cluster of groundwater samples in group 1 which include jm42 sp2 3a b sp1 3a b sp2 1 and sp2 2a thru c these are located north and east of the spectacles and are labelled as background groundwater or native groundwater resulting from rainfall recharge interactions with carbonate minerals present in the superficial aquifer the sample from jm41 is an outlier which may be due to mineral dissolution and or transpiration group 2 consisting of groundwater samples from deep and intermediate depths in the sp1 1 well series shows differences in the extent of evapoconcentration of groundwater between samples collected in 1995 and 2014 however they form a linear trend corresponding to evapoconcentration of groundwater derived from group 1 in contrast group 3 consists of water sampled from the infiltration pond and groundwater samples from many of the wells on the kwtp site groundwater from sp1 1d sampled in 1995 and 2014 is included in group 3 and suggests that much of this groundwater derives from wastewater recharge rather than mixing with the deeper groundwater that has derived from evapoconcentration the group 3 water samples do not fall along the evapoconcentration trend line the reason for this is not immediately apparent wastewater derives from a variety of sources and has passed through treatment which may have altered the isotopic composition and concentrations of tds a water sample from the spectacles wetland is included for reference in fig 6 and has the isotopic signature of surface water that has undergone transpiration and evapoconcentration 3 3 conservative groundwater mixing model the concentration of tds in fig 6 was useful for identifying possible endmembers for a mixing model however to apply the technique and estimate proportions of different water sources requires independent conservative tracers tds includes ions that are not conserved e g potassium which can be contributed to groundwater by fertilizers and wastewater from humans and animals and is affected by ion exchange and plant uptake appelo and postma 1993 rosen and white 2001 however chloride concentrations for possible endmembers native groundwater from further up gradient and infiltration pond water were similar table 2 making it difficult to distinguish the graph of k cl versus δ18o fig 7 suggests three components for the mixing model 1 native groundwater meaning water which derived from rainfall recharge and flowed through the superficial aquifer the chemical composition of this water plotted on a piper diagram see supplementary information bekele et al 2018 is consistent with other studies of the hydrochemistry of the superficial aquifer bekele et al 2009 department of water 2018 2 wastewater from the kwtp infiltration ponds and 3 evapoconcentrated groundwater the third endmember is the least accurately defined as there is large scatter between the samples from sp1 1a through c from 1995 to obtain greater confidence in the estimated endmember compositions would require a larger dataset of samples collected over time the composition of rainwater crosbie et al 2012 plots near the native groundwater sample the samples from sp1 1a through c from 2014 plot further from the samples taken in 1995 that define the evapoconcentrated endmember there has been a reduction in recharge to groundwater from the spectacles over time due to declining water levels within the wetland consequently groundwater beneath the wetland has reduced salinity and d excess as reflected in the shift in concentrations from 1995 to 2014 in the sp1 1 bores water samples from wells kw5 kw6 kw13 and some of the samples from kwtp1 and kwtp2 in april and or november 2014 were excluded from the estimation of source water components these samples did not plot within the three end member mixing model fig 7 the scatter of these points surrounding the infiltration pond endmember is due to there being only two water samples to define this endmember ideally there should be more samples from the infiltration ponds to show seasonal variations and provide uncertainty for this endmember the proportion of wastewater in the kw and kwtp wells between the infiltration ponds and the north wetland of the spectacles varies between 45 kwtp2d and 100 kwtp1 s i d wells based on the three component model with mainly native groundwater as an additional component fig 8 in the sp1 1 series of wells the proportion of evapoconcentrated groundwater increases with depth of the well screen 39 50 the shallowest well in this series sp1 1d has the highest proportion of wastewater 34 compared with the deeper wells at this location there was only one sample collected from the spectacles and the mixing model suggests 9 of its composition derived from wastewater given uncertainty in the endmember compositions the wastewater content of this sample is likely to be within the margin of error 3 4 dominant controls on water table variations there has been a dramatic decline in the water table historically trend lines through the hydrographs for jm42 je22c anketell 1 and 1a reveal declining water levels of the order of 70 to 90 mm yr over three decades fig 9 in part this is due to an increase in demand for groundwater due to development e g allocations of groundwater 100 kl yr however the area has experienced significant drying between 1987 and 2016 the mean annual rainfall was 675 mm but it has declined by 9 mm decade or about 1 4 of the annual mean over this period fig 10 wastewater recharge to the superficial aquifer increased from 3 to 4 ml between years 2004 and 2008 and then stabilised between years 2008 and 2011 from 2012 to 2014 recharge from both mean annual rainfall increased average rainfall was 675 mm and wastewater increased from 4 to 4 7 ml day but the water level in the spectacles continued to decline locally water levels near the spectacles are highly responsive to changes in wastewater discharge to the aquifer the hydrographs for sp1 1c and sp1 1d located between the infiltration ponds and the spectacles show variations in response to wastewater fig 10 labels a and b observed differences in rates of water table decline suggest that water levels in wells nearest the spectacles on its north and east margin i e t140 o and sp1 2b c compared with those farther away in these directions are being bolstered by infiltrated wastewater downstream despite absolute water level changes due to spatially heterogeneous groundwater abstraction and changes in wastewater recharge to the aquifer groundwater flow directions have remained relatively unchanged over time fig 3 depicts groundwater contour maps for two different seasons to compare years 1995 and 2014 in general comparing these years the groundwater flow directions are roughly the same at all four locations a to d the hydraulic gradients were higher in 2014 than that in 1995 due to the increased volume of wastewater discharge to the aquifer the hydraulic gradients for summer were reasonably similar to winter values as shown in table 3 in summary near the spectacles water table variations have been largely influenced by wastewater discharge and rainfall variations and to lesser extent abstraction due to pumping from the aquifer which is largely occurring farther away from the wetland in this semi arid climate fluid density variations arising from evaporative concentration of surface water could affect local scale flow beneath the spectacles this was explored using the following calculations the rayleigh number was calculated based on field values k h φ and physical constants from the literature β g d from sheldon et al 2012 μ ρ 0 from guo and langevin 2002 k 1 33e 11 m2 10 m day h 30 m g 9 81 m s2 ρ 0 1000 kg m3 δs 0 79 kg m3 based on the salinity difference estimated from groundwater tds sampled from wells screened near the top and bottom of the aquifer sp1 1d and sp1 1a respectively β 0 00075 m kg3 μ 0 9e 3 kg m s at 25 c haynes 2016 φ 0 3 and d 1e 9 m2 s at 25 c the critical rayleigh number ra c is a value that is typically derived from stability analysis according to nield and bejan 2006 the ra c value is of the order of 40 or less depending on the assumptions for the salinity gradient and pressure the calculated value of ra is 8606 which greatly exceeds the criterion for free convection relevant to the spectacles wetland system the exact value is not essential for this analysis due to the considerably larger value of ra derived for the site this shows the fluid density contrast would produce instability that could lead to free convection in proximity to the spectacles locations b and c values for the mixed convection ratio m are 0 15 and 0 1 respectively based on the hydraulic gradients from 2014 and assuming δ ρ is 0 6 kg m3 based on density derived from tds measurements from sp1 1a and sp1 2a and a hydraulic conductivity of 10 m day these values of m suggest advective flow is more likely to dominate than free convection the hydraulic gradient would need to be lower than 7 0e 4 to produce a value of m 1 force of advective flow comparable to the buoyancy force of free convection hydraulic gradients for 2014 and 1995 96 are not nearly this low table 3 alternatively to have free convection dominate m 1 the value of δ ρ would need to be 4 kg m3 7 larger than measured for the range of hydraulic conductivities measured above these results indicate groundwater flow by advection dominates over free convection 4 discussion 4 1 conceptual model for the spectacles the hydrochemistry data suggest a conceptual model for the dynamics of groundwater flow near the spectacles wetland fig 11 depicts a two dimensional cross section along a representative flow line following the regional hydraulic gradient from east to west and the local flow paths surrounding the spectacles north wetland different hydrogeological settings in the aquifer are depicted and labelled with typical water types group 1 2 or 3 the superficial aquifer is comprised of carbonate minerals rainwater infiltrates through this aquifer and interacts with the carbonate minerals while flowing westward to produce a ca hco3 type of water indicated by group 1 department of water 2018 supplementary information bekele et al 2018 below the spectacles there is groundwater with an evaporative signature group 2 that separates group 1 and group 3 water types the water type of group 2 contains higher concentrations of tds 1 g l and distinctively higher δ18o 2 5 per mil than groundwater derived from wastewater infiltration group 3 fig 7 in the conceptual model evaporative concentration of water occurs in the north wetland and shallow groundwater beneath it that sinks and migrates westward below a plume of fresher groundwater derived from the wastewater infiltration ponds the groundwater with a high evaporative concentration signal appears localised to an area of the superficial aquifer between the infiltration ponds and the north wetland of the spectacles it is unclear whether this extends westward at the bottom of the superficial aquifer as there are no bores that intersect this deeper groundwater the force of regional groundwater flow westward is possibly opposed by the influx of wastewater below the ponds at this location infiltrated wastewater being less dense than groundwater intercepts the shallow slotted interval of sp1 1d while denser groundwater sinks deeper and flows westward as suggested by the hydrochemistry of groundwater from sp1 1a thru 1c 4 2 comparison of methods used to infer groundwater dynamics this study provides an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods to characterise the groundwater dynamics in coastal aquifers near wastewater infiltration operations some methods provide more of a qualitative understanding of flow and origin of water sources while others provide more of a quantitative understanding effective management plans for surface water ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions often need both qualitative and quantitative insights for sustainable water use li et al 2016 su et al 2016 whilst standard water table contouring allows one to generalise about the directions of flow there would need to be a considerable data set of water level elevations and possibly for different seasons depending on the amount of annual variability to compute flow vectors in greater detail additionally using flow net analysis and permeability data one could estimate groundwater flow rates using darcy s law assuming two dimensional flow through a cross sectional area either manually or using groundwater modelling software such as modflow one can do the calculations to assess groundwater flow rates however it relies on assumptions about the aquifer heterogeneity estimates of recharge and evapotranspiration to effectively model fluxes bekele et al 2015a doble et al 2017 while the regional lithology of the coastal aquifer near the spectacles has been represented using uniform properties at a large scale e g marillier et al 2012 there may be clay lenses kaolinitic mud mixed with sand and other heterogeneities arising from processes in wetland basins semeniuk and semeniuk 2004 that are important for local scale movement of water in and around the wetland the evapotranspiration conditions existing in the coastal plain of western australia requires further consideration of salinity effects on the density of groundwater in some cases requiring density correct hydraulic heads prior to interpreting flow directions from water level data marimuthu et al 2005 the rayleigh number and the mixed convection ratio calculations were useful to gain further insight into potential flow from density related effects the stables isotopes of water deuterium and oxygen 18 were shown to be powerful tracers however it was by calculating the deuterium excess which relates these two isotopes and the ratio of conservative ions potassium and chloride that greater distinction between different sources of water and their provenance could be determined novel methods have recently been developed to aid in understanding the water balance and groundwater dependency of wetland ecosystems for example an isotope approach that utilises a δ18o and δ2h mixing model to calculate the proportion of local groundwater and precipitation in superficial pore water samples from wetlands aided the interpretation of an aerial thermal imaging survey of groundwater seepage isokangas et al 2017 cao et al 2018 assessed seasonal changes in groundwater inflow fluxes to a wetland system using isotope mass balance calculations isotopic fractionation operating during evaporation modifies the isotopic composition furthermore stagnant zones in wetlands will have enrichment in the heavier isotopes of δ18o and δ2h due to a high ratio of evaporation to inflow which can provide important information on the residence time and preferential flow of water in and around wetlands ronkanen and klove 2007 this isotopic signature occurs in the wetland as well as in the wastewater infiltration pond for this reason another independent tracer based on the ratio of ions k cl was needed to understand the mixing of water types and to quantify the proportions of wastewater at the spectacles site the classification of water chemistry data using piper and stiff diagrams and the identification of statistically significant clusters using hca were largely to obtain a qualitative understanding of the water sources as a starting point for doing the mixing calculations in studies that quantify wastewater recharge to aquifers a range of organic micropollutants existing in the wastewater stream have been used as passive tracers e g henzler et al 2014 hillebrand et al 2015 rather than conducting controlled tracer tests that involve injecting or infiltrating a known quantity of tracer into the flow system and monitoring for breakthrough downstream e g bekele et al 2014 ronkanen and klove 2007 used potassium bromide in winter and potassium iodide in summer to assess seasonal differences in the plant uptake of bromide hillebrand et al 2015 injected three tracers uranine acesulfame and carbamazepine as reference to compare with the fate of micropollutants in wastewater that are more reactive atenolol caffeine cyclamate ibuprofen and paracetamol the costs and resources required to analyse routinely for micropollutants can be prohibitive for some studies and the water sampling program for the spectacles does not include micropollutants department of water and environmental regulation 2017 according to a recent study of trends in water analysis of organic micropollutants schmidt 2018 included cost effective in situ or on site analysis by sensors as one of many possible areas for further research high resolution monitoring for water quality changes in aquatic systems is not routinely used but methods of adaptive sampling based on real time monitoring data are being developed for nutrients blaen et al 2016 and could be extended to micropollutants schmidt 2018 less cost for analytical methods and greater throughput of samples due to automation are cited among the major advantages of the latest improvements in analytical methods for organic micropollutants huntscha et al 2012 schmidt 2018 a major advancement in the quantification of micropollutants to support environmental management is the ability to simultaneously detect a range of micropollutants e g pesticides biocides pharmaceuticals corrosion inhibitors and artificial sweeteners at low concentrations e g 10 ng l as demonstrated by huntscha et al 2012 a newly developed automated enrichment method developed by huntscha et al 2012 involves online solid phase extraction coupled to a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer online spe hplc ms ms method the advantages of this method include smaller sample volumes due to enrichment of the sample using solid phase extraction now conducted online rather than manually offline and shorter total analysis times these improvements in analytical methods were critical in obtaining greater temporal resolution of pesticide risk in streams in a study by spycher et al 2018 where several hundred micropollutants were measured which had highly seasonal dynamic concentration profiles the benefits of obtaining highly resolved temporal concentration data in dynamic systems is that it facilitates studies of chemical exposure in aquatic ecosystems related to episodic peak concentration releases versus regular releases of micropollutants e g munz 2017 stamm 2016 the term ecohydrological interfaces was recently introduced to describe the complex interactions of hydrological biochemical and ecological processes for example groundwater surface water interfaces such as between a wetland and the benthic zone krause et al 2017 critical to this area of research is the use of innovative technologies to detect and trace fluxes of water energy and matter across ecohydrological interfaces to study dynamic ecosystem behaviour krause et al 2017 kraus et al 2017 demonstrated the valuable contribution of deploying in situ high frequency nitrate sensors to quantify nutrient concentrations and fluxes in a tidally affected river that receives treated wastewater continuous measurements revealed a significant benthic source of nitrate from sediments downstream of the wastewater treatment plant as suggested by kraus et al 2017 connectivity with a wetland habitat would add another layer of complexity to unravelling the sources and movement of nutrients within the system 4 3 future implications the rayleigh and mixed convection parameter calculations indicate the sensitivity of the system to changes such as increased aridity greater discharge of wastewater to the aquifer and or general lowering of the regional water table near the spectacles salinity gradients can increase or decrease as a result of greater evaporation and more dilute wastewater recharge to the aquifer in contrast to the plume of evapoconcentrated groundwater the hydraulic gradients can change due to general lowering of the water table due to greater abstraction up gradient the current system appears to have a subsurface dam created by the recharge of wastewater and this could be jeopardized if there are modifications as described above the result of greater dominance of flow by convection over advection could affect the water balance and quality of water in the spectacles modification of the local pore water flow has implications for plant growth nutrient exchange and other wetland ecosystem functions shen et al 2015 xin et al 2017 5 conclusions a groundwater assessment of a shallow wetland area in an unconfined aquifer adjacent to infiltration ponds for wastewater based on hydrochemistry and water level data showed three recognizable water sources wastewater recharge from the ponds native groundwater from rainfall recharge interaction with the carbonate aquifer and evapoconcentrated water derived from the wetland the latter is characterised by a high concentration of tds 1019 mg l on average and deuterium excess values that are consistent with the signature of evapoconcentrated water these results are supported by multivariate statistical analysis hca and stable isotope data the analysis of trends in water level data and hydraulic gradient provided further support for the groundwater vectors in and around the spectacles due to the drying climate wetlands in the south west of western australia face an uncertain future semeniuk and semeniuk 2013 moreover it is recognised in other parts of the world that an understanding of the interactions between groundwater and the wetlands is needed to protect these ecosystems particularly in arid and semi arid regions li et al 2016 su et al 2016 a recent large scale survey of wetlands globally by thorslund et al 2017 identified a continued and rapid decline in wetland areas despite many natural functions they provide that benefit society e g biodiversity support carbon sequestration water quality protection contamination removal by natural attenuation processes flood regulation and groundwater level and soil moisture regulation at the spectacles a unique hydraulic setting arises due to the juxtaposition of the kwtp infiltration ponds discharge of wastewater to the unconfined aquifer and the flow through of regional groundwater which slows the flow of regional groundwater such that water levels are maintained in the wetland in essence managed aquifer recharge assists in forming a subsurface dam that raises the water table beneath the wetlands the results are valuable for planning of other mar study sites such as a proposal for perry lakes in western australia which is similarly facing drying conditions bekele et al 2011a mcfarlane et al 2009 despite the increase in daily volumes of wastewater infiltrated to the superficial aquifer at the kwtp near the spectacles over the past three decades water depths in the north wetland have steadily declined and maximum water depths halved during this period the reduction in water levels and increased vegetation in the wetland could lead to the wetland becoming a recharge basin that is either entirely or partially perched above the water table rather than the combined flow through discharge wetland basin reduced flushing of the spectacles may increase salinization and nutrients in the wetland if the pmd fails to deliver sufficient volumes of inflow from surface runoff upstream while this could be used to support proposals to increase the discharge of wastewater to the infiltration ponds the hydrodynamics is complex and should be further investigated to optimally manage and prevent degradation of the water quality the calculations of rayleigh and mixing convection parameters were used to illustrate the sensitivity of the system to changes such as increased aridity greater discharge of wastewater to the aquifer and or general lowering of the regional water table near the spectacles greater knowledge of the spatial extent of the evapoconcentrated groundwater intercepted by the deep and intermediate sp1 1 wells is needed to determine whether it plays a role in impeding the eastward flow of wastewater by virtue of being denser than the surrounding groundwater additionally whether this would be compromised if rates of wastewater recharge were increased as wastewater has lower concentrations of tds than the evapoconcentrated groundwater this paper demonstrates the benefits of applying different qualitative and quantitative methods to effectively manage surface water ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions for sustainable water use generalised fluid flow directions were obtained by water table contouring given there was insufficient data to develop a well calibrated flow and transport model density related effects on flow directions were investigated with theoretical calculations whilst standard graphical and multivariate statistical methods provided understanding of water sources as a starting point for mixing calculations the stables isotopes of water deuterium and oxygen 18 were shown to be powerful tracers however it was by calculating the deuterium excess which relates these two isotopes and the ratio of potassium and chloride that greater distinction between different sources of water and their provenance could be determined acknowledgements this research was funded by the australian water

6868,lake chad is an endorheic lake in the sahel region of africa at the southern edge of the sahara desert the lake which is well known for its dramatic decrease in surface area during the 1970s and 1980s experiences an annual flood resulting in a maximum total surface water area generally during february or march though sometimes earlier or later people along the shores of lake chad make their living fishing farming and raising livestock and have a vested interest in knowing when and how extensive the annual flooding will be particularly those practicing recession farming in which the fertile ground of previously flooded area is used for planting crops in this study the authors investigate the relationship between lake and basin parameters including rainfall basin evapotranspiration lake evapotranspiration lake elevation total surface water area and the previous year s total surface water area and develop equations for each dry season month except november linking total surface water area to the other parameters the resulting equations allow the user to estimate the december average monthly total surface water area of the lake in late november and to make the estimates for january to may in early december based on the results of a leave one out cross validation analysis the equations for lake area are estimated to have an average absolute error

region of africa shared by chad nigeria niger and cameroon there have been numerous hydrological models developed for lake chad each of these has limitations relative to the statistical model for lake area we present here bader et al 2011 developed a hydrological model that simulates the water level in the northern pool southern pool and archipelago using riverine and direct rainfall inputs to the lake it also estimates total water area for each of the pools according to lemoalle et al 2012 the model results correspond well with satellite measurements of northern pool surface water area and with satellite measurements of the total surface water area from 1980 onward though these results are not quantified one disadvantage of this model is that it requires input of the chari river and komodougu yobe river discharges data that is not publicly available coe and foley 2001 report the results of a hydrological model of lake chad they describe a model with good agreement with the inferred lake area during simulations for the years 1954 to 1967 the inferred lake area is not a direct measurement of lake area but rather is derived from a relationship between lake area and lake level it is important to note that the hydrology of lake chad changed significantly in the 1970 s during its transition from normal lake chad to small lake chad and the model based on a coarse 10 km resolution digital elevation model may not be adequate to define the lake after this transition gao et al 2011 developed a hydrological model of lake chad they compared images of the lake extent from the model with images derived from remote sensing three image pairs were shown for october 31 1963 december 25 1972 and january 31 1987 each pair of images from the two earlier dates before the transition from normal lake chad to small lake chad looked quite similar though no numerical value was provided the model observation pair for the post transition period did not look very similar this raises the question of the utility of the model for producing lake area in the current post transition period lemoalle 2004 developed a crude expression for lake chad surface area based on a simplified water balance model and described it as a first approximation that model assumes no seepage from the lake and requires knowledge of the streamflow to the lake which as previously noted is not publicly available delclaux et al 2008 developed a hydrological model of the lake chad basin however the results they presented included streamflow and elevation but not surface area coe and birkett 2004 used upstream measurement of river height along with in situ stream flow and gauge height to estimate river discharge 500 km downstream and wet season height of lake chad greater than 600 km downstream their method though clearly relies on hard to obtain in situ measurements and does not include lake area the first objective of this paper is to assemble and examine a set of satellite and model based data for the southern lake chad basin relevant to developing a statistical model for the area of the lake during its flooding season this data set includes time series of satellite and gauge based precipitation and modeled et for the southern part of the basin modeled lake et data satellite based lake elevation data and satellite based estimated lake total surface water area given the limitations of the existing models described above the second objective is to develop a predictive statistical model for total lake surface water area using regression methods on the data set the regression method includes backward elimination variable selection and a leave one out cross validation loocv analysis to optimize the resulting statistical model 2 study area the lake chad basin is approximately 2 5 million square kilometers about eight percent of the african continent and the largest endorheic basin in the world gao et al 2011 lake chad is the terminal lake of this basin the northern part of the basin lies within the sahara and does not generate runoff that reaches lake chad delclaux et al 2008 for this reason we work with the southern part of the basin fig 1 the lake s average depth varies between 1 5 and 5 m any change in lake volume translates to a substantial change in lake shoreline and area lake chad flooded savanna world wildlife fund no date https www worldwildlife org ecoregions at0904 in the 1960s the lake s area was on the order of 25 000 sq km in the mid 1980 s its area was reported to be about one tenth of that size grove 1996 though it is not clear if that includes flooded vegetation if one includes flooded vegetation the lake s annual peak area for 2017 is estimated at close to 14 700 sq km policelli et al 2018 fig 2 shows the evolution of lake chad from the time of the earliest space based images of the lake below about 280 m asl the lake separates into a southern pool and a northern pool divided by the great barrier and the southern pool separates from the eastern archipelago of sandy islands lemoalle 2004 the population of the lake shore is around 2 million magrin 2016 and the people make a living through a combination of fishing farming and raising livestock sarch and birkett 2000 recession farming is an important method of farming in the region whereby farmers plant in the enriched soils following each year s flood pulse because of the complexity of the hydrology it is difficult to provide farmers with information on the timing of the floods and a sense of how large the flood is going to be in any given year this can be a serious problem for farmers who grow crops near the lake shore and periodically lose crops to flooding okpara et al 2016 according to sarch and birkett 2000 the farming start date at villages on the south west shore of lake chad begins in mid january to late february it seems reasonable to conclude that predictions of lake surface area made in late november or early december could be used for agricultural decision making for locations with similar start dates there are a number of dams and irrigation schemes in the river basins that drain into lake chad such as those of the chari logone and komadougu yobe river systems however at the large scale they do not amount to a substantial revision of the natural seasonal hydrological patterns which are largely determined by the west african monsoon and the position of the itcz birkett 2000 the surface of lake chad is not flat and level the barriers to flow from the southern pool to the northern pool and archipelago result in the water in these areas frequently being at different elevations additionally the local winds and flow of water from the chari river into the lake addressed further in the discussion section combined with the complex shape of the lake lead to an evolving lake surface carmouze et al 1983 lake surface elevation time series data used in this study refer to satellite based measurements made in the relatively small open water portion of the lake in the southern pool fig 3 presents areas of the lake at or below selected elevations the topographic data used to create fig 3 is from a 1 arc second 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem from the nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm the blue areas would correspond to lake levels limited by the accuracy of the dem if the lake surface were flat and the lake filled uniformly however since this is not the case the areas should only be viewed as providing context for lake chad landforms and hydrology according to leblanc et al 2011 most of the flooded area of lake chad is covered by aquatic vegetation including rooted and floating plants this area is not readily measured with optical remote sensing but must be accounted for to get an accurate estimate of total surface water area for the lake policelli et al 2018 lake chad receives 90 96 of its water from the chari logone river system zhu et al 2017 with the remaining coming from smaller tributaries and direct rainfall most of this water arrives from such a distance that the peak lake level and lake area occur months after the rainfalls that produce them the delay is due to the slow runoff and routing of flood water to lake chad from the southern portion of the basin where precipitation rates are highest leblanc et al 2011 it is the reason that the lake chad peak level and area take place in the dry season 3 data and methods 3 1 data the key datasets used for this research are 1 climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data

a quasi global precipitation dataset produced by the climate hazards group at the university of california santa barbara using both satellite data and rain gauge data we used the high resolution 0 05

jason 1 2002 2008 jason 2 2008 to 2016 and jason 3 2016 to present the altimeters have a footprint diameter ranging from about 200 m to several kilometers depending on the target s surface roughness each of the altimeters used for lake chad elevation data have a ten day repeat time the accuracy of the lake surface elevation data for lake chad is approximately 0 29 m ricko et al 2012 lake surface elevation data are provided as the variation from the 1993 2002 mean height the fldas et model product is based on the noah 3 3 land surface model s total et which is the sum of bare soil evaporation evaporation of water intercepted by the canopy and transpiration weighted by the coverage fraction of each component mcnally et al 2017 the spatial resolution of the fldas et is 0 1 degree and we are using monthly data the fldas et data is available from october 1992 to the present fldas et has been evaluated against estimates from the simplified surface energy balance ssebop satellite data based model senay et al 2013 this evaluation indicates that fldas and ssebop et have significant but limited correlation r 0 5 for percentage et variations in west africa according to mcnally et al 2017 it is not entirely clear why the correlation between the fldas et and ssebop et is somewhat poor in west africa though it may have something to do with instability of the ssebop algorithm in that area we estimated the lake chad wet season et as a percentage of the 1988 2016 wet season average because most approximately constant at nearly 90 percent by our estimation of the lake consists of flooded vegetation and multiple types of vegetation are present it is a very difficult research problem to estimate the total monthly et from lake chad however because the ratio of open water to flooded vegetation is roughly constant over time we were able to estimate the lake et percent of average as the ratio of the open water evaporation for the full extent of the lake to the average open water evaporation for the full extent of the lake for 1988 2016 we used the complementary relationship lake evaporation crle model morton 1986 for estimates of lake open water evaporation the meteorological forcing data for the crle model were provided by noaa ncep doe reanalysis 2 the main validation work by the developers of the crle model was to compare model results with lake evaporation from water balance analyses for seventeen selected lakes on an annual basis the model results were within a maximum of seven percent of the water balance results monthly results suffered an unspecified degradation of accuracy morton 1986 the world wildlife fund wwf hydrobasins lehner and grill 2013 provided the shape file for the southern lake chad basin which was used to calculate rainfall and et for the portion of the basin that generates very nearly all of the runoff that reaches the lake the hydrobasins global database of basin shapes was developed using the wwf hydrosheds data lehner et al 2011 which has approximately 500 m resolution the hydrosheds product was developed using srtm data no validation description or accuracy assessment was found for hydrobasins lake chad total surface water area data from the research for policelli et al 2018 were derived from 1 1 km resolution land surface temperature lst data from the nasa terra satellite s modis sensor and adjusted using esa c band radar data from sentinel 1a and 2 total lake chad surface water area estimates by leblanc et al 2011 derived from 5 km resolution lst data from the meteosat mviri sensor and bias corrected by policelli et al 2018 the lst method for estimating lake surface water area is based on the fact that the lake including flooded vegetation is cooler than the surrounding landscape during the day leblanc et al 2011 monthly average area was used for this research this data was produced for the 1988 1989 dry season through the 2016 2017 dry season modis lst data with cloud cover greater than five percent were not used in the development of the lake area data the validation done for this data was comparison of the two datasets used to create the lake area time series the estimated lake areas for the two products during the period of overlap were within approximately three percent of each other 3 2 methods monthly precipitation and et were calculated for the southern portion of the basin from october 1992 to may 2017 using the hydrobasins shape file for this area the lake chad total surface water area time series was then checked for correlation with p et using a series of time lags to find the peak correlation it was expected that net precipitation p et would be more closely correlated to lake area than either of the components similarly the total lake surface water area was checked for correlation with the lake elevation data and it was expected that a close correlation would exist between these variables busker et al 2018 additionally the total lake surface water area was checked for correlation with the precipitation data and the et data for the southern portion of the basin the lake et percentage of 1988 2016 average lake et and the previous year s total lake surface water area next a multivariate regression analysis was performed using the datasets to establish equations linking total surface water area for a given month to one or more of the other independent variables in order to find the best relationship between the lake area and the independent variables we used several methods of regression 1st order linear regression 2nd and 3rd order polynomial regression and the linear log method of regression we also used the backward elimination method of variable selection to optimize the equations to mitigate the risk of overfitting the data we used the rule of thumb of ten data points for each variable included in the final equation harrell et al 1996 except for 1st order linear regression in which case as few as two data points for each variable included is permitted austin and steyerberg 2015 however we did not use less than six data points for each variable in our 1st order linear regression analysis the current year s total surface water area for each month during the dry season was the dependent variable the independent variables were 1 total wet season precipitation for the southern lake chad basin 2 total wet season et for the southern lake chad basin 3 wet season lake et as a percentage of the 1988 2016 average lake et 4 november typically the highest variation from the 1993 2002 mean lake surface height and 5 the total surface water area of the given month for the previous year a leave one out cross validation loocv was performed for the regression analysis in which one data point was left out the equation was generated using regression and the equation was evaluated for the one left out data point this was repeated for each yearly data point and an average absolute value of the percent error was determined for the total dataset for comparison the average absolute value of the percent error was also determined using the average total surface water area for a given month as the prediction and using the previous year s area as the prediction for a given month the study covered the time period from october 1992 to may 2017 which is the intersection of the period of available fldas evapotranspiration data and the available total lake surface water area data three years 2006 2008 were excluded from the study because of insufficient lake surface elevation data 4 results 4 1 datasets total monthly precipitation and et for the southern portion of the lake chad basin were calculated using chirps and fldas respectively fig 4 a shows the total monthly precipitation and et for october 1992 through may 2017 the trend lines indicate essentially no change over this time period fig 4 b shows the average monthly distribution of the precipitation and et for the southern portion of the basin for october 1992 through may 2017 june through october is usually considered the wet season and november through may is considered the dry season fig 4 b and leblanc et al 2011 fig 5 shows the percent of lake chad wet season average et from 1988 to 2016 the data exhibits an oscillatory behavior with a multi year cycle and the trend is essentially flat fig 6 a shows the lake elevation anomaly relative to the 1993 2002 mean level for october 1992 to may 2017 the trend line for july the only month with complete data not shown shows a slight level of decrease with high variability fig 6 b shows the average monthly lake elevation anomalies with respect to the 1993 2002 mean level for october 1992 through may 2017 note that the average level is highest in november during the dry season and lowest in june during the wet season fig 7 a presents the annual average dry season surface water area for lake chad from november 1992 through may 2017 as expected the pattern of the graph is similar to that of the graph of lake chad percentage of 1988 to 2016 average wet season lake et fig 5 the trend line shows an average increase of approximately 82 square kilometers per year in lake area over this period wet season data was not considered suitable for calculation of water extent because of cloud coverage and the fact that the lst method cannot distinguish well between soil moisture and flooded areas policelli et al 2018 the total surface water area includes both open water and flooded vegetation fig 7 b presents the average dry season monthly total surface water area for lake chad from november 1992 through may 2017 while the peak water elevation occurs on average in november the peak total surface water area occurs in march on average the peak total surface water area is not a sharp peak the two antecedent and two following months are not far from the maximum 4 2 a predictive model for lake chad total surface water area during this part of the research we asked the question for a given month how well can we predict the total surface water area of lake chad to address this question we investigated regression of the data to generate equations linking the independent variables to the dependent variable specifically we looked at 1st order linear equations equation 1 2nd order polynomial equations equation 2 3rd order polynomial equations equation 3 and linear log equations equation 4 1 a a b etws c lakeetws d pws e h f a 2 a a b etws c etws 2 d lakeetws e lakeetws 2 f pws g pws 2 h h j h 2 k a m a 2 3 a a b

the independent variables versus the average lake area for january from our regression analysis we found that for the equation types we examined 1st order linear equations provided the minimum average absolute percent error from loocv for december february and may for january march and april higher order polynomial equations provided slightly lower between 0 7 and 1 1 lower loocv average absolute percent errors however because of the lack of a physical explanation for some of the higher order terms a 2 and a 3 for instance and the marginal gain for using the higher order equations we decided to maintain consistency across months and use optimized 1st order linear equations for all months linear log solutions for the regression analysis provided higher loocv average absolute percent errors than the linear 1st order and polynomial solutions the final equations are provided in table 1 the result is that this model using three variables for each month can be used in late november when the precipitation data is available to predict the lake chad total surface water area for december and in early december when lake elevation data is available for november the model can be used to predict the total surface water area for january through may with the expectation of between 5 3 and 7 6 percent error on average this compares with table 2 the set of average absolute percent errors if the average value of the total water surface area for each month is used as a prediction and table 3 the set of average absolute percent errors if the previous year s total water surface area for the given month is used as a prediction for each of the months december through may the regression approach provides a lower average absolute percent error than either the average value used as a prediction or the previous year s area used as a prediction as an example for may the loocv average absolute error is 7 6 while the error using the average may area is 13 1 on average and the error when using the previous year s area for may is 15 6 on average using the average may lake area of 13 363 sq km these percentages are equivalent to 1017 sq km 1751 sq km and 2085 sq km respectively 5 discussion the lake elevation data show that the maximum average monthly elevation typically occurs in november though on occasion in october and once during our record in january it is curious therefore that the maximum area typically though not always occurs in february or march the reason for this seems to be the complex meteorology and hydrology of lake chad the movement of the water in lake chad is influenced by both the winds and the chari logone water supply monsoon winds drive the displacement of the southern waters toward the north and movement begins around the northeastern end of the great barrier in june at the end of the low water the chari logone flood waters begin in august and provide half of their water in october and november when the northeasterly wind known as the harmattan drives the water back toward the southern pool this is also when the satellite radar altimeters which collect data over the southern pool typically record the highest levels during the peak of the riverine flooding water again reaches the northern pool and also spreads into the archipelago from the south basin following the end of the movement of water to the north pool in january there is a general spreading of water in the southern pool to the periphery until april carmouze et al 1983 these movements result in a complex and changing lake surface topography and are likely the reason we find poor correlation between lake elevation and lake area a full parameterization of the lake chad system as implemented by delclaux et al 2008 using the gr b thmb model includes precipitation and reference evapotranspiration as inputs which are adjusted by a coefficient c set such that the nash coefficient is maximized for the monthly flows of the chari logone river system precipitation is then split between a soil reservoir with maximum capacity a and surface runoff the amounts depending on the level of water in the soil reservoir the soil reservoir drains through actual evapotranspiration and percolation which generates sub surface runoff elevation data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm are used for generating drainage directions and water accumulation areas two irrigation scenarios were modeled lake level data was used to validate the model results in comparison our model also uses precipitation and actual evapotranspiration as inputs though only for the wet season the timing of subsurface flow and surface flow through the river systems is simulated in our model by the delay between the wet season end and the month being forecast and by the hydrobasins shapefile for the southern lake chad basin which defines the limits of our representation of the lake watershed lake level is used in the gr b thmb model as memory of previous conditions whereas the lake area for the previous year is used in our model for this purpose unlike the gr b thmb model we do not model irrigation withdrawals as discussed in the introduction section this is a small part of the overall hydrology of the lake chad basin while the gr b thmb model uses stream flow data to calibrate the model and lake elevation to validate the model we use lake area estimates for these tasks and lake elevation as an additional input parameter the main limitation of the model we present here is that it is not a physically based model and may not perform well for conditions outside of those in the database we have developed for example we are not able to do regressions and provide predictions for wet season months because we do not have surface water area data for those conditions policelli et al 2018 also the performance may degrade if it is used outside of the range of areas for which the regression models were established 8 700 sq km 16 800 sq km or when the hydrology of the lake changes substantially such as when small lake chad transitions to normal lake chad at about 18 000 sq km there is no fixed date at which the model becomes unusable however if it is used for operational forecasting it would be wise to regularly update the model with new data as it becomes available 6 conclusions we have built a record of remote sensing data and model products precipitation evapotranspiration lake height and lake area for the lake chad basin and used this record to run a correlation analysis and a regression analysis from the correlation analysis see appendix we have found 1 the highest correlation between basin evaporation and total lake surface water area is 0 43 and occurs with a seven month lag 2 the highest correlation between lake height anomaly and total lake surface water area is 0 57 and occurs with a four month lag 3 the highest correlation between precipitation and total lake surface water area is 0 39 and occurs with a seven month lag 4 the highest correlation between percent of 1988 2016 average lake et and the lake total surface water area is 0 65 at zero lag time and 5 there is a correlation of 0 63 between the surface water area and the previous year s surface water area for the same month note that lake surface height is more closely correlated with total lake surface water area than is precipitation as might be expected from a measurement further downstream additionally basin et is closely correlated with basin precipitation as might be expected since the precipitation is the source water for et finally basin et is slightly more closely correlated with total surface water area than basin precipitation from our regression analysis we have derived a set of equations that can be used starting in late november for predicting the total surface water area of lake chad for a given month except november during the dry season the best of these in terms of r squared use all of our parameters wet season precipitation pws wet season south basin evapotranspiration etws wet season lake evapotranspiration percent of 1988 2016 average lakeetws lake height variation relative to 2002 2009 h and the previous year s surface area for the given month a though we are likely overfitting the data when using all of these variables the results of leave one out cross validation loocv testing and backward elimination variable selection show the best performing variables for december to be lakeetws pws and a for january they are etws h and a and for february march april and may they are pws h and a the regression equations perform at between 5 3 and 7 6 average absolute percent error in the loocv testing and outperform predictions made using the average value for the given month or the previous year s total surface water area the predictions using all of the equations derived from regression in this study can be made with only remotely sensed data and model outputs no in situ data is required though the chirps precipitation product uses rain gauge data as available any improvements in the measurement of the parameters we use in this analysis would likely improve the desired end result the

correlation between p et for the southern lake chad basin and the lake elevation variation relative to 1993 2002 for 1992 to 2017 and found the maximum correlation of 0 69 at four months lag time between these variables next we examined the correlation between the p et for the southern part of the basin and the lake surface area and found the maximum correlation of 0 37 at eight months lag time we also examined the correlation between the lake elevation variation and the lake surface water area and found the maximum correlation of 0 57 at four months lag time we found a maximum correlation of 0 43 for et vs the lake s surface water area at 7 months and a correlation of 0 63 for the surface water area versus the previous year s surface water area for the same month there is apparently memory of the previous year s area in the system to determine the value added by the et data to our analysis we examined the correlation between precipitation without subtracting et for the southern lake chad basin and the lake elevation and found an increase in the maximum correlation to 0 80 at four months lag time we found the correlation between the percentage of the 1988 2016 average lake et and the lake total surface water area to be 0 65 at zero lag time we also examined the correlation between precipitation and total lake surface area and found an increase in the maximum correlation to 0 39 at seven months lag time this is the same lag time as for the maximum correlation between et and total lake surface area and represents the time it takes for much of the net precipitation to make its way from run off in the southernmost part of the lake chad basin to flowing through the chari logone river system to reaching the lake and causing an increase in the lake area a surprising result of the correlation analysis is that the use of fldas et data in the analysis to produce p et causes a small decrease in the correlation numbers relative to what is achieved with precipitation alone note however that et is somewhat more closely correlated with total lake surface water area than is precipitation 0 43 vs 0 39 both at 7 months lag time precipitation and et have a maximum correlation coefficient of 0 93 with a one month delay between the two 
6868,lake chad is an endorheic lake in the sahel region of africa at the southern edge of the sahara desert the lake which is well known for its dramatic decrease in surface area during the 1970s and 1980s experiences an annual flood resulting in a maximum total surface water area generally during february or march though sometimes earlier or later people along the shores of lake chad make their living fishing farming and raising livestock and have a vested interest in knowing when and how extensive the annual flooding will be particularly those practicing recession farming in which the fertile ground of previously flooded area is used for planting crops in this study the authors investigate the relationship between lake and basin parameters including rainfall basin evapotranspiration lake evapotranspiration lake elevation total surface water area and the previous year s total surface water area and develop equations for each dry season month except november linking total surface water area to the other parameters the resulting equations allow the user to estimate the december average monthly total surface water area of the lake in late november and to make the estimates for january to may in early december based on the results of a leave one out cross validation analysis the equations for lake area are estimated to have an average absolute error

region of africa shared by chad nigeria niger and cameroon there have been numerous hydrological models developed for lake chad each of these has limitations relative to the statistical model for lake area we present here bader et al 2011 developed a hydrological model that simulates the water level in the northern pool southern pool and archipelago using riverine and direct rainfall inputs to the lake it also estimates total water area for each of the pools according to lemoalle et al 2012 the model results correspond well with satellite measurements of northern pool surface water area and with satellite measurements of the total surface water area from 1980 onward though these results are not quantified one disadvantage of this model is that it requires input of the chari river and komodougu yobe river discharges data that is not publicly available coe and foley 2001 report the results of a hydrological model of lake chad they describe a model with good agreement with the inferred lake area during simulations for the years 1954 to 1967 the inferred lake area is not a direct measurement of lake area but rather is derived from a relationship between lake area and lake level it is important to note that the hydrology of lake chad changed significantly in the 1970 s during its transition from normal lake chad to small lake chad and the model based on a coarse 10 km resolution digital elevation model may not be adequate to define the lake after this transition gao et al 2011 developed a hydrological model of lake chad they compared images of the lake extent from the model with images derived from remote sensing three image pairs were shown for october 31 1963 december 25 1972 and january 31 1987 each pair of images from the two earlier dates before the transition from normal lake chad to small lake chad looked quite similar though no numerical value was provided the model observation pair for the post transition period did not look very similar this raises the question of the utility of the model for producing lake area in the current post transition period lemoalle 2004 developed a crude expression for lake chad surface area based on a simplified water balance model and described it as a first approximation that model assumes no seepage from the lake and requires knowledge of the streamflow to the lake which as previously noted is not publicly available delclaux et al 2008 developed a hydrological model of the lake chad basin however the results they presented included streamflow and elevation but not surface area coe and birkett 2004 used upstream measurement of river height along with in situ stream flow and gauge height to estimate river discharge 500 km downstream and wet season height of lake chad greater than 600 km downstream their method though clearly relies on hard to obtain in situ measurements and does not include lake area the first objective of this paper is to assemble and examine a set of satellite and model based data for the southern lake chad basin relevant to developing a statistical model for the area of the lake during its flooding season this data set includes time series of satellite and gauge based precipitation and modeled et for the southern part of the basin modeled lake et data satellite based lake elevation data and satellite based estimated lake total surface water area given the limitations of the existing models described above the second objective is to develop a predictive statistical model for total lake surface water area using regression methods on the data set the regression method includes backward elimination variable selection and a leave one out cross validation loocv analysis to optimize the resulting statistical model 2 study area the lake chad basin is approximately 2 5 million square kilometers about eight percent of the african continent and the largest endorheic basin in the world gao et al 2011 lake chad is the terminal lake of this basin the northern part of the basin lies within the sahara and does not generate runoff that reaches lake chad delclaux et al 2008 for this reason we work with the southern part of the basin fig 1 the lake s average depth varies between 1 5 and 5 m any change in lake volume translates to a substantial change in lake shoreline and area lake chad flooded savanna world wildlife fund no date https www worldwildlife org ecoregions at0904 in the 1960s the lake s area was on the order of 25 000 sq km in the mid 1980 s its area was reported to be about one tenth of that size grove 1996 though it is not clear if that includes flooded vegetation if one includes flooded vegetation the lake s annual peak area for 2017 is estimated at close to 14 700 sq km policelli et al 2018 fig 2 shows the evolution of lake chad from the time of the earliest space based images of the lake below about 280 m asl the lake separates into a southern pool and a northern pool divided by the great barrier and the southern pool separates from the eastern archipelago of sandy islands lemoalle 2004 the population of the lake shore is around 2 million magrin 2016 and the people make a living through a combination of fishing farming and raising livestock sarch and birkett 2000 recession farming is an important method of farming in the region whereby farmers plant in the enriched soils following each year s flood pulse because of the complexity of the hydrology it is difficult to provide farmers with information on the timing of the floods and a sense of how large the flood is going to be in any given year this can be a serious problem for farmers who grow crops near the lake shore and periodically lose crops to flooding okpara et al 2016 according to sarch and birkett 2000 the farming start date at villages on the south west shore of lake chad begins in mid january to late february it seems reasonable to conclude that predictions of lake surface area made in late november or early december could be used for agricultural decision making for locations with similar start dates there are a number of dams and irrigation schemes in the river basins that drain into lake chad such as those of the chari logone and komadougu yobe river systems however at the large scale they do not amount to a substantial revision of the natural seasonal hydrological patterns which are largely determined by the west african monsoon and the position of the itcz birkett 2000 the surface of lake chad is not flat and level the barriers to flow from the southern pool to the northern pool and archipelago result in the water in these areas frequently being at different elevations additionally the local winds and flow of water from the chari river into the lake addressed further in the discussion section combined with the complex shape of the lake lead to an evolving lake surface carmouze et al 1983 lake surface elevation time series data used in this study refer to satellite based measurements made in the relatively small open water portion of the lake in the southern pool fig 3 presents areas of the lake at or below selected elevations the topographic data used to create fig 3 is from a 1 arc second 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem from the nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm the blue areas would correspond to lake levels limited by the accuracy of the dem if the lake surface were flat and the lake filled uniformly however since this is not the case the areas should only be viewed as providing context for lake chad landforms and hydrology according to leblanc et al 2011 most of the flooded area of lake chad is covered by aquatic vegetation including rooted and floating plants this area is not readily measured with optical remote sensing but must be accounted for to get an accurate estimate of total surface water area for the lake policelli et al 2018 lake chad receives 90 96 of its water from the chari logone river system zhu et al 2017 with the remaining coming from smaller tributaries and direct rainfall most of this water arrives from such a distance that the peak lake level and lake area occur months after the rainfalls that produce them the delay is due to the slow runoff and routing of flood water to lake chad from the southern portion of the basin where precipitation rates are highest leblanc et al 2011 it is the reason that the lake chad peak level and area take place in the dry season 3 data and methods 3 1 data the key datasets used for this research are 1 climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data

each of the altimeters used for lake chad elevation data have a ten day repeat time the accuracy of the lake surface elevation data for lake chad is approximately 0 29 m ricko et al 2012 lake surface elevation data are provided as the variation from the 1993 2002 mean height the fldas et model product is based on the noah 3 3 land surface model s total et which is the sum of bare soil evaporation evaporation of water intercepted by the canopy and transpiration weighted by the coverage fraction of each component mcnally et al 2017 the spatial resolution of the fldas et is 0 1 degree and we are using monthly data the fldas et data is available from october 1992 to the present fldas et has been evaluated against estimates from the simplified surface energy balance ssebop satellite data based model senay et al 2013 this evaluation indicates that fldas and ssebop et have significant but limited correlation r 0 5 for percentage et variations in west africa according to mcnally et al 2017 it is not entirely clear why the correlation between the fldas et and ssebop et is somewhat poor in west africa though it may have something to do with instability of the ssebop algorithm in that area we estimated the lake chad wet season et as a percentage of the 1988 2016 wet season average because most approximately constant at nearly 90 percent by our estimation of the lake consists of flooded vegetation and multiple types of vegetation are present it is a very difficult research problem to estimate the total monthly et from lake chad however because the ratio of open water to flooded vegetation is roughly constant over time we were able to estimate the lake et percent of average as the ratio of the open water evaporation for the full extent of the lake to the average open water evaporation for the full extent of the lake for 1988 2016 we used the complementary relationship lake evaporation crle model morton 1986 for estimates of lake open water evaporation the meteorological forcing data for the crle model were provided by noaa ncep doe reanalysis 2 the main validation work by the developers of the crle model was to compare model results with lake evaporation from water balance analyses for seventeen selected lakes on an annual basis the model results were within a maximum of seven percent of the water balance results monthly results suffered an unspecified degradation of accuracy morton 1986 the world wildlife fund wwf hydrobasins lehner and grill 2013 provided the shape file for the southern lake chad basin which was used to calculate rainfall and et for the portion of the basin that generates very nearly all of the runoff that reaches the lake the hydrobasins global database of basin shapes was developed using the wwf hydrosheds data lehner et al 2011 which has approximately 500 m resolution the hydrosheds product was developed using srtm data no validation description or accuracy assessment was found for hydrobasins lake chad total surface water area data from the research for policelli et al 2018 were derived from 1 1 km resolution land surface temperature lst data from the nasa terra satellite s modis sensor and adjusted using esa c band radar data from sentinel 1a and 2 total lake chad surface water area estimates by leblanc et al 2011 derived from 5 km resolution lst data from the meteosat mviri sensor and bias corrected by policelli et al 2018 the lst method for estimating lake surface water area is based on the fact that the lake including flooded vegetation is cooler than the surrounding landscape during the day leblanc et al 2011 monthly average area was used for this research this data was produced for the 1988 1989 dry season through the 2016 2017 dry season modis lst data with cloud cover greater than five percent were not used in the development of the lake area data the validation done for this data was comparison of the two datasets used to create the lake area time series the estimated lake areas for the two products during the period of overlap were within approximately three percent of each other 3 2 methods monthly precipitation and et were calculated for the southern portion of the basin from october 1992 to may 2017 using the hydrobasins shape file for this area the lake chad total surface water area time series was then checked for correlation with p et using a series of time lags to find the peak correlation it was expected that net precipitation p et would be more closely correlated to lake area than either of the components similarly the total lake surface water area was checked for correlation with the lake elevation data and it was expected that a close correlation would exist between these variables busker et al 2018 additionally the total lake surface water area was checked for correlation with the precipitation data and the et data for the southern portion of the basin the lake et percentage of 1988 2016 average lake et and the previous year s total lake surface water area next a multivariate regression analysis was performed using the datasets to establish equations linking total surface water area for a given month to one or more of the other independent variables in order to find the best relationship between the lake area and the independent variables we used several methods of regression 1st order linear regression 2nd and 3rd order polynomial regression and the linear log method of regression we also used the backward elimination method of variable selection to optimize the equations to mitigate the risk of overfitting the data we used the rule of thumb of ten data points for each variable included in the final equation harrell et al 1996 except for 1st order linear regression in which case as few as two data points for each variable included is permitted austin and steyerberg 2015 however we did not use less than six data points for each variable in our 1st order linear regression analysis the current year s total surface water area for each month during the dry season was the dependent variable the independent variables were 1 total wet season precipitation for the southern lake chad basin 2 total wet season et for the southern lake chad basin 3 wet season lake et as a percentage of the 1988 2016 average lake et 4 november typically the highest variation from the 1993 2002 mean lake surface height and 5 the total surface water area of the given month for the previous year a leave one out cross validation loocv was performed for the regression analysis in which one data point was left out the equation was generated using regression and the equation was evaluated for the one left out data point this was repeated for each yearly data point and an average absolute value of the percent error was determined for the total dataset for comparison the average absolute value of the percent error was also determined using the average total surface water area for a given month as the prediction and using the previous year s area as the prediction for a given month the study covered the time period from october 1992 to may 2017 which is the intersection of the period of available fldas evapotranspiration data and the available total lake surface water area data three years 2006 2008 were excluded from the study because of insufficient lake surface elevation data 4 results 4 1 datasets total monthly precipitation and et for the southern portion of the lake chad basin were calculated using chirps and fldas respectively fig 4 a shows the total monthly precipitation and et for october 1992 through may 2017 the trend lines indicate essentially no change over this time period fig 4 b shows the average monthly distribution of the precipitation and et for the southern portion of the basin for october 1992 through may 2017 june through october is usually considered the wet season and november through may is considered the dry season fig 4 b and leblanc et al 2011 fig 5 shows the percent of lake chad wet season average et from 1988 to 2016 the data exhibits an oscillatory behavior with a multi year cycle and the trend is essentially flat fig 6 a shows the lake elevation anomaly relative to the 1993 2002 mean level for october 1992 to may 2017 the trend line for july the only month with complete data not shown shows a slight level of decrease with high variability fig 6 b shows the average monthly lake elevation anomalies with respect to the 1993 2002 mean level for october 1992 through may 2017 note that the average level is highest in november during the dry season and lowest in june during the wet season fig 7 a presents the annual average dry season surface water area for lake chad from november 1992 through may 2017 as expected the pattern of the graph is similar to that of the graph of lake chad percentage of 1988 to 2016 average wet season lake et fig 5 the trend line shows an average increase of approximately 82 square kilometers per year in lake area over this period wet season data was not considered suitable for calculation of water extent because of cloud coverage and the fact that the lst method cannot distinguish well between soil moisture and flooded areas policelli et al 2018 the total surface water area includes both open water and flooded vegetation fig 7 b presents the average dry season monthly total surface water area for lake chad from november 1992 through may 2017 while the peak water elevation occurs on average in november the peak total surface water area occurs in march on average the peak total surface water area is not a sharp peak the two antecedent and two following months are not far from the maximum 4 2 a predictive model for lake chad total surface water area during this part of the research we asked the question for a given month how well can we predict the total surface water area of lake chad to address this question we investigated regression of the data to generate equations linking the independent variables to the dependent variable specifically we looked at 1st order linear equations equation 1 2nd order polynomial equations equation 2 3rd order polynomial equations equation 3 and linear log equations equation 4 1 a a b etws c lakeetws d pws e h f a 2 a a b etws c etws 2 d lakeetws e lakeetws 2 f pws g pws 2 h h j h 2 k a m a 2 3 a a b

the independent variables versus the average lake area for january from our regression analysis we found that for the equation types we examined 1st order linear equations provided the minimum average absolute percent error from loocv for december february and may for january march and april higher order polynomial equations provided slightly lower between 0 7 and 1 1 lower loocv average absolute percent errors however because of the lack of a physical explanation for some of the higher order terms a 2 and a 3 for instance and the marginal gain for using the higher order equations we decided to maintain consistency across months and use optimized 1st order linear equations for all months linear log solutions for the regression analysis provided higher loocv average absolute percent errors than the linear 1st order and polynomial solutions the final equations are provided in table 1 the result is that this model using three variables for each month can be used in late november when the precipitation data is available to predict the lake chad total surface water area for december and in early december when lake elevation data is available for november the model can be used to predict the total surface water area for january through may with the expectation of between 5 3 and 7 6 percent error on average this compares with table 2 the set of average absolute percent errors if the average value of the total water surface area for each month is used as a prediction and table 3 the set of average absolute percent errors if the previous year s total water surface area for the given month is used as a prediction for each of the months december through may the regression approach provides a lower average absolute percent error than either the average value used as a prediction or the previous year s area used as a prediction as an example for may the loocv average absolute error is 7 6 while the error using the average may area is 13 1 on average and the error when using the previous year s area for may is 15 6 on average using the average may lake area of 13 363 sq km these percentages are equivalent to 1017 sq km 1751 sq km and 2085 sq km respectively 5 discussion the lake elevation data show that the maximum average monthly elevation typically occurs in november though on occasion in october and once during our record in january it is curious therefore that the maximum area typically though not always occurs in february or march the reason for this seems to be the complex meteorology and hydrology of lake chad the movement of the water in lake chad is influenced by both the winds and the chari logone water supply monsoon winds drive the displacement of the southern waters toward the north and movement begins around the northeastern end of the great barrier in june at the end of the low water the chari logone flood waters begin in august and provide half of their water in october and november when the northeasterly wind known as the harmattan drives the water back toward the southern pool this is also when the satellite radar altimeters which collect data over the southern pool typically record the highest levels during the peak of the riverine flooding water again reaches the northern pool and also spreads into the archipelago from the south basin following the end of the movement of water to the north pool in january there is a general spreading of water in the southern pool to the periphery until april carmouze et al 1983 these movements result in a complex and changing lake surface topography and are likely the reason we find poor correlation between lake elevation and lake area a full parameterization of the lake chad system as implemented by delclaux et al 2008 using the gr b thmb model includes precipitation and reference evapotranspiration as inputs which are adjusted by a coefficient c set such that the nash coefficient is maximized for the monthly flows of the chari logone river system precipitation is then split between a soil reservoir with maximum capacity a and surface runoff the amounts depending on the level of water in the soil reservoir the soil reservoir drains through actual evapotranspiration and percolation which generates sub surface runoff elevation data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm are used for generating drainage directions and water accumulation areas two irrigation scenarios were modeled lake level data was used to validate the model results in comparison our model also uses precipitation and actual evapotranspiration as inputs though only for the wet season the timing of subsurface flow and surface flow through the river systems is simulated in our model by the delay between the wet season end and the month being forecast and by the hydrobasins shapefile for the southern lake chad basin which defines the limits of our representation of the lake watershed lake level is used in the gr b thmb model as memory of previous conditions whereas the lake area for the previous year is used in our model for this purpose unlike the gr b thmb model we do not model irrigation withdrawals as discussed in the introduction section this is a small part of the overall hydrology of the lake chad basin while the gr b thmb model uses stream flow data to calibrate the model and lake elevation to validate the model we use lake area estimates for these tasks and lake elevation as an additional input parameter the main limitation of the model we present here is that it is not a physically based model and may not perform well for conditions outside of those in the database we have developed for example we are not able to do regressions and provide predictions for wet season months because we do not have surface water area data for those conditions policelli et al 2018 also the performance may degrade if it is used outside of the range of areas for which the regression models were established 8 700 sq km 16 800 sq km or when the hydrology of the lake changes substantially such as when small lake chad transitions to normal lake chad at about 18 000 sq km there is no fixed date at which the model becomes unusable however if it is used for operational forecasting it would be wise to regularly update the model with new data as it becomes available 6 conclusions we have built a record of remote sensing data and model products precipitation evapotranspiration lake height and lake area for the lake chad basin and used this record to run a correlation analysis and a regression analysis from the correlation analysis see appendix we have found 1 the highest correlation between basin evaporation and total lake surface water area is 0 43 and occurs with a seven month lag 2 the highest correlation between lake height anomaly and total lake surface water area is 0 57 and occurs with a four month lag 3 the highest correlation between precipitation and total lake surface water area is 0 39 and occurs with a seven month lag 4 the highest correlation between percent of 1988 2016 average lake et and the lake total surface water area is 0 65 at zero lag time and 5 there is a correlation of 0 63 between the surface water area and the previous year s surface water area for the same month note that lake surface height is more closely correlated with total lake surface water area than is precipitation as might be expected from a measurement further downstream additionally basin et is closely correlated with basin precipitation as might be expected since the precipitation is the source water for et finally basin et is slightly more closely correlated with total surface water area than basin precipitation from our regression analysis we have derived a set of equations that can be used starting in late november for predicting the total surface water area of lake chad for a given month except november during the dry season the best of these in terms of r squared use all of our parameters wet season precipitation pws wet season south basin evapotranspiration etws wet season lake evapotranspiration percent of 1988 2016 average lakeetws lake height variation relative to 2002 2009 h and the previous year s surface area for the given month a though we are likely overfitting the data when using all of these variables the results of leave one out cross validation loocv testing and backward elimination variable selection show the best performing variables for december to be lakeetws pws and a for january they are etws h and a and for february march april and may they are pws h and a the regression equations perform at between 5 3 and 7 6 average absolute percent error in the loocv testing and outperform predictions made using the average value for the given month or the previous year s total surface water area the predictions using all of the equations derived from regression in this study can be made with only remotely sensed data and model outputs no in situ data is required though the chirps precipitation product uses rain gauge data as available any improvements in the measurement of the parameters we use in this analysis would likely improve the desired end result the

ichoku helped conceive the experiments and provided domain knowledge frederick policelli wrote the paper with contributions from all co authors declarations of interest none appendix we examined the correlation between p et for the southern lake chad basin and the lake elevation variation relative to 1993 2002 for 1992 to 2017 and found the maximum correlation of 0 69 at four months lag time between these variables next we examined the correlation between the p et for the southern part of the basin and the lake surface area and found the maximum correlation of 0 37 at eight months lag time we also examined the correlation between the lake elevation variation and the lake surface water area and found the maximum correlation of 0 57 at four months lag time we found a maximum correlation of 0 43 for et vs the lake s surface water area at 7 months and a correlation of 0 63 for the surface water area versus the previous year s surface water area for the same month there is apparently memory of the previous year s area in the system to determine the value added by the et data to our analysis we examined the correlation between precipitation without subtracting et for the southern lake chad basin and the lake elevation and found an increase in the maximum correlation to 0 80 at four months lag time we found the correlation between the percentage of the 1988 2016 average lake et and the lake total surface water area to be 0 65 at zero lag time we also examined the correlation between precipitation and total lake surface area and found an increase in the maximum correlation to 0 39 at seven months lag time this is the same lag time as for the maximum correlation between et and total lake surface area and represents the time it takes for much of the net precipitation to make its way from run off in the southernmost part of the lake chad basin to flowing through the chari logone river system to reaching the lake and causing an increase in the lake area a surprising result of the correlation analysis is that the use of fldas et data in the analysis to produce p et causes a small decrease in the correlation numbers relative to what is achieved with precipitation alone note however that et is somewhat more closely correlated with total lake surface water area than is precipitation 0 43 vs 0 39 both at 7 months lag time precipitation and et

6869,the stable isotopic composition of water δ 18o δ 2h is used to trace different components of the hydrological cycle particularly interactions between precipitation surface and ground water in greece insufficient spatial coverage for isotopes in precipitation hinders investigations of relationship between ground water and precipitation information that is required to help quantify aquifer replenishment rates we used precipitation geospatial ground water isotope data and general linear models glm to predict the spatial distribution of isotopes in phreatic ground water in greece prediction covariates of elevation latitude distance to nearest coastline drainage basin western vs eastern greece and amount of precipitation predicted 62 of the isotopic variance in ground water the glm model yielded predictions of the isotopic composition of shallow aquifers which allowed us to construct maps for use in hydrological and other forensic applications in greece a comparison of the stable isotope values predicted by our glm to those of existing precipitation models revealed that phreatic aquifers in greece are mainly recharged during the annual wet period between november and march as documented by the high overlap coefficients of 0 77 and 0 82 respectively rainy period biased aquifer recharge has implications for water quality and management issues for example nitrate pollution may be enhanced in the non growing rainy period when crop uptake is the lowest or for water resource management if climatic changes alter these temporal rainfall patterns keywords isoscape

shallow phreatic aquifers and weighted annual precipitation are often similar in their isotopic composition suggesting that ground water mainly represents average annual rainfall kortelainen and karhu

and karhu 2004 wassenaar et al 2009 dotsika et al 2010 west et al 2014 cerar et al 2018 this paucity of maps is primarily because of the difficulty to obtain sufficient coverage of ground water isotope data especially from alluvial aquifers showing high heterogeneity and complex spatial isotopic patterns moreover the delineation of key meteorological and physical factors controlling the isotopic composition of recharge over large spatial scales is limited by poor spatial and isotopic coverage of seasonal and multi decadal precipitation inputs data networks like the international atomic energy agency s iaea global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip www iaea org water monitor the isotope composition of precipitation on a monthly and multi year basis but often has insufficient geospatial coverage to inform most national or local ground water studies to overcome this limitation the iaea proposed a new regionalized climatic water isotope in precipitation model

isotopic evaluation of ground water resources to precipitation inputs are limited by sparse gnip coverage athens alexandropolis heraklion limnos methoni patras rhodes and thessaloniki and most of these stations have gaps in their time series here we examine the importance of spatio temporal precipitation inputs and controlling environmental variables in phreatic aquifer recharge in greece through a ground water and precipitation isotopic modelling investigation our objectives were to i collate available stable isotope data δ 18o δ 2h from shallow phreatic aquifers and springs at the greek national scale and to compare our results with several gnip stations ii develop a predictive general linear model glm of phreatic aquifer isotopic composition based on explanatory environmental variables e g elevation rain amount basin and iii to compare the mapped spatial patterns and importance of key controlling variables on ground water to those of monthly rcwip precipitation input grids differences or similarities between ground water isotopic composition and spatial patterns in monthly to annual precipitation inputs helped to reveal the importance of seasonality or other spatial controls on aquifer replenishment it is anticipated these findings can help inform and focus water resource management and conservation decisions by incorporating the spatial distribution patterns of

done using r v 3 3 2 r development core team 2008 to obtain a predictive glm model for greece the stable isotope composition δ 18o of ground water was used as a response variable and latitude sampling elevation distance from the nearest coastline and precipitation amount were independent predictor variables related to the isotope composition of precipitation clark and fritz 1997 the gtopo30 global 30 arc second elevation dem from the usgs database usgs 2008 with a resolution of 30 30 about 1 km was used to obtain elevation a precipitation amount layer was obtained from the worldclim global

through geostatistical modelling of precipitation amount data collected from 1960 to 1990 hijmans et al 2005 the spatial analyst extension of arcgis was used to extract elevation and precipitation values from raster layers and assign them to the ground water sampling points distance to the nearest coastline was generated using the sampling points shapefile and a boundary coastline polyline in arcgis mean annual precipitation and the distance from the coast were log 10 transformed to obtain normality we do not present the δ 2h model since it is linearly correlated to δ 18o through the strong mwl relationship plus available data for δ 2h were 30 fewer than δ 18o prior to the final selection of explanatory variables the covariance between the dependent variable i e δ 18o of ground water and the independent variables as well as interactions between the independent variables were examined through correlation matrixes and conditional plots to break down the analysis into regional

were conducted using arcgis v 10 1 3 3 comparison between ground water and precipitation isotopes a comparison between the modelled isotopic composition of ground water and precipitation was used to reveal areas and time periods where and when ground water and precipitation had similar or dissimilar isotopic compositions respectively reflecting the influence of rainfall or seasonality on recharging ground water exploratory data analysis was conducted on the data sets extracted from the spatial distribution maps of ground water and precipitation a kruskal wallis non parametric analysis of variance kruskal and wallis 1952 determined the significant difference p 0 001 between the median values in both data sets density distribution analysis was applied to compare isotope composition patterns between precipitation and ground water overlap coefficients ovl have been suggested for quantifying the affinity of overlap of two probability density functions matusita 1955 morisita 1959

of ground water in greece ranged from 10 9 to 4 8 while δ 2h values ranged from 23 2 to 74 2 table 1 in northern greece climate zones cz05 and cz06 had more depleted δ 18o values i e 10 9 and 10 8 respectively whereas climate zones cz03 and cz11 in eastern greece had more positive δ 18o values i e 5 1 and 4 8 respectively the regression for shallow ground water in greece matched that of dotsika

shallow ground water in greece was slightly higher than 10 0 indicating slightly more evaporative conditions in the different climate zones of greece the regression slopes ranged between 5 and 7 which was attributed to high uncertainty in generating the regression line due to the limited number and range of values of the individual data sets the d excess values of greek shallow ground water fig 5 ranged between 12 and 18 like precipitation and was similar in western and eastern greece the highest ground water d excess values 13 8 to 23 1 were in crete cz09 which affirmed the mediterranean sea as a significant moisture source to this island and the lowest d excess values 13 0 were in macedonia cz05 and thrace cz06 the mean d excess values in the peloponnese were 16 1 and 15 7 in cz02 and cz03 respectively whereas dotsika et al 2010 reported a mean d excess value of 25 3 for spring water in the peloponnese 4 2 comparing gnip precipitation stations to ground water two gnip stations thission and pendeli are in climate zone cz04 the precipitation amounts at these two stations differed because they are at different elevations 107 m and 498 m respectively the δ 18o in precipitation varied within a range of 5 8 for pendeli and 4 1 for thission with the most positive δ 18o values occurring in summer fig 6 ground water data in the cz04 zone exhibited similar temporal variations of δ 18o values ranging from 5 8 to 10 5 the ground water δ 18o values in cz04 overlapped with precipitation values during the wet and cold season the time when the ground water is mostly recharged by precipitation the ground water δ 2h values overlapped with the mean and sd of precipitation in the wet season as with δ 18o indicating the period when the recharge of the aquifers was occurring fig s1 of supplementary there is one gnip station in climate zone cz01 patras most of the annual precipitation occurs between october and april with the most positive δ 18o values in august the δ 18o and δ 2h values of ground water in climate zone cz01 ranged between 5 8 and 9 2 and 32 9 to 57 6 respectively and overlapped with precipitation in the wet winter period figs 6 and s1 there is one gnip station in climate zone cz05 thessaloniki with 3 years of data precipitation amount showed weak seasonal variation however most of the annual precipitation occurs in january april may september and december the δ 18o and δ 2h values of ground water in zone cz05 ranged between 6 2 and 10 9 and 38 1 to 73 6 respectively which overlapped with the winter wet period between november and march figs 6 and s1 taken altogether the limited spatial gnip data compared to ground water near these stations suggest that rainy period biased precipitation comprised most of the ground water recharge in greece 4 3 predictive ground water isoscape model the response variable δ 18o of ground water showed moderate negative correlation to ground water sampling elevation elevsamp latitude latit and distance to the nearest coastline logdsea but no correlation with precipitation amount logprec or the dummy variable drainage fig s2 the result of mallow s cp criterion indicated the number of variables that improved the glm fig s3 the cp p line showed good fits with three models a five parameter model with four predictors a six model parameter with five predictors and a seven model with six predictors our aim was to select the most parsimonious model hence the smaller model was selected the five parameter model with four predictors elevation sampling latitude distance to nearest coastline drainage distance to nearest coastline table 2 the model parameter estimates suggested the isotopic composition of ground water was mainly controlled by elevation of the sampling site which explained 45 of the isotopic variance the latitude parameter accounted for approximately 41 of the variance while around 10 of the variance was attributed to distance to nearest coastline the relationship between drainage basin and distance to the nearest coastline variable explained 4 of the total variance in total our predictive model explained 62 1 of the isotopic variance in ground water data of the training data set the top performing glm model was used to create a predictive isotope map fig 7 of shallow phreatic aquifers across greece by the following equation δ 18 o 3 812 0 001 e l e v a t i o

values were predicted in the northern part of greece along the mountain chains and extending into the interior from the nearest coastline in the north eastern part of greece more negative δ 18o ground water values were predicted which could be attributed to a continental and altitude effect precipitation during the wet season when the shallow aquifers are mostly recharged mostly originates from the atlantic ocean these vapour masses which arrive in greece by westerlies meet the mountain chains and rainout leaving the leeward area with less precipitation and more negative δ 18o values in precipitation the ground water isotope values showed a similar pattern to that of dotsika et al 2010 which affirmed the strong relationship between precipitation and shallow ground water to evaluate our glm efficiency nine statistical indices were calculated as shown in table 3 to compare the glm model with the model of dotsika et al 2010 the same statistical indices were determined for the latter by using the polynomial equation δ 18ospring 27 1 4 latitude 0 02 latitude2 0 00148 altitude to generate the predicted values of the same validation data set the validation test showed there was good agreement between observed and our predicted δ 18o values the glm showed good performance with all statistical indices relatively close to the optimal values the highest residuals between the observed and predicted δ 18o values were mainly observed in the mountainous areas where the most negative values are recorded and also in areas where interpolation uncertainty of the residuals is high due to the lack of data fig s4 the sampling elevation the latitude and the distance to the nearest coastline were plotted vs the δ 18o residuals fig s5 and confirmed that the model was not able to predict the most depleted values and showed that local factors i e independent of elevation latitude and distance to the nearest coastline play a role in the determining the isotopic composition of ground water however the model performed significantly better than previous efforts dotsika et al 2010 primarily because we considered more data and explanatory variables 4 4 comparing predicted ground water to rcwip monthly maps of the residuals of δ 18ogw δ 18orcwip δ 18o of modelled precipitation from the iaea rcwip are depicted in fig s6 kruskal wallis test determined that the difference between the median δ 18o values of precipitation and predicted ground water values was less significant in november p 0 471 0 001 and march p 0 01218 0 001 than for the rest of the year p 2 2e 16 0 001 table s2 in precipitation the δ 18o composition in november ranged from 12 1 to 5 2 with a median value of 7 3 whereas in ground water the values varied from 9 4 to 5 1 with a median value of 7 4 fig s7 the δ 18o values in precipitation in march ranged from 12 1 to 5 4 with a median value of 7 6 the density plots showed the overlap between the distributions of the two variables varied throughout the year fig s7 the overlap coefficient oc reached the lower values in the summer 0 20 in august and increased in fall until it reached a peak in november 0 77 fig 8 in september precipitation replenishes mostly soil moisture and only part of the rain water reaches the aquifer which explains the relatively low value of the overlap coefficient in winter the δ 18o composition of precipitation showed the most depleted values 14 5 the oc showed lower values in the winter months than november which was attributed to biased recharge due to snow storage and increased surface runoff due to exceedance of infiltration rate in march the oc reached a peak 0 82 indicating a significant replenishment of the aquifers the oc decreased significantly in april which could be attributed to vegetation uptake in may the oc decreased further indicating low recharge of the aquifers due to vegetation uptake temperature increase and lower rainfall amount hnms 2017 in the wet period as considered between october and april the δ 18o composition of precipitation ranged from 13 2 to 5 3 with a median of 7 8 whereas the predicted δ 18o composition for ground water ranged from 9 4 to 5 1 with a median of 7 4 fig 9 a the kruskal wallis test showed that the difference between the median δ 18o values of precipitation and predicted ground water values were significant p 3 0e 12 0 001 table s2 the density plots fig 9b showed overlap between the distributions of the two variables with an oc of 0 77 again indicating that ground water was strongly recharged by precipitation during the wet period this value can be used qualitatively as an estimate of ground water that originates from precipitation during the wettest period a spatial distribution of the residuals of δ 18ogw predicted δ 18orcwip of the wet period indicated that ground water was more enriched in 18o than precipitation at higher elevations or in the northern part of the country red 1 for interpretation of color in fig 10 the reader is referred to the web version of this article 1 colour in fig 10 in the southern part of the country ground water showed more negative δ 18o values than precipitation blue colour in fig 10 the difference in the isotopic composition between precipitation and ground water could be attributed to topographical and geological factors that contribute to non uniform recharge rates for example ground water sampling point elevation does not necessarily correspond to its recharge elevation especially when aquifers are hosted in karstic formations and the spring waters discharge at a great distance from the higher recharge area dotsika et al 2010 showed that the local isotope lapse rates for δ 18o present large variation on a regional scale ranging from 0 06 to 0 70 100 m due to significant difference of topographic relief in the country biases can also exist due to seasonal recharge i e snowmelt soil infiltration lag and evaporative processes ground water transit times vegetation variability event driven recharge and irrigation return flows jasechko et al 2014 spring snowmelt has been found to constitute an important fraction of annual ground water recharge especially in highly fractured systems where ground water recharge during spring freshet is expected to be an extreme and rapid process gleeson et al 2009 dripps and bradbury 2010 showed that in vegetated areas the volume of water moving down through the soil profile decreases and the size of the infiltrating pulse diminishes with depth 5 conclusions an isotopic survey and geospatial modelling of phreatic aquifers across greece revealed a close linkage of ground water recharge to the wet period precipitation large scale spatial patterns of δ 18o in shallow ground water were controlled by factors such as elevation latitude and distance to the nearest coastline a rainout effect resulted in 18o depleted values in eastern greece during the wet season the good performance of our glm allowed us to produce an accurate predictive isotopic water map of shallow ground water for greece this mapping depicted a large spatial distribution of rainy period biased recharge prevalent across the country which provides implications for both water and landscape management for example decadal and climatic changes impacting wet period rainfall could disproportionately affect ground water hydrological input predictions i e baseflow ground water extraction moreover rainy period biased recharge can disproportionately affect nutrient fluxes i e nitrate contamination to ground water in a non growing season when n uptake by plants and agriculture is lowest and the leaching potential from agricultural fields is the highest the mapping of differences in δ 18o between ground water and precipitation during the wet period showed overwhelming 77 overlap however the isotopic composition of ground water was generally more enriched in 18o in the mountainous areas compared to wet season rainfall perhaps due to topographic and geological variability ground water transit times or biases related to snowmelt or event driven recharge the isotopic evaluation of ground water resources relative to precipitation input can provide information on the replenishment of the water resources and insight into resources that might be vulnerable to

6869,the stable isotopic composition of water δ 18o δ 2h is used to trace different components of the hydrological cycle particularly interactions between precipitation surface and ground water in greece insufficient spatial coverage for isotopes in precipitation hinders investigations of relationship between ground water and precipitation information that is required to help quantify aquifer replenishment rates we used precipitation geospatial ground water isotope data and general linear models glm to predict the spatial distribution of isotopes in phreatic ground water in greece prediction covariates of elevation latitude distance to nearest coastline drainage basin western vs eastern greece and amount of precipitation predicted 62 of the isotopic variance in ground water the glm model yielded predictions of the isotopic composition of shallow aquifers which allowed us to construct maps for use in hydrological and other forensic applications in greece a comparison of the stable isotope values predicted by our glm to those of existing precipitation models revealed that phreatic aquifers in greece are mainly recharged during the annual wet period between november and march as documented by the high overlap coefficients of 0 77 and 0 82 respectively rainy period biased aquifer recharge has implications for water quality and management issues for example nitrate pollution may be enhanced in the non growing rainy period when crop uptake is the lowest or for water resource management if climatic changes alter these temporal rainfall patterns keywords isoscape ground water stable isotopes precipitation general linear model 1 introduction phreatic aquifers are an important water resource around the world but global consumption for agriculture industry and municipal usage has increased exponentially with population growth ground water abstraction rates are unsustainable in many parts of the world konikow 2005 wada et al 2014 malki et al 2017 martínez santos et al 2018 and estimates suggest that global abstraction represents 26 of total freshwater withdrawal from all sources and 8 of globally aggregated rate of ground water recharge wada et al 2010

of aquifer replenishment and particularly that proportion of annual precipitation that recharges aquifers can help to better assess aquifer resource status and inform sustainable use ground water recharge rates are controlled by inter related climatological hydrogeological and topographical factors soil type and vegetation coverage von rohden et al 2010 kim and jackson 2012 jasechko et al 2014 crosbie et al 2015 barbecot et al 2018 the use of stable isotope tracers in water resources management has been useful to better understand the components of the hydrological cycle and the interactions between them clark and fritz 1997 hobson 1999 harvey and sibray 2001 burnett et al 2004 bowen et al 2005 ehleringer et al 2008 matiatos et al 2014a previous studies have shown that shallow phreatic aquifers and weighted annual precipitation are often similar in their isotopic composition suggesting that ground water mainly represents average annual rainfall kortelainen and karhu 2004 lee and kim 2007 however some phreatic ground water systems differ from mean annual precipitation due to seasonally biased recharge i e snowmelt infiltration evaporative processes event driven recharge or by mixing with older ground water jasechko et al 2014 large scale mapping of the stable isotopic composition of phreatic aquifers are used as a proxy for revealing recharge zones to enable sustainable management of water resources regan et al 2017 showed that spatial distributions of stable isotopes in ground water in ireland are driven by climatic and hydrogeological factors sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 mapped δ 18o in shallow ground water in costa rica showing a strong orographic separation in recharge due to moisture from the caribbean sea and the eastern pacific ocean raidla et al 2016 presented a shallow ground water isoscape of the baltic artesian basin bab which revealed that the isotopic composition of shallow ground water was biased towards wintertime precipitation statistical models are often used to predict the isotopic composition of the components of the hydrological cycle and help to overcome sampling limitation terzer et al 2013 katsuyama et al 2015 baisden et al 2016 giustini et al 2016 birkel et al 2018 however few predictive models of the stable isotopic composition of phreatic ground water are available darling et al 2003 kortelainen and karhu 2004 wassenaar et al 2009 dotsika et al 2010 west et al 2014 cerar et al 2018 this paucity of maps is primarily because of the difficulty to obtain sufficient coverage of ground water isotope data especially from alluvial aquifers showing high heterogeneity and complex spatial isotopic patterns moreover the delineation of key meteorological and physical factors controlling the isotopic composition of recharge over large spatial scales is limited by poor spatial and isotopic coverage of seasonal and multi decadal precipitation inputs data networks like the international atomic energy agency s iaea global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip www iaea org water monitor the isotope composition of precipitation on a monthly and multi year basis but often has insufficient geospatial coverage to inform most national or local ground water studies to overcome this limitation the iaea proposed a new regionalized climatic water isotope in precipitation model rcwip which provides accurate precipitation amount weighted monthly to annual predictions for the isotopic composition of rainfall around the globe to spatial resolution of 10 arcmin terzer et al 2013 greece lies in the mediterranean region where sustainable water resource management is of critical importance especially given the semi arid climate and variability of hydrological characteristics ganoulis 2006 greece is 29th among 153 countries experiencing severe water stress in 2010 luo et al 2015 and many aquifers are overexploited or contaminated e g lambrakis and marinos 2003 stamatis and voudouris 2003 ground water extraction rates require informed long term pumping rate goals that balance ground water recharge input and ecosystem water requirements optimization of aquifer extraction requires better scientific definition of areas where and when ground water recharge takes place and a fuller understanding of the seasonal controls affecting aquifer recharge in greece comparative isotopic evaluation of ground water resources to precipitation inputs are limited by sparse gnip coverage athens alexandropolis heraklion limnos methoni patras rhodes and thessaloniki and most of these stations have gaps in their time series here we examine the importance of spatio temporal precipitation inputs and controlling environmental variables in phreatic aquifer recharge in greece through a ground water and precipitation isotopic modelling investigation our objectives were to i collate available stable isotope data δ 18o δ 2h from shallow phreatic aquifers and springs at the greek national scale and to compare our results with several gnip stations ii develop a predictive general linear model glm of phreatic aquifer isotopic composition based on explanatory environmental variables e g elevation rain amount basin and iii to compare the mapped spatial patterns and importance of key controlling variables on ground water to those of monthly rcwip precipitation input grids differences or similarities between ground water isotopic composition and spatial patterns in monthly to annual precipitation inputs helped to reveal the importance of seasonality or other spatial controls on aquifer replenishment it is anticipated these findings can help inform and focus water resource management and conservation decisions by incorporating the spatial distribution patterns of ground water into quantitative spatial water budget assessments e g good et al 2014 2 study area greece is geomorphologically diverse with mountains plains and coastal landscapes fig 1 the pindos mountains in central greece separate the spatial distribution of air temperature and precipitation the climate of greece is mediterranean csa characterized by mild and rainy winters and dry and warm to hot summers and subdivided into 12 climate zones zerefos et al 2011 voloudakis 2015 the coldest months are january february mean min temperature 0 10 c and the warmest months are july august mean max temperature 29 35 c hnms 2017 annual precipitation in greece averages 698 mm yr varying from 1837 mm in the west to 140 mm in the south east pnevmatikos and katsoulis 2006 fig 2 the wettest months are in winter 95 108 mm per month and the driest are in summer 16 20 mm per month panagos et al 2016 rainfall in greece is influenced by the mediterranean owing to a humidity deficit and strong temperature contrast between air and seawater especially in winter gat et al 2003 in winter precipitation is greater on the western windward slopes due to pindos mountain range and to frontal depressions moving in trajectories mostly from west to east from the atlantic ocean bartzokas et al 2003 in summer precipitation is greater in the mountains primarily due to convective rain associated with land heating metaxas 1978 kambezidis et al 2010 or with rain events produced by saharan depressions moving north northeastwards flocas and giles 1991 the complex stratigraphy of greece comprises fissured karstic aquifers and numerous springs aquifers are often in carbonate formations e g limestones dolomites and other fluvial and alluvial formations e g conglomerates sandstones whereas aquitards are in less permeable lithologies such as flysch metamorphic igneous and volcanic rocks carbonate formations are found in the central western and southern parts of greece covering approximately 35 of the country whereas neogene silt marl sandstone and conglomerates and quaternary deposits cover about 30 daskalaki and voudouris 2008 studies regarding ground water recharge estimations in any type of aquifer and or in catchment area scale are limited in greece e g lambrakis and kallergis 2001 zagana et al 2007 according to kounis et al 1983 the transmissivity of carbonate aquifers varies between 103 and 10 3 m2 s whereas annual replenishment reaches 12 109 m3 for the intergranular and mixed flow aquifers kounis et al 1983 found average transmissivity values ranging from 10 2 to 10 4 m2 s many greek aquifers are overexploited or contaminated e g lambrakis and marinos 2003 papatheodorou et al 2007 matiatos 2016 yet ground water is a key water resource for

ground water isotope data ground water stable isotope δ 18o δ 2h data for greece were assembled from various literature sources spanning 40 years 1976 2015 as summarized in table s1 most of the ground water sites have o and h isotope data 98 δ 18ο and 67 δ 2η for a total of 853 records the ground water sources were classified as follows 378 springs 38 wells and 55 boreholes fig 1 the analytical methods used for stable isotopic analyses typically reported co2 water equilibration δ 18o or zn reduction δ 2h and isotope ratio mass spectrometry with their results reported relative to the vsmow slap standard to ensure that ground water samples were contemporary only the ground water with tritium indicating modern recharge was considered the activities of tritium were expected to differ by reporting time tritium activities in precipitation were higher in the 1980 s whereas currently tritium activities vary between 5 and 15 tu gnip 2017 3 1 2 precipitation isotope data and predictive grids we obtained precipitation isotopic data for greece from the iaea gnip database www iaea org water for alexandropolis hellinikon airport athens heraklion limnos methoni patras pendeli athens rhodes thessaloniki and thission athens these stations were discontinuous over time or had operational periods of months to several years the greek local meteoric water line hellas meteoric water line argiriou and lykoudis 2006 and the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 were used for data comparison we obtained contemporary predictive amount weighted precipitation isotope δ 18o and δ 2h

rcwip html accessed november 2017 the rcwip model provides monthly and annual amount weighted precipitation δ 18o and δ 2h through geostatistical modelling of precipitation isotope data collected by gnip iaea wmo 2017 from 1960 to 2009 terzer et al 2013 3 2 ground water isotope predictive model a general linear model glm was developed to derive a ground water isotope prediction model and isotopic map for greece a standardized process kutner et al 2005 comprised data collection and preparation model selection and model validation fig 3 the development of the models and statistical test were done using r v 3 3 2 r development core team 2008 to obtain a predictive glm model for greece the stable isotope composition δ 18o of ground water was used as a response variable and latitude sampling elevation distance from the nearest coastline and precipitation amount were independent predictor variables related to the isotope composition of precipitation clark and fritz 1997 the gtopo30 global 30 arc second elevation dem from the usgs database usgs 2008 with a resolution of 30 30 about 1 km was used to obtain elevation a precipitation amount layer was obtained from the worldclim global climate data worldclim version 1 4 http www worldclim org accessed in june 2017 in raster format this dataset represents long term average precipitation amounts at a spatial resolution of about 1 km2 through geostatistical modelling of precipitation amount data collected from 1960 to 1990 hijmans et al 2005 the spatial analyst extension of arcgis was used to extract elevation and precipitation values from raster layers and assign them to the ground water sampling points distance to the nearest coastline was generated using the sampling points shapefile and a boundary coastline polyline in arcgis mean annual precipitation and the distance from the coast were log 10 transformed to obtain normality we do not present the δ 2h model since it is linearly correlated to δ 18o through the strong mwl relationship plus available data for δ 2h were 30 fewer than δ 18o prior to the final selection of explanatory variables the covariance between the dependent variable i e δ 18o of ground water and the independent variables as well as interactions between the independent variables were examined through correlation matrixes and conditional plots to break down the analysis into regional scales the variable drainage was added to distinguish basins located on the windward western side of the pindos mountain range drainage 0 vs leeward eastern drainage 1 basins fig 1 model over parameterization was reduced by eliminating variables that were correlated with other parameters e g temperature 3 2 1 model selection the selection of independent variables and interactions between them were obtained by the akaike information criterion aic the r2 p criterion and mallow s cp criterion as metrics of model selection among a priori candidate models kutner et al 2005 faraway 2014 the aic is the penalized log likelihood given by 1 aic 2 xlog likelihood 2 p 1 where p is the number of parameters in the model and 1 is added for the estimated variance the rp 2 criterion calls for the use of the coefficient of multiple determination r2 to define subsets for which r2 is high is given by 2 r p 2 1 s s e p s s t o where ssep is the error sum of squares and ssto is the total deviation or the sum of the square deviations the mallow s cp criterion corresponds to the total mean squared error of the n fitted values for each subset regression model the model was checked for constant variance and normality of the errors the first was achieved by examining residuals related to the fitted values and the calculation of the root mean square error rmse whereas normality was tested by comparing the residuals to the ideal normal observations 3 2 2 model validation our glm validation was obtained using the independent variables of the selected model to generate predicted values for a training set of 94 ground water stations 20 of the original data set withheld the data set used for validation was chosen randomly and checked for biases related to variability and geographical

gis to develop a predictive spatial distribution model of isotopic composition of phreatic aquifers across greece the top performing glm was applied using the digital elevation layer gtopo30 dem and the spatially referenced layers of the independent variables after model selection and validation the dem constrained cell resolution of the predictive model map to 30 x30 spatial distribution maps of residuals i e differences between observed and predicted δ 18o values using the calibration and validation data set were produced with kriging interpolation method spatial analysis and raster overlay were conducted using arcgis v 10 1 3 3 comparison between ground water and precipitation isotopes a comparison between the modelled isotopic composition of ground water and precipitation was used to reveal areas and time periods where and when ground water and precipitation had similar or dissimilar isotopic compositions respectively reflecting the influence of rainfall or seasonality on recharging ground water exploratory data analysis was conducted on the data sets extracted from the spatial distribution maps of ground water and precipitation a kruskal wallis non parametric analysis of variance kruskal and wallis 1952 determined the significant difference p 0 001 between the median values in both data sets density distribution analysis was applied to compare isotope composition patterns between precipitation and ground water overlap coefficients ovl have been suggested for quantifying the affinity of overlap of two probability density functions matusita 1955 morisita 1959

diagram and compared to the hellas meteoric water line argiriou and lykoudis 2006 i e δ 2h 7 24 δ 18o 8 2 and the global meteoric water line craig 1961 i e δ 2h 8 0 δ 18o 10 0 fig 4 the δ 18o values of ground water in greece ranged from 10 9 to 4 8 while δ 2h values ranged from 23 2 to 74 2 table 1 in northern greece climate zones cz05 and cz06 had more depleted δ 18o values i e 10 9 and 10 8 respectively whereas climate zones cz03 and cz11 in eastern greece had more positive δ 18o values i e 5 1 and 4 8 respectively the regression for shallow ground water in greece matched that of dotsika et al 2010 δ 2h 7 50 δ 18o 10 0 yielding δ 2h 7 53 δ 18o 10 6 n 377 r 2 0 89 fig 4 the slope was slightly higher and closer to the slope of the global meteoric line slope of 8 the y intercept of shallow ground water in greece was slightly higher than 10 0 indicating slightly more evaporative conditions in the different climate zones of greece the regression slopes ranged between 5 and 7 which was attributed to high uncertainty in generating the regression line due to the limited number and range of values of the individual data sets the d excess values of greek shallow ground water fig 5 ranged between 12 and 18 like precipitation and was similar in western and eastern greece the highest ground water d excess values 13 8 to 23 1 were in crete cz09 which affirmed the mediterranean sea as a significant moisture source to this island and the lowest d excess values 13 0 were in macedonia cz05 and thrace cz06 the mean d excess values in the peloponnese were 16 1 and 15 7 in cz02 and cz03 respectively whereas dotsika et al 2010 reported a mean d excess value of 25 3 for spring water in the peloponnese 4 2 comparing gnip precipitation stations to ground water two gnip stations thission and pendeli are in climate zone cz04 the precipitation amounts at these two stations differed because they are at different elevations 107 m and 498 m respectively the δ 18o in precipitation varied within a range of 5 8 for pendeli and 4 1 for thission with the most positive δ 18o values occurring in summer fig 6 ground water data in the cz04 zone exhibited similar temporal variations of δ 18o values ranging from 5 8 to 10 5 the ground water δ 18o values in cz04 overlapped with precipitation values during the wet and cold season the time when the ground water is mostly recharged by precipitation the ground water δ 2h values overlapped with the mean and sd of precipitation in the wet season as with δ 18o indicating the period when the recharge of the aquifers was occurring fig s1 of supplementary there is one gnip station in climate zone cz01 patras most of the annual precipitation occurs between october and april with the most positive δ 18o values in august the δ 18o and δ 2h values of ground water in climate zone cz01 ranged between 5 8 and 9 2 and 32 9 to 57 6 respectively and overlapped with precipitation in the wet winter period figs 6 and s1 there is one gnip station in climate zone cz05 thessaloniki with 3 years of data precipitation amount showed weak seasonal variation however most of the annual precipitation occurs in january april may september and december the δ 18o and δ 2h values of ground water in zone cz05 ranged between 6 2 and 10 9 and 38 1 to 73 6 respectively which overlapped with the winter wet period between november and march figs 6 and s1 taken altogether the limited spatial gnip data compared to ground water near these stations suggest that rainy period biased precipitation comprised most of the ground water recharge in greece 4 3 predictive ground water isoscape model the response variable δ 18o of ground water showed moderate negative correlation to ground water sampling elevation elevsamp latitude latit and distance to the nearest coastline logdsea but no correlation with precipitation amount logprec or the dummy variable drainage fig s2 the result of mallow s cp criterion indicated the number of variables that improved the glm fig s3 the cp p line showed good fits with three models a five parameter model with four predictors a six model parameter with five predictors and a seven model with six predictors our aim was to select the most parsimonious model hence the smaller model was selected the five parameter model with four predictors elevation sampling latitude distance to nearest coastline drainage distance to nearest coastline table 2 the model parameter estimates suggested the isotopic composition of ground water was mainly controlled by elevation of the sampling site which explained 45 of the isotopic variance the latitude parameter accounted for approximately 41 of the variance while around 10 of the variance was attributed to distance to nearest coastline the relationship between drainage basin and distance to the nearest coastline variable explained 4 of the total variance in total our predictive model explained 62 1 of the isotopic variance in ground water data of the training data set the top performing glm model was used to create a predictive isotope map fig 7 of shallow phreatic aquifers across greece by the following equation δ 18 o 3 812 0 001 e l e v a t i o

values were predicted in the northern part of greece along the mountain chains and extending into the interior from the nearest coastline in the north eastern part of greece more negative δ 18o ground water values were predicted which could be attributed to a continental and altitude effect precipitation during the wet season when the shallow aquifers are mostly recharged mostly originates from the atlantic ocean these vapour masses which arrive in greece by westerlies meet the mountain chains and rainout leaving the leeward area with less precipitation and more negative δ 18o values in precipitation the ground water isotope values showed a similar pattern to that of dotsika et al 2010 which affirmed the strong relationship between precipitation and shallow ground water to evaluate our glm efficiency nine statistical indices were calculated as shown in table 3 to compare the glm model with the model of dotsika et al 2010 the same statistical indices were determined for the latter by using the polynomial equation δ 18ospring 27 1 4 latitude 0 02 latitude2 0 00148 altitude to generate the predicted values of the same validation data set the validation test showed there was good agreement between observed and our predicted δ 18o values the glm showed good performance with all statistical indices relatively close to the optimal values the highest residuals between the observed and predicted δ 18o values were mainly observed in the mountainous areas where the most negative values are recorded and also in areas where interpolation uncertainty of the residuals is high due to the lack of data fig s4 the sampling elevation the latitude and the distance to the nearest coastline were plotted vs the δ 18o residuals fig s5 and confirmed that the model was not able to predict the most depleted values and showed that local factors i e independent of elevation latitude and distance to the nearest coastline play a role in the determining the isotopic composition of ground water however the model performed significantly better than previous efforts dotsika et al 2010 primarily because we considered more data and explanatory variables 4 4 comparing predicted ground water to rcwip monthly maps of the residuals of δ 18ogw δ 18orcwip δ 18o of modelled precipitation from the iaea rcwip are depicted in fig s6 kruskal wallis test determined that the difference between the median δ 18o values of precipitation and predicted ground water values was less significant in november p 0 471 0 001 and march p 0 01218 0 001 than for the rest of the year p 2 2e 16 0 001 table s2 in precipitation the δ 18o composition in november ranged from 12 1 to 5 2 with a median value of 7 3 whereas in ground water the values varied from 9 4 to 5 1 with a median value of 7 4 fig s7 the δ 18o values in precipitation in march ranged from 12 1 to 5 4 with a median value of 7 6 the density plots showed the overlap between the distributions of the two variables varied throughout the year fig s7 the overlap coefficient oc reached the lower values in the summer 0 20 in august and increased in fall until it reached a peak in november 0 77 fig 8 in september precipitation replenishes mostly soil moisture and only part of the rain water reaches the aquifer which explains the relatively low value of the overlap coefficient in winter the δ 18o composition of precipitation showed the most depleted values 14 5 the oc showed lower values in the winter months than november which was attributed to biased recharge due to snow storage and increased surface runoff due to exceedance of infiltration rate in march the oc reached a peak 0 82 indicating a significant replenishment of the aquifers the oc decreased significantly in april which could be attributed to vegetation uptake in may the oc decreased further indicating low recharge of the aquifers due to vegetation uptake temperature increase and lower rainfall amount hnms 2017 in the wet period as considered between october and april the δ 18o composition of precipitation ranged from 13 2 to 5 3 with a median of 7 8 whereas the predicted δ 18o composition for ground water ranged from 9 4 to 5 1 with a median of 7 4 fig 9 a the kruskal wallis test showed that the difference between the median δ 18o values of precipitation and predicted ground water values were significant p 3 0e 12 0 001 table s2 the density plots fig 9b showed overlap between the distributions of the two variables with an oc of 0 77 again indicating that ground water was strongly recharged by precipitation during the wet period this value can be used qualitatively as an estimate of ground water that originates from precipitation during the wettest period a spatial distribution of the residuals of δ 18ogw predicted δ 18orcwip of the wet period indicated that ground water was more enriched in 18o than precipitation at higher elevations or in the northern part of the country red 1 for interpretation of color in fig 10 the reader is referred to the web version of this article 1 colour in fig 10 in the southern part of the country ground water showed more negative δ 18o values than precipitation blue colour in fig 10 the difference in the isotopic composition between precipitation and ground water could be attributed to topographical and geological factors that contribute to non uniform recharge rates for example ground water sampling point elevation does not necessarily correspond to its recharge elevation especially when aquifers are hosted in karstic formations and the spring waters discharge at a great distance from the higher recharge area dotsika et al 2010 showed that the local isotope lapse rates for δ 18o present large variation on a regional scale ranging from 0 06 to 0 70 100 m due to significant difference of topographic relief in the country biases can also exist due to seasonal recharge i e snowmelt soil infiltration lag and evaporative processes ground water transit times vegetation variability event driven recharge and irrigation return flows jasechko et al 2014 spring snowmelt has been found to constitute an important fraction of annual ground water recharge especially in highly fractured systems where ground water recharge during spring freshet is expected to be an extreme and rapid process gleeson et al 2009 dripps and bradbury 2010 showed that in vegetated areas the volume of water moving down through the soil profile decreases and the size of the infiltrating pulse diminishes with depth 5 conclusions an isotopic survey and geospatial modelling of phreatic aquifers across greece revealed a close linkage of ground water recharge to the wet period precipitation large scale spatial patterns of δ 18o in shallow ground water were controlled by factors such as elevation latitude and distance to the nearest coastline a rainout effect resulted in 18o depleted values in eastern greece during the wet season the good performance of our glm allowed us to produce an accurate predictive isotopic water map of shallow ground water for greece this mapping depicted a large spatial distribution of rainy period biased recharge prevalent across the country which provides implications for both water and landscape management for example decadal and climatic changes impacting wet period rainfall could disproportionately affect ground water hydrological input predictions i e baseflow ground water extraction moreover rainy period biased recharge can disproportionately affect nutrient fluxes i e nitrate contamination to ground water in a non growing season when n uptake by plants and agriculture is lowest and the leaching potential from agricultural fields is the highest the mapping of differences in δ 18o between ground water and precipitation during the wet period showed overwhelming 77 overlap however the isotopic composition of ground water was generally more enriched in 18o in the mountainous areas compared to wet season rainfall perhaps due to topographic and geological variability ground water transit times or biases related to snowmelt or event driven recharge the isotopic evaluation of ground water resources relative to precipitation input can provide information on the replenishment of the water resources and insight into resources that might be vulnerable to
