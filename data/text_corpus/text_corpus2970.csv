14850,large uncertainties exist regarding the combined effects of pollution and impoundment on riverine greenhouse gas ghg emissions it has also been debated whether river eutrophication can transform downstream estuaries into carbon sinks to assess human impacts on the riverine and estuarine distributions of co2 ch4 and n2o two source to estuary surveys along three impounded rivers in korea were combined with multiple samplings at five or six estuarine sites the basin wide surveys revealed predominant pollution effects generating localized hotspots of riverine ghgs along metropolitan areas the localized pollution effect was pronounced in the lower han river and estuary adjacent to seoul while the highest ghg levels in the upper yeongsan traversing gwangju were not carried over into the faraway estuary ch4 levels were elevated across the eutrophic middle nakdong reaches regulated by eight cascade weirs in contrast to undersaturated co2 indicating enhanced phytoplankton production the levels of all three ghgs tended to be higher in the han estuary across seasons higher summer time δ13c ch4 values at some nakdong and yeongsan estuarine sites implied that temperature enhanced ch4 production may have been dampened by increased ch4 oxidation our results suggest that the location and magnitude of pollution sources and impoundments control basin specific longitudinal ghg distributions and estuarine carryover effects warning against simple generalizations of eutrophic rivers and estuaries as carbon sinks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon dioxide co2 estuary eutrophication methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o river impoundment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recent syntheses have raised estimates for global riverine emissions of co2 drake et al 2018 and ch4 rosentreter et al 2021 corroborating the widely recognized importance of river systems in the global carbon c cycle battin et al 2009 regnier et al 2022 many of the rivers included in the global syntheses have not been adequately monitored to address the large spatiotemporal variability in greenhouse gas ghg concentrations and fluxes drake et al 2018 rosentreter et al 2021 furthermore few studies have explicitly considered the effects of river eutrophication on phytoplankton co2 dynamics kim et al 2021 and associated ch4 production beaulieu et al 2019 recent changes in riverine trophic status add large uncertainties to estimating riverine emissions of co2 regnier et al 2022 ch4 rosentreter et al 2021 and n2o chun et al 2020 efforts have been made to conceptualize anthropogenically modified riverine metabolism based on the river continuum concept ward and stanford 1983 garnier and billen 2007 reservoirs created by dams have been evaluated as a primary source of ch4 emissions from inland waters deemer et al 2016 however given the varying emission rates with dam age and reservoir trophic status jin et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 it is presumptuous to expect certain linear relationships between river impoundments and ch4 emissions while impoundment effects can cascade down across serial dams and weirs to estuarine and coastal waters little is known about the coupled effects of the location and type dams weirs dykes and tide gates of impoundments and the location and magnitude of upstream pollution sources e g wastewater treatment plants wwtps on longitudinal distributions of ch4 and other ghgs along the river to sea continuum water pollution including eutrophication and organic pollution has long been linked to enhanced co2 emissions from various estuaries cai and wang 1998 frankignoulle et al 1998 guo et al 2009 however few studies have investigated gas specific seasonal patterns in the distribution of the three major ghgs along the river to sea continuum nguyen et al 2022 previous studies have observed pulse like increases in the concentrations and fluxes of one or two ghgs in the estuaries downstream of large pollution sources yoon et al 2017 these downstream effects can vary greatly with season and travel distance based on the synthesis of co2 emissions from 106 estuaries chen et al 2012 argued that lower estuaries and plumes carrying large riverine nutrient exports can promote photosynthesis generating c sinks while upper estuaries would generally function as co2 sources however this generalization of enhanced c sinks needs to be tested against the seasonal shifts between co2 sinks and sources as observed in the amazon river plumes valerio et al 2021 and coastal waters receiving the changjiang river plumes chow et al 2013 to assess the basin specific anthropogenic impacts on longitudinal distributions and seasonal variations in co2 ch4 and n2o two basin wide surveys from source to estuary along three impounded rivers han nakdong and yeongsan in korea were combined with five repeated samplings for 1 year at five or six estuarine sites in each basin fig 1 here we report only gas concentrations and departures from atmospheric equilibrium to avoid large uncertainties in estimating gas fluxes focusing on testing our hypothesis that anthropogenic perturbations by river impoundment and pollution vary with basins and reaches depending on the location and magnitude of perturbations stable c isotope ratios δ13c in co2 and ch4 were compared among estuarine samples and potential sources of these gasses to provide complementary information for tracking sources of ghgs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the three river basins drain 62 of the national land area of south korea combined with a part of the han river hr basin belonging to north korea table 1 hr nakdong river nr and yeongsan river yr are the first second and fifth largest in south korea respectively the predominant bedrock of the three basins includes precambrian gneisses and mesozoic granites while the upper reaches of hr and nr are surrounded by mountainous terrain containing paleozoic and cenozoic sedimentary rocks rich in carbonate and other clastic components shin et al 2011 the annual mean temperature and precipitation ranged from 12 5 c and 1450 mm in the hr basin to 14 7 c and 1519 mm in the nr basin respectively for the three decades from 1981 to 2010 korea meteorological agency the summer monsoon brings approximately 70 of the annual precipitation from june to september kim et al 2021 the three basins vary in land use population and number of dams and weirs on the mainstems and tributaries table 1 agricultural and urban land use increases longitudinally along hr and nr whereas the upper yr basin is intensely used for agriculture and urban settlements resulting in the highest basin wide agricultural 32 and urban 9 land use more details on the three basins are provided in supplementary information text 1 1 2 2 field surveys two basin wide field surveys were conducted during april 17 29 and july 13 27 2022 to compare the basin specific spatial patterns of the three ghgs between the dry april and wet july periods the surface water concentrations of the three ghgs and ancillary water quality components were measured from river sources to estuarine plumes at 15 14 and 13 sites for hr nr and yr respectively fig 1 table s1 as part of three year monitoring of ghgs sampling was repeated at five nr and yr or six hr estuarine sites five times from november 2021 to september 2022 at the two upper estuarine sites of each basin saltwater intrusion was restricted by a weir hr or estuarine dams nr and yr these sites were selected as freshwater endmembers under tidal influence spot water samples were collected at 10 20 cm below the surface either from a location 1 2 m away from the riverbank or along the estuarine thalweg riverine and estuarine samples were filtered through pre combusted 0 4 µm glass fiber filters on site or in the laboratory respectively text s1 3 the filtered riverine samples were frozen immediately prior to laboratory analyses within three days during water sampling a pre calibrated multiparameter probe was used to measure the in situ water quality text s1 3 including water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec salinity and dissolved oxygen do headspace equilibration was performed for 2 min using a 60 ml polypropylene syringe filled with a 30 ml water sample and a 30 ml ambient air following pre tested protocols jin et al 2018 the air temperature and barometric pressure were recorded during the headspace equilibration 2 3 laboratory analyses and calculations ghg concentrations in the ambient and equilibrated air samples were measured using a gas chromatograph 7890a agilent usa equipped with a flame ionization detector coupled with a methanizer for ch4 and co2 analyses and a microelectron capture detector for n2o analysis subsets of the gas samples from the two basin wide surveys were determined for stable c isotope ratios in co2 δ13c co2 and ch4 δ13c ch4

gas concentration calculations wannikhof 2014 and corrections for co2 undersaturated samples koschorreck et al 2021 is provided in supplementary information text s1 3 the departure of each dissolved ghg concentration from atmospheric equilibrium ghgde is reported as the difference ghg ghg eq where the atmospheric equilibrium level was calculated from the ambient gas concentration and the corresponding solubility constant wannikhof 2014 as a measure of oxygen consumption apparent oxygen utilization aou was calculated using the equation o2 eq o2 o2 was taken as the measured do while o2 eq was calculated as the do concentration at atmospheric equilibrium based on the coefficients provided by garcia and gordon 1992 the filtered water samples were analyzed for doc using a total organic c analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan estuarine samples were further analyzed for total nitrogen tn and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations apha 1995 as part of the qa qc standards with known concentrations and blank samples containing ultrapure water were analyzed for every 10 samples to check for instrumental stability and analytical precision the relative standard deviation for replicate water analyses was lower than 5 the data of chemical oxygen demand cod tn total phosphorus tp and chl a for the riverine sites and some of the estuarine sites were obtained from the closest monitoring stations of water environment information system https water nier go kr and marine water quality monitoring system https www meis go kr respectively 2 4 statistical analyses two data sets from the two basin wide surveys and five estuarine samplings were analyzed to identify significant factors for spatial variations in ghg concentrations and associated environmental variables after conducting shapiro wilk normality test one way analysis of variance anova on ranks kruskal wallis h test followed by dunn s pairwise multiple comparisons was performed to compare significant differences in mean concentrations of the three ghgs among the rivers or estuaries using sigmastat version 4 0 to establish the overall relationships among the ghgs and environmental variables principal component analysis pca was performed using two packages operating in r version 4 2 2 with the package factominer used for the analysis and factoextra used for visualization forward stepwise regression was conducted using spss version 29 0 to identify the critical contributing factors that could explain variations in ghg concentrations across the basins 3 results 3 1 basin wide surveys of ghgs and water quality the source to estuary surveys revealed basin specific longitudinal distributions and seasonal variations in co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations fig 2 table 2 the most outstanding pattern is distinctively high gas concentrations in the reaches around metropolitan areas fig 2 which include the lower middle and upper reaches of hr seoul nr daegu and yr gwangju respectively fig 1 while hr and yr exhibited the highest peaks of all three ghgs along the metropolitan areas during both sampling periods only ch4 peaks were found along the weir regulated middle nr reaches fig 2 when only the riverine sites were compared the mean concentrations of all three ghgs and their departures from atmospheric equilibrium were the highest in yr although significant differences were not found for ch4 table 2 co2 mean 106 μatm across the weir sites from nr6 to nr9 along the middle nr reaches shown in fig 2 was undersaturated relative to atmospheric equilibrium 426 μatm in contrast the mean ch4 concentration 785 nmol l 1 at the same sites was higher than the saturation level 3 1 nmol l 1 by 253 fold although the means were not significantly different paired t test p 0 38 ch4 concentrations in the same reaches were higher in july mean 968 nmol l 1 than in april 541 nmol l 1 in contrast to the weakened july peaks of ch4 in hr and yr n2o peaks in hr and yr were also lowered in july fig 2 large decreases in co2 concentrations were observed only at a few sites in hr and yr in july in line with the highest ghg levels at the riverine sites of yr most of the water quality components exhibited the most severe contamination as indicated by the highest levels of doc cod chl a tn and tp table s2 while the means of organic contamination indicators doc and cod and phytoplankton biomass chl a were intermediate at the nr riverine sites the highest levels of chl a up to 92 1 μg l 1 contrasted with the lowest n p ratios down to 15 at some weir sites in july reflecting the month long occurrence of severe cyanobacterial blooms in this year the yr estuarine sites also displayed the highest levels of organic contamination among the three estuaries whereas chl a tn and tp concentrations were the highest at the hr estuarine sites table s2 when pca was conducted for the whole data set fig s1 and separately for the riverine and estuarine sites fig 3 two principal components accounted for 52 the whole data to 59 the riverine data of total variations refer to table s3 for correlation coefficients between five identified principal components and environmental variables despite substantial overlapping in both riverine and estuarine pca biplots the yr riverine sites and hr estuarine sites exhibited larger deviations in variable correlations than the other basins fig 3 for the riverine sites the first principal component dim1 had strong positive correlations with variables including ch4 ch4 departures from atmospheric equilibrium doc cod and tp whereas the second principal component dim2 was highly correlated either negatively with ph and do or positively with aou pco2 and co2 departures table s3 fig s2 in comparison the first principal component identified for the estuarine data included more diverse correlating variables which generally had lower correlation values than those of the riverine data except for salinity and tn fig s2 the individual relationships between aou and co2 departures for the riverine sites were consistent across the three basins for a narrow range of aou around zero fig 4 however large departures from the 1 1 line were found at some yr and nr sites belonging to the upper and lower aou ranges respectively although ch4 and n2o departures displayed no consistent relationship with aou it was notable that exceptionally high n2o levels were found at some yr sites in a narrow sub zero aou range and that high ratios of ch4 to co2 existed across a wide range of sub zero aou fig 4 the whole data fig s3 and the estuarine data fig s4 exhibited slightly to widely different patterns from those of the riverine data indicating a separation of the riverine and estuarine data in the relationship between aou and ghgs some of the highly correlated variables identified using pca also significantly contributed to the forward stepwise regressions involving the three ghgs and associated environmental variables table 3 interestingly the most significant contributors did not only differ among the three ghgs but also the key contributing variables were specific to each basin significant contributors to spatial variations in co2 included ph the distance from the most downstream dam and tn tn and tp were common contributors to the overall variation in ch4 and n2o table 3 however for a specific basin spatial variations in ch4 were also explained by aou nr and n p and chl a yr in the case of n2o the nr basin did not have any significant contributing variables whereas two or three variables explained 39 and 58 of the variation for hr chl a and tn and yr tn cod and n p respectively 3 2 spatiotemporal variations in estuarine ghg concentrations and δ13c the yearlong monitoring of estuarine ghgs revealed distinct inter basin differences and large seasonal variations in the longitudinal concentration distribution fig 5 the mean concentrations of all three ghgs were 2 3 fold higher in the hr estuary than in the other estuaries although statistical significance was found only for co2 table 2 while the gas concentrations dropped to the lowest levels after passing through the yr and nr estuarine dams those of the hr estuary remained relatively high across the estuarine reaches downstream of the weir all three estuaries were supersaturated in ch4 with concentrations generally decreasing from riverine water to seawater fig 5 table 2 relatively high ch4 concentrations at the first yr estuarine site 717 nmol l 1 in april 151 nmol l 1 in july decreased drastically along estuarine plumes downstream of the estuarine dam ranging from 19 to 84 nmol l 1 in line with the high ch4 concentrations along the middle to lower nr reaches fig 2 ch4 concentrations in the nr estuary remained relatively high across the estuarine dam down to nr12 with a mean of 201 nmol l 1 at sites nr10 nr12 although n2o concentrations were the highest at the yr riverine sites mean 199 nmol l 1 anova on ranks p 0 008 the estuarine mean n2o concentration 18 nmol l 1 was the lowest among the three estuaries p 0 69 table 2 these inter basin differences in estuarine n2o concentrations were consistent with the corresponding differences in water quality components including tn tp and chl a table s2 the effects of upstream riverine inputs on estuarine co2 and ch4 concentrations were also reflected by the spatial and seasonal variations in the δ13c values of both gasses measured across the three basins in april and july 2022 fig 6 the overall longitudinal patterns were similar across the basins however the δ13c values in july tended to be lower for co2 but higher for ch4 than the counterparts in april particularly at sites upstream of the weir or estuarine dams very low co2 concentrations did not allow for isotope analysis at the two upstream sites of the nr estuarine dam the δ13c co2 values in the upper hr and yr estuaries were significantly lower in july than in april t test p 0 02 in contrast there were pronounced increases in δ13c ch4 in the upper nr and yr estuaries in july although seasonal differences in δ13c co2 were not distinct in the estuarine plumes substantial increases in δ13c ch4 were also observed across the lower estuarine sites in july fig 6 this upward shift in δ13c ch4 in july was also evident when the relationships between the concentrations and δ13c of the two gasses were compared between the two sampling periods fig 7 across all estuaries except hr11 the δ13c ch4 values were consistently higher in july than in april when the δ13c co2 ranges at the estuarine sites were compared with those of the headwater streams 22 6 to 23 4 the decreases in δ13c co2 found in july reflected the increased input of co2 derived from upland soils table 4 fig 6 the increases in δ13c ch4 observed at some estuarine sites in july up to 17 3 exceeded the usual ranges of δ13c ch4 observed for major biogenic sources in the three basins including river bottom sediment 55 0 wetland floodwater 48 4 and wwtp effluents 45 8 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 an environmental anna karenina principle basin specific controls on ghg variations the three basins are under common anthropogenic stresses they are all regulated by multiple 8 27 dams and weirs and plagued by chronic water pollution problems associated with nutrients and organic waste released from metropolitan and agricultural areas table 1 despite this commonality the three basins exhibited unique spatiotemporal variations in riverine and estuarine ghg concentrations figs 2 5 implying basin specific sets of controls out of various environmental factors this basin specificity can be called an environmental anna karenina principle following leo tolstoy s novel anna karenina which begins with all happy families are alike each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way as observed in other basin scale studies borges et al 2018 mwanake et al 2022 the predominant effects of water pollution on the longitudinal distribution of the three ghgs were pronounced in the upper yr and lower hr reaches adjacent to pollution sources fig 2 although the yr basin has a smaller population than the hr basin 1 9 million vs 20 9 million agricultural and urban land uses around the upper yr are more concentrated within the relatively small area compared to the lower hr traversing the wider seoul metropolitan area fig 1 table 1 this difference in land use combined with the large capacity of advanced wastewater treatments yoon et al 2017 can explain the highest levels of eutrophication and organic pollution observed in the upper yr table s2 sin and lee 2020 the concurrence of high levels of ghgs and water pollution along the upper yr was well illustrated by the correlating water quality variables tp doc and cod and ch4 or n2o in the pca biplots fig 3 and the significant contributors to the forward stepwise regressions explaining variations in ch4 tn n p and chl a and n2o tn cod and n p in the yr table 4 both eutrophication and organic pollution also appeared to induce strong downstream effects on all three ghgs along the relatively long hr estuary figs 2 5 the localized ghg peaks have been ascribed to wwtp effluents and urban runoff that deliver loads of ghgs and labile organic pollutants via tributaries or directly to the hr mainstem yoon et al 2017 jin et al 2018 chun et al 2020 while the contribution of wwtp effluents is usually greater during dry periods incomplete waste treatment at low temperatures has been suggested as a trigger for the extremely large winter peaks of n2o in the lower hr chun et al 2020 although the environmental impacts of water pollution have been studied extensively in the yr basin sin and lee 2020 this study is the first to report the basin wide ghg distributions the localized ghg peaks along the upper yr fig 2 fall within the upper ranges observed worldwide and even approach extremely high levels of ghgs in highly contaminated rivers affected by untreated sewage nguyen et al 2022 patel et al 2023 the concurrence of exceptionally high levels of ch4 and undersaturated co2 levels along the middle to lower nr reaches fig 2 implied other contributing factors besides nutrients and organic waste discharged from the two metropolitan areas daegu and busan most importantly the middle nr reaches are regulated by eight cascade weirs so flow regulation is much stronger than in the other rivers fig 1 while the other rivers are also impounded across scattered reaches the serial weirs are unique in that they regulate an approximately 180 km eutrophic stretch with eight consecutive run of the river structures cascade dams on the regulated reaches can induce deviations from natural patterns or the serial discontinuities termed by ward and stanford 1983 in riverine metabolic processes that are usually considered to vary gradually along the longitudinal continuum vannote et al 1980 in terms of discontinuity distance which refers to the distance from a dam where impoundment induced perturbations persist ward and stanford 1983 the nr reaches impounded by the cascade weirs appear more vulnerable to cyanobacteria blooms and associated methanogenesis than the other impounded reaches of the nr and other basins as a consequence of weir construction from 2009 to 2011 flows have slowed resulting in a five fold increase in the cumulative hydraulic retention time between the most upstream and downstream weirs to 46 days lee et al 2018 peak monsoonal flows in the lower nr have been lowered from 2000 m3 s 1 during the pre regulation periods 2005 2009 to 1300 m3 s 1 during 2012 2016 kim et al 2021b slowed and reduced flows combined with seasonal increases in nutrient inputs from metropolitan areas and industrial complexes may have exacerbated sporadic eutrophic conditions favorable for cyanobacterial blooms in recent years as indicated by summer time increases in po4 3 concentrations in the impounded reaches kim et al 2021b an analysis of long term data from the lower nr from 1993 to 2016 suggested that temporary increases in p availability by monsoonal floods flushing p from terrestrial sources can trigger episodic cyanobacterial blooms given the increasing role of p availability as a limiting factor in the overall decreasing nutrient trends in response to continuous efforts to enhance water quality in the basin kim et al 2020 eutrophication indices tn tp and chl a at the three nr weir sites displayed higher eutrophic levels in july than in april with the highest chl a concentration at nr7 92 1 μg l 1 exceeding that of the yr table s2 the relationship between summer time increases in ch4 and cyanobacterial blooms along the impounded nr reaches was also indicated by aou and tp which were identified as the key contributors to the forward stepwise regression involving environmental variables and ch4 concentrations table 3 the elevated ch4 concentrations along the eutrophic impounded reaches agree with recent studies that have reported enhanced ch4 emissions from eutrophic rivers and reservoirs jin et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 sun et al 2021 nguyen et al 2022 while an enhanced phytoplankton production in impoundments can lower co2 levels temporarily during the productive daytime or during the short term responses to early stages of eutrophication degrading phytoplankton biomass after passing a threshold can supply metabolic sources for both aerobic decomposers kim et al 2021a and anaerobic methanogens vachon et al 2020 the concurrence of enhanced co2 uptake and ch4 production in the eutrophic impounded reaches of nr and other basins was also illustrated by the clustered sites on the relationships between aou and co2 or ch4 departures fig 4 across the negative ranges of aou which indicate more o2 generated from phytoplankton production than the level expected from consumption by biodegradation ch4 departures and ch4 co2 ratios at the eutrophic sites were clearly distinguished from those of the other sites ch4 co2 ratios have been observed to increase with intensifying anaerobic conditions both in unperturbed rivers with large riparian wetlands such as the amazon richey et al 1988 and in highly polluted rivers and estuaries borges et al 2018 nguyen et al 2021 the same inverse relationship was found between do and n2o jin et al 2018 borges et al 2018 in this study however there was no consistent relationship between the two variables except for the extremely high n2o concentrations found at some highly n enriched yr sites clustered around sub zero aou levels fig 4 our previous study conducted in the lower hr found high levels of n2o under a narrow range of hypoxic conditions in contrast to large concentration decreases under anoxic conditions where complete denitrification or hampered nitrification drastically lowered n2o levels chun et al 2020 localized pollution effects observed in the lower hr reaches were reflected by higher ghg concentrations in the hr estuary close to seoul compared to a limited downstream effect of the highest ghg levels found in the upper yr on the yr estuary fig 5 although most of the ghg and water quality measurements in the upper yr exhibited the highest levels among the three basins the downstream elongation of the large concentration peaks was generally limited to the first estuarine site despite the small basin size the relatively large reservoir created by the estuarine dam and mixing by seawater downstream appear to efficiently dilute the inflowing upstream ghgs and other solutes in contrast large concentration peaks observed along the weir impounded nr reaches cascaded across the estuarine dam and left relatively large footprints along the downstream estuarine sites fig 5 indicating an elongated discontinuity distance 4 2 sources of estuarine ghgs while all ghg concentrations were distinctively higher in the hr estuary across seasons seasonal increases in ch4 production and oxidation in the estuary or upstream sources were also indicated by changes in concentrations fig 5 and δ13c ch4 at some nr and yr estuarine sites fig 6 we cannot preclude the active transformation of om in the bottom sediment and overlying water as an important estuarine source of co2 and ch4 borges and abril 2011 wells et al 2020 however upstream riverine inputs of ghgs labile om and nutrients may have driven the observed spatiotemporal variations in estuarine ghg concentrations given the proximity of the major pollution sources as a primary control fig 5 the direct influence of co2 derived from proximate pollution sources in the seoul metropolitan area was reflected by the similar δ13c co2 values found for the estuarine samples 16 4 table 4 and wwtp effluents 17 3 table 4 which are close to our previous measurements for the lower hr mainstem 17 4 to 16 7 jin et al 2018 but differ distinctly from those of headwater streams 22 6 table 4 however depletion of 13c in co2 observed across the upper estuarine sites of the three basins in july indicates the overriding influence of soil derived co2 with low δ13c values during each season the enrichment of 13c in co2 at the nr and yr estuarine sites as well as the impounded sites across the basins may reflect the concomitant effects of physical gas evasion and photosynthesis both of which usually enrich 13c in the remaining co2 molecules via the preferential removal of lighter 12c isotopes finlay et al 2004 jin et al 2018 the levels of ch4 in the three estuaries ranging from 0 007 1 5 μmol l 1 table 2 fig 5 fall within the mid to upper ranges observed in nine european tidal estuaries 0 002 3 6 μmol l 1 middelburg et al 2002 and a global synthesis of streams and rivers 0 1 4 μmol l 1 borges and abril 2011 and estuaries 0 002 6 5 μmol l 1 borges and abril 2012 different locations and magnitudes of peak ch4 concentrations in the three basins can be translated into basin specific predominant sources of estuarine ch4 wastewater effluents in the lower hr agricultural and urban drainage waters in the upper yr and sediments rich in om derived from enhanced phytoplankton production in the weir regulated nr reaches stable carbon isotope measurements support estuary specific dynamic changes in the production and consumption of ch4 fig 6 compared to the typical ranges of δ13c ch4 for acetoclastic 70 to 32 and hydrogenotrophic 115 to 55 methanogenesis wells et al 2020 and prior measurements of δ13c ch4 in wwtp effluents in the lower hr 48 5 table 4 the δ13c ch4 in the upper hr estuary indicated a strong influence of wwtps and oxidation induced enrichment of 13c in ch4 in comparison the more 13c depleted ch4 along the nr and yr estuaries implied proximate methanogenic sources within the estuary or adjacent upstream areas the gradual shift from enrichment to depletion of 13c in ch4 along the estuary is consistent with previous studies conducted in the lower hr jin et al 2018 and estuaries of north america sansone et al 1999 and europe jacques et al 2021 jin et al 2018 observed a downstream decrease in δ13c ch4 from 36 6 to 48 6 along the lower hr and linked this change to urban tributary inputs carrying wwtp effluents the enriched isotopic signatures observed in july across the three basins except at the upper hr estuarine sites fig 6 can be ascribed to temperature enhanced ch4 oxidation enriching 13c in ch4 whitcar 1999 and some concomitant effect of monsoonal flows carrying wwtps isotopic fractionation factors ε for ch4 oxidation were estimated to range from 4 2 12 0 in five american estuaries sansone et al 1999 to 12 8 in the scheldt estuary jacques et al 2021 high oxidation rates were observed in freshwater and brackish estuarine parts at low salinity compared to marine waters where methanotrophic activity can be adversely affected by high salinity borges and abril 2011 although the observed spatial and seasonal patterns of co2 and ch4 in the three basins indicate the predominant influence of riverine ghg inputs further research is required to elucidate the roles of estuarine processes affecting the distributions of co2 and ch4 along the freshwater to marine continuum as illustrated by the distinct separation of the contributing factors identified using pca for inter estuarine differences in ghgs between hr on one hand and nr and yr on the other fig 3 estuarine processing of organic sources indicated by doc and chl a can significantly alter both co2 and ch4 distributions along estuarine plumes while a previous study conducted in the nr estuary suggested riverine inputs of ch4 as the most probable cause for gradual seaward decreases in ch4 concentrations it was also noted that organic rich sediments accumulated near the estuarine dam could function as a local hot spot for methanogenesis ryu and an 2016 in estuaries with an appreciable coverage of tidal flats and marshes as the case of the hr estuary the lateral tidal pumping transferring ch4 from riparian sources can also play an important role in driving spatiotemporal variations in ch4 concentrations bartlett et al 1985 sulfate reducing bacteria can outcompete methanogens for available carbon substrates acetate fermentation or hydrogen co2 reduction in saline environments with dissolved sulfate concentrations greater than 200 mmol l 1 capone and kiene 1988 because freshwater marshes upstream of the nr and yr estuarine dams are protected from the intrusion of saltwater containing high sulfate concentrations this anthropogenic alteration of tidal environments may have enhanced baseline ch4 emissions from the impacted estuarine reaches warranting further research 4 3 implications for global riverine and estuarine ghg emissions consistent with the global syntheses that have evaluated river systems as sources of co2 to the atmosphere lauerwald et al 2015 drake et al 2018 many of the sampling sites in this study exhibited supersaturated co2 levels indicating the role of the three rivers as c sources however undersaturated co2 levels were also found at some of the upper reaches of hr and nr and the impounded reaches of the three basins fig 2 in particular co2 undersaturation was the strongest at the weir regulated nr sites among all impoundment sites and consistent across the dry and monsoon seasons the undersaturation of co2 along the upper reaches of hr and nr can be explained by the carbonate chemistry associated with the predominant bedrock carbonate and clastic sedimentary rocks maintaining high ph and alkalinity but a low pco2 below atmospheric equilibrium shin et al 2011 in contrast the consistent co2 undersaturation along the impounded nr reaches may have been exacerbated by phytoplankton blooms prevailing under regulated and eutrophic conditions as has often been observed in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs pacheco et al 2014 sun et al 2021 the elongated co2 sinks along the plumes downstream of the nr estuarine dam may imply that the inflowing eutrophic estuarine water can lower the surface water pco2 in the receiving coastal waters at least during warm periods when the phytoplankton uptake of co2 can significantly exceed the rate of co2 production from om degradation despite the observed co2 undersaturation it may become a hasty generalization to consider the impounded river and downstream estuarine reaches as c sinks based on two time measurements as reported by recent studies employing continuous sensor measurements pco2 levels in eutrophic lakes and rivers tend to show large diel variations often resulting in nocturnal co2 effluxes exceeding the diurnal phytoplankton co2 uptake vachon et al 2020 furthermore eutrophication enhanced ch4 emissions can compensate for reduced co2 emissions during short periods of high primary productivity beaulieu 2019 vachon et al 2020 sun et al 2021 when gas emissions from the impounded reaches nr7 nr9 were estimated based on the measured gas concentrations and a representative value of gas transfer velocity k recommended for large rivers in the temperate zone 19 3 cm h 1 lauerwald et al 2015 co2 and ch4 emissions ranged from 133 6 to 86 1 mmol co2 m 2 d 1 and from 31 2 to 181 3 mmol ch4 m 2 d 1 respectively ch4 emissions expressed in co2eq based on a global warming potential of 28 0 9 5 1 mol co2eq m 2 d 1 can offset co2 sinks by 7 59 folds based on a decadal intensification of summer time decreases in surface water pco2 on an inner shelf affected by the eutrophic changjiang plume chou et al 2013 argued that increased anthropogenic inputs of estuarine nutrients could temporarily enhance coastal c sequestration however this temporary c sink can be offset by the increased production of co2 converted from dissolved inorganic c in the bottom water during the subsequent mixing seasons c dynamics in coastal areas can also vary substantially along estuarine plumes for instance as shown by a high resolution investigation using remote sensing data that distinguished the plume area closer to the river mouth as a source of co2 from the receiving waters taking up co2 on an annual basis valerio et al 2021 given the large spatiotemporal variations in coastal c dynamics our coarse monitoring of ghgs at three coastal locations per estuary is limited in evaluating the coastal c sink or source capacity however it seems evident that the coastal areas under the strong influences of estuarine plumes can emit more co2 and ch4 than surrounding areas as illustrated by the distinctively higher levels of co2 and ch4 in the hr estuary than those of the other estuaries fig 5 even in the co2 undersaturated nr estuarine reaches the elevated levels of ch4 carried over from the upstream riverine reaches can offset the seasonal eutrophication enhanced co2 uptake in summary we suggest that c sinks in coastal waters created by the input of eutrophic estuarine plumes can vary dynamically depending on seasonal variations in upstream inputs of co2 ch4 and nutrients as well as surface and bottom water c dynamics 5 conclusions basin specific anthropogenic modifications of riverine and estuarine ghg dynamics were revealed by the approach combining two source to estuary surveys and 1 year monitoring of estuarine ghgs conducted for the first time in major river basins of korea given the intensifying anthropogenic impacts on ghg emissions from rivers and estuaries worldwide the reported basin wide patterns of the three ghgs and the simultaneous measurements of gas isotopic composition and controlling environmental factors can provide useful reference data and methodological approaches to researchers interested in assessing human impacts on riverine ghg dynamics overall the results emphasize that the location and magnitude of pollution sources and impoundments control basin wide ghg distributions and estuarine carryover effects the new findings on weir induced perturbations to ghg dynamics in the impounded nr reaches will gain traction not only among researchers but also watershed managers these and other weirs built as part of the four major river project in the early 2010s have been the focus of decade long national debates and conflicts over their societal and environmental impacts the observed decreases in co2 in contrast to elevated ch4 would add an additional dimension to the ongoing debate on recurring toxic cyanobacterial blooms the summer time increase in δ13c ch4 indicates very active ch4 oxidation therefore the actual production of ch4 in anaerobic bottom sediments along the weir impounded reaches and downstream estuary may greatly exceed the amount of ch4 emitted from the water surface recent studies have argued that eutrophication might transform rivers and estuaries into c sinks however basin specific responses to eutrophication including large basin wide and seasonal variations in ghgs and impoundment effects on ch4 production offsetting phytoplankton enhanced co2 uptake warn against simple generalizations of eutrophic rivers and estuaries as c sinks future research needs to employ more high resolution samplings covering large spatiotemporal variations in riverine and estuarine ghgs to elucidate basin and reach specific controls on the source or sink capacity of ghgs declaration

14850,large uncertainties exist regarding the combined effects of pollution and impoundment on riverine greenhouse gas ghg emissions it has also been debated whether river eutrophication can transform downstream estuaries into carbon sinks to assess human impacts on the riverine and estuarine distributions of co2 ch4 and n2o two source to estuary surveys along three impounded rivers in korea were combined with multiple samplings at five or six estuarine sites the basin wide surveys revealed predominant pollution effects generating localized hotspots of riverine ghgs along metropolitan areas the localized pollution effect was pronounced in the lower han river and estuary adjacent to seoul while the highest ghg levels in the upper yeongsan traversing gwangju were not carried over into the faraway estuary ch4 levels were elevated across the eutrophic middle nakdong reaches regulated by eight cascade weirs in contrast to undersaturated co2 indicating enhanced phytoplankton production the levels of all three ghgs tended to be higher in the han estuary across seasons higher summer time δ13c ch4 values at some nakdong and yeongsan estuarine sites implied that temperature enhanced ch4 production may have been dampened by increased ch4 oxidation our results suggest that the location and magnitude of pollution sources and impoundments control basin specific longitudinal ghg

dioxide co2 estuary eutrophication methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o river impoundment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recent syntheses have raised estimates for global riverine emissions of co2 drake et al 2018 and ch4 rosentreter et al 2021 corroborating the widely recognized importance of river systems in the global carbon c cycle battin et al 2009 regnier et al 2022 many of the rivers included in the global syntheses have not been adequately monitored to address the large spatiotemporal variability in greenhouse gas ghg concentrations and fluxes drake et al 2018 rosentreter et al 2021 furthermore few studies have explicitly considered the effects of river eutrophication on phytoplankton co2 dynamics kim et al 2021 and associated ch4 production beaulieu et al 2019 recent changes in riverine trophic status add large uncertainties to estimating riverine emissions of co2 regnier et al 2022 ch4 rosentreter et al 2021 and n2o chun et al 2020 efforts have been made to conceptualize anthropogenically modified riverine metabolism based on the river continuum concept ward and stanford 1983 garnier and billen 2007 reservoirs created by dams have been evaluated as a primary source of ch4 emissions from inland waters deemer et al 2016 however given the varying emission rates with dam age and reservoir trophic status jin et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 it is presumptuous to expect certain linear relationships between river impoundments and ch4 emissions while impoundment effects can cascade down across serial dams and weirs to estuarine and coastal waters little is known about the coupled effects of the location and type dams weirs dykes and tide gates of impoundments and the location and magnitude of upstream pollution sources e g wastewater treatment plants wwtps on longitudinal distributions of ch4 and other ghgs along the river to sea continuum water pollution including eutrophication and organic pollution has long been linked to enhanced co2 emissions from various estuaries cai and wang 1998 frankignoulle et al 1998 guo et al 2009 however few studies have investigated gas specific seasonal patterns in the distribution of the three major ghgs along the river to sea continuum nguyen et al 2022 previous studies have observed pulse like increases in the concentrations and fluxes of one or two ghgs in the estuaries downstream of large pollution sources yoon et al 2017 these downstream effects can vary greatly with season and travel distance based on the synthesis of co2 emissions from 106 estuaries chen et al 2012 argued that lower estuaries and plumes carrying large riverine nutrient exports can promote photosynthesis generating c sinks while upper estuaries would generally function as co2 sources however this generalization of enhanced c sinks needs to be tested against the seasonal shifts between co2 sinks and sources as observed in the amazon river plumes valerio et al 2021 and coastal waters receiving the changjiang river plumes chow et al 2013 to assess the basin specific anthropogenic impacts on longitudinal distributions and seasonal variations in co2 ch4 and n2o two basin wide surveys from source to estuary along three impounded rivers han nakdong and yeongsan in korea were combined with five repeated samplings for 1 year at five or six estuarine sites in each basin fig 1 here we report only gas concentrations and departures from atmospheric equilibrium to avoid large uncertainties in estimating gas fluxes focusing on testing our hypothesis that anthropogenic perturbations by river impoundment and pollution vary with basins and reaches depending on the location and magnitude of perturbations stable c isotope ratios δ13c in co2 and ch4 were compared among estuarine samples and potential sources of these gasses to provide complementary information for tracking sources of ghgs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the three river basins drain 62 of the national land area of south korea combined with a part of the han river hr basin belonging to north korea table 1 hr nakdong river nr and yeongsan river yr are the first second and fifth largest in south korea respectively the predominant bedrock of the three basins includes precambrian gneisses and mesozoic granites while the upper reaches of hr and nr are surrounded by mountainous terrain containing paleozoic and cenozoic sedimentary rocks rich in carbonate and other clastic components shin et al 2011 the annual mean temperature and precipitation ranged from 12 5 c and 1450 mm in the hr basin to 14 7 c and 1519 mm in the nr basin respectively for the three decades from 1981 to 2010 korea meteorological agency the summer monsoon brings approximately 70 of the annual precipitation from june to september kim et al 2021 the three basins vary in land use population and number of dams and weirs on the mainstems and tributaries table 1 agricultural and urban land use increases longitudinally along hr and nr whereas the upper yr basin is intensely used for agriculture and urban settlements resulting in the highest basin wide agricultural 32 and urban 9 land use more details on the three basins are provided in supplementary information text 1 1 2 2 field surveys two basin wide field surveys were conducted during april 17 29 and july 13 27 2022 to compare the basin specific spatial patterns of the three ghgs between the dry april and wet july periods the surface water concentrations of the three ghgs and ancillary water quality components were measured from river sources to estuarine plumes at 15 14 and 13 sites for hr nr and yr respectively fig 1 table s1 as part of three year monitoring of ghgs sampling was repeated at five nr and yr or six hr estuarine sites five times from november 2021 to september 2022 at the two upper estuarine sites of each basin saltwater intrusion was restricted by a weir hr or estuarine dams nr and yr these sites were selected as freshwater endmembers under tidal influence spot water samples were collected at 10 20 cm below the surface either from a location 1 2 m away from the riverbank or along the estuarine thalweg riverine and estuarine samples were filtered through pre combusted 0 4 µm glass fiber filters on site or in the laboratory respectively text s1 3 the filtered riverine samples were frozen immediately prior to laboratory analyses within three days during water sampling a pre calibrated multiparameter probe was used to measure the in situ water quality text s1 3 including water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec salinity and dissolved oxygen do headspace equilibration was performed for 2 min using a 60 ml polypropylene syringe filled with a 30 ml water sample and a 30 ml ambient air following pre tested protocols jin et al 2018 the air temperature and barometric pressure were recorded during the headspace equilibration 2 3 laboratory analyses and calculations ghg concentrations in the ambient and equilibrated air samples were measured using a gas chromatograph 7890a agilent usa equipped with a flame ionization detector coupled with a methanizer for ch4 and co2 analyses and a microelectron capture detector for n2o analysis subsets of the gas samples from the two basin wide surveys were determined for stable c isotope ratios in co2 δ13c co2 and ch4 δ13c ch4

eq was calculated as the do concentration at atmospheric equilibrium based on the coefficients provided by garcia and gordon 1992 the filtered water samples were analyzed for doc using a total organic c analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan estuarine samples were further analyzed for total nitrogen tn and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations apha 1995 as part of the qa qc standards with known concentrations and blank samples containing ultrapure water were analyzed for every 10 samples to check for instrumental stability and analytical precision the relative standard deviation for replicate water analyses was lower than 5 the data of chemical oxygen demand cod tn total phosphorus tp and chl a for the riverine sites and some of the estuarine sites were obtained from the closest monitoring stations of water environment information system https water nier go kr and marine water quality monitoring system https www meis go kr respectively 2 4 statistical analyses two data sets from the two basin wide surveys and five estuarine samplings were analyzed to identify significant factors for spatial variations in ghg concentrations and associated environmental variables after conducting shapiro wilk normality test one way analysis of variance anova on ranks kruskal wallis h test followed by dunn s pairwise multiple comparisons was performed to compare significant differences in mean concentrations of the three ghgs among the rivers or estuaries using sigmastat version 4 0 to establish the overall relationships among the ghgs and environmental variables principal component analysis pca was performed using two packages operating in r version 4 2 2 with the package factominer used for the analysis and factoextra used for visualization forward stepwise regression was conducted using spss version 29 0 to identify the critical contributing factors that could explain variations in ghg concentrations across the basins 3 results 3 1 basin wide surveys of ghgs and water quality the source to estuary surveys revealed basin specific longitudinal distributions and seasonal variations in co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations fig 2 table 2 the most outstanding pattern is distinctively high gas concentrations in the reaches around metropolitan areas fig 2 which include the lower middle and upper reaches of hr seoul nr daegu and yr gwangju respectively fig 1 while hr and yr exhibited the highest peaks of all three ghgs along the metropolitan areas during both sampling periods only ch4 peaks were found along the weir regulated middle nr reaches fig 2 when only the riverine sites were compared the mean concentrations of all three ghgs and their departures from atmospheric equilibrium were the highest in yr although significant differences were not found for ch4 table 2 co2 mean 106 μatm across the weir sites from nr6 to nr9 along the middle nr reaches shown in fig 2 was undersaturated relative to atmospheric equilibrium 426 μatm in contrast the mean ch4 concentration 785 nmol l 1 at the same sites was higher than the saturation level 3 1 nmol l 1 by 253 fold although the means were not significantly different paired t test p 0 38 ch4 concentrations in the same reaches were higher in july mean 968 nmol l 1 than in april 541 nmol l 1 in contrast to the weakened july peaks of ch4 in hr and yr n2o peaks in hr and yr were also lowered in july fig 2 large decreases in co2 concentrations were observed only at a few sites in hr and yr in july in line with the highest ghg levels at the riverine sites of yr most of the water quality components exhibited the most severe contamination as indicated by the highest levels of doc cod chl a tn and tp table s2 while the means of organic contamination indicators doc and cod and phytoplankton biomass chl a were intermediate at the nr riverine sites the highest levels of chl a up to 92 1 μg l 1 contrasted with the lowest n p ratios down to 15 at some weir sites in july reflecting the month long occurrence of severe cyanobacterial blooms in this year the yr estuarine sites also displayed the highest levels of organic contamination among the three estuaries whereas chl a tn and tp concentrations were the highest at the hr estuarine sites table s2 when pca was conducted for the whole data set fig s1 and separately for the riverine and estuarine sites fig 3 two principal components accounted for 52 the whole data to 59 the riverine data of total variations refer to table s3 for correlation coefficients between five identified principal components and environmental variables despite substantial overlapping in both riverine and estuarine pca biplots the yr riverine sites and hr estuarine sites exhibited larger deviations in variable correlations than the other basins fig 3 for the riverine sites the first principal component dim1 had strong positive correlations with variables including ch4 ch4 departures from atmospheric equilibrium doc cod and tp whereas the second principal component dim2 was highly correlated either negatively with ph and do or positively with aou pco2 and co2 departures table s3 fig s2 in comparison the first principal component identified for the estuarine data included more diverse correlating variables which generally had lower correlation values than those of the riverine data except for salinity and tn fig s2 the individual relationships between aou and co2 departures for the riverine sites were consistent across the three basins for a narrow range of aou around zero fig 4 however large departures from the 1 1 line were found at some yr and nr sites belonging to the upper and lower aou ranges respectively although ch4 and n2o departures displayed no consistent relationship with aou it was notable that exceptionally high n2o levels were found at some yr sites in a narrow sub zero aou range and that high ratios of ch4 to co2 existed across a wide range of sub zero aou fig 4 the whole data fig s3 and the estuarine data fig s4 exhibited slightly to widely different patterns from those of the riverine data indicating a separation of the riverine and estuarine data in the relationship between aou and ghgs some of the highly correlated variables identified using pca also significantly contributed to the forward stepwise regressions involving the three ghgs and associated environmental variables table 3 interestingly the most significant contributors did not only differ among the three ghgs but also the key contributing variables were specific to each basin significant contributors to spatial variations in co2 included ph the distance from the most downstream dam and tn tn and tp were common contributors to the overall variation in ch4 and n2o table 3 however for a specific basin spatial variations in ch4 were also explained by aou nr and n p and chl a yr in the case of n2o the nr basin did not have any significant contributing variables whereas two or three variables explained 39 and 58 of the variation for hr chl a and tn and yr tn cod and n p respectively 3 2 spatiotemporal variations in estuarine ghg concentrations and δ13c the yearlong monitoring of estuarine ghgs revealed distinct inter basin differences and large seasonal variations in the longitudinal concentration distribution fig 5 the mean concentrations of all three ghgs were 2 3 fold higher in the hr estuary than in the other estuaries although statistical significance was found only for co2 table 2 while the gas concentrations dropped to the lowest levels after passing through the yr and nr estuarine dams those of the hr estuary remained relatively high across the estuarine reaches downstream of the weir all three estuaries were supersaturated in ch4 with concentrations generally decreasing from riverine water to seawater fig 5 table 2 relatively high ch4 concentrations at the first yr estuarine site 717 nmol l 1 in april 151 nmol l 1 in july decreased drastically along estuarine plumes downstream of the estuarine dam ranging from 19 to 84 nmol l 1 in line with the high ch4 concentrations along the middle to lower nr reaches fig 2 ch4 concentrations in the nr estuary remained relatively high across the estuarine dam down to nr12 with a mean of 201 nmol l 1 at sites nr10 nr12 although n2o concentrations were the highest at the yr riverine sites mean 199 nmol l 1 anova on ranks p 0 008 the estuarine mean n2o concentration 18 nmol l 1 was the lowest among the three estuaries p 0 69 table 2 these inter basin differences in estuarine n2o concentrations were consistent with the corresponding differences in water quality components including tn tp and chl a table s2 the effects of upstream riverine inputs on estuarine co2 and ch4 concentrations were also reflected by the spatial and seasonal variations in the δ13c values of both gasses measured across the three basins in april and july 2022 fig 6 the overall longitudinal patterns were similar across the basins however the δ13c values in july tended to be lower for co2 but higher for ch4 than the counterparts in april particularly at sites upstream of the weir or estuarine dams very low co2 concentrations did not allow for isotope analysis at the two upstream sites of the nr estuarine dam the δ13c co2 values in the upper hr and yr estuaries were significantly lower in july than in april t test p 0 02 in contrast there were pronounced increases in δ13c ch4 in the upper nr and yr estuaries in july although seasonal differences in δ13c co2 were not distinct in the estuarine plumes substantial increases in δ13c ch4 were also observed across the lower estuarine sites in july fig 6 this upward shift in δ13c ch4 in july was also evident when the relationships between the concentrations and δ13c of the two gasses were compared between the two sampling periods fig 7 across all estuaries except hr11 the δ13c ch4 values were consistently higher in july than in april when the δ13c co2 ranges at the estuarine sites were compared with those of the headwater streams 22 6 to 23 4 the decreases in δ13c co2 found in july reflected the increased input of co2 derived from upland soils table 4 fig 6 the increases in δ13c ch4 observed at some estuarine sites in july up to 17 3 exceeded the usual ranges of δ13c ch4 observed for major biogenic sources in the three basins including river bottom sediment 55 0 wetland floodwater 48 4 and wwtp effluents 45 8 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 an environmental anna karenina principle basin specific controls on ghg variations the three basins are under common anthropogenic stresses they are all regulated by multiple 8 27 dams and weirs and plagued by chronic water pollution problems associated with nutrients and organic waste released from metropolitan and agricultural areas table 1 despite this commonality the three basins exhibited unique spatiotemporal variations in riverine and estuarine ghg concentrations figs 2 5 implying basin specific sets of controls out of various environmental factors this basin specificity can be called an environmental anna karenina principle following leo tolstoy s novel anna karenina which begins with all happy families are alike each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way as observed in other basin scale studies borges et al 2018 mwanake et al 2022 the predominant effects of water pollution on the longitudinal distribution of the three ghgs were pronounced in the upper yr and lower hr reaches adjacent to pollution sources fig 2 although the yr basin has a smaller population than the hr basin 1 9 million vs 20 9 million agricultural and urban land uses around the upper yr are more concentrated within the relatively small area compared to the lower hr traversing the wider seoul metropolitan area fig 1 table 1 this difference in land use combined with the large capacity of advanced wastewater treatments yoon et al 2017 can explain the highest levels of eutrophication and organic pollution observed in the upper yr table s2 sin and lee 2020 the concurrence of high levels of ghgs and water pollution along the upper yr was well illustrated by the correlating water quality variables tp doc and cod and ch4 or n2o in the pca biplots fig 3 and the significant contributors to the forward stepwise regressions explaining variations in ch4 tn n p and chl a and n2o tn cod and n p in the yr table 4 both eutrophication and organic pollution also appeared to induce strong downstream effects on all three ghgs along the relatively long hr estuary figs 2 5 the localized ghg peaks have been ascribed to wwtp effluents and urban runoff that deliver loads of ghgs and labile organic pollutants via tributaries or directly to the hr mainstem yoon et al 2017 jin et al 2018 chun et al 2020 while the contribution of wwtp effluents is usually greater during dry periods incomplete waste treatment at low temperatures has been suggested as a trigger for the extremely large winter peaks of n2o in the lower hr chun et al 2020 although the environmental impacts of water pollution have been studied extensively in the yr basin sin and lee 2020 this study is the first to report the basin wide ghg distributions the localized ghg peaks along the upper yr fig 2 fall within the upper ranges observed worldwide and even approach extremely high levels of ghgs in highly contaminated rivers affected by untreated sewage nguyen et al 2022 patel et al 2023 the concurrence of exceptionally high levels of ch4 and undersaturated co2 levels along the middle to lower nr reaches fig 2 implied other contributing factors besides nutrients and organic waste discharged from the two metropolitan areas daegu and busan most importantly the middle nr reaches are regulated by eight cascade weirs so flow regulation is much stronger than in the other rivers fig 1 while the other rivers are also impounded across scattered reaches the serial weirs are unique in that they regulate an approximately 180 km eutrophic stretch with eight consecutive run of the river structures cascade dams on the regulated reaches can induce deviations from natural patterns or the serial discontinuities termed by ward and stanford 1983 in riverine metabolic processes that are usually considered to vary gradually along the longitudinal continuum vannote et al 1980 in terms of discontinuity distance which refers to the distance from a dam where impoundment induced perturbations persist ward and stanford 1983 the nr reaches impounded by the cascade weirs appear more vulnerable to cyanobacteria blooms and associated methanogenesis than the other impounded reaches of the nr and other basins as a consequence of weir construction from 2009 to 2011 flows have slowed resulting in a five fold increase in the cumulative hydraulic retention time between the most upstream and downstream weirs to 46 days lee et al 2018 peak monsoonal flows in the lower nr have been lowered from 2000 m3 s 1 during the pre regulation periods 2005 2009 to 1300 m3 s 1 during 2012 2016 kim et al 2021b slowed and reduced flows combined with seasonal increases in nutrient inputs from metropolitan areas and industrial complexes may have exacerbated sporadic eutrophic conditions favorable for cyanobacterial blooms in recent years as indicated by summer time increases in po4 3 concentrations in the impounded reaches kim et al 2021b an analysis of long term data from the lower nr from 1993 to 2016 suggested that temporary increases in p availability by monsoonal floods flushing p from terrestrial sources can trigger episodic cyanobacterial blooms given the increasing role of p availability as a limiting factor in the overall decreasing nutrient trends in response to continuous efforts to enhance water quality in the basin kim et al 2020 eutrophication indices tn tp and chl a at the three nr weir sites displayed higher eutrophic levels in july than in april with the highest chl a concentration at nr7 92 1 μg l 1 exceeding that of the yr table s2 the relationship between summer time increases in ch4 and cyanobacterial blooms along the impounded nr reaches was also indicated by aou and tp which were identified as the key contributors to the forward stepwise regression involving environmental variables and ch4 concentrations table 3 the elevated ch4 concentrations along the eutrophic impounded reaches agree with recent studies that have reported enhanced ch4 emissions from eutrophic rivers and reservoirs jin et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 sun et al 2021 nguyen et al 2022 while an enhanced phytoplankton production in impoundments can lower co2 levels temporarily during the productive daytime or during the short term responses to early stages of eutrophication degrading phytoplankton biomass after passing a threshold can supply metabolic sources for both aerobic decomposers kim et al 2021a and anaerobic methanogens vachon et al 2020 the concurrence of enhanced co2 uptake and ch4 production in the eutrophic impounded reaches of nr and other basins was also illustrated by the clustered sites on the relationships between aou and co2 or ch4 departures fig 4 across the negative ranges of aou which indicate more o2 generated from phytoplankton production than the level expected from consumption by biodegradation ch4 departures and ch4 co2 ratios at the eutrophic sites were clearly distinguished from those of the other sites ch4 co2 ratios have been observed to increase with intensifying anaerobic conditions both in unperturbed rivers with large riparian wetlands such as the amazon richey et al 1988 and in highly polluted rivers and estuaries borges et al 2018 nguyen et al 2021 the same inverse relationship was found between do and n2o jin et al 2018 borges et al 2018 in this study however there was no consistent relationship between the two variables except for the extremely high n2o concentrations found at some highly n enriched yr sites clustered around sub zero aou levels fig 4 our previous study conducted in the lower hr found high levels of n2o under a narrow range of hypoxic conditions in contrast to large concentration decreases under anoxic conditions where complete denitrification or hampered nitrification drastically lowered n2o levels chun et al 2020 localized pollution effects observed in the lower hr reaches were reflected by higher ghg concentrations in the hr estuary close to seoul compared to a limited downstream effect of the highest ghg levels found in the upper yr on the yr estuary fig 5 although most of the ghg and water quality measurements in the upper yr exhibited the highest levels among the three basins the downstream elongation of the large concentration peaks was generally limited to the first estuarine site despite the small basin size the relatively large reservoir created by the estuarine dam and mixing by seawater downstream appear to efficiently dilute the inflowing upstream ghgs and other solutes in contrast large concentration peaks observed along the weir impounded nr reaches cascaded across the estuarine dam and left relatively large footprints along the downstream estuarine sites fig 5 indicating an elongated discontinuity distance 4 2 sources of estuarine ghgs while all ghg concentrations were distinctively higher in the hr estuary across seasons seasonal increases in ch4 production and oxidation in the estuary or upstream sources were also indicated by changes in concentrations fig 5 and δ13c ch4 at some nr and yr estuarine sites fig 6 we cannot preclude the active transformation of om in the bottom sediment and overlying water as an important estuarine source of co2 and ch4 borges and abril 2011 wells et al 2020 however upstream riverine inputs of ghgs labile om and nutrients may have driven the observed spatiotemporal variations in estuarine ghg concentrations given the proximity of the major pollution sources as a primary control fig 5 the direct influence of co2 derived from proximate pollution sources in the seoul metropolitan area was reflected by the similar δ13c co2 values found for the estuarine samples 16 4 table 4 and wwtp effluents 17 3 table 4 which are close to our previous measurements for the lower hr mainstem 17 4 to 16 7 jin et al 2018 but differ distinctly from those of headwater streams 22 6 table 4 however depletion of 13c in co2 observed across the upper estuarine sites of the three basins in july indicates the overriding influence of soil derived co2 with low δ13c values during each season the enrichment of 13c in co2 at the nr and yr estuarine sites as well as the impounded sites across the basins may reflect the concomitant effects of physical gas evasion and photosynthesis both of which usually enrich 13c in the remaining co2 molecules via the preferential removal of lighter 12c isotopes finlay et al 2004 jin et al 2018 the levels of ch4 in the three estuaries ranging from 0 007 1 5 μmol l 1 table 2 fig 5 fall within the mid to upper ranges observed in nine european tidal estuaries 0 002 3 6 μmol l 1 middelburg et al 2002 and a global synthesis of streams and rivers 0 1 4 μmol l 1 borges and abril 2011 and estuaries 0 002 6 5 μmol l 1 borges and abril 2012 different locations and magnitudes of peak ch4 concentrations in the three basins can be translated into basin specific predominant sources of estuarine ch4 wastewater effluents in the lower hr agricultural and urban drainage waters in the upper yr and sediments rich in om derived from enhanced phytoplankton production in the weir regulated nr reaches stable carbon isotope measurements support estuary specific dynamic changes in the production and consumption of ch4 fig 6 compared to the typical ranges of δ13c ch4 for acetoclastic 70 to 32 and hydrogenotrophic 115 to 55 methanogenesis wells et al 2020 and prior measurements of δ13c ch4 in wwtp effluents in the lower hr 48 5 table 4 the δ13c ch4 in the upper hr estuary indicated a strong influence of wwtps and oxidation induced enrichment of 13c in ch4 in comparison the more 13c depleted ch4 along the nr and yr estuaries implied proximate methanogenic sources within the estuary or adjacent upstream areas the gradual shift from enrichment to depletion of 13c in ch4 along the estuary is consistent with previous studies conducted in the lower hr jin et al 2018 and estuaries of north america sansone et al 1999 and europe jacques et al 2021 jin et al 2018 observed a downstream decrease in δ13c ch4 from 36 6 to 48 6 along the lower hr and linked this change to urban tributary inputs carrying wwtp effluents the enriched isotopic signatures observed in july across the three basins except at the upper hr estuarine sites fig 6 can be ascribed to temperature enhanced ch4 oxidation enriching 13c in ch4 whitcar 1999 and some concomitant effect of monsoonal flows carrying wwtps isotopic fractionation factors ε for ch4 oxidation were estimated to range from 4 2 12 0 in five american estuaries sansone et al 1999 to 12 8 in the scheldt estuary jacques et al 2021 high oxidation rates were observed in freshwater and brackish estuarine parts at low salinity compared to marine waters where methanotrophic activity can be adversely affected by high salinity borges and abril 2011 although the observed spatial and seasonal patterns of co2 and ch4 in the three basins indicate the predominant influence of riverine ghg inputs further research is required to elucidate the roles of estuarine processes affecting the distributions of co2 and ch4 along the freshwater to marine continuum as illustrated by the distinct separation of the contributing factors identified using pca for inter estuarine differences in ghgs between hr on one hand and nr and yr on the other fig 3 estuarine processing of organic sources indicated by doc and chl a can significantly alter both co2 and ch4 distributions along estuarine plumes while a previous study conducted in the nr estuary suggested riverine inputs of ch4 as the most probable cause for gradual seaward decreases in ch4 concentrations it was also noted that organic rich sediments accumulated near the estuarine dam could function as a local hot spot for methanogenesis ryu and an 2016 in estuaries with an appreciable coverage of tidal flats and marshes as the case of the hr estuary the lateral tidal pumping transferring ch4 from riparian sources can also play an important role in driving spatiotemporal variations in ch4 concentrations bartlett et al 1985 sulfate reducing bacteria can outcompete methanogens for available carbon substrates acetate fermentation or hydrogen co2 reduction in saline environments with dissolved sulfate concentrations greater than 200 mmol l 1 capone and kiene 1988 because freshwater marshes upstream of the nr and yr estuarine dams are protected from the intrusion of saltwater containing high sulfate concentrations this anthropogenic alteration of tidal environments may have enhanced baseline ch4 emissions from the impacted estuarine reaches warranting further research 4 3 implications for global riverine and estuarine ghg emissions consistent with the global syntheses that have evaluated river systems as sources of co2 to the atmosphere lauerwald et al 2015 drake et al 2018 many of the sampling sites in this study exhibited supersaturated co2 levels indicating the role of the three rivers as c sources however undersaturated co2 levels were also found at some of the upper reaches of hr and nr and the impounded reaches of the three basins fig 2 in particular co2 undersaturation was the strongest at the weir regulated nr sites among all impoundment sites and consistent across the dry and monsoon seasons the undersaturation of co2 along the upper reaches of hr and nr can be explained by the carbonate chemistry associated with the predominant bedrock carbonate and clastic sedimentary rocks maintaining high ph and alkalinity but a low pco2 below atmospheric equilibrium shin et al 2011 in contrast the consistent co2 undersaturation along the impounded nr reaches may have been exacerbated by phytoplankton blooms prevailing under regulated and eutrophic conditions as has often been observed in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs pacheco et al 2014 sun et al 2021 the elongated co2 sinks along the plumes downstream of the nr estuarine dam may imply that the inflowing eutrophic estuarine water can lower the surface water pco2 in the receiving coastal waters at least during warm periods when the phytoplankton uptake of co2 can significantly exceed the rate of co2 production from om degradation despite the observed co2 undersaturation it may become a hasty generalization to consider the impounded river and downstream estuarine reaches as c sinks based on two time measurements as reported by recent studies employing continuous sensor measurements pco2 levels in eutrophic lakes and rivers tend to show large diel variations often resulting in nocturnal co2 effluxes exceeding the diurnal phytoplankton co2 uptake vachon et al 2020 furthermore eutrophication enhanced ch4 emissions can compensate for reduced co2 emissions during short periods of high primary productivity beaulieu 2019 vachon et al 2020 sun et al 2021 when gas emissions from the impounded reaches nr7 nr9 were estimated based on the measured gas concentrations and a representative value of gas transfer velocity k recommended for large rivers in the temperate zone 19 3 cm h 1 lauerwald et al 2015 co2 and ch4 emissions ranged from 133 6 to 86 1 mmol co2 m 2 d 1 and from 31 2 to 181 3 mmol ch4 m 2 d 1 respectively ch4 emissions expressed in co2eq based on a global warming potential of 28 0 9 5 1 mol co2eq m 2 d 1 can offset co2 sinks by 7 59 folds based on a decadal intensification of summer time decreases in surface water pco2 on an inner shelf affected by the eutrophic changjiang plume chou et al 2013 argued that increased anthropogenic inputs of estuarine nutrients could temporarily enhance coastal c sequestration however this temporary c sink can be offset by the increased production of co2 converted from dissolved inorganic c in the bottom water during the subsequent mixing seasons c dynamics in coastal areas can also vary substantially along estuarine plumes for instance as shown by a high resolution investigation using remote sensing data that distinguished the plume area closer to the river mouth as a source of co2 from the receiving waters taking up co2 on an annual basis valerio et al 2021 given the large spatiotemporal variations in coastal c dynamics our coarse monitoring of ghgs at three coastal locations per estuary is limited in evaluating the coastal c sink or source capacity however it seems evident that the coastal areas under the strong influences of estuarine plumes can emit more co2 and ch4 than surrounding areas as illustrated by the distinctively higher levels of co2 and ch4 in the hr estuary than those of the other estuaries fig 5 even in the co2 undersaturated nr estuarine reaches the elevated levels of ch4 carried over from the upstream riverine reaches can offset the seasonal eutrophication enhanced co2 uptake in summary we suggest that c sinks in coastal waters created by the input of eutrophic estuarine plumes can vary dynamically depending on seasonal variations in upstream inputs of co2 ch4 and nutrients as well as surface and bottom water c dynamics 5 conclusions basin specific anthropogenic modifications of riverine and estuarine ghg dynamics were revealed by the approach combining two source to estuary surveys and 1 year monitoring of estuarine ghgs conducted for the first time in major river basins of korea given the intensifying anthropogenic impacts on ghg emissions from rivers and estuaries worldwide the reported basin wide patterns of the three ghgs and the simultaneous measurements of gas isotopic composition and controlling environmental factors can provide useful reference data and methodological approaches to researchers interested in assessing human impacts on riverine ghg dynamics overall the results emphasize that the location and magnitude of pollution sources and impoundments control basin wide ghg distributions and estuarine carryover effects the new findings on weir induced perturbations to ghg dynamics in the impounded nr reaches will gain traction not only among researchers but also watershed managers these and other weirs built as part of the four major river project in the early 2010s have been the focus of decade long national debates and conflicts over their societal and environmental impacts the observed decreases in co2 in contrast to elevated ch4 would add an additional dimension to the ongoing debate on recurring toxic cyanobacterial blooms the summer time increase in δ13c ch4 indicates very active ch4 oxidation therefore the actual production of ch4 in anaerobic bottom sediments along the weir impounded reaches and downstream estuary may greatly exceed the amount of ch4 emitted from the water surface recent studies have argued that eutrophication might transform rivers and estuaries into c sinks however basin specific responses to eutrophication including large basin wide and seasonal variations in ghgs and impoundment effects on ch4 production offsetting phytoplankton enhanced co2 uptake warn against simple generalizations of eutrophic rivers and estuaries as c sinks future research needs to employ more high resolution samplings covering large spatiotemporal variations in riverine and estuarine ghgs to elucidate basin and reach specific controls on the source or sink capacity of ghgs declaration

14851,urban drainage system is an important channel for terrigenous microplastics 5 mm in size to migrate to urban water bodies especially the input load caused by overflow pollution in wet weather investigating how they transport and discharge is essential to better understand the occurrence and variability of microplastics in different water ecosystems this study evaluated the abundance and distribution characteristics of microplastics in the drainage systems of typical coastal cities in china the impacts of meteorological conditions and land use were explored in particular the prominent contribution of drainage sewer overflow pollution during storm events were investigated the results showed that the microplastics abundance in daily sewage discharge from different drainage plots ranged between 13 6 and 30 8 items l with fibers as the dominant type of microplastics sewer overflow discharge can greatly aggravate microplastic abundance to 83 1 40 2 items l road runoff and sewer sediment scouring were the main pollution sources systematic estimates based on detailed data showed that the average microplastics emitted per capita per day in household wastewater was 3461 5 items a quantitative estimation method was proposed to show that the annual emissions load of microplastics via urban drainage system in this research area was 5 83 1010 items km2 of which the proportion of emissions in wet weather accounted for about 60 this research provides the first full process of assessment and source apportionment of the microplastic distribution characteristics in old drainage system the occurrence of storm events is an important marker of increased microplastic abundance in urban rivers with a view to urgent need for interception of surface runoff and purification of sewer overflow pollution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic urban drainage system sewer overflow pollution receiving river discharge abundance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics a type of plastics generally accepted as measuring smaller than 5 mm in size are widely distributed in the water environment rochman 2018 microplastics have posed a threat to most parts of ecological system and even transport through the food chain into human bodies ross et al 2021 wright and kelly 2017 researchers have found microplastic particles in human blood samples and deep in the lungs of living humans jenner et al 2022 leslie et al 2022 annual global plastic production is estimated to reach 500 million tons in 2025 plastics europe 2019 80 of marine microplastics originate from terrestrial systems andrady 2011 yonkos et al 2014 fluvial system are an essential pathway for land based inputs huang et al 2021 niu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 due to the high correlation with human activities urban areas may be considered of an integral source for microplastics emissions into rivers wagner et al 2019 the major sources of microplastics in urban agglomerations include sewage discharge atmospheric deposition and surface runoff these sources are all related to the collection and discharge of drainage systems which are the important channels for pollution transfer between land and water bodies browne et al 2011 eriksen et al 2013 mak et al 2020 in general generated microplastics are transported via sewers to the wastewater treatment plants wwtps the removal rates is influenced by a combination of service area characteristics and treatment processes blair et al 2019 carr et al 2016 long et al 2019 although appreciable removal can be achieved depending on the wwtp types due to the continuous discharge of treated effluent high concentrations of microplastics are still detected in both the water column and sediment downstream of the wwtp conley et al 2019 murphy et al 2016 also rapid and dense urbanization has contributed to increased abundance of microplastic in urban rivers esquinas et al 2020 the sources and pathways of microplastics are closely related to land use and population density microplastics are generated from the use of personal care products washing illegal waste dumping etc choi et al 2021 ó briain et al 2020 piehl et al 2018 there is great spatial heterogeneity in microplastic emissions due to differences in production patterns jang et al 2020 su et al 2020 however most previous studies revealed the influence of land use types through the variation of microplastic abundance in water environment in different regions dikareva and simon 2019 wagner et al 2019 while few have reported the abundance of microplastics in directly generated wastewater from drainage plots understanding microplastics produced by different drainage plots is critical for identifying sources and managing wastewater treatment facilities another key source of impact to pollution discharge from urban drainage systems is sewer overflow pollution during wet weather high pollution load caused by sewer overflow has been widely demonstrated such as cod nutrients heavy metals persistent organic compounds etc launay et al 2016 pilotti et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 during storms or intense rainfall surface scouring causes microplastics to transport into sewers with runoff and eventually discharge into rivers lange et al 2021 liu et al 2019a the major sources include the form of tire wear particles road paint plastic waste etc large amounts of runoff cause the water volume to exceed the operational load in the drainage sewers resulting in overflow pollution direct input of untreated wastewater containing high microplastic abundance might occur which have been detected in overflow effluent in paris italy and shanghai chen et al 2020 di nunno et al 2021 dris et al 2015 treilles et al 2020 in addition the continuous transport of wastewater in sewers during dry weather results in the settlement or adsorption of large amounts of microplastic particles into the sediments sang et al 2021 shahsavari et al 2017 while the increased flow during storm or intense rainfall continuously flushes the sediments at the bottom of the sewers to the receiving water sewer sediments may be considered a prominent source of overflow pollution microplastic abundance in rivers and estuaries can surge several or even tens of times following intense rainfall and storm events chen et al 2020 given accelerated urbanization process and progressively larger paved areas the risk of microplastic generation and emission is likely to rise dalu et al 2021 esquinas et al 2020 meanwhile in china as well as other countries or regions there are numerous problems with drainage systems such as broken blockages and separation of rainwater and sewage drains schilperoort et al 2013 ellis and butler 2015 tan et al 2019 xu et al 2020 2019 these exacerbate the leakage or overflow of untreated wastewater and sediment transmitted which also meant that more land based microplastics would migrate into the nearby water bodies there is consensus that the most effective way to reduce microplastics is to control the sources and migration pathways woodward et al 2021 however this microplastic migration pathway has not attracted enough attention the aim of this study was to determine the migration and emission of microplastics in urban drainage systems during normal and storm flows the urbanized catchments of typical coastal cities in southern china are selected representative microplastic samples were collected from surface runoff overflow effluent sewer sediment and receiving river during multiple rainfall events the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the microplastics abundance in the daily sewage discharge from drainage plots of different land use types 2 evaluate the microplastics abundance of sewer overflows and investigate the migration characteristics of microplastic in receiving river after storm events 3 propose a quantitative evaluation method for microplastics emission load in normal and wet weather understanding the sources of microplastics in these catchments is crucial for deciding priorities for management interventions and reducing inputs load to waterways 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas we selected the drainage system of the built up area of nanning to determine the characteristics of microplastic distribution in a typical coastal city fig 1 nanning located in southern china a typical subtropical region with annual average rainfall of about 1300 mm in normal weather samples were collected from the influent and effluent of three wwtps the collection area of the wwtps was mainly dominated by the separated drainage system more than 80 of the area which mainly collected domestic wastewater more than 90 and a small amount of industrial wastewater five pumping stations within the service area of the largest wwtp were selected to collect wastewater samples two wastewater pumping stations and three stormwater pumping stations specific information on wwtps and pumping stations is provided in table s1 meanwhile wastewater samples were collected from 17 different functional area drainage plots including 4 residential areas 4 industrial areas 4 commercial areas 3 administrative areas and 2 urban villages table s2 for details all samples were collected in the summer of 2021 and on dry days at least three days after rain during wet weather a separated drainage catchment a was selected for the collection of surface runoff overflow discharge and sediments at the bottom of sewers the catchment a was in the service area of the same wwtp collected in dry weather catchment a covered an area of about 14 6 ha and was predominantly residential with a population density of 335 p ha the sewer overflow from catchment a is discharged into an urban river that eventually flows into yongjiang river in order to ensure that the untreated wastewater was not directly discharged into the river in dry weather intercepted sewers were set up along the river to transport the misconnected wastewater to the wwtp when it rains a large amount of runoff is mixed in exceeding the load of the intercepted sewer thus causing overflow discharge water and sediment samples were collected simultaneously from four river cross sections during and after rainfall rainfall information was provided in the table s3 2 2 sample collection before sampling all sampling tools were rinsed with ultrapure water water samples were collected using 10 l stainless steel bucket wwtps samples were collected at the collection wells and effluent outlets pumping station samples were collected at the collection pond drainage plots were collected in the manholes before connected to the municipal sewer network all samples were collected 15 20 min and volume of 5 l on rainy days samples from runoff and overflow were collected every 30 min of the first hour and every hour thereafter until runoff and overflow ended river samples were collected three times simultaneously taking 10 l of mixed water samples at 30 cm below the water surface after collection the water samples were passed through a 30 µm stainless steel meshes repeatedly rinsed 3 5 times and all residual material on the meshes was transferred to a clean glass bottle using ultrapure water sewer sediment samples were collected using a stainless steel grabber prior to rainfall and approximately 1 kg was collected into a glass container we collected water samples simultaneously to perform the other chemical analysis upon completing the sample collection all the samples were kept in 500 ml polyethylene bottles immediately transported to the laboratory refrigerated at 4 and analyzed within 12 h 2 3 microplastic identification water samples were pretreated to digest using 60 ml of h2o2 to remove organic matters and the digestion process was carried out in a thermostat with a stable temperature of 60 c for 24 h reaction after digestion the solution was filtered through a 5 μm polycarbonate filter membrane with a vacuum pump and the membranes were stored in covered glass dishes and dried in an oven at 40 c sediment samples were sieved 5 mm mesh and freeze dried for 3 d to a constant weight 20 g of samples were weighed and then separated using a saturated zncl2 solution 1 6 g cm3 for 8 h repeated 3 4 times the obtained sediment supernatant was then passed through a 30 μm stainless steel mesh the subsequent operation was the same as the above water sample treatment process the obtained microplastic samples were observed using a stereomicroscope pxs6555t j3 shanghai cewei photoelectric technology co ltd and tcapture software including the quantitative and morphological analysis the shape can be classified as fiber particle fragment film etc the size is divided into five categories 0 03 0 1 mm 0 1 0 5 mm 0 5 1 mm 1 3 mm 3 5 mm after quantitative analysis 5 10 of typical microplastics samples in each sampling site are selected for micro infrared spectroscopy nicolet in 10 thermo scientific the polymer type of the samples was determined by matching the measured spectra with the standard spectral database at least 80 omnic spectral library in this research approximately 43 4 of the suspected plastic items in daily wastewater samples 38 5 in the surface runoff samples 55 6 in the overflow samples 59 1 in the sediment samples and 58 3 in the receiving river samples were verified as microplastics typical microplastic morphology and spectra were described in the figs s1 and s2 to minimize potential plastic use and dust contamination during the experiment quality control measures were taken with reference to previous studies su et al 2020 all contaminated plastics in the experimental blank samples were fibers with an average concentration of about 6 5 items l subtracting the background values from the results 2 4 physicochemical analysis rainfall characteristics were recorded by a tilting bucket rainfall sensor the flow rate of wastewater in sewers was monitored by doppler ultrasonic flowmeters dx lsx 2 temperature do conductivity and ph were monitored by portable ysi detector in the field turbidity was detected by turbidity meter hj041 3 shanghai xinrui instrument co ltd indicators of cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total nitrogen tn and ss in water samples were analyzed the detection methods were all based on china s national standard guidelines particle volume concentration was analyzed using the lisst 200x a field portable laser particle size analyzer to ensure precision and accuracy three identical water samples were collected during each sampling 2 5 estimation of microplastics emission via urban drainage systems based on the existing research bollmann et al 2019 wang et al 2021 a quantitative evaluation method was proposed considering per capita discharge wastewater treatment rates sewer system layout and local precipitation randomly selected residential plots and overflow discharge data were analyzed directly to estimate microplastic emission during normal and storm weather from urban drainage catchments quantification of microplastics discharge into the aquatic environment from a particular separated drainage system were calculated by the following equations the detailed description was presented in table s4 1

differences of microplastic discharge using multiple statistical analysis methods principal component analysis pca was used to determine the correlation structure between microplastics and other water quality indicators regression analysis and pearson correlation analysis were used to elucidate the correlation between microplastic and physicochemical indicators related to particulate matter all statistical and data analyses were carried out with the help of the origin 2018 and ibm spss 23 0 3 results 3 1 microplastics abundance in wastewater generation transport treatment processes fig 2a revealed the microplastics abundance collected from different drainage plots and pumping stations 1 2 and 3 are stormwater pumping stations 4 and 5 are wastewater pumping stations microplastics in wastewater discharged from drainage plots generally showed urban villages 30 8 1 3 items l residential areas 28 4 4 0 items l administrative areas 25 5 4 9 items l industrial areas 19 1 6 5 items l commercial areas 13 6 4 5 items l fibers were the dominant microplastic shape accounting for more than 70 the microplastics abundance in wastewater pumping stations was larger than the stormwater pumping stations with concentrations of 32 3 5 1 items l and 20 7 6 2 items l respectively particles and films accounted for a larger proportion in the stormwater pumping stations than in the wastewater pumping stations fig 2b showed the mean value of microplastic abundance in wwtp influent was 42 3 9 2 items l and the effluent was 15 8 5 1 items l the removal rates of wwtps were about 53 6 70 8 fibers were the main type of microplastics in the influent 26 1 40 2 items l and effluent 10 2 16 8 items l fig 2c revealed that microplastics in daily wastewater were mainly 0 03 1 mm in size accounting for more than 85 of the total there was no significant difference in the size distribution of microplastics from different drainage plots the average proportion of less than 0 5 mm was about 62 0 polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyethylene pe were the main types accounting for more than 65 followed by polyamide pa and polystyrene ps the types of microplastics in wastewater transport process have slight differences mainly because microplastics in wastewater were mainly affected by human activities and there were time varying characteristics 3 2 microplastics discharged from drainage sewer overflow the sources of urban drainage sewer overflow pollution in wet weather mainly included rainfall runoff combined or misconnected wastewater and sewer sediments gasperi et al 2010 li et al 2022 the microplastic abundance in runoff and sewer overflow from different storm events were presented in fig 3a microplastic abundance in overflow 83 1 40 2 items l was significantly higher than that in runoff 34 2 33 5 items l the highest concentration was found in road runoff 49 1 21 4 items l followed by sidewalk 26 9 14 7 items l and roof 24 9 12 1 items l the runoff samples were much higher than stormwater 8 8 2 9 items l microplastic abundance in overflow pollution differed under different rainfall conditions the highest average overflow effluent concentration of 71 1 to 122 2 items l on july 21 and the lowest average overflow effluent concentration of 59 0 to 82 3 items l on september 14 the concentrations of single overflow event showed a trend of high in the early stage and low in the late stage fig s3 the overall microplastic abundance in the sewer sediment of the stormwater sewers showed that the residential area 6982 5 3049 5 items kg administrative area 4161 0 711 0 items kg commercial area 3705 0 285 0 items kg industrial area 2964 0 1824 0 items kg fig 3b the shapes sizes and polymer of microplastics in sewer overflow during wet weather shown in fig 3c fibers were the most dominant type accounting for 56 1 in runoff 85 7 in misconnected wastewater and 72 6 in sewer sediment respectively and a total of 69 2 in the overflow effluent particles accounted for a higher proportion in runoff and sewer sediment 22 6 and 18 7 respectively and a total of 17 6 of the overflow effluent in comparison the size of microplastics in runoff and daily wastewater was small with the particle size 0 03 0 5 mm accounted for 76 8 and 69 5 respectively it is noteworthy that the distribution of large size microplastics 1 mm in sewer sediments was significantly higher than that of runoff and daily wastewater which was about 21 2 pet 38 5 followed by pe 21 5 and ps 18 4 were the most abundant and other polymers were polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp and cellophane 3 3 microplastics pollution in the receiving urban river after sewer overflow the variation process of microplastics abundance in an urban river during and after the sewer overflow pollution was observed the samples were collected when the overflow occurred and 10 h 24 h 72 h after from fig 4 the highest microplastics abundance in receiving river occurred during the overflow which was much higher than the average abundance in runoff and daily wastewater then gradually decreased with the peak abundance lasting about 10 24 h and it returned to normal level after 2 3 days the microplastics abundance in the upstream river was larger than downstream section 1 and section 2 were 46 4 68 44 items l and 33 6 77 7 items l at the time of overflow which may relate to the reason that the overflow outlets were mostly located upstream consistent with the sewer overflow characteristics microplastics abundance in the river was generally higher on july 21 61 5 items l and the lowest was on august 15 40 8 items l the morphological characteristics of microplastics in the river were mainly fibers 31 6 91 7 and particles 4 6 35 3 with lower content of films and fragments in addition sediment samples from each river cross section were synchronously collected overall microplastics abundance in the sediment was higher in section 1 6270 0 1779 5 items kg and section 4 6384 0 1595 9 items kg than in section 2 4845 0 403 1 items kg and section 3 4190 0 809 2 items kg the reason might be mainly due to the installation of rubber dams at the sampling sections 1 and 4 which intercepted the particles the rain sourced urban rivers have slow velocity about 0 13 0 26 m s in dry weather microplastics would be deposited in the riverbed by the movement of aggregation and sedimentation which makes microplastics accumulate in the sediment alimi et al 2018 consistent with the surface water the morphological distribution generally showed fiber 71 9 particle 15 0 film 8 4 fragments 4 7 3 4 correlation analysis of microplastics and water quality pac was used to determine the correlation between the microplastics and conventional water quality indexes cod nh3 n tn tss turbidity and particle volume concentration in wastewater runoff overflow and surface water the results showed that two principal components pc1 49 5 pc2 26 2 comprised the majority variance fig 5a tables s5 and s6 demonstrated that the variables of wastewater runoff overflow and surface water formed more distinct independent clusters wastewater had a more distinct positive correlation with pc1 while runoff overflow had a more distinct positive correlation with pc2 in terms of different indicators positive pc1 correlated with cod tn and nh3 n whereas positive pc2 correlated with microplastics concentration and particle volume concentration due to the instrument range the particle volume concentration was below 0 495 mm fig 5b further revealed the variation of microplastics with cod and tn in wastewater runoff overflow and surface water there was no consistent trend of increasing microplastic abundance with increasing concentrations of conventional indicators the variation trend of cod and tn in wastewater was synchronized however the microplastics did not change with the variation of cod and tn the microplastics abundance in runoff and overflow was significantly higher than that in wastewater and surface water and the microplastics abundance in surface water after storms was mostly even higher than the untreated wastewater despite the low concentrations of cod and tn from fig 5c there are significant differences between microplastic abundance in wastewater runoff overflow and surface water in relation to these variable indicators for wastewater there was no significant correlation between microplastics and tss turbidity and particle volume concentration the correlation between microplastic abundance and particle volume concentration was more significant in both runoff overflow and surface water compared with microplastics particle volume concentration was easier to obtain by monitoring particle volume concentrations the following formula were derived for predicting microplastic abundance in runoff and overflow under different rainfall events fig s4 6 y 0 086 x 26 622 r 2 0 7321 p 0 01 where y is the microplastic abundance items l x is the particle volume concentration below 0 495 mm μl l the formula was applicable to the rainfall depth of 2 4 21 0 mm d or the rainfall intensity of 0 041 0 331 mm min and might be more suitable for the calculation of overflow load discharge from the sewer with sediment deposition especially in the urban built up areas 4 discussion 4 1 distribution characteristics of microplastics in the generation transport treatment process of urban wastewater system residential activities industrial production and agriculture were all important output sources of terrigenous microplastic su et al 2020 high microplastic emissions were concentrated in many industrial and commercial areas chen et al 2020 jang et al 2020 in the west river downstream in the south of china the microplastics abundance was observed in commercial public recreational residential industrial natural areas huang et al 2021 microplastics 5 85 3 28 items l had even been found in rivers in slum areas alam et al 2019 in addition there were also studies revealing higher microplastics concentrations in waste from agricultural land such as the ofanto river in southeast italy campanale et al 2020 swiss seeland bigalke et al 2022 a farmland in southeast germany piehl et al 2018 and coastal areas in xiamen china tang et al 2018 this study provided direct evidence for the microplastic abundance in effluent discharging from drainage plots of different land use types microplastic abundance were found to be higher in direct discharges from residential areas 28 4 4 0 items l and urban villages 30 8 1 3 items l than other plots and some temporal variability was found for residential wastewater with higher microplastic discharge concentrations at 10 pm than at 6 pm and 1 pm table s7 previous studies had similarly reported obvious variability in microplastic abundance between different times of the day blair et al 2019 cao et al 2020 fiber was the most predominant form in all land use types especially residential area with polyester production dominated by synthetic fibers the polymer was mainly pet and pe similar to other studies baldwin et al 2016 dris et al 2015 ross et al 2021 fibers mainly originated from textile clothing care products cosmetics etc higher microplastic abundance in the evening also provided direct evidence that laundry and washing processes were the main source of household fibers choi et al 2021 hernandez et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the microplastics characteristics composition shape and size etc physicochemical properties of the water column ph salinity ionic species and strength etc sediment properties particle size distribution composition and organic matter content etc disturbance time and intensity are all the key influencing factors on the migration of microplastics in the water column kooi et al 2017 jin et al 2018 wagner et al 2019 gao et al 2023 because of the significant differences in shape size and density of microplastics microplastics differed significantly from particulate matter in its behavior waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 cowger et al 2021 in general the surface area of a microplastic particle and its texture were practically important parameters since they might affect the time of fouling up chubarenko et al 2016 the fibers appeared to have the largest surface area for the given mass immediately followed by films zhang and choi 2022 the settling velocity of fibers and films in still water is generally lower than that of particles and debris khatmullina and isachenko 2017 wang et al 2021 meanwhile daily wastewater was mainly fibers which should sink due to bio fouling by the bio films attached to the sewer walls chubarenko et al 2016 in this study the direct discharge wastewater from the drainage plots was mainly pet 1 38 g cm3 pe 0 92 0 97 g cm3 and ps 0 96 1 05 g cm3 except for pet the densities of the other two polymers were smaller or approximate to that of daily wastewater 0 9988 1 0041 g cm3 zhang et al 2019 however when the velocity in the sewers increased the shear stress exceeded the critical value microplastics might re suspend into the wastewater similar to the composite effect of sediment and epiphytes at the riverbed hurley et al 2018 as a corollary in addition to being directly influenced by land use types microplastic abundance in sewage sewers might have physical sedimentation biosorption and erosion characteristics as conventional organic matters and nutrients shi et al 2018 while few studies have yet revealed the physical and dynamical properties of microplastics in sewage sewers compared with previous studies of wwtps in different countries the microplastic abundance measured in the influent and effluent herein was at a moderate level table 1 the removal rates of wwtps 53 6 70 8 in this study was much lower than the above studies basically above 85 previous studies have shown that the removal of microplastics closely related to the treatment process physicochemical properties of microplastics etc the removal rates varied widely among different wwtps carr et al 2016 long et al 2019 the microplastic removal rates of tertiary treatment in the three wastewater plants in this study was higher than that of secondary treatment schernewski et al 2021 talvitie et al 2017 the treated effluent in this study consisted mainly of fibers in agreement with previous studies gies et al 2018 capturing all polyester fibers in wwtps was a major technical challenge requiring urgent attention hurley et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2021 especially in densely populated older urban areas just like the present study area in addition it had been claimed that as the operating load of the wwtp increased the microplastic abundance subsequently increased while the removal rates decreased significantly long et al 2019 combined drainage systems remained in some regions and stormwater and wastewater misconnection was difficult to avoid the operational control of wwtps during the wet weather needed sufficient attention 4 2 contribution of sewer overflow to microplastics pollution in urban receiving rivers overflow pollution is an important factor that exacerbated microplastic load in the aquatic environment under high flow rates and dispersed inputs li et al 2015 hitchcock 2020 in this study microplastic discharge characteristics from sewer outlets in urban catchments were investigated for the first time the results showed that the highest peak abundance being about 10 times higher than that in treated effluent from wwtp the microplastic abundance from overflow outlets obtained in this study 83 1 40 2 items l were significantly higher than those of stormwater sewers in hong kong 1 4 to 6 8 items l mak et al 2020 and in wuhan 2 75 0 76 to 19 04 2 96 items l sang et al 2021 the main reason might be the presence of misconnected wastewater in the drainage area of this study however the results of the study were lower than that in the combined system overflow in shanghai 130 30 to 8500 1241 items l chen et al 2020 and paris 190 1046 fibers l dris et al 2015 the possible reason might be attributed to a combination of urbanization population density or sampling and analytical methods the high percentage of polymer that appeared were pet pe and ps and toxic plastics further harmed the ecology of the receiving urban water bodies the first flush effect was an important indicator to characterize the pollution process of overflow pollution peng et al 2016 peter et al 2020 in this study microplastic abundance in a single overflow event also showed first flush effect supplementary material and was similar to cod and tss in the early stage of rainfall the scouring effect of surface runoff and wastewater in sewers carried the microplastic particles accumulated in dry weather to the receiving water bodies however the dilution effect of rainwater increased in the later stage of rainfall resulting in a decrease of microplastics concentration the overflow effluent in this study was dominated by fibers which tend to settle on the surface sutton et al 2016 also they could be resuspended and discharged during heavy rainfall chen et al 2020 numerous studies had revealed the significant effects of rainfall intensity and antecedent dry period on the concentration of pollutants such as organic matter nutrients and heavy metals in the overflow yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 the significant differences in microplastic abundance among the four overflow events revealed that the response of microplastic abundance to rainfall conditions was basically consistent with other pollutants the results suggested that prolonged antecedent dry period would cause pollutants on the surface and sediment in the sewer to accumulate increasing the concentration of effluent when rainfall started barone et al 2019 while the rainfall depth and intensity increased the dilution effect became more noticeable in addition heavy rainfall would increase the scouring on the surface increasing the microplastics concentration of runoff and enhance the erosion of sediment in the sewer semadeni davies et al 2008 sandoval et al 2013 in this study for the first time simultaneous sampling of surface runoff misconnected wastewater in stormwater sewer sewer sediment and final overflow discharge in a specific catchment area the highest microplastic abundance were found in road runoff which was consistent with previous study chen et al 2022b granular and film plastics found in road runoff were different with wastewater in this study which might be tire and road wear particles vehicle wear etc yukioka et al 2020 fibers were still the dominant microplastic form in surface runoff which might originate from synthetic clothing plastic waste paper towels packaging materials etc the higher proportion of pet pe and ps confirmed this speculation talbot et al 2022 wang et al 2019 yan et al 2019 studies have also revealed that cigarette butts composed of cellulose were one of the most common microplastics in the environment shen et al 2021 the large number of masks were also used during the covid 19 dissanayake et al 2021 meanwhile atmospheric deposition was also an important source of microplastics the microplastic abundance in the rainwater background monitored in this study was 8 8 2 9 items l mainly fibers liu et al 2019b through previous studies and the results of our research group s existing studies sewer sediments had been proved to be a key source of overflow pollutants such as cod nutrients and heavy metals gasperi et al 2010 li et al 2022 storm and flood events were the primary periods when microplastic entered water bodies hitchcock 2020 microplastic abundance increased seven times after rainfall along the california coast of the united states moore et al 2011 and microplastic load in the clackamas river and the johnson creek in poland was significantly higher in august than in february talbot et al 2022 the same results also occurred in the brisbane river australia he et al 2020 nakdong river korea eo et al 2019 baltic sea schernewski et al 2021 and in northwest england hurley et al 2018 in this study the overflow effluent and the dense distribution of outlets directly influenced microplastic abundance in the water column high microplastic abundance lasted for nearly 1 day after the storm low density microplastics pe and pp were more likely to float on the water surface or be suspended in the water column kooi et al 2017 the tendency of microplastics to accumulate in the sediment also because urban rivers were mostly rich in humic substances and microbial communities eo et al 2019 meanwhile rubber dams or interception measures in urban streams might exacerbate microplastic abundance in the substrate during the wet weather increased river flows could cause microplastics deposited in river substrates to resuspend in the water column transforming temporarily from a microplastic sink to a source of pollution woodward et al 2021 in this study microbeads or regular particles were only considered also particles below 0 03 mm were not considered due to the limitations of the detection method the amount of microplastics reported in this study might be underestimated therefore rainfall and storm occurrence were critical periods for riverine input of microplastics to the ocean which were possibly more harmful than direct discharges from wwtp or other point sources pollution 4 3 microplastics emission in the urban drainage systems characteristic pollutants and total amount control many urban drainage systems currently suffer from breakage blockage and misconnection due to a variety of factors such as unqualified construction and improper maintenance and management sun 2020 xing et al 2020 in areas where the sewer invert lies below the ground water table sewer infiltration commonly occurs through sewer cracks and joints increased hydraulic loading and reduced wastewater treatment efficiency marker species approach was a commonly method to account for the infiltration in the sewer which mainly utilized the difference in concentration of characteristic factors and was more appropriate to use conservative substances zhao et al 2020 some studies claimed that microplastics had also been detected in groundwater 0 7 10 3 items l mintenig et al 2019 but at much lower concentrations than in daily wastewater 13 6 30 8 items l similarly microplastic characteristics in surface runoff also differ significantly from those of daily wastewater especially characteristic plastics such as rubber particles from tire wear and road coatings subsequent studies could explore the operability of microplastics as a marker specie for groundwater infiltration or rainwater inflow in sewage sewers the total annual discharge load of microplastics have been directly accounted in different regions using the effluent from wwtps or the discharge from pumping stations bollmann et al 2019 chen et al 2022a qi et al 2022 stated that the average microplastic discharge load in personal care and cosmetics was 2 18 million particles per capita per year kole et al 2017 estimated per capita emission ranged from 0 23 to 4 7 kg year with a global average of 0 81 kg year from wear and tear tyres however there was a lack of microplastic production coefficient that correspond to the actual level of social development in each region this study aimed to account for the first time the per capita generation equivalents of microplastics in drainage plots combined with population and actual water usage the results showed that the average microplastics per day emitted per capita in household wastewater was 3461 5 items the per capita production coefficient closely related to the level of urbanization and water consumption habits of the region it was an important basic index for statistical calculation and evaluation of the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment industry the average microplastic discharge from the four overflow events in catchment a monitored in this study was about 1 85 107 items based on the per capita production coefficient and the removal rates of the wwtp 70 8 the microplastic emissions in the catchment a was about 4 40 106 items day microplastic emissions from the single overflow event in wet weather was about 4 5 times higher than treated effluent discharge in dry weather a quantitative estimation method was proposed to show that the annual emissions load of microplastics via urban drainage system in this research area was 5 83 1010 items km2 of which the proportion of emissions in wet weather accounted for about 60 this study confirmed the non negligible microplastic emissions during rainfall or storm events at present similar with other particulate pollutants the increase of rainfall and intensity would intensify the microplastics emissions however there was a lack of research on the microplastic discharge load under different rainfall conditions which also made the operational design of interception and precipitation facilities more difficult turbulent flow in the sewers might exacerbate the secondary movement of microplastic fibers choi et al 2022 the scientific definition of microplastic morphology in wastewater might provide a basis for reasonable prediction of resistance models zhang and choi 2022 in addition a range of other anthropogenic stressors in the sewers interact with microplastics such as sediments nutrients pathogens and anoxic or anaerobic environment which might pose a higher risk after storms and floods eckert et al 2018 mccormick et al 2014 the results of this study might provide additional data to support the establishment of a database on microplastic abundance in overflow pollution meanwhile the importance of implementing measures to reduce the output of microplastics in wet weather was emphasized the hydraulic and dynamical properties of specific microplastics should also be considered when selecting and operating facilities such as overflow registers stormwater retention ponds and constructed wetlands the effective capture of microplastics along with the effective removal of traditional pollutants should also considered 5 conclusion this study determined the migration and emission of microplastics in urban drainage systems during normal and storm flows the impacts of meteorological conditions and land use were explored microplastics were detected at the sewage discharge from drainage plots with different land use types the highest and lowest abundance were residential and commercial areas respectively the average microplastics per day emitted per capita in household wastewater was 3461 5 items the main microplastic forms in the wastewater were fibers with particle size less than 1 mm pet and pe were the two main microplastic polymers the microplastic removal rates of the three wwtps in the study area ranged from 53 6 to 70 8 and the treatment facilities had limited removal of fibers sewer overflow pollution in wet weather was an important source of microplastics in urban receiving river sewer overflow discharge can greatly aggravate microplastic abundance to 83 1 40 2 items l this study confirmed the major contribution of road runoff and sewer sediments scouring to microplastic emission load in addition microplastic abundance in runoff overflow and surface water showed a more significant positive correlation with particle volume concentrations a quantitative estimation method was proposed to show that the annual emissions load of microplastics via urban drainage system in this research area was 5 83 1010 items km2 of which the proportion of emissions in wet weather accounted for about 60 more attention needs to be paid to control and reduce the microplastics discharge from urban drainage systems to

14851,urban drainage system is an important channel for terrigenous microplastics 5 mm in size to migrate to urban water bodies especially the input load caused by overflow pollution in wet weather investigating how they transport and discharge is essential to better understand the occurrence and variability of microplastics in different water ecosystems this study evaluated the abundance and distribution characteristics of microplastics in the drainage systems of typical coastal cities in china the impacts of meteorological conditions and land use were explored in particular the prominent contribution of drainage sewer overflow pollution during storm events were investigated the results showed that the microplastics abundance in daily sewage discharge from different drainage plots ranged between 13 6 and 30 8 items l with fibers as the dominant type of microplastics sewer overflow discharge can greatly aggravate microplastic abundance to 83 1 40 2 items l road runoff and sewer sediment scouring were the main pollution sources systematic estimates based on detailed data showed that the average microplastics emitted per capita per day in household wastewater was 3461 5 items a quantitative estimation method was proposed to show that the annual emissions load of microplastics via urban drainage system in this research area was 5 83 1010 items km2 of which the proportion of emissions in wet weather accounted for about 60 this research provides the first full process of assessment and source apportionment of the microplastic distribution characteristics in old drainage system the occurrence of storm events is an important marker of increased microplastic abundance in urban rivers with a view to urgent need for interception of surface runoff and purification of sewer overflow pollution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic urban drainage system sewer overflow pollution receiving river discharge abundance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics a type of plastics generally accepted as measuring smaller than 5 mm in size are widely distributed in the water environment rochman 2018 microplastics have posed a threat to most parts of ecological system and even transport through the food chain into human bodies ross et al 2021 wright and kelly 2017 researchers have found microplastic particles in human blood samples and deep in the lungs of living humans jenner et al 2022 leslie et al 2022 annual global plastic production is estimated to reach 500 million tons in 2025 plastics europe 2019 80 of marine microplastics originate from terrestrial systems andrady 2011 yonkos et al 2014 fluvial system are an essential pathway for land based inputs huang et al 2021 niu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 due to the high correlation with human activities urban areas may be considered of an integral source for microplastics emissions into rivers wagner et al 2019 the major sources of microplastics in urban agglomerations include sewage discharge atmospheric deposition and surface runoff these sources are all related to the collection and discharge of drainage systems which are the important channels for pollution transfer between land and water bodies browne et al 2011 eriksen et al 2013 mak et al 2020 in general generated microplastics are transported via sewers to the wastewater treatment plants wwtps the removal rates is influenced by a combination of service area characteristics and treatment processes blair et al 2019 carr et al 2016 long et al 2019 although appreciable removal can be achieved depending on the wwtp types due to the continuous discharge of treated effluent high concentrations of microplastics are still detected in both the water column and sediment downstream of the wwtp conley et al 2019 murphy et al 2016 also rapid and dense urbanization has contributed to increased abundance of microplastic in urban rivers esquinas et al 2020 the sources and pathways of microplastics are closely related to land use and population density microplastics are generated from the use of personal care products washing illegal waste dumping etc choi et al 2021 ó briain et al 2020 piehl et al 2018 there is great spatial heterogeneity in microplastic emissions due to differences in production patterns jang et al 2020 su et al 2020 however most previous studies revealed the influence of land use types through the variation of microplastic abundance in water environment in different regions dikareva and simon 2019 wagner et al 2019 while few have reported the abundance of microplastics in directly generated wastewater from drainage plots understanding microplastics produced by different drainage plots is critical for identifying sources and managing wastewater treatment facilities another key source of impact to pollution discharge from urban drainage systems is sewer overflow pollution during wet weather high pollution load caused by sewer overflow has been widely demonstrated such as cod nutrients heavy metals persistent organic compounds etc launay et al 2016 pilotti et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 during storms or intense rainfall surface scouring causes microplastics to transport into sewers with runoff and eventually discharge into rivers lange et al 2021 liu et al 2019a the major sources include the form of tire wear particles road paint plastic waste etc large amounts of runoff cause the water volume to exceed the operational load in the drainage sewers resulting in overflow pollution direct input of untreated wastewater containing high microplastic abundance might occur which have been detected in overflow effluent in paris italy and shanghai chen et al 2020 di nunno et al 2021 dris et al 2015 treilles et al 2020 in addition the continuous transport of wastewater in sewers during dry weather results in the settlement or adsorption of large amounts of microplastic particles into the sediments sang et al 2021 shahsavari et al 2017 while the increased flow during storm or intense rainfall continuously flushes the sediments at the bottom of the sewers to the receiving water sewer sediments may be considered a prominent source of overflow pollution microplastic abundance in rivers and estuaries can surge several or even tens of times following intense rainfall and storm events chen et al 2020 given accelerated urbanization process and progressively larger paved areas the risk of microplastic generation and emission is likely to rise dalu et al 2021 esquinas et al 2020 meanwhile in china as well as other countries or regions there are numerous problems with drainage systems such as broken blockages and separation of rainwater and sewage drains schilperoort et al 2013 ellis and butler 2015 tan et al 2019 xu et al 2020 2019 these exacerbate the leakage or overflow of untreated wastewater and sediment transmitted which also meant that more land based microplastics would migrate into the nearby water bodies there is consensus that the most effective way to reduce microplastics is to control the sources and migration pathways woodward et al 2021 however this microplastic migration pathway has not attracted enough attention the aim of this study was to determine the migration and emission of microplastics in urban drainage systems during normal and storm flows the urbanized catchments of typical coastal cities in southern china are selected representative microplastic samples were collected from surface runoff overflow effluent sewer sediment and receiving river during multiple rainfall events the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the microplastics abundance in the daily sewage discharge from drainage plots of different land use types 2 evaluate the microplastics abundance of sewer overflows and investigate the migration characteristics of microplastic in receiving river after storm events 3 propose a quantitative evaluation method for microplastics emission load in normal and wet weather understanding the sources of microplastics in these catchments is crucial for deciding priorities for management interventions and reducing inputs load to waterways 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas we selected the drainage system of the built up area of nanning to determine the characteristics of microplastic distribution in a typical coastal city fig 1 nanning located in southern china a typical subtropical region with annual average rainfall of about 1300 mm in normal weather samples were collected from the influent and effluent of three wwtps the collection area of the wwtps was mainly dominated by the separated drainage system more than 80 of the area which mainly collected domestic wastewater more than 90 and a small amount of industrial wastewater five pumping stations within the service area of the largest wwtp were selected to collect wastewater samples two wastewater pumping stations and three stormwater pumping stations specific information on wwtps and pumping stations is provided in table s1 meanwhile wastewater samples were collected from 17 different functional area drainage plots including 4 residential areas 4 industrial areas 4 commercial areas 3 administrative areas and 2 urban villages table s2 for details all samples were collected in the summer of 2021 and on dry days at least three days after rain during wet weather a separated drainage catchment a was selected for the collection of surface runoff overflow discharge and sediments at the bottom of sewers the catchment a was in the service area of the same wwtp collected in dry weather catchment a covered an area of about 14 6 ha and was predominantly residential with a population density of 335 p ha the sewer overflow from catchment a is discharged into an urban river that eventually flows into yongjiang river in order to ensure that the untreated wastewater was not directly discharged into the river in dry weather intercepted sewers were set up along the river to transport the misconnected wastewater to the wwtp when it rains a large amount of runoff is mixed in exceeding the load of the intercepted sewer thus causing overflow discharge water and sediment samples were collected simultaneously from four river cross sections during and after rainfall rainfall information was provided in the table s3 2 2 sample collection before sampling all sampling tools were rinsed with ultrapure water water samples were collected using 10 l stainless steel bucket wwtps samples were collected at the collection wells and effluent outlets pumping station samples were collected at the collection pond drainage plots were collected in the manholes before connected to the municipal sewer network all samples were collected 15 20 min and volume of 5 l on rainy days samples from runoff and overflow were collected every 30 min of the first hour and every hour thereafter until runoff and overflow ended river samples were collected three times simultaneously taking 10 l of mixed water samples at 30 cm below the water surface after collection the water samples were passed through a 30 µm stainless steel meshes repeatedly rinsed 3 5 times and all residual material on the meshes was transferred to a clean glass bottle using ultrapure water sewer sediment samples were collected using a stainless steel grabber prior to rainfall and approximately 1 kg was collected into a glass container we collected water samples simultaneously to perform the other chemical analysis upon completing the sample collection all the samples were kept in 500 ml polyethylene bottles immediately transported to the laboratory refrigerated at 4 and analyzed within 12 h 2 3 microplastic identification water samples were pretreated to digest using 60 ml of h2o2 to remove organic matters and the digestion process was carried out in a thermostat with a stable temperature of 60 c for 24 h reaction after digestion the solution was filtered through a 5 μm polycarbonate filter membrane with a vacuum pump and the membranes were stored in covered glass dishes and dried in an oven at 40 c sediment samples were sieved 5 mm mesh and freeze dried for 3 d to a constant weight 20 g of samples were weighed and then separated using a saturated zncl2 solution 1 6 g cm3 for 8 h repeated 3 4 times the obtained sediment supernatant was then passed through a 30 μm stainless steel mesh the subsequent operation was the same as the above water sample treatment process the obtained microplastic samples were observed using a stereomicroscope pxs6555t j3 shanghai cewei photoelectric technology co ltd and tcapture software including the quantitative and morphological analysis the shape can be classified as fiber particle fragment film etc the size is divided into five categories 0 03 0 1 mm 0 1 0 5 mm 0 5 1 mm 1 3 mm 3 5 mm after quantitative analysis 5 10 of typical microplastics samples in each sampling site are selected for micro infrared spectroscopy nicolet in 10 thermo scientific the polymer type of the samples was determined by matching the measured spectra with the standard spectral database at least 80 omnic spectral library in this research approximately 43 4 of the suspected plastic items in daily wastewater samples 38 5 in the surface runoff samples 55 6 in the overflow samples 59 1 in the sediment samples and 58 3 in the receiving river samples were verified as microplastics typical microplastic morphology and spectra were described in the figs s1 and s2 to minimize potential plastic use and dust contamination during the experiment quality control measures were taken with reference to previous studies su et al 2020 all contaminated plastics in the experimental blank samples were fibers with an average concentration of about 6 5 items l subtracting the background values from the results 2 4 physicochemical analysis rainfall characteristics were recorded by a tilting bucket rainfall sensor the flow rate of wastewater in sewers was monitored by doppler ultrasonic flowmeters dx lsx 2 temperature do conductivity and ph were monitored by portable ysi detector in the field turbidity was detected by turbidity meter hj041 3 shanghai xinrui instrument co ltd indicators of cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total nitrogen tn and ss in water samples were analyzed the detection methods were all based on china s national standard guidelines particle volume concentration was analyzed using the lisst 200x a field portable laser particle size analyzer to ensure precision and accuracy three identical water samples were collected during each sampling 2 5 estimation of microplastics emission via urban drainage systems based on the existing research bollmann et al 2019 wang et al 2021 a quantitative evaluation method was proposed considering per capita discharge wastewater treatment rates sewer system layout and local precipitation randomly selected residential plots and overflow discharge data were analyzed directly to estimate microplastic emission during normal and storm weather from urban drainage catchments quantification of microplastics discharge into the aquatic environment from a particular separated drainage system were calculated by the following equations the detailed description was presented in table s4 1

concentration of stormwater runoff and sewer overflow was the average of multiple sampling annual rainfall used official data for 2021 2 6 data analysis quantitative expression of the similarities and differences of microplastic discharge using multiple statistical analysis methods principal component analysis pca was used to determine the correlation structure between microplastics and other water quality indicators regression analysis and pearson correlation analysis were used to elucidate the correlation between microplastic and physicochemical indicators related to particulate matter all statistical and data analyses were carried out with the help of the origin 2018 and ibm spss 23 0 3 results 3 1 microplastics abundance in wastewater generation transport treatment processes fig 2a revealed the microplastics abundance collected from different drainage plots and pumping stations 1 2 and 3 are stormwater pumping stations 4 and 5 are wastewater pumping stations microplastics in wastewater discharged from drainage plots generally showed urban villages 30 8 1 3 items l residential areas 28 4 4 0 items l administrative areas 25 5 4 9 items l industrial areas 19 1 6 5 items l commercial areas 13 6 4 5 items l fibers were the dominant microplastic shape accounting for more than 70 the microplastics abundance in wastewater pumping stations was larger than the stormwater pumping stations with concentrations of 32 3 5 1 items l and 20 7 6 2 items l respectively particles and films accounted for a larger proportion in the stormwater pumping stations than in the wastewater pumping stations fig 2b showed the mean value of microplastic abundance in wwtp influent was 42 3 9 2 items l and the effluent was 15 8 5 1 items l the removal rates of wwtps were about 53 6 70 8 fibers were the main type of microplastics in the influent 26 1 40 2 items l and effluent 10 2 16 8 items l fig 2c revealed that microplastics in daily wastewater were mainly 0 03 1 mm in size accounting for more than 85 of the total there was no significant difference in the size distribution of microplastics from different drainage plots the average proportion of less than 0 5 mm was about 62 0 polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyethylene pe were the main types accounting for more than 65 followed by polyamide pa and polystyrene ps the types of microplastics in wastewater transport process have slight differences mainly because microplastics in wastewater were mainly affected by human activities and there were time varying characteristics 3 2 microplastics discharged from drainage sewer overflow the sources of urban drainage sewer overflow pollution in wet weather mainly included rainfall runoff combined or misconnected wastewater and sewer sediments gasperi et al 2010 li et al 2022 the microplastic abundance in runoff and sewer overflow from different storm events were presented in fig 3a microplastic abundance in overflow 83 1 40 2 items l was significantly higher than that in runoff 34 2 33 5 items l the highest concentration was found in road runoff 49 1 21 4 items l followed by sidewalk 26 9 14 7 items l and roof 24 9 12 1 items l the runoff samples were much higher than stormwater 8 8 2 9 items l microplastic abundance in overflow pollution differed under different rainfall conditions the highest average overflow effluent concentration of 71 1 to 122 2 items l on july 21 and the lowest average overflow effluent concentration of 59 0 to 82 3 items l on september 14 the concentrations of single overflow event showed a trend of high in the early stage and low in the late stage fig s3 the overall microplastic abundance in the sewer sediment of the stormwater sewers showed that the residential area 6982 5 3049 5 items kg administrative area 4161 0 711 0 items kg commercial area 3705 0 285 0 items kg industrial area 2964 0 1824 0 items kg fig 3b the shapes sizes and polymer of microplastics in sewer overflow during wet weather shown in fig 3c fibers were the most dominant type accounting for 56 1 in runoff 85 7 in misconnected wastewater and 72 6 in sewer sediment respectively and a total of 69 2 in the overflow effluent particles accounted for a higher proportion in runoff and sewer sediment 22 6 and 18 7 respectively and a total of 17 6 of the overflow effluent in comparison the size of microplastics in runoff and daily wastewater was small with the particle size 0 03 0 5 mm accounted for 76 8 and 69 5 respectively it is noteworthy that the distribution of large size microplastics 1 mm in sewer sediments was significantly higher than that of runoff and daily wastewater which was about 21 2 pet 38 5 followed by pe 21 5 and ps 18 4 were the most abundant and other polymers were polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp and cellophane 3 3 microplastics pollution in the receiving urban river after sewer overflow the variation process of microplastics abundance in an urban river during and after the sewer overflow pollution was observed the samples were collected when the overflow occurred and 10 h 24 h 72 h after from fig 4 the highest microplastics abundance in receiving river occurred during the overflow which was much higher than the average abundance in runoff and daily wastewater then gradually decreased with the peak abundance lasting about 10 24 h and it returned to normal level after 2 3 days the microplastics abundance in the upstream river was larger than downstream section 1 and section 2 were 46 4 68 44 items l and 33 6 77 7 items l at the time of overflow which may relate to the reason that the overflow outlets were mostly located upstream consistent with the sewer overflow characteristics microplastics abundance in the river was generally higher on july 21 61 5 items l and the lowest was on august 15 40 8 items l the morphological characteristics of microplastics in the river were mainly fibers 31 6 91 7 and particles 4 6 35 3 with lower content of films and fragments in addition sediment samples from each river cross section were synchronously collected overall microplastics abundance in the sediment was higher in section 1 6270 0 1779 5 items kg and section 4 6384 0 1595 9 items kg than in section 2 4845 0 403 1 items kg and section 3 4190 0 809 2 items kg the reason might be mainly due to the installation of rubber dams at the sampling sections 1 and 4 which intercepted the particles the rain sourced urban rivers have slow velocity about 0 13 0 26 m s in dry weather microplastics would be deposited in the riverbed by the movement of aggregation and sedimentation which makes microplastics accumulate in the sediment alimi et al 2018 consistent with the surface water the morphological distribution generally showed fiber 71 9 particle 15 0 film 8 4 fragments 4 7 3 4 correlation analysis of microplastics and water quality pac was used to determine the correlation between the microplastics and conventional water quality indexes cod nh3 n tn tss turbidity and particle volume concentration in wastewater runoff overflow and surface water the results showed that two principal components pc1 49 5 pc2 26 2 comprised the majority variance fig 5a tables s5 and s6 demonstrated that the variables of wastewater runoff overflow and surface water formed more distinct independent clusters wastewater had a more distinct positive correlation with pc1 while runoff overflow had a more distinct positive correlation with pc2 in terms of different indicators positive pc1 correlated with cod tn and nh3 n whereas positive pc2 correlated with microplastics concentration and particle volume concentration due to the instrument range the particle volume concentration was below 0 495 mm fig 5b further revealed the variation of microplastics with cod and tn in wastewater runoff overflow and surface water there was no consistent trend of increasing microplastic abundance with increasing concentrations of conventional indicators the variation trend of cod and tn in wastewater was synchronized however the microplastics did not change with the variation of cod and tn the microplastics abundance in runoff and overflow was significantly higher than that in wastewater and surface water and the microplastics abundance in surface water after storms was mostly even higher than the untreated wastewater despite the low concentrations of cod and tn from fig 5c there are significant differences between microplastic abundance in wastewater runoff overflow and surface water in relation to these variable indicators for wastewater there was no significant correlation between microplastics and tss turbidity and particle volume concentration the correlation between microplastic abundance and particle volume concentration was more significant in both runoff overflow and surface water compared with microplastics particle volume concentration was easier to obtain by monitoring particle volume concentrations the following formula were derived for predicting microplastic abundance in runoff and overflow under different rainfall events fig s4 6 y 0 086 x 26 622 r 2 0 7321 p 0 01 where y is the microplastic abundance items l x is the particle volume concentration below 0 495 mm μl l the formula was applicable to the rainfall depth of 2 4 21 0 mm d or the rainfall intensity of 0 041 0 331 mm min and might be more suitable for the calculation of overflow load discharge from the sewer with sediment deposition especially in the urban built up areas 4 discussion 4 1 distribution characteristics of microplastics in the generation transport treatment process of urban wastewater system residential activities industrial production and agriculture were all important output sources of terrigenous microplastic su et al 2020 high microplastic emissions were concentrated in many industrial and commercial areas chen et al 2020 jang et al 2020 in the west river downstream in the south of china the microplastics abundance was observed in commercial public recreational residential industrial natural areas huang et al 2021 microplastics 5 85 3 28 items l had even been found in rivers in slum areas alam et al 2019 in addition there were also studies revealing higher microplastics concentrations in waste from agricultural land such as the ofanto river in southeast italy campanale et al 2020 swiss seeland bigalke et al 2022 a farmland in southeast germany piehl et al 2018 and coastal areas in xiamen china tang et al 2018 this study provided direct evidence for the microplastic abundance in effluent discharging from drainage plots of different land use types microplastic abundance were found to be higher in direct discharges from residential areas 28 4 4 0 items l and urban villages 30 8 1 3 items l than other plots and some temporal variability was found for residential wastewater with higher microplastic discharge concentrations at 10 pm than at 6 pm and 1 pm table s7 previous studies had similarly reported obvious variability in microplastic abundance between different times of the day blair et al 2019 cao et al 2020 fiber was the most predominant form in all land use types especially residential area with polyester production dominated by synthetic fibers the polymer was mainly pet and pe similar to other studies baldwin et al 2016 dris et al 2015 ross et al 2021 fibers mainly originated from textile clothing care products cosmetics etc higher microplastic abundance in the evening also provided direct evidence that laundry and washing processes were the main source of household fibers choi et al 2021 hernandez et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the microplastics characteristics composition shape and size etc physicochemical properties of the water column ph salinity ionic species and strength etc sediment properties particle size distribution composition and organic matter content etc disturbance time and intensity are all the key influencing factors on the migration of microplastics in the water column kooi et al 2017 jin et al 2018 wagner et al 2019 gao et al 2023 because of the significant differences in shape size and density of microplastics microplastics differed significantly from particulate matter in its behavior waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 cowger et al 2021 in general the surface area of a microplastic particle and its texture were practically important parameters since they might affect the time of fouling up chubarenko et al 2016 the fibers appeared to have the largest surface area for the given mass immediately followed by films zhang and choi 2022 the settling velocity of fibers and films in still water is generally lower than that of particles and debris khatmullina and isachenko 2017 wang et al 2021 meanwhile daily wastewater was mainly fibers which should sink due to bio fouling by the bio films attached to the sewer walls chubarenko et al 2016 in this study the direct discharge wastewater from the drainage plots was mainly pet 1 38 g cm3 pe 0 92 0 97 g cm3 and ps 0 96 1 05 g cm3 except for pet the densities of the other two polymers were smaller or approximate to that of daily wastewater 0 9988 1 0041 g cm3 zhang et al 2019 however when the velocity in the sewers increased the shear stress exceeded the critical value microplastics might re suspend into the wastewater similar to the composite effect of sediment and epiphytes at the riverbed hurley et al 2018 as a corollary in addition to being directly influenced by land use types microplastic abundance in sewage sewers might have physical sedimentation biosorption and erosion characteristics as conventional organic matters and nutrients shi et al 2018 while few studies have yet revealed the physical and dynamical properties of microplastics in sewage sewers compared with previous studies of wwtps in different countries the microplastic abundance measured in the influent and effluent herein was at a moderate level table 1 the removal rates of wwtps 53 6 70 8 in this study was much lower than the above studies basically above 85 previous studies have shown that the removal of microplastics closely related to the treatment process physicochemical properties of microplastics etc the removal rates varied widely among different wwtps carr et al 2016 long et al 2019 the microplastic removal rates of tertiary treatment in the three wastewater plants in this study was higher than that of secondary treatment schernewski et al 2021 talvitie et al 2017 the treated effluent in this study consisted mainly of fibers in agreement with previous studies gies et al 2018 capturing all polyester fibers in wwtps was a major technical challenge requiring urgent attention hurley et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2021 especially in densely populated older urban areas just like the present study area in addition it had been claimed that as the operating load of the wwtp increased the microplastic abundance subsequently increased while the removal rates decreased significantly long et al 2019 combined drainage systems remained in some regions and stormwater and wastewater misconnection was difficult to avoid the operational control of wwtps during the wet weather needed sufficient attention 4 2 contribution of sewer overflow to microplastics pollution in urban receiving rivers overflow pollution is an important factor that exacerbated microplastic load in the aquatic environment under high flow rates and dispersed inputs li et al 2015 hitchcock 2020 in this study microplastic discharge characteristics from sewer outlets in urban catchments were investigated for the first time the results showed that the highest peak abundance being about 10 times higher than that in treated effluent from wwtp the microplastic abundance from overflow outlets obtained in this study 83 1 40 2 items l were significantly higher than those of stormwater sewers in hong kong 1 4 to 6 8 items l mak et al 2020 and in wuhan 2 75 0 76 to 19 04 2 96 items l sang et al 2021 the main reason might be the presence of misconnected wastewater in the drainage area of this study however the results of the study were lower than that in the combined system overflow in shanghai 130 30 to 8500 1241 items l chen et al 2020 and paris 190 1046 fibers l dris et al 2015 the possible reason might be attributed to a combination of urbanization population density or sampling and analytical methods the high percentage of polymer that appeared were pet pe and ps and toxic plastics further harmed the ecology of the receiving urban water bodies the first flush effect was an important indicator to characterize the pollution process of overflow pollution peng et al 2016 peter et al 2020 in this study microplastic abundance in a single overflow event also showed first flush effect supplementary material and was similar to cod and tss in the early stage of rainfall the scouring effect of surface runoff and wastewater in sewers carried the microplastic particles accumulated in dry weather to the receiving water bodies however the dilution effect of rainwater increased in the later stage of rainfall resulting in a decrease of microplastics concentration the overflow effluent in this study was dominated by fibers which tend to settle on the surface sutton et al 2016 also they could be resuspended and discharged during heavy rainfall chen et al 2020 numerous studies had revealed the significant effects of rainfall intensity and antecedent dry period on the concentration of pollutants such as organic matter nutrients and heavy metals in the overflow yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 the significant differences in microplastic abundance among the four overflow events revealed that the response of microplastic abundance to rainfall conditions was basically consistent with other pollutants the results suggested that prolonged antecedent dry period would cause pollutants on the surface and sediment in the sewer to accumulate increasing the concentration of effluent when rainfall started barone et al 2019 while the rainfall depth and intensity increased the dilution effect became more noticeable in addition heavy rainfall would increase the scouring on the surface increasing the microplastics concentration of runoff and enhance the erosion of sediment in the sewer semadeni davies et al 2008 sandoval et al 2013 in this study for the first time simultaneous sampling of surface runoff misconnected wastewater in stormwater sewer sewer sediment and final overflow discharge in a specific catchment area the highest microplastic abundance were found in road runoff which was consistent with previous study chen et al 2022b granular and film plastics found in road runoff were different with wastewater in this study which might be tire and road wear particles vehicle wear etc yukioka et al 2020 fibers were still the dominant microplastic form in surface runoff which might originate from synthetic clothing plastic waste paper towels packaging materials etc the higher proportion of pet pe and ps confirmed this speculation talbot et al 2022 wang et al 2019 yan et al 2019 studies have also revealed that cigarette butts composed of cellulose were one of the most common microplastics in the environment shen et al 2021 the large number of masks were also used during the covid 19 dissanayake et al 2021 meanwhile atmospheric deposition was also an important source of microplastics the microplastic abundance in the rainwater background monitored in this study was 8 8 2 9 items l mainly fibers liu et al 2019b through previous studies and the results of our research group s existing studies sewer sediments had been proved to be a key source of overflow pollutants such as cod nutrients and heavy metals gasperi et al 2010 li et al 2022 storm and flood events were the primary periods when microplastic entered water bodies hitchcock 2020 microplastic abundance increased seven times after rainfall along the california coast of the united states moore et al 2011 and microplastic load in the clackamas river and the johnson creek in poland was significantly higher in august than in february talbot et al 2022 the same results also occurred in the brisbane river australia he et al 2020 nakdong river korea eo et al 2019 baltic sea schernewski et al 2021 and in northwest england hurley et al 2018 in this study the overflow effluent and the dense distribution of outlets directly influenced microplastic abundance in the water column high microplastic abundance lasted for nearly 1 day after the storm low density microplastics pe and pp were more likely to float on the water surface or be suspended in the water column kooi et al 2017 the tendency of microplastics to accumulate in the sediment also because urban rivers were mostly rich in humic substances and microbial communities eo et al 2019 meanwhile rubber dams or interception measures in urban streams might exacerbate microplastic abundance in the substrate during the wet weather increased river flows could cause microplastics deposited in river substrates to resuspend in the water column transforming temporarily from a microplastic sink to a source of pollution woodward et al 2021 in this study microbeads or regular particles were only considered also particles below 0 03 mm were not considered due to the limitations of the detection method the amount of microplastics reported in this study might be underestimated therefore rainfall and storm occurrence were critical periods for riverine input of microplastics to the ocean which were possibly more harmful than direct discharges from wwtp or other point sources pollution 4 3 microplastics emission in the urban drainage systems characteristic pollutants and total amount control many urban drainage systems currently suffer from breakage blockage and misconnection due to a variety of factors such as unqualified construction and improper maintenance and management sun 2020 xing et al 2020 in areas where the sewer invert lies below the ground water table sewer infiltration commonly occurs through sewer cracks and joints increased hydraulic loading and reduced wastewater treatment efficiency marker species approach was a commonly method to account for the infiltration in the sewer which mainly utilized the difference in concentration of characteristic factors and was more appropriate to use conservative substances zhao et al 2020 some studies claimed that microplastics had also been detected in groundwater 0 7 10 3 items l mintenig et al 2019 but at much lower concentrations than in daily wastewater 13 6 30 8 items l similarly microplastic characteristics in surface runoff also differ significantly from those of daily wastewater especially characteristic plastics such as rubber particles from tire wear and road coatings subsequent studies could explore the operability of microplastics as a marker specie for groundwater infiltration or rainwater inflow in sewage sewers the total annual discharge load of microplastics have been directly accounted in different regions using the effluent from wwtps or the discharge from pumping stations bollmann et al 2019 chen et al 2022a qi et al 2022 stated that the average microplastic discharge load in personal care and cosmetics was 2 18 million particles per capita per year kole et al 2017 estimated per capita emission ranged from 0 23 to 4 7 kg year with a global average of 0 81 kg year from wear and tear tyres however there was a lack of microplastic production coefficient that correspond to the actual level of social development in each region this study aimed to account for the first time the per capita generation equivalents of microplastics in drainage plots combined with population and actual water usage the results showed that the average microplastics per day emitted per capita in household wastewater was 3461 5 items the per capita production coefficient closely related to the level of urbanization and water consumption habits of the region it was an important basic index for statistical calculation and evaluation of the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment industry the average microplastic discharge from the four overflow events in catchment a monitored in this study was about 1 85 107 items based on the per capita production coefficient and the removal rates of the wwtp 70 8 the microplastic emissions in the catchment a was about 4 40 106 items day microplastic emissions from the single overflow event in wet weather was about 4 5 times higher than treated effluent discharge in dry weather a quantitative estimation method was proposed to show that the annual emissions load of microplastics via urban drainage system in this research area was 5 83 1010 items km2 of which the proportion of emissions in wet weather accounted for about 60 this study confirmed the non negligible microplastic emissions during rainfall or storm events at present similar with other particulate pollutants the increase of rainfall and intensity would intensify the microplastics emissions however there was a lack of research on the microplastic discharge load under different rainfall conditions which also made the operational design of interception and precipitation facilities more difficult turbulent flow in the sewers might exacerbate the secondary movement of microplastic fibers choi et al 2022 the scientific definition of microplastic morphology in wastewater might provide a basis for reasonable prediction of resistance models zhang and choi 2022 in addition a range of other anthropogenic stressors in the sewers interact with microplastics such as sediments nutrients pathogens and anoxic or anaerobic environment which might pose a higher risk after storms and floods eckert et al 2018 mccormick et al 2014 the results of this study might provide additional data to support the establishment of a database on microplastic abundance in overflow pollution meanwhile the importance of implementing measures to reduce the output of microplastics in wet weather was emphasized the hydraulic and dynamical properties of specific microplastics should also be considered when selecting and operating facilities such as overflow registers stormwater retention ponds and constructed wetlands the effective capture of microplastics along with the effective removal of traditional pollutants should also considered 5 conclusion this study determined the migration and emission of microplastics in urban drainage systems during normal and storm flows the impacts of meteorological conditions and land use were explored microplastics were detected at the sewage discharge from drainage plots with different land use types the highest and lowest abundance were residential and commercial areas respectively the average microplastics per day emitted per capita in household wastewater was 3461 5 items the main microplastic forms in the wastewater were fibers with particle size less than 1 mm pet and pe were the two main microplastic polymers the microplastic removal rates of the three wwtps in the study area ranged from 53 6 to 70 8 and the treatment facilities had limited removal of fibers sewer overflow pollution in wet weather was an important source of microplastics in urban receiving river sewer overflow discharge can greatly aggravate microplastic abundance to 83 1 40 2 items l this study confirmed the major contribution of road runoff and sewer sediments scouring to microplastic emission load in addition microplastic abundance in runoff overflow and surface water showed a more significant positive correlation with particle volume concentrations a quantitative estimation method was proposed to show that the annual emissions load of microplastics via urban drainage system in this research area was 5 83 1010 items km2 of which the proportion of emissions in wet weather accounted for about 60 more attention needs to be paid to control and reduce the microplastics discharge from urban drainage systems to

14852,ecological restoration of wetland plants has emerged as an environmentally friendly and less carbon footprint method for treating secondary effluent wastewater root iron plaque ip is located at the important ecological niches in constructed wetlands cws ecosystem and is the critical micro zone for pollutants migration and transformation root ip can affect the chemical behaviors and bioavailability of key elements c n p since its formation dissolution is a dynamic equilibrium process jointly influenced by rhizosphere habitats however as an efficient approach to further explore the mechanism of pollutant removal in cws the dynamic formation of root ip and its function have not been fully studied especially in substrate enhanced cws this article concentrates on the biogeochemical processes between fe cycling involved in root ip with carbon turnover nitrogen transformation and phosphorus availability in cws rhizosphere as ip has the potential to enhance pollutant removal by being regulated and managed we summarized the critical factors affecting the ip formation from the perspective of wetland design and operation as well as emphasizing the heterogeneity of rhizosphere redox and the role of key microbes in nutrient cycling subsequently interactions between redox controlled root ip and biogeochemical elements c n p are emphatically discussed additionally the effects of ip on emerging contaminants and heavy metals in cws rhizosphere are assessed finally major challenges and outlooks for future research in regards to root ip are proposed it is expected that this review can provide a new perspective for the efficient removal of target pollutants in cws graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fe redox cycling contaminant removal n

introduction wetland is a transitional zone between terrestrial ecosystem and aquatic ecosystem playing vital roles in nutrients cycling improving water quality and wastewater remediation khan et al 2016 as a sophisticated technology involving physical chemical and biological processes of plants substrates and microorganisms constructed wetlands cws is a water purification system with sustainable environmental benefits low cost and less carbon footprint which has rapidly developed in recent years gu et al 2021 wetland plants have a better adaptation to anoxic habitats due to their developed aerenchyma for the transportation of oxygen to roots in the rhizosphere yamauchi et al 2018 this facilitates microbial growth and attachment around roots that in turn promotes the treatment of nutrients and immobilization of pollutants such as total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp emerging contaminants ecs and heavy metals hms etc how to improve the adsorption capacity and purification efficiency of wetland plants for pollutants has recently become a hot topic in the wetland science field rhizosphere is an important micro environment of cws lloyd et al 2004 zhang et al 2022 reddish brown iron plaque ip widely existed on hydrophyte rhizosphere and has been found on the root surfaces of aquatic plants such as typha latifolia xiao et al 2021 iris pseudacorus ma et al 2020a acorus calamus ma et al 2020b phragmites australis zhang et al 2021b oryza sativa lee et al 2012 aster tripolium otte et al 1989 canna indica xu et al 2009 spartina alterniflora zhang et al 2021b in freshwater cws samantha et al 2022 farmlands mangrove wetlands pi et al 2011 and coastal wetlands luo et al 2018 the formation of ip in rhizosphere is thought to be the result of the migration of fe ii from soil interstitial water to plant root surface and then precipitated which involves root oxidation of plants and the biological oxidation of rhizosphere microorganisms yang et al 2014a ip formed on the root surface can reach 10 of the total root weight in the cws when treating different types of wastewaters taylor et al 1984a the reed roots with and without ip attached were photographed by zhu et al 2018 and the former had reddish surface coatings maisch et al 2019 showed the ip formed dense fe hydr oxide plaque on young roots while less ip on basal roots møller and sand jensen 2008 displayed the ip fully covered and partially covered the root tip of a lobelia dortmanna reddish ip in the rhizosphere from sparganium americanum recovered from microcosms was observed by chang et al 2014 moreover various wetland plants can form root ip under artificial induction wan et al 2020 with the wide application of substrate enhanced cws in recent years especially iron based cws adding iron minerals iron scraps modified iron rich activated carbon or other functional materials the introduction of available fe ii can influence the root ip formation however the literature about the impacts and functions of ip on nutrient removal in substrate enhanced cws was not sufficient especially for the treatment of domestic sewage and aquaculture wastewater rich in organic matter ip deposits is a mixed phase of amorphous or crystalline fe hydr oxide on hydrophyte roots surface which is mainly composed of goethite α feooh lepidocrocite γ feooh and a small amount of siderite feco3 tripathi et al 2014 due to its large surface area and carrying charge clusters ip can influence the chemical behavior and bioavailability of nutrients and metals in cws through adsorption complexation co precipitation as well as desorption dissolution and other reactions khan et al al 2016 jacob and otte 2003 the phase and reactivity of fe in ip play an essential role in the migration of major biogeochemical elements a steep redox gradient in rhizosphere provides suitable sites for key processes related to n conversion and further influences the greenhouse gasses emission such as n2o and ch4 wang et al 2016 dynamic ip and its c capture or loss in rhizosphere are largely influenced by fe redox equilibrium yu et al 2021b substrate interception and plants uptake are considered the primary ways for p removal in cws while ip located between substrates and plants has a strong affinity for p and the mobility of p and metal elements is associate with the precipitation and dissolution of ip glodowska et al 2020 the redox potential of fe in different valence states is between those of oxidized and reduced c n o and s which have disproportionate effects on these major biogeochemical elements cycling kappler and bryce 2017 however few articles have comprehensively reviewed the interactions between fe turnover and major element cycle in root ip so as the specific functions of ip in pollutant removal in cws ecosystems root ip has the potential to improve pollutant removal by being regulated and managed while the dynamic formation and dissolution of ip in cws are affected by available fe tai et al 2018 redox habitats zhang et al 2012 root exudates res dong et al 2022 salt stress pedersen et al 2021 microbial metabolism emerson et al 1999 and so on the comprehensiveness of this dynamic process influenced by various environmental factors and operational conditions in cws is still limited by the knowledge gap even though the pollutants removal capacity of ip has been observed in some cws the specific efficacy of root ip on cn p pollutants in cws has not been fully understood due to insufficient and contradictory published literature therefore we reviewed the previous research on the exploration of ip s function and highlighted the indispensable role of ip in the retention and translocation of pollutants in cws as well including i the critical influencing factors for dynamic ip formation dissolution ii the iron cycling processes involved in root ip and its potential function on critical elements n c p emerging contaminants and heavy metals transformation and migration iii the major challenges and outlooks for future research in regards to root ip in cws ecosystem attempt is made to further reveal the role of ip on the migration and transformation of pollutants in the key ecological niches of cws rhizosphere interface to help make informed decisions for future study 2 critical factors influencing iron plaque formation in cws system strong aerenchyma of aquatic plants can deliver 30 40 atmospheric oxygen to the roots establishing steep redox gradients in rhizosphere and further extending the oxic anoxic interface in the cws ecosystems oxygen loss from the roots and soluble fe ii diffusing from the reduced sediments react to form brownish orangish precipitates on root surface known as iron plaque ip xiao et al 2021 the reaction can be expressed as 1 4fe2 o2 10h2o 4fe oh 3 8h generally ip began to form at 1 cm away from the root tips batty et al 2002 more ip formed in the elongation zone root hair area and near the root base of the plant roots and oppositely less formed on the young root tip and the new root hair hydrophytes with higher root porosities and roc had a higher amount of ip deposition and reddish brown ip can also be found on the soil surface around the rhizosphere of plants yang et al 2014a the formation of root ip on wetlands plants is species specific and regulated by many environmental factors and operational conditions which will be elaborated on in the following paragraphs 2 1 basic component sufficient available fe ii the high solubility of fe ii makes it more bioavailable in aquatic environments fe ii migrates into hydrophytes rhizosphere from surrounding sediments of wetlands due to the concentration gradient and the active fe ii pools are considered to be a major component source for ip formation tai et al 2018 the solubility of iron in sediments is affected by cation exchange capacity which affects the ip accumulation on plant roots barber 1984 fe and mn coexist in plaque deposits through adsorption and co precipitation while the amount of mn plaque is usually less than that of fe plaque jia et al 2018 ip content of typha latifolia showed a non linear increase trend with the increasing concentration of fe ii and then reached stability taylor et al 1984b the content of root ip is proportional to the concentration of fe ii in a certain range such as juncus effusus oryza sativa h li et al 2016 and canna indica tai et al 2018 fu et al 2011 found that fecl2 can increase the antioxidant enzyme activity in roots and the amount of ip on root surface in addition fe ii can stimulate the rhizosphere microbial activities which plays a significant role in stimulating fe redox transformation and influencing the ip formation dai et al 2020 ecological floating bed with iron scraps and plant biomass addition as electron donors developed ip on the plant roots peng et al 2023 for iron based enhanced cws the introduction of sufficient available fe ii promotes the ip formation therefore the remobilization and introduction of available ii from sediment or iron rich functional materials will promote the formation and dissolution of root ip 2 2 redox habitat and ph in cws rhizosphere redox habitat varies spatially and temporally due to the heterogeneity of oxygen distribution which is related to the waterlogging conditions water management type of cws and ph yamaguchi et al 2014 redox potential eh is a critical variable affecting the fe redox fluctuation during ip formation zhang et al 2012 waterlogging condition reduced the eh of wetland sediments and increased the fe ii mobility high contents of available fe ii and mn ii diffusing into the rhizosphere and precipitated by rol christensen et al al 1998a the operation mode of wetlands can affect the redox condition of the rhizosphere such as the continuous flow or tidal flow alternation moderate alternate drying and submergence in rhizosphere induce the ip formation by enhancing the accumulation of endogenous h2o2 and root activity fu et al 2017 in the vertical flow cws vfcws most fe ii get rapidly oxidized due to the oxidation environment and then filtered through the substrates which leads to insufficient available fe ii and poor ip formation ip may be observed in the horizontal subsurface flow cws hsfcws with necessary anaerobic zones and rol creating a favorable condition for the ip formation wu et al 2019 in the cws designed with artificial aeration the amount of root ip can be affected by adjusting the do content in the substrate different types of cws will affect the redox habitat in the substrate layer which affect the turnover of iron in the sediment or substrate thereby influencing the contact between roots and available fe ii rhizosphere ph is a comprehensive response of the rate of rol rhizosphere oxygen consumption root proton loss electron donor availability and the soil acid neutralization capacity it can influence the deposition status of ip directly by regulating the contents of available fe ii and dissolving ip on root surface or indirectly by affecting the roc mendelssohn et al 1995 higher fe ii mobility can be obtained in a prevailing acidic condition with relatively low ph and reductants such as phenolic compounds secreted from roots can promote the fe iii reduction in the surrounding rhizosphere mendelssohn et al 1995 while the decreased fe ii solubility is obtained at relatively high ph due to the fe ii oxidation taylor et al 1984a zhang et al 2012 to sum up the regulation of water conditions wetland types and ph can affect the redox environment in the rhizosphere thereby influencing the root ip formation 2 3 root characteristics of wetland plants 2 3 1 radial oxygen loss radial oxygen loss rol is one of the most important steps in promoting the ip formation and oxidized root channels which is the result of natural selection in wetland plants to cope with the long term anoxic aquatic conditions yang et al 2014a ip serves as a diffusive barrier to conduct a large proportion of o2 flux towards the root meristems thus reducing oxygen loss from the roots møller and sand jensen 2008 maintaining an oxygenated rhizosphere facilitates the degradation of pollutants and the oxidation of reducing substances such as organic acids fe2 nh4 n mn2 hs and s2 armstrong 1971 and enhances the tolerance of aquatic plants to heavy metals metalloids i e arsenic and emerging contaminants mei et al 2009 root oxidizing capacity is a key to the conversion of fe hydr oxide from amorphous to crystalline state and prevents ip against being reduced which will further immobilize pollutants and reduce their permeability yang et al 2018a rol not only promotes the abiotic fe ii oxidation but also provides electron acceptors for microaerophilic fe oxidizing bacteria both of which contribute to the ip formation aquatic plants with higher root porosity and rol have large amounts of ip deposition yang et al 2014b 2 3 2 root enzymatic oxidation activity root oxidizing capacity roc includes rol and enzymatic oxidation activity on the root surface yamada et al 2005 enzyme mediated promotion of reactive oxygen species ros plays a critical role in fe ii oxidation yang et al 2014b ros are intermediates of molecular oxygen reduction or oxidative burst products in response to environmental stresses including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 superoxide anion o 2 and hydroxyl radical ho etc srivastava and dubey 2011 large amounts of h2o2 accumulate in plant roots under salinity stress which can significantly reduce root porosity and rol thus further influencing the ip formation di bella et al 2014 pedersen et al 2021 as iii stress will cause an oxidative burst in plant roots exuding large amounts of ros to oxidize the available fe ii lee et al 2013 the induction of rhizosphere environment is closely related to the expression of root enzymatic oxidation genes catalase secreted by roots can promote the oxidation and crystallization of fe ii in rhizosphere liu et al 2006 fu et al 2013 proved the role of h2o2 in the root ip formation by titration test with a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide fenton reaction between fe ii and h2o2 may be an important step in ip formation by analyzing the function of antioxidant enzymes in scavenging ros yu et al 2021a however it s still not clear which type of ros plays a decisive role in the ip formation nor the ros concentration affects the composition of ip which all need to be further studied 2 3 3 root exudates root exudates res are the general term for enormous organic compounds exuded from plant roots which can be divided into low molecular weight compounds low mr and high molecular weight substances high mr low mr compounds involve amino acids organic acids phenolics and sugars and high mr exudates include polysaccharides proteins and enzymes which are all believed to serve as carbon and nitrogen sources for microbial growth meng et al 2022 organic acids will influence the existing form and solubility of root ip zhang et al 2019 oxalic acid and citric acid can significantly accelerate the fe iii dissolution via the complexation of hydroxyl groups with fe leading to the migration of fe oxides chen et al 2016 the root surface is more susceptible to the direct influence of res which can accumulate a vast array of organics and attract more microorganisms to colonize landi et al 2006 res can serve as electron donors to promote the growth of ferb joner and leyval 2003 rhizosphere effect involves res bais et al 2006 which can affect the important rhizosphere ecological processes such as denitrification li et al 2021 anammox y li et al 2016 organics decomposition dong et al 2022 discovered that res inhibited the activity of geobacteria and anaeromyxobacter that influence the ip formation through van der waals forces furthermore metal ions mobility bioavailability and transformation are all closely linked to the release of res particularly in the rhizosphere zhao et al 2021 to sum up different types of wetland plants feature different root properties such as the ability of root oxygen secretion proton secretion root enzyme oxidation sensitivity to iron etc which will affect the root ip formation therefore it s important to choose the right aquatic plants for different treatment water quality snowden et al 1995 hupfer and dollan 2003 2 4 microbes involved in iron plaque formation rol together with other environmental factors provides favorable conditions for microbial growth and proliferation diverse microbial communities are involved in the ip formation and representative microbes include but are not limited to fe oxidizing bacteria feob fe reducing bacteria ferb and mn oxidizing bacteria mnob emerson et al 1999 feob was found in 92 of wetland plant roots surveyed in 13 biogeochemical aquatic ecosystems weiss et al 2003 fe ii oxidation under neutral ph condition is mediated by neutrophilic feob at the oxic anoxic interface or in anoxic habitats including microaerophilic feob anaerobic phototrophic feob and anaerobic nitrate reducing feob widdel et al 1993 straub et al 1996 feob belongs to freshwater betaproteobacteria and known genera include gallionella kucera et al 1957 sideroxydans weiss et al 2007 and ferriphaselus emerson et al 2010 inhabiting niches where o2 concentration is well below air saturation maisch et al 2019 feob can dramatically alter the kinetics of fe ii oxidation and oxygen consumption at the anoxic interface around the roots mainly by forming unique micro niches due to oxygen heterogeneity chan et al 2016 under the condition of high fe ii availability high density of lithotrophic feob can promote the ip formation on juncus effusus roots and increase the short term rates of fe ii oxidation by 1 3 1 7 times neubauer et al 2007 feob inoculation increased the ip formation on phragmites australis roots guo and cutright 2015 wei et al 2021 highlighted the contribution of feob burkholderia sp d416 and mnob pseudomonas sp in promoting and regulating the cd uptake through root ip formation ferb is widely distributed in anoxic and anaerobic habitats such as lakes sediments and rhizosphere king and garey 1999 notable identified ferb include shewanella spp myers et al 1990 geobacter spp lovley et al 1988 albidoferax ferrireducens lovley et al 1996 geothrix fermentans coates et al 1999 acidiphilium spp fabisch et al 2013 and hyperthermophilic archaea tor et al 2001 geobacteria spp mainly in contact with extracellular electron acceptors and other organisms electrically mohapatra et al 2021 geobacter spp and shewanella spp can perform nitrate dependent fe iii reduction by reducing nitrates to ammonia gao et al 2019 dissimilatory fe iii reduction is an enzymatic reaction driven by ferb which is a coupling process of fe iii reduction and organics decomposition in anaerobic habitats in wetlands rhizosphere lovley 1991 ferb strain shewanella oneidensis mr 1 can use h2 formate or lactate as electron donors for the dissimilatory fe iii reduction 2 4feooh ch3chohcoo 7h 4fe2 ch3coo hco 3 6h2o a high abundance of poorly crystallized fe iii oxides hydroxides and labile organic components on ip can serve as an energy source for ferb sowers et al 2019 acetate ethanol propionate and butyrate were all used as carbon sources for ferb enrichment such as geobacter spp conrad and klose 1999 conversely much of the poorly crystallized fe iii minerals in sediments are not readily reduced by ferb phillips et al 1993 3 ch3coo 24feooh 8fe3o4 2hco 3 12h2o h the rate of rol is not uniform in a different part of the root system and the same spot on the plaque may change from microaerobic to anaerobic state with a corresponding switch from feob to ferb leading to a transient break between microbial fe oxidation and reduction neubauer et al 2008 however the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cws substrate facilitates the multiple ecological niches formation therefore more studies are required to quantify the fe cycling mediated by rhizosphere microbes and the synergistic effects of root ip and microbes and its effect on nutrient turnover are worthy of attention 2 5 nutrient composition in wastewater 2 5 1 labile om abundance labile om plays a significant role in the sorption and mobility of fe ii perret et al 2000 om decomposition creates an anoxic condition in rhizosphere and releases various organic ligands contributing electrons and protons to the acid and reducing the dissolution of ip accumulating research has demonstrated that fe mediated om protection may reduce the availability of fe and thereby affecting the ip formation chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 the presence of inorganic carbonate promoted the fe immobilization in the wetland rhizosphere batty et al 2000 while macfie and crowder 1987 believed that the formation of ip was negatively correlated with the percent inorganic carbonate fe associated om coprecipitated at the anoxic aerobic interface where microorganisms take fe iii as electron acceptor and produces co2 via om decomposition coupled with fe reduction under anoxic period chen et al 2020 and large amounts of fe ii can be released from fe iii om precipitates and micro aggregates pan et al 2016 huang et al 2017 syu et al 2014 demonstrated that fe ii reservoir in sediments was not sufficient for ip formation under flooded conditions while fe combined with high om concentrations significantly promoted the release of fe ii making it easier to migrate and promote the ip formation 2 5 2 impact of inorganic s waterlogged conditions in cws will affect the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur s and its relationship with ip formation khan et al 2016 inorganic s and its form play critical roles in the ip formation and inhibition of uptake and bioavailability of toxic metals zandi et al 2020 elemental sulfur s0 could induce the formation of root ip and mineral particles in rhizosphere and the plaque content increased with the increasing s addition fan et al 2010 however excessive application of sulfate so4 2 decreased the root ip and sharply affect its barrier function zandi et al 2020 this can be interpreted as the reduction of so4 2 to sulfide s2 by sulfate reducing bacteria srb under reducing conditions s2 with strong reducibility reduces the fe iii leads to an increase of fe ii in rhizosphere and get oxidized by rol yang et al 2016 excess s2 oxidization in rhizosphere might deplete more oxygen and its toxicity might affect the roc and eventually diminish the root ip fan et al 2010 moreover s2 can directly facilitate the reduction and decomposition of ip excessive sulfide in hsfcws can directly precipitate fe ii as fes or pyrite fes2 minerals to decrease the available fe ii required for ip formation armstrong and armstrong 2005 zandi et al 2020 notably rol can oxidize fes occasionally and liberate fe ii thus further promoting massive root ip deposition trolldenier 1988 khan et al 2016 overall the influence of s on ip formation depends not only on the substrate property microbial activity but also on and the transformation uptake release of these elements by rhizosphere effect fig 1 displays the conceptual model showing s cycling and ip formation in cws rhizosphere 2 5 3 impact of p availability phosphorus p is one of the most basic nutrients essential for plant yield and growth malhotra et al 2018 currently various studies have been reported on the effect of p availability on ip formation in wetlands hupfer and dollan 2003 found that ip formed on hydrophyte roots was associated with p retention p availability hindered the reduction and transformation of ferrihydrite thereby reducing the effectiveness of fe however yang et al 2018b demonstrated that the available p can regulate the community composition and activity of microorganisms thus facilitating the ip formation dai et al 2017 several studies found that p deficiency can induce the reddish brown ip rip formation fu et al 2014b p deficiency can enhance the roc of hydrophytes which will trigger the production of ros and the release of oxides such as h2o2 leading to more ip deposition chen et al 2008 fu et al 2014a speculated that the ip formation was related to the concentration ratio of p fe2 in the rhizosphere recent studies found that p sufficiency was beneficial for the non reddish brown nip formation and prevented the rip formation by available fe ii reacting with p to form white precipitates fu et al 2016 overall more studies are needed to determine the actual role and contribution of p in the ip formation 3 function of iron plaque in contaminants removal 3 1 fate of nutrients affected by iron plaque the rhizosphere of wetland plants is a unique habitat featured by redox heterogeneity on account of the rol and artificial water management which differentiates various functional microbial niches in the micro zones and motivates the biogeochemical cycling of key elements especially c n p and fe kögel knabner et al 2010 the interactions between the ip formation disintegration and n transformation c turnover and p availability are of great significance for rhizosphere pollutant removal in cws 3 1 1 interactions of iron plaque with carbon turnover the wetland rhizosphere boasts a large dynamic organic carbon c pool which provides an abundant c source for microbes and serves as a biogeochemical hotspot for various fe hydr oxides the cycling of fe hydr oxide is interactively coupled with c which in turn strongly influences the dynamics and scale of c turnover in wetland ecosystems yu et al 2021a rhizosphere ip is a hotspot for fe redox cycling due to the poorly crystallized fe that can be utilized by microorganisms yao et al 2022 in addition to the protection transportation and stabilization of c root ip plays a variety of roles in wetland ecosystems some of which can drive c loss in rhizosphere coward et al 2018 sowers et al 2019 on the one hand fe hydr oxide can mediate c retention by serving as sorbent and connective cement to bind organic c forming complexes and aggregates in rhizosphere duan et al 2020 wei et al 2022 argued that ip formed on root surface acted as a rusty sink with a large surface area to accumulate and stabilize organic c and the difference in crystallinity and mineralogy of ip determine its capacity to absorb and bind organic c on the other hand amorphous fe hydr oxide can serve as an electron transfer role whereby fe iii can receive electrons from microorganisms or electron shuttles for microbial respiration and promotes the om decomposition melton et al 2014 moreover considerable fe iii minerals in rhizosphere were electron acceptors for ferb which can promote the destruction of ip and organic c release weiss et al 2005 luo et al 2018 in addition fe ii donates electrons to various oxidants such as o2 or h2o2 especially the re oxidation of labile fe ii accumulated on ip during anoxic period to generate abundant ros which can depolymerize complex biopolymers into unstable monomers via fenton or fenton like reactions chen et al 2020 or indirectly contribute to the decomposition of organic c in rhizosphere by promoting the phenol oxidase activity van bodegom et al 2005 yao et al 2022 demonstrated that ip enhanced the oxidation of microbial available organic c via fe iii reduction coupled microbial respiration and enriched the microorganisms involved in fe redox cycling e g bacillus and geobacter and their functional genes on both root surface and rhizosphere liu et al 2021 showed that the salinity elevated the ip abundance at oligohaline treatment while suppressing it at the mesohaline treatment in tidal freshwater wetlands and the abundance of ip can be considered as an indicator of c decomposition rates in response to salinity and flooding res and microbial derived organic c can affect the organic mineral complexes and repeated formation and dissolution of ip jeewani et al 2020 the aerobic anaerobic alternating environment is expected to significantly increase the net reduction rate of ip and associated anaerobic organic c mineralization huang and hall 2017 chen et al 2020 and may promote the recrystallization of amorphous fe hydr oxide thompson et al 2006 as crystalline fe hydr oxide such as goethite and hematite are less susceptible to dissimilatory reduction the associated organic c bound to it is less likely to decompose and will be protected for a relatively long time roberts 2015 in summary root ip in wetlands plays a complex but important role in om decomposition and storage which is closely related to the hydrological cycle and microbial activities 3 1 2 interactions of iron plaque with nitrogen transformation steep oxygen concentration gradients and ip were formed under a dynamic rhizosphere environment and many key processes pertaining to n transformation in wetlands occur in rhizosphere micro zones arth and frenzel 2000 plant uptake and nitrification mainly occur in the rhizosphere aerobic zone ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrifying bacteria can convert ammonia nh4 into nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 by using rol brix et al 2002 samantha et al 2022 displayed that the no3 concentration in the rhizosphere exhibited reproducible significant trends as a function of distance from roots and varied inversely with o2 and profiles in the root zone via planar optode imaging as nh4 and nox diffuse away from the oxic zone to the more oxygen depleted zone nox removal is observed via denitrification nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation or anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox wu et al 2019 res can serve as the carbon source for denitrification or dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra moreover fe iii reduction coupled with anammox termed feammox which can produce n2 no2 or no3 has been identified in many ecosystems including cws li et al 2015 peng et al 2021 shuai and jaffe 2019 found that the bioaugmentation of acidimicrobiaceae sp a6 in fe rich substrates cw had higher nh4 removal due to the process of feammox which is essential for n conversion in submerged soils and rhizosphere sediments the conceptual diagram illustrating the root ip and n cycling in cws rhizosphere is shown in fig 2 microorganisms involved in n cycling occupy different ecological niches in the rhizosphere redox gradient ip provides a satisfied site for microbial attachment which greatly enrich the microbial community structure and density hu et al al 2017 a higher abundance of nitrifying bacteria was detected in ip of iron rich substrate limonite cws indicating that ip promoted the growth and reproduction of nitrifying bacteria in rhizosphere wan et al 2020 sun et al 2019 found that rol stimulated the growth of facultative anaerobic denitrifiers mainly by pseudomonas aeromonas and acinetobacter in rhizoplane thereby promoting the denitrification process most nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria attached to ip belong to proteobacteria which play a critical role in nitrogen removal li et al 2008 nitrospirillum was enhanced on ip which was related to the higher nitrification efficiency chung et al 2015 genera of bradyrhizobium attached on ip have been reported to serve as aerobic denitrifiers gabarro et al 2013 ferb such as geobacteraceae spp and shewanella spp was able to affect the ip dissolution and feammox rate in rhizosphere anaerobic habitats li et al 2015 in addition the genera of azospira and sphingobacteriales were found on ip which was capable of nitrogen fixation iturralde et al 2020 mei et al 2014 showed that the ip rose the oxygen concentration around the roots by changing the root characteristics and then improved the removal efficiencies of tn and cod in the treatment of domestic sewage with acorus calamus arundo donax cyperus flabelliformis canna indica iris tectorum and scirpus validus moreover the removal efficiency of tn by plants covered with ip was significantly higher than those without and ip enhanced the tn concentration in both above ground and belowground plant tissues mei et al 2014 3 1 3 interactions of iron plaque with phosphorus availability biogeochemical cycles of p and fe in cws are tightly interlinked due to the dynamic change of ph eh and other environmental parameters in rhizosphere the mobility of fe and p and the impact of ip on p accumulation and bioavailability show different effects since fe iii hydr oxides have a strong affinity for p the fixation of p by ip reduces its nutrient availability resulting in less available p to hydrophytes zhang et al 2012 crowder et al 1991 christensen et al 1998b suggested that ip on littorella unifora and isoetes lacustris roots limited the p uptake and biomass production due to p adsorption by oxidized fe and mn in plaque wan et al 2020 found that root ip on cattails enhanced the tp removal in aquatic environments in some cases ip functions as a temporary p hub in rhizosphere which may facilitate p diffusion into root system and promote p translocation to the above ground jia et al 2018 xu et al 2009 the sequestration amount of p in ip and aboveground shoots increased with the soluble p contents in the growing media wang et al 2010 p content in ip was affected by the competition between substrate adsorption in cws and the transfer of p from ip into plant biomass cao et al 2013 moreover some views believed that the absorption and utilization of p depend on the content of ip when ip was present as a thick cover on the root system its physical blocking and immobilization of p were significantly enhanced thus the uptake of p by wetland plants was dependent on the optimum amendment of fe and varied by plant species xu et al al 2009 wang et al 2010 however batty et al 2002 found that ip can sequester p but its role for p uptake by hydrophytes was ineffective which could still satisfy the plant growth p immobilized in vfcws rhizosphere is relatively stable under oxic conditions due to its combination with amorphous fe oxides while it s released when fe iii minerals reduced by ferb occur in water saturated vertical cws or hsfcws with anoxic environments far away from the rhizosphere khan et al 2016 the fixation of p by ip makes up for the release of p in the anaerobic niches and the dynamic ip formation ensures that the dissolved fe ii can continue to play the role of p fixation in cws in addition the temporary p hub would gradually collapse and the fixed p would be released after hydrophytes decay which increases the risk of eutrophication the fixation of p by ip may be permanent in hydrophytes with an evergreen survival strategy christensen 1997 in conclusion the role of root ip in the removal of p by aquatic plants seems to be controversial with different functions of a hub a barrier or be ineffective in addition the regulatory mechanism of rhizosphere microorganisms on p turnover is still unclear based on the above summary in rhizosphere micro niches root ip showed different roles in the transformation and absorption of pollutants in cws it can serve as a good reservoir for retaining nutrients which plays a significant role in nitrification and denitrification it can also act as a barrier against the uptake of nutrients then low ip produced wetland plants may be preferred for the remediation of contaminants in cws the actual role of ip in nutrient immobilization and removal remains to be further explained therefore establishing conditions for optimum ip formation according to the characteristics of influents quality and pollutants removal targets will be helpful in regulating pollutant removal in cws fig 3 illustrates the schematic overview of the interactions between root ip and c n and p cycles in cws rhizosphere 3 2 emerging contaminants emerging contaminants ecs are becoming more prevalent in cws ecosystems and we summarized the recent studies on the interactions of ip with pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps persistent organic pollutants pops and microplastics mps in rhizosphere of cws plants in table 1 representative substances of ppcps are water borne antibiotics and sterol hormones pi et al 2011 part of ppcps can be deposited on root ip under waterlogged conditions and ip with high adsorption sites and functional groups can accelerate the elimination of ppcps wei et al 2019 hu et al 2021 however the inhibitory effect of antibiotics on ip formation was found in bao et al 2018 study pahs and pbdes are two common pops in industrial discharges and ecosystems luo et al 2020 ip can contribute to the immobilization of pahs and pbdes and act as a physical barrier to prevent contaminants into plants pi et al 2016 the reductive dechlorination of lindane coupled with fe reduction promoted the ip formation in rhizosphere thereby blocking the external toxic lindane feng et al 2019 psmp and ptfe interacted with res through van der waals forces inhibited the root activity and reduced the ip formation dong et al 2022 while the coexist of as iii modulates the fe related response genes and increases ip thickness by causing p deficiency dong et al 2021 based on the above research root ip can act as the adsorption sites for pollutants immobilization but it will also be stimulated by pollutants and decompose till fail current research on the removal mechanism of root ip and ecs is still a brand new topic and few qualitative and quantitative information is available in cws for example the combined roles of root ip in the bioaccumulation and degradation of ecs and the effects of ip on ecs metabolism in aquatic plants have not been explored moreover multi factorial studies are needed to reveal the mechanism of co exposure of ecs salinity toxic metal loid s and other stresses on the ip formation in cws 3 3 heavy metals due to its high specific surface area and hydroxyl oh functional groups ip can co precipitate with heavy metals and provide reaction substrates for the translocation and sequestration of various metal loids kerl et al 2019 khan et al 2016 zandi et al 2021 found that the oryza sativa l covered with ip significantly reduced the uptake accumulation and mobilization of toxic metal loids such as cd cr as and sb in paddy soil shen et al 2021 investigated the combined heavy metal stress on root ip formation of k obovata and the results showed that it enhanced the ip formation and heavy metals deposition with different sensitivity to the type and concentration of pollutants aquatic plants can either act as accumulators to accumulate pollutants or as excluders that restrict the entry khan et al 2016 the disparity in the pattern of metal loids uptake by ip is strongly attributed to the root characteristics of specific plants the amount and the type of ip and the availability of metal ions in aquatic media controversial results revealed more about the barrier reservoir or ineffectual function of ip for toxic metal loids substances under environmental stresses rather than the relatively clear relationship between the rhizosphere ip and contaminants removal tripathi et al 2014 khan et al 2016 in addition hydroponic research or experiments with fewer factors may lead to certain limitations in understanding the relationship between rhizosphere ip and toxic metal loids removal in cws in natural environments root ip will lose its supporting substrates upon the death and decomposition of hydrophytes and more attention should be paid to the fate of ip and metal loid s attached onto it in cws ecosystem 4 challenges and outlooks for future research ip exists in the key ecological niche at the interface between wetland sediments and hydrophytes rhizosphere and affects the migration and transformation of pollutants due to the complexity of wastewater composition and rhizosphere redox gradient in cws our knowledge of this dynamic equilibrium process influenced by various environmental factors is still limited in general few studies have been carried out from the quantitative perspectives such as the model construction based on the pollutant removal of ip in cws rhizosphere therefore we propose some key areas for future research 4 1 exploring the optimal design and working conditions of cws for appropriate ip formation the cws ecosystem is affected by many factors such as its structural design operating parameters plant species substrate selection etc which are closely related to the formation of rhizosphere ip and the removal of pollutants vfcws have the excellent aerobic conditions due to the large amounts of wastewater flowing vertically through the planted zones while rol has a negligible effect on redox potential hsfcws system creates both aerobic and anoxic zones which are conducive to the ip formation redox state in hsfcws rhizosphere varies with numerous factors such as wetland depth and length plant oxygen release and substrate cws has evolved from its original category and many new technologies have been derived such as ecological floating beds research showed that ip was formed on the roots of aquatic plants when the ecological floating bed was used to treat micro polluted wastewater peng et al 2023 studies showed that drying submergence alternation can improve the root activity and resistance to environmental stresses and promote large amounts of reddish brown root ip fu et al 2017 however current efforts mostly focused on paddy fields and more works need to be carried out on the dynamic changes of ip in different cws taking examples of evaluating the impacts of hydraulic design on the thickness and distribution of ip at the roots water interface and how to optimize and coordinate the relationship between drying submergence alternation and influencing factors do carbon source microorganisms etc and pollutant removal in cws therefore manipulating redox potentials by altering the design and operation of cws may be the most available approach to promote dynamic ip formation in the rhizosphere cws can not only be designed with a wide range of redox conditions to facilitate multiple pollutants removal but also with limited redox conditions for specific pollutants removal by adjusting the influent organic loads hrt operation pattern and aeration condition in substrates future studies should focus more on oxygen distribution and nutrient availability in rhizosphere so as to improve the nutrition center role of ip and strengthen its sequestration and immobilization of targeted pollutants aquatic plant species are one of the essential factors affecting the ip formation rol and root ip are valuable parameters for selecting suitable plant species for cws and the potential ranking of plant roc and whether some plants can create better oxidation environments in root micro niche in winter are not yet known moreover rol also depends on the redox state of the wetland substrates wiessner et al 2002 reasonable substrates selection and composition can enable the harmonious co existence of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions in cws rhizosphere which will enhance the ip performance and contaminants removal and provide possible carbon source for denitrification for low c n ratio influent as substrates widely used in wetlands biochar or novel fe modified biochar can induce or inhibit the root ip formation and might affect the adsorption and subsequent removal of p and heavy metals limited studies are listed in table 2 however studies related to the effect of substrates on root ip focused more on paddy fields and few studies on cws overall based on the above aspects the research on the root ip will help to further optimize the design of cws ecosystem for immobilization and pollutants removal and provide theoretical support for improving the water purification efficiency of the root ip in cws 4 2 developing bioaugmentation strategy of ip in rhizosphere ecological remediation rhizosphere redox habitat significantly induced the enrichment of functional microorganisms and their different responses therefore a novel strategy of synthetic microbial communities syncoms can be designed and applied to stimulate the functional microbes in situ and reinforce the rhizosphere effects for bioremediation in cws thus clearly elucidating the complex interaction of rhizosphere microorganisms vorholt et al 2017 bhatia and goyal 2014 in addition inoculants with improved remediation potential can be added based on their inherent properties to improve the remediation capacity of cws adding plant litters to enrich feob the mnob for intensifying the biogenic ip plaque in rhizosphere which can further promote the fe mn plaque formation gu et al 2022 found that plant biomass can accelerate fe oxidation by enriching the microbial community biogenic ip on roots provides an ecological habitat for the removal of nitrate phosphate persistent organics pollutants and emerging contaminants in cws which strengthens the shortfalls of existing cws in addition the effect of root ip on the transformation of coexisting pollutants such as the removal mechanisms of refractory organic matter and nitrogen in the rhizosphere can be considered moreover the modification of substrate materials for functional microorganism enrichment and selection can be explored in future studies 4 3 exploring the relationship between root ip and ghg emission root ip not only affects the migration and bioavailability of rhizosphere elements but also greatly enriches the abundance and density of rhizosphere microbial community and promotes the n c s and p cycling biogenic gasses such as ch4 n2o and h2s generated from these processes are interconnected and interact with cws substrates and intermediates moreover the process of nitrification and denitrification in plants rhizosphere and its relationship with ip have important theoretical and practical significances for nitrogen loss and n2o emission liu et al 2019 demonstrated that ip is a hotspot for n2o emission and n loss in paddy soils mainly through fe ii oxidation coupled with denitrification however the impact of rhizosphere ip on ghg emissions n2o ch4 in cws and whether this effect will be exacerbated under climate change has not been well studied therefore future studies should focus on the relationship between rhizosphere ip and ghg emissions to provide more powerful evidence for estimating the ghg contribution of the entire wetland ecosystems 4 4 deepening in situ kinetics study of ip in cws detailed research on in situ kinetics of ip formation and dissolution in rhizosphere is still not available understanding the kinetics of fe redox in rhizosphere is a prerequisite for studying the cycling of key elements and the impact of fe redox on the electron accepting process studies have demonstrated that humic substances act as electron shuttles for fe iii dissimilation and reduction under anaerobic condition while direct evidence of kinetic mechanisms of electron transfer is lacking and there has been no definitive kinetics study of labile om abundance on ip dissolution moreover the kinetics between abiotic and biotic fe ii oxidation on ip formation need to be clarified and the kinetics of solute uptake and transport by ip with different thickness also needs to be further studied 5 conclusions rhizosphere is a dynamic transitional zone at the interface of aquatic plants water substrates in cws and ip is the product formed by various environmental factors in rhizosphere root ip may not only serve as fe oxide reservoir but also as the sink of pollutants more importantly ip can act as a redox gradient mediated biofilm in the rhizosphere that drives efficient nutrient transformation as root ip has the potential to increase pollutant removal by being regulated the main influencing factors for ip formation from the perspectives of wetland design and operation in cws was reviewed and evaluated the function of root ip on the migration and transformation of cn p pollutants emerging contaminants and heavy metals in cws more importantly root ip is crucial to the adaptability and resilience of the whole wetland ecosystem to future environmental disturbances so it is necessary to continue to explore and expand the research scope of root ip for instance exploring the optimal design and working conditions of cws suitable for the ip formation and creating the right conditions for the specific pollutant removal applying the bioaugmentation strategies to the ecological restoration of root ip to provide multiple barriers for the degradation of coexisting pollutants exploring the in situ kinetics of the ip formation and dissolution in cws rhizosphere considering the effects of root ip on ghg emissions in cws it provides strong evidence for estimating the ghg contributions of

14852,ecological restoration of wetland plants has emerged as an environmentally friendly and less carbon footprint method for treating secondary effluent wastewater root iron plaque ip is located at the important ecological niches in constructed wetlands cws ecosystem and is the critical micro zone for pollutants migration and transformation root ip can affect the chemical behaviors and bioavailability of key elements c n p since its formation dissolution is a dynamic equilibrium process jointly influenced by rhizosphere habitats however as an efficient approach to further explore the mechanism of pollutant removal in cws the dynamic formation of root ip and its function have not been fully studied especially in substrate enhanced cws this article concentrates on the biogeochemical processes between fe cycling involved in root ip with carbon turnover nitrogen transformation and phosphorus availability in cws rhizosphere as ip has the potential to enhance pollutant removal by being regulated and managed we summarized the critical factors affecting the ip formation from the perspective of wetland design and operation as well as emphasizing the heterogeneity of rhizosphere redox and the role of key microbes in nutrient cycling subsequently interactions between redox controlled root ip and biogeochemical elements c n p are emphatically discussed additionally the effects of ip on emerging contaminants and heavy metals in cws rhizosphere are assessed finally major challenges and outlooks for future research in regards to root ip are proposed it is expected that this review can provide a new perspective for the efficient removal of target pollutants in cws graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fe redox cycling contaminant removal n

introduction wetland is a transitional zone between terrestrial ecosystem and aquatic ecosystem playing vital roles in nutrients cycling improving water quality and wastewater remediation khan et al 2016 as a sophisticated technology involving physical chemical and biological processes of plants substrates and microorganisms constructed wetlands cws is a water purification system with sustainable environmental benefits low cost and less carbon footprint which has rapidly developed in recent years gu et al 2021 wetland plants have a better adaptation to anoxic habitats due to their developed aerenchyma for the transportation of oxygen to roots in the rhizosphere yamauchi et al 2018 this facilitates microbial growth and attachment around roots that in turn promotes the treatment of nutrients and immobilization of pollutants such as total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp emerging contaminants ecs and heavy metals hms etc how to improve the adsorption capacity and purification efficiency of wetland plants for pollutants has recently become a hot topic in the wetland science field rhizosphere is an important micro environment of cws lloyd et al 2004 zhang et al 2022 reddish brown iron plaque ip widely existed on hydrophyte rhizosphere and has been found on the root surfaces of aquatic plants such as typha latifolia xiao et al 2021 iris pseudacorus ma et al 2020a acorus calamus ma et al 2020b phragmites australis zhang et al 2021b oryza sativa lee et al 2012 aster tripolium otte et al 1989 canna indica xu et al 2009 spartina alterniflora zhang et al 2021b in freshwater cws samantha et al 2022 farmlands mangrove wetlands pi et al 2011 and coastal wetlands luo et al 2018 the formation of ip in rhizosphere is thought to be the result of the migration of fe ii from soil interstitial water to plant root surface and then precipitated which involves root oxidation of plants and the biological oxidation of rhizosphere microorganisms yang et al 2014a ip formed on the root surface can reach 10 of the total root weight in the cws when treating different types of wastewaters taylor et al 1984a the reed roots with and without ip attached were photographed by zhu et al 2018 and the former had reddish surface coatings maisch et al 2019 showed the ip formed dense fe hydr oxide plaque on young roots while less ip on basal roots møller and sand jensen 2008 displayed the ip fully covered and partially covered the root tip of a lobelia dortmanna reddish ip in the rhizosphere from sparganium americanum recovered from microcosms was observed by chang et al 2014 moreover various wetland plants can form root ip under artificial induction wan et al 2020 with the wide application of substrate enhanced cws in recent years especially iron based cws adding iron minerals iron scraps modified iron rich activated carbon or other functional materials the introduction of available fe ii can influence the root ip formation however the literature about the impacts and functions of ip on nutrient removal in substrate enhanced cws was not sufficient especially for the treatment of domestic sewage and aquaculture wastewater rich in organic matter ip deposits is a mixed phase of amorphous or crystalline fe hydr oxide on hydrophyte roots surface which is mainly composed of goethite α feooh lepidocrocite γ feooh and a small amount of siderite feco3 tripathi et al 2014 due to its large surface area and carrying charge clusters ip can influence the chemical behavior and bioavailability of nutrients and metals in cws through adsorption complexation co precipitation as well as desorption dissolution and other reactions khan et al al 2016 jacob and otte 2003 the phase and reactivity of fe in ip play an essential role in the migration of major biogeochemical elements a steep redox gradient in rhizosphere provides suitable sites for key processes related to n conversion and further influences the greenhouse gasses emission such as n2o and ch4 wang et al 2016 dynamic ip and its c capture or loss in rhizosphere are largely influenced by fe redox equilibrium yu et al 2021b substrate interception and plants uptake are considered the primary ways for p removal in cws while ip located between substrates and plants has a strong affinity for p and the mobility of p and metal elements is associate with the precipitation and dissolution of ip glodowska et al 2020 the redox potential of fe in different valence states is between those of oxidized and reduced c n o and s which have disproportionate effects on these major biogeochemical elements cycling kappler and bryce 2017 however few articles have comprehensively reviewed the interactions between fe turnover and major element cycle in root ip so as the specific functions of ip in pollutant removal in cws ecosystems root ip has the potential to improve pollutant removal by being regulated and managed while the dynamic formation and dissolution of ip in cws are affected by available fe tai et al 2018 redox habitats zhang et al 2012 root exudates res dong et al 2022 salt stress pedersen et al 2021 microbial metabolism emerson et al 1999 and so on the comprehensiveness of this dynamic process influenced by various environmental factors and operational conditions in cws is still limited by the knowledge gap even though the pollutants removal capacity of ip has been observed in some cws the specific efficacy of root ip on cn p pollutants in cws has not been fully understood due to insufficient and contradictory published literature therefore we reviewed the previous research on the exploration of ip s function and highlighted the indispensable role of ip in the retention and translocation of pollutants in cws as well including i the critical influencing factors for dynamic ip formation dissolution ii the iron cycling processes involved in root ip and its potential function on critical elements n c p emerging contaminants and heavy metals transformation and migration iii the major challenges and outlooks for future research in regards to root ip in cws ecosystem attempt is made to further reveal the role of ip on the migration and transformation of pollutants in the key ecological niches of cws rhizosphere interface to help make informed decisions for future study 2 critical factors influencing iron plaque formation in cws system strong aerenchyma of aquatic plants can deliver 30 40 atmospheric oxygen to the roots establishing steep redox gradients in rhizosphere and further extending the oxic anoxic interface in the cws ecosystems oxygen loss from the roots and soluble fe ii diffusing from the reduced sediments react to form brownish orangish precipitates on root surface known as iron plaque ip xiao et al 2021 the reaction can be expressed as 1 4fe2 o2 10h2o 4fe oh 3 8h generally ip began to form at 1 cm away from the root tips batty et al 2002 more ip formed in the elongation zone root hair area and near the root base of the plant roots and oppositely less formed on the young root tip and the new root hair hydrophytes with higher root porosities and roc had a higher amount of ip deposition and reddish brown ip can also be found on the soil surface around the rhizosphere of plants yang et al 2014a the formation of root ip on wetlands plants is species specific and regulated by many environmental factors and operational conditions which will be elaborated on in the following paragraphs 2 1 basic component sufficient available fe ii the high solubility of fe ii makes it more bioavailable in aquatic environments fe ii migrates into hydrophytes rhizosphere from surrounding sediments of wetlands due to the concentration gradient and the active fe ii pools are considered to be a major component source for ip formation tai et al 2018 the solubility of iron in sediments is affected by cation exchange capacity which affects the ip accumulation on plant roots barber 1984 fe and mn coexist in plaque deposits through adsorption and co precipitation while the amount of mn plaque is usually less than that of fe plaque jia et al 2018 ip content of typha latifolia showed a non linear increase trend with the increasing concentration of fe ii and then reached stability taylor et al 1984b the content of root ip is proportional to the concentration of fe ii in a certain range such as juncus effusus oryza sativa h li et al 2016 and canna indica tai et al 2018 fu et al 2011 found that fecl2 can increase the antioxidant enzyme activity in roots and the amount of ip on root surface in addition fe ii can stimulate the rhizosphere microbial activities which plays a significant role in stimulating fe redox transformation and influencing the ip formation dai et al 2020 ecological floating bed with iron scraps and plant biomass addition as electron donors developed ip on the plant roots peng et al 2023 for iron based enhanced cws the introduction of sufficient available fe ii promotes the ip formation therefore the remobilization and introduction of available ii from sediment or iron rich functional materials will promote the formation and dissolution of root ip 2 2 redox habitat and ph in cws rhizosphere redox habitat varies spatially and temporally due to the heterogeneity of oxygen distribution which is related to the waterlogging conditions water management type of cws and ph yamaguchi et al 2014 redox potential eh is a critical variable affecting the fe redox fluctuation during ip formation zhang et al 2012 waterlogging condition reduced the eh of wetland sediments and increased the fe ii mobility high contents of available fe ii and mn ii diffusing into the rhizosphere and precipitated by rol christensen et al al 1998a the operation mode of wetlands can affect the redox condition of the rhizosphere such as the continuous flow or tidal flow alternation moderate alternate drying and submergence in rhizosphere induce the ip formation by enhancing the accumulation of endogenous h2o2 and root activity fu et al 2017 in the vertical flow cws vfcws most fe ii get rapidly oxidized due to the oxidation environment and then filtered through the substrates which leads to insufficient available fe ii and poor ip formation ip may be observed in the horizontal subsurface flow cws hsfcws with necessary anaerobic zones and rol creating a favorable condition for the ip formation wu et al 2019 in the cws designed with artificial aeration the amount of root ip can be affected by adjusting the do content in the substrate different types of cws will affect the redox habitat in the substrate layer which affect the turnover of iron in the sediment or substrate thereby influencing the contact between roots and available fe ii rhizosphere ph is a comprehensive response of the rate of rol rhizosphere oxygen consumption root proton loss electron donor availability and the soil acid neutralization capacity it can influence the deposition status of ip directly by regulating the contents of available fe ii and dissolving ip on root surface or indirectly by affecting the roc mendelssohn et al 1995 higher fe ii mobility can be obtained in a prevailing acidic condition with relatively low ph and reductants such as phenolic compounds secreted from roots can promote the fe iii reduction in the surrounding rhizosphere mendelssohn et al 1995 while the decreased fe ii solubility is obtained at relatively high ph due to the fe ii oxidation taylor et al 1984a zhang et al 2012 to sum up the regulation of water conditions wetland types and ph can affect the redox environment in the rhizosphere thereby influencing the root ip formation 2 3 root characteristics of wetland plants 2 3 1 radial oxygen loss radial oxygen loss rol is one of the most important steps in promoting the ip formation and oxidized root channels which is the result of natural selection in wetland plants to cope with the long term anoxic aquatic conditions yang et al 2014a ip serves as a diffusive barrier to conduct a large proportion of o2 flux towards the root meristems thus reducing oxygen loss from the roots møller and sand jensen 2008 maintaining an oxygenated rhizosphere facilitates the degradation of pollutants and the oxidation of reducing substances such as organic acids fe2 nh4 n mn2 hs and s2 armstrong 1971 and enhances the tolerance of aquatic plants to heavy metals metalloids i e arsenic and emerging contaminants mei et al 2009 root oxidizing capacity is a key to the conversion of fe hydr oxide from amorphous to crystalline state and prevents ip against being reduced which will further immobilize pollutants and reduce their permeability yang et al 2018a rol not only promotes the abiotic fe ii oxidation but also provides electron acceptors for microaerophilic fe oxidizing bacteria both of which contribute to the ip formation aquatic plants with higher root porosity and rol have large amounts of ip deposition yang et al 2014b 2 3 2 root enzymatic oxidation activity root oxidizing capacity roc includes rol and enzymatic oxidation activity on the root surface yamada et al 2005 enzyme mediated promotion of reactive oxygen species ros plays a critical role in fe ii oxidation yang et al 2014b ros are intermediates of molecular oxygen reduction or oxidative burst products in response to environmental stresses including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 superoxide anion o 2 and hydroxyl radical ho etc srivastava and dubey 2011 large amounts of h2o2 accumulate in plant roots under salinity stress which can significantly reduce root porosity and rol thus further influencing the ip formation di bella et al 2014 pedersen et al 2021 as iii stress will cause an oxidative burst in plant roots exuding large amounts of ros to oxidize the available fe ii lee et al 2013 the induction of rhizosphere environment is closely related to the expression of root enzymatic oxidation genes catalase secreted by roots can promote the oxidation and crystallization of fe ii in rhizosphere liu et al 2006 fu et al 2013 proved the role of h2o2 in the root ip formation by titration test with a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide fenton reaction between fe ii and h2o2 may be an important step in ip formation by analyzing the function of antioxidant enzymes in scavenging ros yu et al 2021a however it s still not clear which type of ros plays a decisive role in the ip formation nor the ros concentration affects the composition of ip which all need to be further studied 2 3 3 root exudates root exudates res are the general term for enormous organic compounds exuded from plant roots which can be divided into low molecular weight compounds low mr and high molecular weight substances high mr low mr compounds involve amino acids organic acids phenolics and sugars and high mr exudates include polysaccharides proteins and enzymes which are all believed to serve as carbon and nitrogen sources for microbial growth meng et al 2022 organic acids will influence the existing form and solubility of root ip zhang et al 2019 oxalic acid and citric acid can significantly accelerate the fe iii dissolution via the complexation of hydroxyl groups with fe leading to the migration of fe oxides chen et al 2016 the root surface is more susceptible to the direct influence of res which can accumulate a vast array of organics and attract more microorganisms to colonize landi et al 2006 res can serve as electron donors to promote the growth of ferb joner and leyval 2003 rhizosphere effect involves res bais et al 2006 which can affect the important rhizosphere ecological processes such as denitrification li et al 2021 anammox y li et al 2016 organics decomposition dong et al 2022 discovered that res inhibited the activity of geobacteria and anaeromyxobacter that influence the ip formation through van der waals forces furthermore metal ions mobility bioavailability and transformation are all closely linked to the release of res particularly in the rhizosphere zhao et al 2021 to sum up different types of wetland plants feature different root properties such as the ability of root oxygen secretion proton secretion root enzyme oxidation sensitivity to iron etc which will affect the root ip formation therefore it s important to choose the right aquatic plants for different treatment water quality snowden et al 1995 hupfer and dollan 2003 2 4 microbes involved in iron plaque formation rol together with other environmental factors provides favorable conditions for microbial growth and proliferation diverse microbial communities are involved in the ip formation and representative microbes include but are not limited to fe oxidizing bacteria feob fe reducing bacteria ferb and mn oxidizing bacteria mnob emerson et al 1999 feob was found in 92 of wetland plant roots surveyed in 13 biogeochemical aquatic ecosystems weiss et al 2003 fe ii oxidation under neutral ph condition is mediated by neutrophilic feob at the oxic anoxic interface or in anoxic habitats including microaerophilic feob anaerobic phototrophic feob and anaerobic nitrate reducing feob widdel et al 1993 straub et al 1996 feob belongs to freshwater betaproteobacteria and known genera include gallionella kucera et al 1957 sideroxydans weiss et al 2007 and ferriphaselus emerson et al 2010 inhabiting niches where o2 concentration is well below air saturation maisch et al 2019 feob can dramatically alter the kinetics of fe ii oxidation and oxygen consumption at the anoxic interface around the roots mainly by forming unique micro niches due to oxygen heterogeneity chan et al 2016 under the condition of high fe ii availability high density of lithotrophic feob can promote the ip formation on juncus effusus roots and increase the short term rates of fe ii oxidation by 1 3 1 7 times neubauer et al 2007 feob inoculation increased the ip formation on phragmites australis roots guo and cutright 2015 wei et al 2021 highlighted the contribution of feob burkholderia sp d416 and mnob pseudomonas sp in promoting and regulating the cd uptake through root ip formation ferb is widely distributed in anoxic and anaerobic habitats such as lakes sediments and rhizosphere king and garey 1999 notable identified ferb include shewanella spp myers et al 1990 geobacter spp lovley et al 1988 albidoferax ferrireducens lovley et al 1996 geothrix fermentans coates et al 1999 acidiphilium spp fabisch et al 2013 and hyperthermophilic archaea tor et al 2001 geobacteria spp mainly in contact with extracellular electron acceptors and other organisms electrically mohapatra et al 2021 geobacter spp and shewanella spp can perform nitrate dependent fe iii reduction by reducing nitrates to ammonia gao et al 2019 dissimilatory fe iii reduction is an enzymatic reaction driven by ferb which is a coupling process of fe iii reduction and organics decomposition in anaerobic habitats in wetlands rhizosphere lovley 1991 ferb strain shewanella oneidensis mr 1 can use h2 formate or lactate as electron donors for the dissimilatory fe iii reduction 2 4feooh ch3chohcoo 7h 4fe2 ch3coo hco 3 6h2o a high abundance of poorly crystallized fe iii oxides hydroxides and labile organic components on ip can serve as an energy source for ferb sowers et al 2019 acetate ethanol propionate and butyrate were all used as carbon sources for ferb enrichment such as geobacter spp conrad and klose 1999 conversely much of the poorly crystallized fe iii minerals in sediments are not readily reduced by ferb phillips et al 1993 3 ch3coo 24feooh 8fe3o4 2hco 3 12h2o h the rate of rol is not uniform in a different part of the root system and the same spot on the plaque may change from microaerobic to anaerobic state with a corresponding switch from feob to ferb leading to a transient break between microbial fe oxidation and reduction neubauer et al 2008 however the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cws substrate facilitates the multiple ecological niches formation therefore more studies are required to quantify the fe cycling mediated by rhizosphere microbes and the synergistic effects of root ip and microbes and its effect on nutrient turnover are worthy of attention 2 5 nutrient composition in wastewater 2 5 1 labile om abundance labile om plays a significant role in the sorption and mobility of fe ii perret et al 2000 om decomposition creates an anoxic condition in rhizosphere and releases various organic ligands contributing electrons and protons to the acid and reducing the dissolution of ip accumulating research has demonstrated that fe mediated om protection may reduce the availability of fe and thereby affecting the ip formation chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 the presence of inorganic carbonate promoted the fe immobilization in the wetland rhizosphere batty et al 2000 while macfie and crowder 1987 believed that the formation of ip was negatively correlated with the percent inorganic carbonate fe associated om coprecipitated at the anoxic aerobic interface where microorganisms take fe iii as electron acceptor and produces co2 via om decomposition coupled with fe reduction under anoxic period chen et al 2020 and large amounts of fe ii can be released from fe iii om precipitates and micro aggregates pan et al 2016 huang et al 2017 syu et al 2014 demonstrated that fe ii reservoir in sediments was not sufficient for ip formation under flooded conditions while fe combined with high om concentrations significantly promoted the release of fe ii making it easier to migrate and promote the ip formation 2 5 2 impact of inorganic s waterlogged conditions in cws will affect the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur s and its relationship with ip formation khan et al 2016 inorganic s and its form play critical roles in the ip formation and inhibition of uptake and bioavailability of toxic metals zandi et al 2020 elemental sulfur s0 could induce the formation of root ip and mineral particles in rhizosphere and the plaque content increased with the increasing s addition fan et al 2010 however excessive application of sulfate so4 2 decreased the root ip and sharply affect its barrier function zandi et al 2020 this can be interpreted as the reduction of so4 2 to sulfide s2 by sulfate reducing bacteria srb under reducing conditions s2 with strong reducibility reduces the fe iii leads to an increase of fe ii in rhizosphere and get oxidized by rol yang et al 2016 excess s2 oxidization in rhizosphere might deplete more oxygen and its toxicity might affect the roc and eventually diminish the root ip fan et al 2010 moreover s2 can directly facilitate the reduction and decomposition of ip excessive sulfide in hsfcws can directly precipitate fe ii as fes or pyrite fes2 minerals to decrease the available fe ii required for ip formation armstrong and armstrong 2005 zandi et al 2020 notably rol can oxidize fes occasionally and liberate fe ii thus further promoting massive root ip deposition trolldenier 1988 khan et al 2016 overall the influence of s on ip formation depends not only on the substrate property microbial activity but also on and the transformation uptake release of these elements by rhizosphere effect fig 1 displays the conceptual model showing s cycling and ip formation in cws rhizosphere 2 5 3 impact of p availability phosphorus p is one of the most basic nutrients essential for plant yield and growth malhotra et al 2018 currently various studies have been reported on the effect of p availability on ip formation in wetlands hupfer and dollan 2003 found that ip formed on hydrophyte roots was associated with p retention p availability hindered the reduction and transformation of ferrihydrite thereby reducing the effectiveness of fe however yang et al 2018b demonstrated that the available p can regulate the community composition and activity of microorganisms thus facilitating the ip formation dai et al 2017 several studies found that p deficiency can induce the reddish brown ip rip formation fu et al 2014b p deficiency can enhance the roc of hydrophytes which will trigger the production of ros and the release of oxides such as h2o2 leading to more ip deposition chen et al 2008 fu et al 2014a speculated that the ip formation was related to the concentration ratio of p fe2 in the rhizosphere recent studies found that p sufficiency was beneficial for the non reddish brown nip formation and prevented the rip formation by available fe ii reacting with p to form white precipitates fu et al 2016 overall more studies are needed to determine the actual role and contribution of p in the ip formation 3 function of iron plaque in contaminants removal 3 1 fate of nutrients affected by iron plaque the rhizosphere of wetland plants is a unique habitat featured by redox heterogeneity on account of the rol and artificial water management which differentiates various functional microbial niches in the micro zones and motivates the biogeochemical cycling of key elements especially c n p and fe kögel knabner et al 2010 the interactions between the ip formation disintegration and n transformation c turnover and p availability are of great significance for rhizosphere pollutant removal in cws 3 1 1 interactions of iron plaque with carbon turnover the wetland rhizosphere boasts a large dynamic organic carbon c pool which provides an abundant c source for microbes and serves as a biogeochemical hotspot for various fe hydr oxides the cycling of fe hydr oxide is interactively coupled with c which in turn strongly influences the dynamics and scale of c turnover in wetland ecosystems yu et al 2021a rhizosphere ip is a hotspot for fe redox cycling due to the poorly crystallized fe that can be utilized by microorganisms yao et al 2022 in addition to the protection transportation and stabilization of c root ip plays a variety of roles in wetland ecosystems some of which can drive c loss in rhizosphere coward et al 2018 sowers et al 2019 on the one hand fe hydr oxide can mediate c retention by serving as sorbent and connective cement to bind organic c forming complexes and aggregates in rhizosphere duan et al 2020 wei et al 2022 argued that ip formed on root surface acted as a rusty sink with a large surface area to accumulate and stabilize organic c and the difference in crystallinity and mineralogy of ip determine its capacity to absorb and bind organic c on the other hand amorphous fe hydr oxide can serve as an electron transfer role whereby fe iii can receive electrons from microorganisms or electron shuttles for microbial respiration and promotes the om decomposition melton et al 2014 moreover considerable fe iii minerals in rhizosphere were electron acceptors for ferb which can promote the destruction of ip and organic c release weiss et al 2005 luo et al 2018 in addition fe ii donates electrons to various oxidants such as o2 or h2o2 especially the re oxidation of labile fe ii accumulated on ip during anoxic period to generate abundant ros which can depolymerize complex biopolymers into unstable monomers via fenton or fenton like reactions chen et al 2020 or indirectly contribute to the decomposition of organic c in rhizosphere by promoting the phenol oxidase activity van bodegom et al 2005 yao et al 2022 demonstrated that ip enhanced the oxidation of microbial available organic c via fe iii reduction coupled microbial respiration and enriched the microorganisms involved in fe redox cycling e g bacillus and geobacter and their functional genes on both root surface and rhizosphere liu et al 2021 showed that the salinity elevated the ip abundance at oligohaline treatment while suppressing it at the mesohaline treatment in tidal freshwater wetlands and the abundance of ip can be considered as an indicator of c decomposition rates in response to salinity and flooding res and microbial derived organic c can affect the organic mineral complexes and repeated formation and dissolution of ip jeewani et al 2020 the aerobic anaerobic alternating environment is expected to significantly increase the net reduction rate of ip and associated anaerobic organic c mineralization huang and hall 2017 chen et al 2020 and may promote the recrystallization of amorphous fe hydr oxide thompson et al 2006 as crystalline fe hydr oxide such as goethite and hematite are less susceptible to dissimilatory reduction the associated organic c bound to it is less likely to decompose and will be protected for a relatively long time roberts 2015 in summary root ip in wetlands plays a complex but important role in om decomposition and storage which is closely related to the hydrological cycle and microbial activities 3 1 2 interactions of iron plaque with nitrogen transformation steep oxygen concentration gradients and ip were formed under a dynamic rhizosphere environment and many key processes pertaining to n transformation in wetlands occur in rhizosphere micro zones arth and frenzel 2000 plant uptake and nitrification mainly occur in the rhizosphere aerobic zone ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrifying bacteria can convert ammonia nh4 into nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 by using rol brix et al 2002 samantha et al 2022 displayed that the no3 concentration in the rhizosphere exhibited reproducible significant trends as a function of distance from roots and varied inversely with o2 and profiles in the root zone via planar optode imaging as nh4 and nox diffuse away from the oxic zone to the more oxygen depleted zone nox removal is observed via denitrification nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation or anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox wu et al 2019 res can serve as the carbon source for denitrification or dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra moreover fe iii reduction coupled with anammox termed feammox which can produce n2 no2 or no3 has been identified in many ecosystems including cws li et al 2015 peng et al 2021 shuai and jaffe 2019 found that the bioaugmentation of acidimicrobiaceae sp a6 in fe rich substrates cw had higher nh4 removal due to the process of feammox which is essential for n conversion in submerged soils and rhizosphere sediments the conceptual diagram illustrating the root ip and n cycling in cws rhizosphere is shown in fig 2 microorganisms involved in n cycling occupy different ecological niches in the rhizosphere redox gradient ip provides a satisfied site for microbial attachment which greatly enrich the microbial community structure and density hu et al al 2017 a higher abundance of nitrifying bacteria was detected in ip of iron rich substrate limonite cws indicating that ip promoted the growth and reproduction of nitrifying bacteria in rhizosphere wan et al 2020 sun et al 2019 found that rol stimulated the growth of facultative anaerobic denitrifiers mainly by pseudomonas aeromonas and acinetobacter in rhizoplane thereby promoting the denitrification process most nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria attached to ip belong to proteobacteria which play a critical role in nitrogen removal li et al 2008 nitrospirillum was enhanced on ip which was related to the higher nitrification efficiency chung et al 2015 genera of bradyrhizobium attached on ip have been reported to serve as aerobic denitrifiers gabarro et al 2013 ferb such as geobacteraceae spp and shewanella spp was able to affect the ip dissolution and feammox rate in rhizosphere anaerobic habitats li et al 2015 in addition the genera of azospira and sphingobacteriales were found on ip which was capable of nitrogen fixation iturralde et al 2020 mei et al 2014 showed that the ip rose the oxygen concentration around the roots by changing the root characteristics and then improved the removal efficiencies of tn and cod in the treatment of domestic sewage with acorus calamus arundo donax cyperus flabelliformis canna indica iris tectorum and scirpus validus moreover the removal efficiency of tn by plants covered with ip was significantly higher than those without and ip enhanced the tn concentration in both above ground and belowground plant tissues mei et al 2014 3 1 3 interactions of iron plaque with phosphorus availability biogeochemical cycles of p and fe in cws are tightly interlinked due to the dynamic change of ph eh and other environmental parameters in rhizosphere the mobility of fe and p and the impact of ip on p accumulation and bioavailability show different effects since fe iii hydr oxides have a strong affinity for p the fixation of p by ip reduces its nutrient availability resulting in less available p to hydrophytes zhang et al 2012 crowder et al 1991 christensen et al 1998b suggested that ip on littorella unifora and isoetes lacustris roots limited the p uptake and biomass production due to p adsorption by oxidized fe and mn in plaque wan et al 2020 found that root ip on cattails enhanced the tp removal in aquatic environments in some cases ip functions as a temporary p hub in rhizosphere which may facilitate p diffusion into root system and promote p translocation to the above ground jia et al 2018 xu et al 2009 the sequestration amount of p in ip and aboveground shoots increased with the soluble p contents in the growing media wang et al 2010 p content in ip was affected by the competition between substrate adsorption in cws and the transfer of p from ip into plant biomass cao et al 2013 moreover some views believed that the absorption and utilization of p depend on the content of ip when ip was present as a thick cover on the root system its physical blocking and immobilization of p were significantly enhanced thus the uptake of p by wetland plants was dependent on the optimum amendment of fe and varied by plant species xu et al al 2009 wang et al 2010 however batty et al 2002 found that ip can sequester p but its role for p uptake by hydrophytes was ineffective which could still satisfy the plant growth p immobilized in vfcws rhizosphere is relatively stable under oxic conditions due to its combination with amorphous fe oxides while it s released when fe iii minerals reduced by ferb occur in water saturated vertical cws or hsfcws with anoxic environments far away from the rhizosphere khan et al 2016 the fixation of p by ip makes up for the release of p in the anaerobic niches and the dynamic ip formation ensures that the dissolved fe ii can continue to play the role of p fixation in cws in addition the temporary p hub would gradually collapse and the fixed p would be released after hydrophytes decay which increases the risk of eutrophication the fixation of p by ip may be permanent in hydrophytes with an evergreen survival strategy christensen 1997 in conclusion the role of root ip in the removal of p by aquatic plants seems to be controversial with different functions of a hub a barrier or be ineffective in addition the regulatory mechanism of rhizosphere microorganisms on p turnover is still unclear based on the above summary in rhizosphere micro niches root ip showed different roles in the transformation and absorption of pollutants in cws it can serve as a good reservoir for retaining nutrients which plays a significant role in nitrification and denitrification it can also act as a barrier against the uptake of nutrients then low ip produced wetland plants may be preferred for the remediation of contaminants in cws the actual role of ip in nutrient immobilization and removal remains to be further explained therefore establishing conditions for optimum ip formation according to the characteristics of influents quality and pollutants removal targets will be helpful in regulating pollutant removal in cws fig 3 illustrates the schematic overview of the interactions between root ip and c n and p cycles in cws rhizosphere 3 2 emerging contaminants emerging contaminants ecs are becoming more prevalent in cws ecosystems and we summarized the recent studies on the interactions of ip with pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps persistent organic pollutants pops and microplastics mps in rhizosphere of cws plants in table 1 representative substances of ppcps are water borne antibiotics and sterol hormones pi et al 2011 part of ppcps can be deposited on root ip under waterlogged conditions and ip with high adsorption sites and functional groups can accelerate the elimination of ppcps wei et al 2019 hu et al 2021 however the inhibitory effect of antibiotics on ip formation was found in bao et al 2018 study pahs and pbdes are two common pops in industrial discharges and ecosystems luo et al 2020 ip can contribute to the immobilization of pahs and pbdes and act as a physical barrier to prevent contaminants into plants pi et al 2016 the reductive dechlorination of lindane coupled with fe reduction promoted the ip formation in rhizosphere thereby blocking the external toxic lindane feng et al 2019 psmp and ptfe interacted with res through van der waals forces inhibited the root activity and reduced the ip formation dong et al 2022 while the coexist of as iii modulates the fe related response genes and increases ip thickness by causing p deficiency dong et al 2021 based on the above research root ip can act as the adsorption sites for pollutants immobilization but it will also be stimulated by pollutants and decompose till fail current research on the removal mechanism of root ip and ecs is still a brand new topic and few qualitative and quantitative information is available in cws for example the combined roles of root ip in the bioaccumulation and degradation of ecs and the effects of ip on ecs metabolism in aquatic plants have not been explored moreover multi factorial studies are needed to reveal the mechanism of co exposure of ecs salinity toxic metal loid s and other stresses on the ip formation in cws 3 3 heavy metals due to its high specific surface area and hydroxyl oh functional groups ip can co precipitate with heavy metals and provide reaction substrates for the translocation and sequestration of various metal loids kerl et al 2019 khan et al 2016 zandi et al 2021 found that the oryza sativa l covered with ip significantly reduced the uptake accumulation and mobilization of toxic metal loids such as cd cr as and sb in paddy soil shen et al 2021 investigated the combined heavy metal stress on root ip formation of k obovata and the results showed that it enhanced the ip formation and heavy metals deposition with different sensitivity to the type and concentration of pollutants aquatic plants can either act as accumulators to accumulate pollutants or as excluders that restrict the entry khan et al 2016 the disparity in the pattern of metal loids uptake by ip is strongly attributed to the root characteristics of specific plants the amount and the type of ip and the availability of metal ions in aquatic media controversial results revealed more about the barrier reservoir or ineffectual function of ip for toxic metal loids substances under environmental stresses rather than the relatively clear relationship between the rhizosphere ip and contaminants removal tripathi et al 2014 khan et al 2016 in addition hydroponic research or experiments with fewer factors may lead to certain limitations in understanding the relationship between rhizosphere ip and toxic metal loids removal in cws in natural environments root ip will lose its supporting substrates upon the death and decomposition of hydrophytes and more attention should be paid to the fate of ip and metal loid s attached onto it in cws ecosystem 4 challenges and outlooks for future research ip exists in the key ecological niche at the interface between wetland sediments and hydrophytes rhizosphere and affects the migration and transformation of pollutants due to the complexity of wastewater composition and rhizosphere redox gradient in cws our knowledge of this dynamic equilibrium process influenced by various environmental factors is still limited in general few studies have been carried out from the quantitative perspectives such as the model construction based on the pollutant removal of ip in cws rhizosphere therefore we propose some key areas for future research 4 1 exploring the optimal design and working conditions of cws for appropriate ip formation the cws ecosystem is affected by many factors such as its structural design operating parameters plant species substrate selection etc which are closely related to the formation of rhizosphere ip and the removal of pollutants vfcws have the excellent aerobic conditions due to the large amounts of wastewater flowing vertically through the planted zones while rol has a negligible effect on redox potential hsfcws system creates both aerobic and anoxic zones which are conducive to the ip formation redox state in hsfcws rhizosphere varies with numerous factors such as wetland depth and length plant oxygen release and substrate cws has evolved from its original category and many new technologies have been derived such as ecological floating beds research showed that ip was formed on the roots of aquatic plants when the ecological floating bed was used to treat micro polluted wastewater peng et al 2023 studies showed that drying submergence alternation can improve the root activity and resistance to environmental stresses and promote large amounts of reddish brown root ip fu et al 2017 however current efforts mostly focused on paddy fields and more works need to be carried out on the dynamic changes of ip in different cws taking examples of evaluating the impacts of hydraulic design on the thickness and distribution of ip at the roots water interface and how to optimize and coordinate the relationship between drying submergence alternation and influencing factors do carbon source microorganisms etc and pollutant removal in cws therefore manipulating redox potentials by altering the design and operation of cws may be the most available approach to promote dynamic ip formation in the rhizosphere cws can not only be designed with a wide range of redox conditions to facilitate multiple pollutants removal but also with limited redox conditions for specific pollutants removal by adjusting the influent organic loads hrt operation pattern and aeration condition in substrates future studies should focus more on oxygen distribution and nutrient availability in rhizosphere so as to improve the nutrition center role of ip and strengthen its sequestration and immobilization of targeted pollutants aquatic plant species are one of the essential factors affecting the ip formation rol and root ip are valuable parameters for selecting suitable plant species for cws and the potential ranking of plant roc and whether some plants can create better oxidation environments in root micro niche in winter are not yet known moreover rol also depends on the redox state of the wetland substrates wiessner et al 2002 reasonable substrates selection and composition can enable the harmonious co existence of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions in cws rhizosphere which will enhance the ip performance and contaminants removal and provide possible carbon source for denitrification for low c n ratio influent as substrates widely used in wetlands biochar or novel fe modified biochar can induce or inhibit the root ip formation and might affect the adsorption and subsequent removal of p and heavy metals limited studies are listed in table 2 however studies related to the effect of substrates on root ip focused more on paddy fields and few studies on cws overall based on the above aspects the research on the root ip will help to further optimize the design of cws ecosystem for immobilization and pollutants removal and provide theoretical support for improving the water purification efficiency of the root ip in cws 4 2 developing bioaugmentation strategy of ip in rhizosphere ecological remediation rhizosphere redox habitat significantly induced the enrichment of functional microorganisms and their different responses therefore a novel strategy of synthetic microbial communities syncoms can be designed and applied to stimulate the functional microbes in situ and reinforce the rhizosphere effects for bioremediation in cws thus clearly elucidating the complex interaction of rhizosphere microorganisms vorholt et al 2017 bhatia and goyal 2014 in addition inoculants with improved remediation potential can be added based on their inherent properties to improve the remediation capacity of cws adding plant litters to enrich feob the mnob for intensifying the biogenic ip plaque in rhizosphere which can further promote the fe mn plaque formation gu et al 2022 found that plant biomass can accelerate fe oxidation by enriching the microbial community biogenic ip on roots provides an ecological habitat for the removal of nitrate phosphate persistent organics pollutants and emerging contaminants in cws which strengthens the shortfalls of existing cws in addition the effect of root ip on the transformation of coexisting pollutants such as the removal mechanisms of refractory organic matter and nitrogen in the rhizosphere can be considered moreover the modification of substrate materials for functional microorganism enrichment and selection can be explored in future studies 4 3 exploring the relationship between root ip and ghg emission root ip not only affects the migration and bioavailability of rhizosphere elements but also greatly enriches the abundance and density of rhizosphere microbial community and promotes the n c s and p cycling biogenic gasses such as ch4 n2o and h2s generated from these processes are interconnected and interact with cws substrates and intermediates moreover the process of nitrification and denitrification in plants rhizosphere and its relationship with ip have important theoretical and practical significances for nitrogen loss and n2o emission liu et al 2019 demonstrated that ip is a hotspot for n2o emission and n loss in paddy soils mainly through fe ii oxidation coupled with denitrification however the impact of rhizosphere ip on ghg emissions n2o ch4 in cws and whether this effect will be exacerbated under climate change has not been well studied therefore future studies should focus on the relationship between rhizosphere ip and ghg emissions to provide more powerful evidence for estimating the ghg contribution of the entire wetland ecosystems 4 4 deepening in situ kinetics study of ip in cws detailed research on in situ kinetics of ip formation and dissolution in rhizosphere is still not available understanding the kinetics of fe redox in rhizosphere is a prerequisite for studying the cycling of key elements and the impact of fe redox on the electron accepting process studies have demonstrated that humic substances act as electron shuttles for fe iii dissimilation and reduction under anaerobic condition while direct evidence of kinetic mechanisms of electron transfer is lacking and there has been no definitive kinetics study of labile om abundance on ip dissolution moreover the kinetics between abiotic and biotic fe ii oxidation on ip formation need to be clarified and the kinetics of solute uptake and transport by ip with different thickness also needs to be further studied 5 conclusions rhizosphere is a dynamic transitional zone at the interface of aquatic plants water substrates in cws and ip is the product formed by various environmental factors in rhizosphere root ip may not only serve as fe oxide reservoir but also as the sink of pollutants more importantly ip can act as a redox gradient mediated biofilm in the rhizosphere that drives efficient nutrient transformation as root ip has the potential to increase pollutant removal by being regulated the main influencing factors for ip formation from the perspectives of wetland design and operation in cws was reviewed and evaluated the function of root ip on the migration and transformation of cn p pollutants emerging contaminants and heavy metals in cws more importantly root ip is crucial to the adaptability and resilience of the whole wetland ecosystem to future environmental disturbances so it is necessary to continue to explore and expand the research scope of root ip for instance exploring the optimal design and working conditions of cws suitable for the ip formation and creating the right conditions for the specific pollutant removal applying the bioaugmentation strategies to the ecological restoration of root ip to provide multiple barriers for the degradation of coexisting pollutants exploring the in situ kinetics of the ip formation and dissolution in cws rhizosphere considering the effects of root ip on ghg emissions in cws it provides strong evidence for estimating the ghg contributions of

14853,river systems are a key environmental recipient of macroplastic pollution understanding the sources of macroplastic to rivers and the mechanisms controlling fate and transport is essential to identify and tailor measures that can effectively reduce global plastic pollution several guidelines exist for monitoring macroplastic in rivers yet no single method has emerged representing the standard approach this reflects the substantial variability in river systems globally and the need to adapt methods to the local environmental context and monitoring goals here we present a critical review of methods used to measure macroplastic flows in rivers with a specific focus on opportunities for methods testing harmonisation and quality assurance and quality control qa qc several studies have already revealed important findings however there is significant disparity in the reporting of methodologies and data there is a need to converge methods and their adaptations towards greater comparability this can be achieved through i methods testing to better understand what each method effectively measures and how it can be applied in different contexts ii incorporating qa qc procedures during sampling and analysis and iii reporting methodological details and data in a more harmonised way to facilitate comparability and the utilisation of data by several end users including policy makers setting this as a priority now will facilitate the collection of rigorous and comparable monitoring data to help frame solutions to limit plastic pollution including the forthcoming global treaty on plastic pollution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic litter river monitoring harmonisation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction plastic debris is now well established as a global pollutant in the environment its occurrence can extend across a wide size spectrum from several meters down to the nanometre scale where macroplastic refers to the larger tangible pieces of plastic litter there remains a lack of internationally accepted definitions on what is included within the term plastic pollution such as size boundaries or relevant material compositions that are considered to be plastic hartmann et al 2019 however macroplastic typically includes plastic items down to a few centimetre in size e g 2 5 cm gonzález et al 2016 and may comprise common plastics such as polyethylene or polypropylene as well as bio based or biodegradable polymer types as such macroplastic pollution is typically characterised as a heterogeneous assemblage of plastic waste items exhibiting a range of properties that exert variable influence on fate and possible risks several modelling studies point to river systems as a key environmental recipient of plastic and an important pathway to other environments including wetlands lakes estuaries coastal ecosystems and the oceans e g lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 schmidt et al 2017 macroplastic pollution in river systems is a cause for concern as it can interact with organisms increase flood risk reduce amenity value and fragment into microplastics al zawaidah et al 2021 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 lechthaler et al 2020 understanding the sources of plastic to rivers and the mechanisms controlling riverine transport efficiency is key to identify measures that can effectively reduce pollution such as source control clean up technologies and shoreline riverine infrastructure designs black et al 2019 rochman 2018 by mass macroplastic represents the dominant component of river plastic pollution mai et al 2020 yet riverine macroplastic monitoring activities are hindered by lack of consolidated methodologies van emmerik and schwarz 2020 emphasising the urgency 175 countries endorsed a historic resolution at the un environment assembly unea 5 2 aiming at developing a legally binding agreement on plastic pollution by 2024 understanding the sources and riverine loadings of plastic pollution is instrumental for both the design and the implementation of the policy rognerud et al 2023 currently riverine plastic loading estimations are conducted with non validated coarse model frameworks e g lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 schmidt et al 2017 field data are required to consolidate these estimates and assess the future success of policy implementation developments in monitoring design including the coordination of monitoring activities and their methodological approach are central to success for this goal the majority of riverine macroplastic studies specifically aim to quantify the movement of plastic waste in the river channel thirty nine published studies have measured macroplastic flows in rivers globally within the scope of this review fig 1 utilising five main methodological approaches table s1 these methods can be divided into observation based and physical interception based techniques observation based sampling refers to the surveillance quantification and categorisation of macroplastic that is visible in the river without collecting the detected items whilst physical interception based sampling instead involves the active entrapment and collection of macroplastic from the river for the quantification and categorisation step there is significant variability in the methodological approaches adopted in existing published studies this includes discrepancies in the specific conditions of method deployment as well as the specific component of the total macroplastic load that is measured for example floating versus submerged items thus hampering the potential to compare between datasets globally winton et al 2020 several guidelines have been developed that describe and promote different methods for analysing riverine macroplastic e g barnardo and ribbink 2020 gonzález et al 2016 gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 miliute plepiene et al 2018 unep 2020 yet no single method has emerged representing the standard van emmerik and schwarz 2020 this reflects the difficulties in establishing a global one size fits all approach for all river systems and monitoring goals there is significant variability in river hydrology and geomorphology across the world macroplastics also vary considerably in size morphology and other physical properties where there is a current lack of harmonisation regarding this characterisation these differences will require substantial improvements adaptations or even the development of entirely new approaches to accurately assess macroplastic pollution in rivers globally better understanding plastic fluxes in a range of different fluvial settings is important meijer et al 2021 demonstrated that over 1000 rivers account for 80 of global plastic release to the oceans so targeting action on a small number of catchments may not be sufficient to tackle global plastic contamination moreover according to the same study more than 98 5 of the total mismanaged waste is not transported into the sea and remains within river catchments monitoring is therefore crucial to better understand the fate of plastic waste in rivers there is in addition a wide range of different operational objectives connected to riverine macroplastic monitoring linked to for instance assessments of plastic inputs e g recharge or affluent points loading flows e g baseline vs high flow assessments focused vs time aggregated observations etc or accumulations in specific parts of a river e g sediment bed bank riparian vegetation etc unep 2020 van emmerik et al 2022b different monitoring foci require different solutions and may necessitate the collection of data in different forms no single method is capable of measuring the total macroplastic load for all riverine settings in a single deployment instead methods are capable of characterising specific fractions defined by size buoyancy behaviour or other characteristics which must be interpreted or combined with other measurements to obtain a more complete picture of plastic contamination in a given catchment herein lies the importance of establishing well defined frames and methods with due consideration for what they are capable of accurately measuring and what the generated data can inform about plastic pollution across different spatial and temporal scales for these reasons harmonisation of methods is likely to be more important than standardisation in this context harmonisation can be defined as an effort to achieve cross comparability and interoperability in data outputs from different surveys operationally harmonisation includes an initial recognition and explanation of potential differences between datasets and the definition of a set of tools enabling conversions for comparability or interoperability harmonisation can be achieved through method testing validation and quality assurance and control qa qc respectively these actions can clearly define the limits thresholds and optimal deployment of a method methods testing establish the precision and accuracy validation and ensure data quality comparability and interoperability qa qc harmonisation of data reporting is also important the present paper critically reviews the methods adopted by published studies of macroplastic flows in river systems this refers to macroplastic actively transported in the river channel and does not include a review of methods to measure stocks or temporary stores of plastic within or along the river through this the aim is to support ongoing international policy processes such as the proposed global agreement on plastic unep ea 5 res 14 by identifying priority knowledge gaps related to method development and optimisation and defining opportunities for method testing validation and harmonisation that will facilitate a convergence of existing approaches the different applications of riverine macroplastic data are also considered to further optimise methods towards providing data that can be used by a wide range of end users including policymakers 2 measuring riverine macroplastic flows a total of 39 studies were identified as part of the critical method review for this paper following a systematic approach a full description of the review methodology is provided in the supplementary information briefly a series of boolean search strings were used for web of knowledge sciencedirect and google scholar to identify relevant papers which were further assessed based on the following criteria 1 a specific macroplastic focus 2 reporting of measurements of active macroplastic transport under field conditions and in river systems and 3 publication of data and methods in peer reviewed literature or technical reports the final list of 39 studies identified utilise five main methodological approaches which are depicted in fig 2 a e in the following sections each method will be evaluated with regard to ongoing needs for method testing and opportunities for validation and harmonisation 2 1 observations of riverine macroplastic 2 1 1 visual observation visual observation is the most commonly utilised technique for measuring macroplastic flows in rivers 17 out of 39 publications table s1 briefly human analyst s observe and record the visible macroplastic load passing a cross section of the river channel or a portion of it during a predefined measurement period a prerequisite is the availability of a vantage point for viewing the river this is typically a bridge or other infrastructure that passes over the river but surveys can also be performed from the riverbank for narrower streams e g crosti et al 2018 tasseron et al 2020 visual observation is therefore limited to locations where such a vantage point exists and can be safely accessed van emmerik et al 2020b in wider channels it will not be possible to observe the full width of the river from a single point and in this case it is necessary to define a cross section portion or observation track that represents a proportion of the river width gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 van emmerik et al 2018 recommends dividing the channel cross section into several portions and observing each of these for a measurement period that allows all defined portions to be observed in under one hour termed a sweep deemed to be a time lag where stream conditions will be relatively stationary where the full river width cannot be monitored within an appropriate time window the results from the measured portions will be extrapolated to the full river width to estimate total transport an appropriate portion width will depend on a number of factors for example vantage point height flow velocity plastic load and weather conditions some guidelines recommend that analysts face upstream to obtain a better view of arriving litter items e g gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 however several studies have also opted to view downstream in response to the specific environmental setting such as to avoid sun glare table s2 commonly a minimum of two analysts are required to perform this task one to observe the river and the other to record the data although this will depend on the plastic flux and flow velocity all macroplastic items that are observed during the measurement period are recorded additional categorisation of observed macroplastic can range from no categorisation to polymer category e g van calcar and van emmerik 2019 or item specific categorisation e g gonzález fernández et al 2021 the visual observation method allows for the rapid and inexpensive collection of data without the need for specialised equipment extensive training or permits this can facilitate the generation of several datapoints covering a range of spatial and temporal scales representing an important asset of this technique however this method is not capable of assessing the total riverine macroplastic load but only items visible from a position above the surface it also presents limitations or challenges that need to be carefully acknowledged and addressed these are selection of cross sectional spatial resolution of observations the optimum river cross section dimensions that can be reliably observed by a single analyst or team under a range of flow and plastic load conditions should be assessed this is likely to vary case by case and in relation to the contingent river flow conditions this includes an investigation into the upper thresholds for flow velocity and total plastic loads in cases where the total plastic flowing past the observation portion becomes too high it is no longer possible to reliably record and categorise all macroplastic items geraeds et al 2019 van emmerik et al 2018 moreover turbulent flows particularly in highly turbid rivers can potentially reduce the proportion of the total macroplastic load that can be reliably observed in this case river currents may drag buoyant plastic items below the river surface and out of the visible range hence the visual observation method is likely to be more challenging to accurately measure and categorise plastic flows during flood conditions or during periods of high suspended sediment load single observer cross sectional portions range from 2 5 to 65 m in width table s2 this factor can affect the lower size limit of macroplastic that can be identified for example schöneich argent et al 2020 selected a maximum 20 m segment width for their analysis of three german rivers as this facilitated assessment of 2 2 5 cm particles under different light and weather conditions additionally castro jiménez et al 2019 noted that whilst 2 5 cm particles could be identified directly below their selected vantage point only 7 cm particles could be reliably detected at the distal edges of their 65 m segments in the rhone river the use of cross sectional portions to facilitate visual observation can also have an impact on the representativeness of the data generated many studies do not visually observe the full river width and in some cases the portion s observed may represent 1 of the river width at the site in question table s2 this can create problems when extrapolating observation results to the full river cross section e g in connection with the statistical representativeness of the observations which is a function of the total density of visible floating items the percentage of the total cross section covered by the observers and the cross sectional distribution of plastic items turbulence and stream velocity method testing and validation exercises for example using tracers and measurement standards newbould 2021 or video footage van lieshout et al 2020 would help to establish what conditions facilitate effective measurement of riverine macroplastic e g bridge height and lower size limit and what the minimum requirements are for achieving accurate and representative measurements of macroplastic flows e g proportion of channel width measured or need for replication elevation of the observation point from water surface the distance of the observer from the water surface will also influence the lower size limit that can be reliably observed and the selection of the cross sectional domain covered by each observer reported vantage point heights vary between 0 5 and 20 m table s2 method testing should assess the realistic lower size limit for a range of vantage point heights to establish what can be defined as a suitable site for visual observation based monitoring this could be performed using items of a known size that are released upstream or by running the visual observation method in parallel with a physical interception technique to verify what was present in the water and was successfully detected van emmerik et al 2020a established a size limit of 1 cm for observation heights of up to 12 m when using human analysts a slightly different approach is outlined by gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 who recommend the selection of a monitoring site on the basis that it is possible to detect plastics 2 5 cm in size the latter facilitates more harmonised data collection but it is important to note that no such location may available in some river catchments incorporating data reporting in size bins may help to better compare between datasets with different minimum item sizes establishing an adequate lower observable size limit the lower observable size limit is in principle a function of the observer elevation and sensitivity the width of the cross sectional observation domains and stream flow it can be argued that lower observable item size is smaller than the lower size of items that can be reliably detected i e the lower size of quantifiable items because of the difficulty for a human operator to maintain an elevated level of attention over long observation periods and because different operators deployed along different cross sectional portions of the channel may have different sensitivities and concentration abilities the distinction between lowest detectable size and lowest size of quantifiable items is rarely discussed the lower size limit of plastics applied by the studies ranges across an order of magnitude from 0 5 to 5 cm table s2 this limits the potential for comparability between different studies using a common lower size limit or reporting in defined size categories could help to overcome this shortcoming however accurately assessing size when an item is in flux can be challenging for this measurement standards placed in line of sight may be needed unfortunately often the size limit is dictated by contingent aspects such as the elevation of the infrastructure e g a bridge river side etc used for the observations schöneich argent et al 2020 included an additional size category down to 0 5 cm to capture an important source of macroplastic litter cigarette butts that was detectable and below their initial lower size limit validating the accuracy of human analysts in detecting the lowermost sizes of macroplastic under a range of conditions is also necessary to ensure good data quality effective training of analysts is essential to avoid under reporting of some sizes classes of riverine macroplastic visibility depth vs channel depth the visibility of submerged plastics is likely to vary between monitoring sites and river catchments and in response to factors such as turbidity turbulence wind speed sun glare and the colour and size of the plastic items van emmerik et al 2018 the extent of visibility is only detailed in 5 out of 17 published studies table s2 and has been reported as 10 cm in the saigon river van emmerik et al 2018 manila rivers van emmerik et al 2020b and dutch canals tasseron et al 2020 and 20 cm in the seine van emmerik et al 2019c and klang rivers geraeds et al 2019 these studies do not report the total depth of the river so the proportion of the river that was observable cannot be discerned hindering the scaling of observations for the total water column depth in only very rare cases it may be possible to observe the total plastic load due to clear waters and very shallow rivers difficulties in accounting for variability in visibility represents a major challenge for harmonisation although reporting the visibility associated with each measurement along with the depth of the observed cross sections should represent a minimum data reporting requirement section 4 1 human error the potential for human error and bias should also be assessed within future methods testing and validation exercises geraeds et al 2019 vriend et al 2020b the time for a single measurement ranges from 1 to 63 min table s2 it is important to consider what is reasonable with regard to the concentration limit of a human analyst which will in turn be connected to the plastic load at a given site it may be preferable to take several short measurements in channels with a high flow velocity and or plastic load versus fewer longer measurements where the reliability of the human analyst s could be called into question the concept of fatigue has already been raised in other fields that rely on human observation based approaches e g rankin et al 2020 some studies report the use of binoculars to improve the confirmation of object identity e g crosti et al 2018 schirinzi et al 2020 weideman et al 2020 this may help to verify that a piece of debris is composed of plastic and what category it falls into although whilst using binoculars the field of view is significantly narrowed so they may not be suitable in circumstances where the plastic load is high or is spread across the river cross section moreover some particles may be preferentially under reported due to their characteristics for example being small in size or transparent vriend et al 2020b further validation tests to verify what can be reliably identified by human analysts under a range of conditions and for a range of plastic sizes and types are required to establish the real significance of these factors for generating accurate and reliable monitoring data and setting important thresholds in monitoring guidelines the influence of human error bias can be assessed and reduced by replicating e g two or more observers working independently from the same vantage point or randomising observations e g repeating observations by randomising the locations of individual observers in different cross sectional portions during consecutive sweeps using citizen science as a means to obtain larger datasets of visual observations for macroplastic flows has been discussed kiessling et al 2021 van emmerik et al 2020a this should consider the potential implications for data quality e g imprecise measurements human bias and balance the uncertainties of any given single reported measurement within a dataset for example problems associated with low motivation of citizen scientists has been reported for scenarios where plastic loads were low or the weather conditions were unfavourable kiessling et al 2021 based on the potential limitations set out for visual observation the extent to which citizen science represents the optimal use of this methodological approach should be explored this does not preclude the use of trained analysts for undertaking monitoring activities but through setting thorough monitoring and data reporting guidelines the uncertainties associated with visual observation data could be outweighed by the size of the datasets generated thus general trends could be more rapidly identified despite the potential lower quality of any single measurement within a citizen science generated dataset van emmerik et al 2020a the influence of the analyst as well as the environmental setting should be assessed routinely during the monitoring programme as part of a qa qc procedure this includes checks to evaluate i the total proportion of floating or visible macroplastic that is successfully recorded recovery rate for example through the use of dummy items intentionally released in the upstream ii the degree of variation in the categorisation of plastics between analysts iii the successful identification of litter items as plastic iv the successful categorisation of macroplastic litter items and v agreement between analysts regarding categorisation many of these factors can be assessed by running a parallel method which includes the physical interception of macroplastic such as the deployment of nets geraeds et al 2019 van emmerik et al 2019a 2019b 2 1 2 non human observation non human observation approaches follow a similar principle as for visual observation section 2 1 1 but replace human analysts with technological solutions current applications include the use of cameras kataoka and nihei 2020 onoi and nihei 2012 van lieshout et al 2020 and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs geraeds et al 2019 rocamora et al 2021 schreyers et al 2021a wolf et al 2020 as for the visual observation approach these methods are capable of assessing the visible macroplastic at the water surface namely what is floating and what is visible beneath the surface within a certain visibility depth relative to the optics and device used in addition sonar has been applied to detect below the water surface broere et al 2021 sensor assisted observations present many of the same limitations affecting human based observations but also offer some advantages similar to human based approaches turbidity and the distance from the water surface will define both the proportion of the total macroplastic load that can be recorded and the lower size limit that can be detected by a camera for example geraeds et al 2019 noted that macroplastic could no longer be classified at heights of 8 18 m above the water surface in the case of sonar echo sounding devices can permit observations of submerged including non visible plastics below the water surface broere et al 2021 however sonars cannot currently concretely discriminate whether a detected item is made of plastic or another material benefits of these techniques include the potential to measure over longer durations with high levels of consistency for example in the case of mounted cameras or in river reaches that are not easily accessible in the case of uavs they are able to handle higher plastic loads and flow velocities especially when footage can be replayed or the analysis is automated with the use of a visual processing algorithm geraeds et al 2019 kataoka and nihei 2020 although the influence of turbulent flow on the buoyancy and therefore visibility of plastics should be assessed if cameras are equipped with night vision capability then measurements of plastic flows during the night may be possible however in this case due to a potential different visibility depth a correction factor is necessary to harmonise data with day time observations it can also be possible to assess the size or 2d area of plastics with the use of a measurement reference or by registering deployment criteria e g height and angle to establish the spatial resolution geraeds et al 2019 rocamora et al 2021 image capture based methods can be limited by factors such as the file size of data outputs e g in the case of large video files or the battery life of devices geraeds et al 2019 the field of view i e the total area observed by the camera or uav etc will define the area of river that can be measured where the field of view is relatively small this may not cover the full width of the river and therefore may not assess the total visible floating and sub surface macroplastic load of the river in a single deployment this can be solved as for human based observations by considering well defined portions of the river cross section some technologies e g uavs are limited to quite specific weather conditions such as sufficiently low wind speeds or a lack of precipitation geraeds et al 2019 despite significant potential these approaches require testing and likely optimisation prior to routine deployment based on the limited application of these techniques thus far this includes testing what can be accurately detected with these technologies associated with different deployment conditions studies have already begun to compare human and technological approaches to plastic observation in rivers van lieshout et al 2020 found that 34 6 more plastic was detected when using a camera and visual processing algorithm than with human analysts in several jakarta rivers there was high variability associated with counts derived from both methods the camera and algorithm approach appeared to be better suited to handle high plastic loads where human observers were not able to count and classify as many items at the highest loadings however the study did not verify results with physical interception based sampling so it is difficult to conclude regarding the accuracy of each approach geraeds et al 2019 also recorded discrepancies between human and uav derived counts the potential for human analysts to be overwhelmed by high plastic loads and high flow velocities was observed however the occurrence of sun glints or shadows in uav images also lead to some classification errors using that technique validation and qa qc for non human observation approaches could be performed in a similar way to that for visual observation namely the deployment of a parallel physical interception sampling methodology to verify what proportion of total plastic is identified and assess the accuracy of item characterisation or facilitate assessment of mass conversions the efficacy of these techniques relies upon the quality and breadth of the training data for visual processing algorithms or the ability of human analysts to detect plastics in recorded images geraeds et al 2019 van lieshout et al 2020 this relates to the ability to reliably distinguish plastic items from other materials in the river an additional qa qc protocol should be put into place to confirm the quality of matches established ideally algorithms and associated training data should be provided as open source or made available through data code sharing platforms to allow for harmonisation in data collection where different programmes are used for different techniques facilitating interoperability should be a priority methods testing for these approaches should aim to identify the optimal range of working conditions as well as aspects related to the lower size limit of detection or the proportion of the river reach that can be studied additionally methods testing should address new and emerging technologies that can replace human analysts such as the potential use of underwater drones 2 2 physical interception of riverine macroplastic 2 2 1 nets nets comprise mesh screens or bags that are lowered into the water and used to intercept macroplastic that is flowing in the river fig 2c they are typically deployed from a fixed point such as a bridge but they may also be used from a boat e g haberstroh et al 2020 schöneich argent et al 2020 or from the riverbank or bed e g munari et al 2021 taryono et al 2020 nets can be utilised to measure floating sub surface or even benthic transport of macroplastic using buoys and weights to position them in the desired location within the water column e g moore et al 2011 morritt et al 2014 they can also be deployed in fleets several nets connected to the same frame to sample different parts of the water column simultaneously e g van emmerik et al 2019a 2019b nets are deployed for predefined measurement times or until the net becomes full or clogged with debris in published studies this ranges from 30 s to 3 days table s3 once the measurement period is over the nets are retrieved from the water the contents are then inspected to isolate count categorise and weigh the macroplastic component the use of nets represents the mostly commonly utilised physical interception based technique for measuring macroplastic flows table s1 the proportion of the total riverine macroplastic load captured by this method depends on the parameters of the net and its deployment first the size of the net opening aperture will determine both the proportion of the river cross section and the volume of water that can be sampled during the measurement period second the mesh size of the net establishes the lower size of plastic that is retained third the location and depth of deployment in the river cross section will define the transport pathway floating sub surface benthic that is assessed by this technique factors such as the selected mesh size the length of the net the flow velocity of the river and the total suspended load will also impact the length of the useful deployment time in a given environmental setting based on the clogging of the net harmonisation between these many factors is dependant upon a thorough description of the specific methodological details some studies do not report important criteria that can define what a given deployment specifically measured for example only six out of fifteen studies that deploy nets at the water surface describe the extent to which the nets were submerged in the water table s4 a factor which dictates the volume of water sampled and has potential implications for the sampling of floating macroplastic of different sizes minimum reporting requirements should form the basis of harmonised methods and this is addressed in more detail in section 4 1 the thresholds associated with the deployment of nets with different configurations and under different flow and plastic load conditions requires testing this testing will help to optimise the technique and ensure safe deployment in the field a submerged net produces drag a force with an orientation opposite to that of the water flow drag results in additional turbulence in water and the reduction of the downstream transport of plastic in the vicinity of the net mouth upstream this in turn lowers the likelihood that an item will be captured be the net drag and hence turbulence is linearly proportional to the stream flow velocity at low flow velocities while it increases quadratically at high flow velocities drag force also depends on the drag coefficient imposed by the geometry of the net which increases as the net accumulates material flow velocity immediately upstream of a clogged net can even approach zero rendering further sampling ineffective maintaining adequate control of operational conditions of nets with a given geometry and mesh and in given river conditions is therefore essential to enable quantitative and reliable assessments and comparable and interoperable data generation the selection of mesh size should also be considered for example weideman et al 2020 reported that flow velocities up to 3 m s 1 were manageable for a 0 6 0 3 m net with a 300 µm mesh set at the water surface in the orange vaal river system south africa under lower flow conditions reported as 0 002 m s 1 the presence of the net introduced turbulence that prevented some plastic items from entering the net and being captured the debris instead flowed around at higher velocities the potential for damaging the net increases and the drag force acting on the nets becomes too great for safe manual deployment and retrieval this was noted by geraeds et al 2019 who selected a 2 5 cm mesh to ensure safe deployment of a 0 67 0 67 m net in the klang river malaysia flow velocity between 0 5 and 1 m s 1 changes in one variable flow velocity mesh size deployment duration etc will affect other variables so this technique should be adapted to the specific research questions and conditions in the river this will determine the total length of time temporal scale that a single measurement can account for and the representativeness of the net as a sampling technique nets represent the second most commonly utilised technique for assessing macroplastic flows table s1 yet there is currently very little harmonisation between monitoring efforts that utilise this method for example only two studies use the same net configuration with regards to aperture mesh size degree of submersion for surface nets or depth location of deployment fig 3 haberstroh et al 2021 2020 given the lack of a standardised description of which nets are appropriate for macroplastic monitoring in different contexts it is likely that the choice of the net characteristics adopted in the different studies is at least partly contingent to what was locally available or had precedence in a research group it is unlikely that a single net configuration can be recommended for all rivers as several of the above mentioned factors are tailored to the conditions in the river instead method calibration aiming to define the operability window of a given net in a given environmental setting should proceed deployment results of such calibration should be presented along with monitoring results and constitute a set of parameters and knowledge to increase confidence in the comparability and interoperability of data rather than being based on a set of technical specifications standardisation in this area should be achieved through a shared set of quality criteria relative to pre calibration of the net operability a venue to achieve this type of standardisation could be through the deployment of nets in artificial flumes during ad hoc calibration experiments that aim to test what net parameters e g mesh size are optimal for different hydrological conditions and plastic loads this could provide model parameterisation to predict behaviours of macroplastic capturing devices under different conditions reduce calibration effort prior to monitoring and produce guidelines for the types of nets to be used in riverine macroplastic monitoring this should also comprise a quantitative assessment of the errors associated with net design and operation in addition harmonisation efforts should address the data collection and reporting to ensure that critical differences between studies are described and can be accounted for 2 2 2 booms booms are floating barriers that extend across all or part of the channel and collect buoyant debris including macroplastics as they accumulate at the water surface upstream fig 2d they are typically used as clean up or pollution prevention measures but may also be used as a sampling methodology by adding a procedure to isolate count categorise and weigh the macroplastic component of collected debris booms are emptied by carefully dragging the floating accumulation to the bank or other suitable location for retrieval some more advanced installations include automated collection for example by lifting debris from the water or directing it towards a collection container e g vriend et al 2020b booms may also include a mesh or screen that extends below the floating line to collect near surface debris flows vriend et al 2020b booms can measure the macroplastic load that is transported in the uppermost part of the water column across the full or partial river width depending on the nature of deployment for the duration of boom deployment if a net or screen is present below the floating component of the boom the coverage of the total cross section of course increases the mesh size used for this net screen will determine the lower size limit that can be captured from this near surface flow only six studies have thus far utilised booms as a sampling method table s5 all of these use structures that were already established as part of ongoing clean up or debris removal schemes before being used in monitoring it is notable that studies rarely report important criteria about the structure of the device or the parameters of any given measurement specifically this includes sparse reporting of the dimensions of the boom the presence of any mesh or screen the depth of the submerged part the rate at which the boom was emptied the proportion of the channel width intercepted by the boom or the capacity of the boom structure table s5 these represent crucial details for interpreting data derived from this methodological approach and the lack of reporting is a barrier to harmonisation without these details it is difficult to conclude on the efficacy of booms as a sampling method for measuring macroplastic flows in order to transform this approach into a validated sampling methodology methods testing is required for example malik et al 2020 established that this method is best suited to slower moving water as the capture rate is highest this was further explored by roy et al 2021 for the specific context of covid 19 related floating waste they found that the structure design can influence the surface streamflow dynamics affecting how waste can be channelled into a collection device or how it could potentially bypass the boom structure particularly in the case of configurations that only partially cross the river width yet based on their study it was not possible to observe significant differences between the trapping efficiencies of different structures for the plastic types investigated the authors also noted that plastic items may slip under the boom structures during periods of high flow roy et al 2021 further methods testing should specifically assess the capture rate of different boom structures under different deployment conditions this includes the maximum working conditions in terms of the maximum flow rate or maximum working load i e the maximum amount of floating debris that can be retained by the boom and how this changes over time e g as the boom fills up the influence of high flow conditions should also be further studied for example the thresholds above which plastics could pass over or under the boom structure and be lost the retention capacity of the boom as it nears full capacity should also be investigated as this could set important guidelines for the duration of deployment as booms are typically deployed over longer time periods the variability in flow conditions in this time should be accounted for within the final measurement for example the potential losses that may have occurred whilst the boom was in operation this information can transform the data from the deployment of a boom into a number that represents a known proportion of the riverine macroplastic load over a given timescale one further aspect relates to the potential for non plastic material to complicate measurements much of the debris collected by a boom may be non plastic in composition gasperi et al 2014 found that 92 0 99 1 of the mass of debris collected by a network of 26 booms on the seine river in paris was vegetal where the percentage of plastic ranged between just 0 8 and 5 1 such sample composition introduces new challenges for the isolation of the plastic component particularly for smaller particles sizes and handling of waste in terms of personnel requirements and infrastructure for removing the sorted debris this should form the basis of further study to help identify the optimal conditions for boom deployment and interpretation of results 2 2 3 waste collection activities riverine macroplastic flows may also be measured using data from waste collection activities which include both litter clean up actions from the river channel banks or beaches and operations linked for example to the maintenance of gauges or dams or dredging activities litter clean up was utilised by lahens et al 2018 for the saigon river in vietnam and bauer civiello et al 2019 for the ross river in australia table s6 as an approach to estimate riverine macroplastic transport both studies manually cleared floating debris from the water surface lahens et al 2018 used data from a public clean up company that employ nets with 2 cm mesh towed from the side of boats to clear 0 10 cm depth of debris in channels with slow moving water five subsamples were taken from the total load to assess the composition bauer civiello et al 2019 instead present data from complete clearance by hand by 2 3 people on kayaks of a defined sampling area utilisation of waste collected data as a method for measuring macroplastic flows hinges upon the successful harmonisation of data collection and reporting standard data collection forms should be developed in parallel with the delivery of training or development of detailed protocols to describe how macroplastic data should be collected and reported this include details such as i the spatial extent that was covered during the clean up activity ii an estimate of the total capture rate of the activity iii basic river morphological and hydrological data to enable scaling for total flow assessment iv the time elapsed since any previous clean up activities v the approaches to categorising macroplastic and separating plastic from other waste types and vi how to report macroplastic counts or weights 2 3 other approaches in addition to the methods identified during the critical review of studies table s1 other approaches could also serve as a means for measuring macroplastic flows as part of monitoring activities remote sensing has been proposed as a promising new approach to observation based monitoring although the spatial resolution may be too coarse to detect small macroplastics unless they are accumulated or entrapped in vegetation patches for example al zawaidah et al 2021 schreyers et al 2021b tasseron et al 2021 trash racks a coarse screen or gridded cage that is placed across a channel to catch large debris represent a relatively common form of riverine infrastructure that is used to capture litter carleton and nielsen 1990 several other devices have also been specifically designed for the purpose of intercepting plastics in river or estuarine systems helinski et al 2021 these techniques could theoretically be adapted to provide measurements of macroplastic flows in a similar way as has already been done for booms or waste collection activities such adaptations should be accompanied by a process of method testing and validation to ascertain what such a method can accurately measure and any associated thresholds or limitations the selection of methodological approach es to be included in a given study should be based on the specific objectives of the study a consideration of the local environmental context a clear definition of what constitutes macroplastic pollution in the study and the outcome of methods testing and validation related to an understanding of what each method is capable of measuring in addition to this more general selection criteria could include the time and cost efficiency of methods 3 towards a holistic assessment of riverine macroplastic flows 3 1 measuring total macroplastic flux there are some scenarios in which the total macroplastic flux could be discerned using a single approach for example if the visibility is very good and observation based methods can be used to view all plastics flowing in the river or if the water level is low paired with low flow velocities or plastic loads and a physical interception technique can safely isolate plastics from the whole river cross section however these descriptions do not marry well with the realities of most river systems globally in more complex settings no single measurement can be taken to assess the total macroplastic flux instead it is more common to combine multiple techniques or deployments e g haberstroh et al 2020 van emmerik et al 2018 and or undertake statistical extrapolations to upscale measured values e g taryono et al 2020 van emmerik et al 2019b this creates an urgent need to understand exactly what fraction of the total macroplastic load each method can sample both theoretically through method testing and validation exercises and practically as part of a qa qc procedure such efforts can improve the accuracy of estimates of the total macroplastic flux in rivers not covered in this review methods for assessing macroplastic concentrations in other parts of the river system should also be developed and optimised van emmerik et al 2022a this includes establishing the storage of macroplastic on the riverbed in riverbanks or floodplain environments and in riparian vegetation liro et al 2020 it should be noted that many of these environments are subject to discharge conditions for example during flood events and macroplastic stored in these zones may be introduced to or resume active transport in the river channel the methods required to measure stores of macroplastic in the river system differ from those used to assess active flows and as such should be addressed in further review and critical evaluation an important goal of such work should be to identify opportunities to report data in units that can be combined with outputs from different methods data on riverine macroplastic storage should be combined with measurements of flows to establish a more holistic perspective of riverine macroplastic dynamics and provide more accurate flux calculations as well as shed light on the processes that govern the partitioning between different components of the river 3 2 quantifying variabilities thus far the majority of studies of riverine macroplastic flows have concentrated on two main geographic regions europe and south east asia fig 1 whilst there is significant variability in catchment characteristics hydrogeomorphology and flow regimes within these regions the uneven geographic distribution of study sites thus far may omit additional unique challenges elsewhere in the world where current methods may be unsuited for macroplastic monitoring some examples include anastomosing or braided channels or ephemeral streams methods that can be applied in a wide variety of settings can ease efforts towards harmonisation optimisation of methods should prioritise approaches that have greater geographic applicability and do not preclude use in globally important river channel types or flow regimes this is also relevant on a finer scale where methods should be adaptable to different river environments within regions or catchments for example with differing river widths tidal effect flow velocity variation anthropogenic modification or activity extent of vegetation or with different geomorphological profiles gonzález et al 2016 any specific factors which rule out the deployment of different methods in different settings should be evaluated to help identify study sites within regions or catchments which represent the optimum locations for undertaking sampling understanding spatiotemporal variability in macroplastic flows forms a key focus within ongoing monitoring and research several studies have together begun to identify some important trends for example the occurrence of higher macroplastic flows during wet seasons or flood events roebroek et al 2021 van calcar and van emmerik 2019 there are also additional factors which may impart an important control on macroplastic flows that remain poorly understood roebroek et al 2022 the variability across short term temporal scales such as day night cycles the occurrence of a first flush response during flooding or the dynamics of macroplastic accumulation and flushing associated with ephemeral streams represent three such examples related to temporal variability vriend et al 2020b point out that rivers typically exhibit a unique plastic footprint which is tied to spatial and temporal trends in source dynamics and fate and transport processes understanding the variability in macroplastic typologies across time and space is essential for tailoring and refining policy instruments or remediation actions to reduce riverine pollution for example more data on the spatial variability of macroplastic within a river system could help to identify plastic sources and identify hotspots associated with potential risks posed by macroplastic pollution such as interaction with organisms impacts on amenities or impact on flood risk consideration and where possible quantification of uncertainties is also critical to better understand macroplastic riverine flows and how they vary across space and time for example high flow events have been highlighted as periods of increased macroplastic transport due to the greater connectivity with land based sources to rivers and flushing of plastic stored in the catchment as a result of increased surface runoff and discharge roebroek et al 2022 yet these events also impose additional challenges to effectively monitor macroplastic in rivers due to safety aspects higher flow velocities and increased turbulence and or turbidity that can affect visibility as such there is a current lack of data globally to effectively measure macroplastic fluxes across an entire hydrograph and in different local environmental contexts model estimates provide some preliminary data to quantify the potential magnitude of flood events on macroplastic flows roebroek et al 2022 further research is now needed to refine these estimates using monitoring and experimental investigations to more accurately assess the errors associated with riverine macroplastic data 3 3 fate and transport of riverine macroplastic 3 3 1 fate and transport processes the majority of studies conducted thus far concentrate on how much macroplastic moves through rivers rather than the transport dynamics that govern this movement newbould 2021 no clear pattern related to density size or morphology has emerged in the current evidence to detail specifically how these factors influence the way in which macroplastic debris moves through riverine environments yet there are indications that they represent important controls on how plastic is transported for example several studies point towards the dominance of the floating component of riverine macroplastic e g haberstroh et al 2021 van emmerik et al 2019b 2019a however in other river systems a more complex pattern of transport has been observed throughout the river cross section including dominant flows at greater depths e g broere et al 2021 haberstroh et al 2020 in studies of macroplastic flows in rivers movement of the litter is implicit yet this is often not the case several papers report that plastic litter follows a complicated journey lechthaler et al 2020 liro et al 2020 newbould et al 2021 schreyers et al 2021a van emmerik et al 2022a williams and simmons 1997 transport of litter is discontinuous and stranding in sediments vegetation or turbulent eddies is common and can occur repeatedly and for varying durations as a plastic item travels downstream cesarini and scalici 2022 schreyers et al 2021a williams and simmons 1997 characteristics such as size morphology and density play an important role in controlling this temporary trapping or deposition and the thresholds for remobilisation williams and simmons 1997 but this has not yet been specifically established for a range of different litter types the spatial and temporal scales over which these processes operate are also essentially unknown this complexity is highly relevant when designing sampling programmes and interpreting results plastic flows in the river may reflect source dynamics proximity magnitude of release etc but they are also a net result of the processes that facilitate transport or remobilisation studies utilising plastic litter tracers that are representative of a range of different sizes shapes and polymer composition are needed to support monitoring and modelling assessments to better quantify and predict the movement of plastic in rivers this has been performed for plastic bottles duncan et al 2020 newbould 2021 tramoy et al 2020a and plastic films and sanitary products williams and simmons 1997 but more knowledge is needed regarding the fate of different items including those that represent the most abundant types in river systems 3 3 2 riverine discharges of plastic to the ocean there is often an assumption that all plastic that is released into rivers eventually reaches the marine environment in some cases rivers are described as conduits for plastic to the ocean with the implication that they represent smooth pipelines delivering plastic along their course however this does not account for the high level of complexity inherent in riverine environments the global diversity in catchment characteristics hydrology and fluvial geomorphology and the inherent and variable characteristics of macroplastics affecting transport efficiency kallenbach et al 2021 the time at which a macroplastic item that is inputted into a river could be expected to theoretically be released into the marine environment remains a persistent knowledge gap this gap has the potential to undermine estimates of plastic release to the marine environment that utilise for example waste mis management data or quantify specific sources to rivers in fact there is now increasing evidence that substantially less than 100 of the plastic that enters a river is released into the ocean van emmerik et al 2022a this was initially observed as a marked discrepancy between estimates for plastic emissions based on waste mis management data versus the results from monitoring activities revealing a difference of up to 98 5 meijer et al 2021 van emmerik et al 2019a the potential for macroplastic to enter temporary sinks within river catchments has already been stated an additional factor includes the removal of plastic through pollution remediation efforts e g sidek et al 2016 although data on the total volumes collected or the efficacy of different technologies remains sparse helinski et al 2021 on the other hand the extent to which discrepancies between measured and estimated values could be explained by for example the accuracy of estimates of mismanaged waste item to mass conversions model uncertainties or the difficulties associated with accurately measuring macroplastic emissions during flood events remains unknown roebroek et al 2022 this issue is also confounded by the influence of estuarine environments estuaries represent complex and dynamic systems that sit at the interface of riverine and marine environments practically measuring flows of macroplastic in these settings introduces an additional level of complexity compared to riverine methods and it has been recommended to focus on downstream sections of the main river channel to overcome this issue gonzález et al 2016 movement within the estuarine environment is complicated by factors such as bidirectional flow dynamics tramoy et al 2020a van emmerik et al 2020b which can also bring marine derived plastic litter upstream ryan and perold 2021 and salinity gradients which can affect the transport of macroplastics estuarine beaches and vegetated areas such as mangroves represent sinks for macroplastic do sul et al 2014 gonçalves et al 2020 with residence times in the order of several decades tramoy et al 2020b the fate of plastic entering estuarine environments remains a persistent knowledge gap dris et al 2020 based on this measurements of macroplastic flux taken in the downstream zone of a river may not represent the actual emission to the ocean van emmerik et al 2020b the role of estuaries as macroplastic sinks requires further scrutiny to better establish the fate of riverine macroplastic debris and its potential for release into the oceans across different temporal scales schernewski et al 2021 4 optimising monitoring data 4 1 harmonisation of data collection and reporting harmonisation is a necessary task to facilitate comparability and interoperability of data generated in different studies and different geographical contexts this applies to both the method s used and the way in which data is collected and reported a hindrance to harmonisation efforts include the lack of detail in reporting methodological parameters and results future studies should aim to converge methods and data reporting for example standard data collection forms should be generated in parallel with the delivery of training or the development of detailed protocols to describe how macroplastic should be quantified and categorised and how data should be reported mobile applications such as crowdwater tasseron et al 2020 van emmerik et al 2020a or the floating litter monitoring app gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 have been developed with this goal flexibility is still important especially given that rivers often present a unique plastic footprint vriend et al 2020b but this should be nested within broader standardised categories to allow for interoperability standardisation of the definitions for macroplastic sizes and types and methods for establishing the quantity number weight is important reporting units should also be addressed within the context of riverine macroplastic pollution several different units have been used to quantify macroplastic fluxes thus far many of which are not comparable exemplified in table s7 where possible studies should report in multiple units to assist in harmonisation efforts and facilitate wider utilisation of data outputs for example reporting totals relative to river discharge or time to further improve the potential for comparing between datasets or even datapoints reporting in units that account for additional factors should be considered for example reporting data in a way that accounts for the width of the river at a site or the total discharge can help to avoid drawing false conclusions when comparing two sites that have different characteristics even within the same study some monitoring methods typically observation based approaches generate data in the form of counts for establishing policy and regulations mass based data may be the preferred option this has already been recognised by some researchers who have used a combination of approaches to help establish a conversion van emmerik et al 2018 or applied an assumed conversion factor castro jiménez et al 2019 kataoka and nihei 2020 the need for data in particular forms may dictate what is the most suitable monitoring method for a given study and this detail should form part of the ongoing optimisation of monitoring methods to facilitate data reporting and interpretation of results additional parameters associated with practical measurements must also be recorded table 1 presents a summary of different details related to the method and the environmental conditions that represent critical information for interpreting and contextualising macroplastic data for example it is important to record the flow velocity in the river alongside each plastic measurement that is taken changes in velocity even on short temporal scales can affect the number of plastic items flowing past a measurement point and it therefore represents a useful parameter for interpreting results it can be measured using different techniques such as with flow meters or the simpler pooh sticks approach moss et al 2021 alternatively monitoring could be conducted in locations where routine hydrological monitoring is already undertaken such as close to gauging stations many studies do not provide important variables that can affect the interpretation of results tables s2 s6 such as the lower size limit detected the visibility conditions the location and duration of net deployment in the river cross section and the proportion of the total river cross section that each measurement relates to this further hinders the potential for harmonisation as it becomes more difficult to account for potential differences in methods or compare results future monitoring should report measurement parameters and environmental conditions as a standard requirement of the data reporting several studies report macroplastic data with reference to the polymer type e g lahens et al 2018 van calcar and van emmerik 2019 van emmerik et al 2018 a standardised approach is needed to ensure that categorisation by composition is undertaken in a verifiable or reproducible manner for example the astm international resin identification coding system represents a useful resource in this case e g blettler et al 2019 although a physical interception based method is needed to facilitate inspection for such codes and in some cases degradation may lead to a loss of this information many studies report polymer type based on the function of the litter item for example plastic bottles are recorded as polyethylene terephthalate pet data generated through this approach should indicate the potential for uncertainty here based on the diversity of polymer types used for some applications to facilitate harmonised data collection and reproducible results a standardised set of polymer categories with explicit definitions should be established this should aim to increase the convertibility of existing categorisation lists to translate item or polymer based information vriend et al 2020a specific polymeric data if analysed experimentally such as with infrared spectroscopy techniques should be collected and verified using validated methods reference libraries or library search algorithms should be used to confirm polymer type and minimum requirements for data reporting should be observed 4 2 tailoring methodologies to different data applications 4 2 1 estimates of riverine emission to the ocean establishing the release of macroplastics from a river is an important goal for many monitoring campaigns this is linked to a strong marine focus in the plastic pollution domain and is often in response to modelling studies that report substantial releases of plastics from many river catchments globally e g lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 schmidt et al 2017 yet there are several potential shortcomings inherent to flux estimates calculated from monitoring data section 3 3 2 namely they may not represent real releases to the marine environment for example by overlooking macroplastic sequestration in rivers or estuaries this matter aside efforts to tailor monitoring activities for the purpose of calculating estimates should focus on increasing the accuracy and representativeness of data generated the data should represent where possible the full river cross section and account for temporal variability selecting a location that is furthest downstream will generate an estimate that is closest to reality although this introduces challenges associated with handling tidal influence finally efforts should be paid towards harmonising how flux estimates are reported at present several different approaches to describe release have been presented in the literature table s7 undermining potential comparability selected units should conform to the resolution of the monitoring data for example data from a short temporal frame will render a high level of uncertainty in annual scale estimates reporting in multiple units may enhance the utilisation of flux estimates for different purposes 4 2 2 hydrological models riverine macroplastic modelling studies thus far have focused on upscaling estimates of plastic masses emitted from land to sea at the catchment national or global scale lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 sakti et al 2021 schmidt et al 2017 these have utilised data sources related to waste management practices consumption patterns land use or population density and catchment characteristics to generate outputs the resolution of models and the description of riverine macroplastic transport mechanisms can be further improved by focusing on processes occurring within the catchment to predict inputs and transport of plastic of different types such as the hydrological models established for micro and nanoplastics e g besseling et al 2017 nizzetto et al 2016 for hydrological models macroplastic monitoring data mainly mass based is needed to validate outputs ideally the resolution of the data should fit with the model frame and it is important to establish what the monitoring data represents i e what the selected method was able to accurately measure thus quality controlled data from validated methods are preferable monitoring campaigns that encompass both spatial and temporal variability are needed to improve the accuracy of models in particular monitoring efforts should span a range of representative hydrological conditions including hot spots and hot moments e g capturing flush effects when estimating seasonal or annual emissions additional insights into quantified inputs of plastics across space and time partitioning of plastic of different typologies in different components of the river system and dominant fate and transport processes represent critical data to parameterise models particularly at the catchment scale plastic typologies relevant for modelling purposes do not necessarily fit with those relevant to other applications while shape size and polymer are common and relevant characteristics degree of buoyancy is often lacking despite its control on transport processes and settling likelihood kooi et al 2018 hence reporting data from the water surface and below as well as ancillary information on net deployment depth and degree of submersion becomes essential 4 2 3 policy and governance governments worldwide have recognised plastic pollution as an urgent environmental social and political issue rognerud et al 2021 national and international regulations have already been proposed particularly for some components of the problem such as single use plastics e g patrício silva et al 2020 sun et al 2021 syberg et al 2018 at the resumed session of unea 5 175 countries endorsed a historic resolution to start the negotiations of a legally binding agreement on plastic pollution high modelled plastic emissions occur at the intersection of i increasing economic prosperity and material consumption and ii inadequate regulation or mis management of waste the collection analysis and reporting of plastic data detected in various environmental compartments is an essential source of information for developing targeted and efficient policies in all countries van emmerik et al 2022b however government action is also dependant on other data such as technological innovation policy assessments and the existence of less harmful or environmentally sustainable alternatives of particular importance to policy and governance is establishing the scale of the problem its origin or temporal frame the behaviour of the problem its impacts and interlinkages with other pressures data that can help to highlight potential solutions or evaluate the impact of mitigation or remediation actions are also relevant monitoring data tailored towards policy and governance should include typical descriptors of the debris such as the category of plastic or polymer type mass based data is typically preferred in the context of setting regulations additional identifying information such as brand name or provenance data can also be useful in identifying specific sources or release pathways that could be targeted through policy additional ancillary data includes anthropogenic factors such as waste management systems consumption patterns or cultural events occurring in spatial or temporal proximity to the sampling which can help to better understand observed plastic fluxes table 1 extending beyond the frame of a single study achieving harmonisation in riverine macroplastic monitoring globally is a critical task for setting appropriate well framed and realistic policy instruments ensuring comparability assessing the impact of concerted action and sharing of best practices and technological advances as the unea 5 2 resolution indicates a global legally binding agreement is expected to materialise in 2024 the agreement may include an effectiveness evaluation requirement for the parties of the agreement which requires time series of comparable data of plastic flux to prove the effectiveness of the measures taken by the parties this stresses the need for coherent standards definitions and a harmonised monitoring system across the different geographic locations in the world the current limited comparability between datasets represents a major hindrance promoting international collaboration on defining criteria converging methods towards interoperability and setting guidelines for data collection and reporting should represent important priorities for academics and policy makers alike 5 conclusions riverine macroplastic monitoring has already revealed numerous important findings this includes the scale of pollution in different regions dominant sources of plastic to river environments the role of seasonality and source dynamics in governing observed concentrations and indications of several fate and transport processes relevant for understanding how plastic waste moves through the environment yet the lack of comparability between several reported data from different studies sets limitations that prevent concrete conclusions from being drawn expanding upon the testing of methods undertaking method validation implementing qa qc protocols in sampling and reaching agreements internationally to set standards for harmonisation are urgently needed to progress in this arena this critical review has highlighted several opportunities for achieving this aim by reviewing the current utilisation of different methods aspects that require further testing have been identified in many cases this relates to better understanding the thresholds or limits of a given method this should be paired with qa qc procedures which will help to elucidate the suitability reliability and consistency of each methodology beyond this each monitoring study should understand what exactly is being measured and what the obtained data can reliably reveal similar effort directed towards stranded or sequestered plastics in riverine or estuarine settings is also needed a topic which was outside the scope of this present review fewer studies have investigated freshwater plastic sinks than flows of plastic litter yet this presents a crucial opportunity to harmonise methods before several different and potentially poorly comparable approaches emerge understanding the mechanisms and scales associated with the accumulation of plastic in freshwater environments is critical to gain a holistic perspective of plastic pollution accumulation zones may represent ideal sites to intercept pollution and target clean up actions plastic accumulation may be dependant on factors such as macroplastic size buoyancy or morphology therefore surveys that sample plastic flowing out from a river may underestimate a significant source of plastic to rivers that is preferentially retained due to its characteristics harmonisation is an ongoing task decisions need to be made internationally to set defining criteria and research priorities however early progress can be made towards the goal of harmonisation by facilitating comparability wherever possible practically this refers to undertaking qa qc during sampling and data analysis reporting data in multiple units or forms and providing ancillary data to enable effective interpretation of the data this should keep in mind the potential utilisation of data beyond the primary goal of the study and reporting should facilitate this where possible riverine macroplastic research is at a critical early stage establishing quality and harmonisation as a priority now will facilitate the collection of rigorous and comparable data from ongoing and future monitoring efforts this will provide essential information to help frame local national and international solutions to limit pollution and its associated impacts a legally binding global agreement on plastic pollution will emerge by 2024 and thereafter countries will prepare for ratification and implementation this imposes a time pressure on further advancing this field of research establishing a consensus on harmonised monitoring standards for riverine

14853,river systems are a key environmental recipient of macroplastic pollution understanding the sources of macroplastic to rivers and the mechanisms controlling fate and transport is essential to identify and tailor measures that can effectively reduce global plastic pollution several guidelines exist for monitoring macroplastic in rivers yet no single method has emerged representing the standard approach this reflects the substantial variability in river systems globally and the need to adapt methods to the local environmental context and monitoring goals here we present a critical review of methods used to measure macroplastic flows in rivers with a specific focus on opportunities for methods testing harmonisation and quality assurance and quality control qa qc several studies have already revealed important findings however there is significant disparity in the reporting of methodologies and data there is a need to converge methods and their adaptations towards greater comparability this can be achieved through i methods testing to better understand what each method effectively measures and how it can be applied in different contexts ii incorporating qa qc procedures during sampling and analysis and iii reporting methodological details and data in a more harmonised way to facilitate comparability and the utilisation of data by several end users including policy makers setting this as a priority now will facilitate the collection of rigorous and comparable monitoring data to help frame solutions to limit plastic pollution including the forthcoming global treaty on plastic pollution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic litter river monitoring harmonisation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction plastic debris is now well established as a global pollutant in the environment its occurrence can extend across a wide size spectrum from several meters down to the nanometre scale where macroplastic refers to the larger tangible pieces of plastic litter there remains a lack of internationally accepted definitions on what is included within the term plastic pollution such as size boundaries or relevant material compositions that are considered to be plastic hartmann et al 2019 however macroplastic typically includes plastic items down to a few centimetre in size e g 2 5 cm gonzález et al 2016 and may comprise common plastics such as polyethylene or polypropylene as well as bio based or biodegradable polymer types as such macroplastic pollution is typically characterised as a heterogeneous assemblage of plastic waste items exhibiting a range of properties that exert variable influence on fate and possible risks several modelling studies point to river systems as a key environmental recipient of plastic and an important pathway to other environments including wetlands lakes estuaries coastal ecosystems and the oceans e g lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 schmidt et al 2017 macroplastic pollution in river systems is a cause for concern as it can interact with organisms increase flood risk reduce amenity value and fragment into microplastics al zawaidah et al 2021 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 lechthaler et al 2020 understanding the sources of plastic to rivers and the mechanisms controlling riverine transport efficiency is key to identify measures that can effectively reduce pollution such as source control clean up technologies and shoreline riverine infrastructure designs black et al 2019 rochman 2018 by mass macroplastic represents the dominant component of river plastic pollution mai et al 2020 yet riverine macroplastic monitoring activities are hindered by lack of consolidated methodologies van emmerik and schwarz 2020 emphasising the urgency 175 countries endorsed a historic resolution at the un environment assembly unea 5 2 aiming at developing a legally binding agreement on plastic pollution by 2024 understanding the sources and riverine loadings of plastic pollution is instrumental for both the design and the implementation of the policy rognerud et al 2023 currently riverine plastic loading estimations are conducted with non validated coarse model frameworks e g lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 schmidt et al 2017 field data are required to consolidate these estimates and assess the future success of policy implementation developments in monitoring design including the coordination of monitoring activities and their methodological approach are central to success for this goal the majority of riverine macroplastic studies specifically aim to quantify the movement of plastic waste in the river channel thirty nine published studies have measured macroplastic flows in rivers globally within the scope of this review fig 1 utilising five main methodological approaches table s1 these methods can be divided into observation based and physical interception based techniques observation based sampling refers to the surveillance quantification and categorisation of macroplastic that is visible in the river without collecting the detected items whilst physical interception based sampling instead involves the active entrapment and collection of macroplastic from the river for the quantification and categorisation step there is significant variability in the methodological approaches adopted in existing published studies this includes discrepancies in the specific conditions of method deployment as well as the specific component of the total macroplastic load that is measured for example floating versus submerged items thus hampering the potential to compare between datasets globally winton et al 2020 several guidelines have been developed that describe and promote different methods for analysing riverine macroplastic e g barnardo and ribbink 2020 gonzález et al 2016 gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 miliute plepiene et al 2018 unep 2020 yet no single method has emerged representing the standard van emmerik and schwarz 2020 this reflects the difficulties in establishing a global one size fits all approach for all river systems and monitoring goals there is significant variability in river hydrology and geomorphology across the world macroplastics also vary considerably in size morphology and other physical properties where there is a current lack of harmonisation regarding this characterisation these differences will require substantial improvements adaptations or even the development of entirely new approaches to accurately assess macroplastic pollution in rivers globally better understanding plastic fluxes in a range of different fluvial settings is important meijer et al 2021 demonstrated that over 1000 rivers account for 80 of global plastic release to the oceans so targeting action on a small number of catchments may not be sufficient to tackle global plastic contamination moreover according to the same study more than 98 5 of the total mismanaged waste is not transported into the sea and remains within river catchments monitoring is therefore crucial to better understand the fate of plastic waste in rivers there is in addition a wide range of different operational objectives connected to riverine macroplastic monitoring linked to for instance assessments of plastic inputs e g recharge or affluent points loading flows e g baseline vs high flow assessments focused vs time aggregated observations etc or accumulations in specific parts of a river e g sediment bed bank riparian vegetation etc unep 2020 van emmerik et al 2022b different monitoring foci require different solutions and may necessitate the collection of data in different forms no single method is capable of measuring the total macroplastic load for all riverine settings in a single deployment instead methods are capable of characterising specific fractions defined by size buoyancy behaviour or other characteristics which must be interpreted or combined with other measurements to obtain a more complete picture of plastic contamination in a given catchment herein lies the importance of establishing well defined frames and methods with due consideration for what they are capable of accurately measuring and what the generated data can inform about plastic pollution across different spatial and temporal scales for these reasons harmonisation of methods is likely to be more important than standardisation in this context harmonisation can be defined as an effort to achieve cross comparability and interoperability in data outputs from different surveys operationally harmonisation includes an initial recognition and explanation of potential differences between datasets and the definition of a set of tools enabling conversions for comparability or interoperability harmonisation can be achieved through method testing validation and quality assurance and control qa qc respectively these actions can clearly define the limits thresholds and optimal deployment of a method methods testing establish the precision and accuracy validation and ensure data quality comparability and interoperability qa qc harmonisation of data reporting is also important the present paper critically reviews the methods adopted by published studies of macroplastic flows in river systems this refers to macroplastic actively transported in the river channel and does not include a review of methods to measure stocks or temporary stores of plastic within or along the river through this the aim is to support ongoing international policy processes such as the proposed global agreement on plastic unep ea 5 res 14 by identifying priority knowledge gaps related to method development and optimisation and defining opportunities for method testing validation and harmonisation that will facilitate a convergence of existing approaches the different applications of riverine macroplastic data are also considered to further optimise methods towards providing data that can be used by a wide range of end users including policymakers 2 measuring riverine macroplastic flows a total of 39 studies were identified as part of the critical method review for this paper following a systematic approach a full description of the review methodology is provided in the supplementary information briefly a series of boolean search strings were used for web of knowledge sciencedirect and google scholar to identify relevant papers which were further assessed based on the following criteria 1 a specific macroplastic focus 2 reporting of measurements of active macroplastic transport under field conditions and in river systems and 3 publication of data and methods in peer reviewed literature or technical reports the final list of 39 studies identified utilise five main methodological approaches which are depicted in fig 2 a e in the following sections each method will be evaluated with regard to ongoing needs for method testing and opportunities for validation and harmonisation 2 1 observations of riverine macroplastic 2 1 1 visual observation visual observation is the most commonly utilised technique for measuring macroplastic flows in rivers 17 out of 39 publications table s1 briefly human analyst s observe and record the visible macroplastic load passing a cross section of the river channel or a portion of it during a predefined measurement period a prerequisite is the availability of a vantage point for viewing the river this is typically a bridge or other infrastructure that passes over the river but surveys can also be performed from the riverbank for narrower streams e g crosti et al 2018 tasseron et al 2020 visual observation is therefore limited to locations where such a vantage point exists and can be safely accessed van emmerik et al 2020b in wider channels it will not be possible to observe the full width of the river from a single point and in this case it is necessary to define a cross section portion or observation track that represents a proportion of the river width gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 van emmerik et al 2018 recommends dividing the channel cross section into several portions and observing each of these for a measurement period that allows all defined portions to be observed in under one hour termed a sweep deemed to be a time lag where stream conditions will be relatively stationary where the full river width cannot be monitored within an appropriate time window the results from the measured portions will be extrapolated to the full river width to estimate total transport an appropriate portion width will depend on a number of factors for example vantage point height flow velocity plastic load and weather conditions some guidelines recommend that analysts face upstream to obtain a better view of arriving litter items e g gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 however several studies have also opted to view downstream in response to the specific environmental setting such as to avoid sun glare table s2 commonly a minimum of two analysts are required to perform this task one to observe the river and the other to record the data although this will depend on the plastic flux and flow velocity all macroplastic items that are observed during the measurement period are recorded additional categorisation of observed macroplastic can range from no categorisation to polymer category e g van calcar and van emmerik 2019 or item specific categorisation e g gonzález fernández et al 2021 the visual observation method allows for the rapid and inexpensive collection of data without the need for specialised equipment extensive training or permits this can facilitate the generation of several datapoints covering a range of spatial and temporal scales representing an important asset of this technique however this method is not capable of assessing the total riverine macroplastic load but only items visible from a position above the surface it also presents limitations or challenges that need to be carefully acknowledged and addressed these are selection of cross sectional spatial resolution of observations the optimum river cross section dimensions that can be reliably observed by a single analyst or team under a range of flow and plastic load conditions should be assessed this is likely to vary case by case and in relation to the contingent river flow conditions this includes an investigation into the upper thresholds for flow velocity and total plastic loads in cases where the total plastic flowing past the observation portion becomes too high it is no longer possible to reliably record and categorise all macroplastic items geraeds et al 2019 van emmerik et al 2018 moreover turbulent flows particularly in highly turbid rivers can potentially reduce the proportion of the total macroplastic load that can be reliably observed in this case river currents may drag buoyant plastic items below the river surface and out of the visible range hence the visual observation method is likely to be more challenging to accurately measure and categorise plastic flows during flood conditions or during periods of high suspended sediment load single observer cross sectional portions range from 2 5 to 65 m in width table s2 this factor can affect the lower size limit of macroplastic that can be identified for example schöneich argent et al 2020 selected a maximum 20 m segment width for their analysis of three german rivers as this facilitated assessment of 2 2 5 cm particles under different light and weather conditions additionally castro jiménez et al 2019 noted that whilst 2 5 cm particles could be identified directly below their selected vantage point only 7 cm particles could be reliably detected at the distal edges of their 65 m segments in the rhone river the use of cross sectional portions to facilitate visual observation can also have an impact on the representativeness of the data generated many studies do not visually observe the full river width and in some cases the portion s observed may represent 1 of the river width at the site in question table s2 this can create problems when extrapolating observation results to the full river cross section e g in connection with the statistical representativeness of the observations which is a function of the total density of visible floating items the percentage of the total cross section covered by the observers and the cross sectional distribution of plastic items turbulence and stream velocity method testing and validation exercises for example using tracers and measurement standards newbould 2021 or video footage van lieshout et al 2020 would help to establish what conditions facilitate effective measurement of riverine macroplastic e g bridge height and lower size limit and what the minimum requirements are for achieving accurate and representative measurements of macroplastic flows e g proportion of channel width measured or need for replication elevation of the observation point from water surface the distance of the observer from the water surface will also influence the lower size limit that can be reliably observed and the selection of the cross sectional domain covered by each observer reported vantage point heights vary between 0 5 and 20 m table s2 method testing should assess the realistic lower size limit for a range of vantage point heights to establish what can be defined as a suitable site for visual observation based monitoring this could be performed using items of a known size that are released upstream or by running the visual observation method in parallel with a physical interception technique to verify what was present in the water and was successfully detected van emmerik et al 2020a established a size limit of 1 cm for observation heights of up to 12 m when using human analysts a slightly different approach is outlined by gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 who recommend the selection of a monitoring site on the basis that it is possible to detect plastics 2 5 cm in size the latter facilitates more harmonised data collection but it is important to note that no such location may available in some river catchments incorporating data reporting in size bins may help to better compare between datasets with different minimum item sizes establishing an adequate lower observable size limit the lower observable size limit is in principle a function of the observer elevation and sensitivity the width of the cross sectional observation domains and stream flow it can be argued that lower observable item size is smaller than the lower size of items that can be reliably detected i e the lower size of quantifiable items because of the difficulty for a human operator to maintain an elevated level of attention over long observation periods and because different operators deployed along different cross sectional portions of the channel may have different sensitivities and concentration abilities the distinction between lowest detectable size and lowest size of quantifiable items is rarely discussed the lower size limit of plastics applied by the studies ranges across an order of magnitude from 0 5 to 5 cm table s2 this limits the potential for comparability between different studies using a common lower size limit or reporting in defined size categories could help to overcome this shortcoming however accurately assessing size when an item is in flux can be challenging for this measurement standards placed in line of sight may be needed unfortunately often the size limit is dictated by contingent aspects such as the elevation of the infrastructure e g a bridge river side etc used for the observations schöneich argent et al 2020 included an additional size category down to 0 5 cm to capture an important source of macroplastic litter cigarette butts that was detectable and below their initial lower size limit validating the accuracy of human analysts in detecting the lowermost sizes of macroplastic under a range of conditions is also necessary to ensure good data quality effective training of analysts is essential to avoid under reporting of some sizes classes of riverine macroplastic visibility depth vs channel depth the visibility of submerged plastics is likely to vary between monitoring sites and river catchments and in response to factors such as turbidity turbulence wind speed sun glare and the colour and size of the plastic items van emmerik et al 2018 the extent of visibility is only detailed in 5 out of 17 published studies table s2 and has been reported as 10 cm in the saigon river van emmerik et al 2018 manila rivers van emmerik et al 2020b and dutch canals tasseron et al 2020 and 20 cm in the seine van emmerik et al 2019c and klang rivers geraeds et al 2019 these studies do not report the total depth of the river so the proportion of the river that was observable cannot be discerned hindering the scaling of observations for the total water column depth in only very rare cases it may be possible to observe the total plastic load due to clear waters and very shallow rivers difficulties in accounting for variability in visibility represents a major challenge for harmonisation although reporting the visibility associated with each measurement along with the depth of the observed cross sections should represent a minimum data reporting requirement section 4 1 human error the potential for human error and bias should also be assessed within future methods testing and validation exercises geraeds et al 2019 vriend et al 2020b the time for a single measurement ranges from 1 to 63 min table s2 it is important to consider what is reasonable with regard to the concentration limit of a human analyst which will in turn be connected to the plastic load at a given site it may be preferable to take several short measurements in channels with a high flow velocity and or plastic load versus fewer longer measurements where the reliability of the human analyst s could be called into question the concept of fatigue has already been raised in other fields that rely on human observation based approaches e g rankin et al 2020 some studies report the use of binoculars to improve the confirmation of object identity e g crosti et al 2018 schirinzi et al 2020 weideman et al 2020 this may help to verify that a piece of debris is composed of plastic and what category it falls into although whilst using binoculars the field of view is significantly narrowed so they may not be suitable in circumstances where the plastic load is high or is spread across the river cross section moreover some particles may be preferentially under reported due to their characteristics for example being small in size or transparent vriend et al 2020b further validation tests to verify what can be reliably identified by human analysts under a range of conditions and for a range of plastic sizes and types are required to establish the real significance of these factors for generating accurate and reliable monitoring data and setting important thresholds in monitoring guidelines the influence of human error bias can be assessed and reduced by replicating e g two or more observers working independently from the same vantage point or randomising observations e g repeating observations by randomising the locations of individual observers in different cross sectional portions during consecutive sweeps using citizen science as a means to obtain larger datasets of visual observations for macroplastic flows has been discussed kiessling et al 2021 van emmerik et al 2020a this should consider the potential implications for data quality e g imprecise measurements human bias and balance the uncertainties of any given single reported measurement within a dataset for example problems associated with low motivation of citizen scientists has been reported for scenarios where plastic loads were low or the weather conditions were unfavourable kiessling et al 2021 based on the potential limitations set out for visual observation the extent to which citizen science represents the optimal use of this methodological approach should be explored this does not preclude the use of trained analysts for undertaking monitoring activities but through setting thorough monitoring and data reporting guidelines the uncertainties associated with visual observation data could be outweighed by the size of the datasets generated thus general trends could be more rapidly identified despite the potential lower quality of any single measurement within a citizen science generated dataset van emmerik et al 2020a the influence of the analyst as well as the environmental setting should be assessed routinely during the monitoring programme as part of a qa qc procedure this includes checks to evaluate i the total proportion of floating or visible macroplastic that is successfully recorded recovery rate for example through the use of dummy items intentionally released in the upstream ii the degree of variation in the categorisation of plastics between analysts iii the successful identification of litter items as plastic iv the successful categorisation of macroplastic litter items and v agreement between analysts regarding categorisation many of these factors can be assessed by running a parallel method which includes the physical interception of macroplastic such as the deployment of nets geraeds et al 2019 van emmerik et al 2019a 2019b 2 1 2 non human observation non human observation approaches follow a similar principle as for visual observation section 2 1 1 but replace human analysts with technological solutions current applications include the use of cameras kataoka and nihei 2020 onoi and nihei 2012 van lieshout et al 2020 and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs geraeds et al 2019 rocamora et al 2021 schreyers et al 2021a wolf et al 2020 as for the visual observation approach these methods are capable of assessing the visible macroplastic at the water surface namely what is floating and what is visible beneath the surface within a certain visibility depth relative to the optics and device used in addition sonar has been applied to detect below the water surface broere et al 2021 sensor assisted observations present many of the same limitations affecting human based observations but also offer some advantages similar to human based approaches turbidity and the distance from the water surface will define both the proportion of the total macroplastic load that can be recorded and the lower size limit that can be detected by a camera for example geraeds et al 2019 noted that macroplastic could no longer be classified at heights of 8 18 m above the water surface in the case of sonar echo sounding devices can permit observations of submerged including non visible plastics below the water surface broere et al 2021 however sonars cannot currently concretely discriminate whether a detected item is made of plastic or another material benefits of these techniques include the potential to measure over longer durations with high levels of consistency for example in the case of mounted cameras or in river reaches that are not easily accessible in the case of uavs they are able to handle higher plastic loads and flow velocities especially when footage can be replayed or the analysis is automated with the use of a visual processing algorithm geraeds et al 2019 kataoka and nihei 2020 although the influence of turbulent flow on the buoyancy and therefore visibility of plastics should be assessed if cameras are equipped with night vision capability then measurements of plastic flows during the night may be possible however in this case due to a potential different visibility depth a correction factor is necessary to harmonise data with day time observations it can also be possible to assess the size or 2d area of plastics with the use of a measurement reference or by registering deployment criteria e g height and angle to establish the spatial resolution geraeds et al 2019 rocamora et al 2021 image capture based methods can be limited by factors such as the file size of data outputs e g in the case of large video files or the battery life of devices geraeds et al 2019 the field of view i e the total area observed by the camera or uav etc will define the area of river that can be measured where the field of view is relatively small this may not cover the full width of the river and therefore may not assess the total visible floating and sub surface macroplastic load of the river in a single deployment this can be solved as for human based observations by considering well defined portions of the river cross section some technologies e g uavs are limited to quite specific weather conditions such as sufficiently low wind speeds or a lack of precipitation geraeds et al 2019 despite significant potential these approaches require testing and likely optimisation prior to routine deployment based on the limited application of these techniques thus far this includes testing what can be accurately detected with these technologies associated with different deployment conditions studies have already begun to compare human and technological approaches to plastic observation in rivers van lieshout et al 2020 found that 34 6 more plastic was detected when using a camera and visual processing algorithm than with human analysts in several jakarta rivers there was high variability associated with counts derived from both methods the camera and algorithm approach appeared to be better suited to handle high plastic loads where human observers were not able to count and classify as many items at the highest loadings however the study did not verify results with physical interception based sampling so it is difficult to conclude regarding the accuracy of each approach geraeds et al 2019 also recorded discrepancies between human and uav derived counts the potential for human analysts to be overwhelmed by high plastic loads and high flow velocities was observed however the occurrence of sun glints or shadows in uav images also lead to some classification errors using that technique validation and qa qc for non human observation approaches could be performed in a similar way to that for visual observation namely the deployment of a parallel physical interception sampling methodology to verify what proportion of total plastic is identified and assess the accuracy of item characterisation or facilitate assessment of mass conversions the efficacy of these techniques relies upon the quality and breadth of the training data for visual processing algorithms or the ability of human analysts to detect plastics in recorded images geraeds et al 2019 van lieshout et al 2020 this relates to the ability to reliably distinguish plastic items from other materials in the river an additional qa qc protocol should be put into place to confirm the quality of matches established ideally algorithms and associated training data should be provided as open source or made available through data code sharing platforms to allow for harmonisation in data collection where different programmes are used for different techniques facilitating interoperability should be a priority methods testing for these approaches should aim to identify the optimal range of working conditions as well as aspects related to the lower size limit of detection or the proportion of the river reach that can be studied additionally methods testing should address new and emerging technologies that can replace human analysts such as the potential use of underwater drones 2 2 physical interception of riverine macroplastic 2 2 1 nets nets comprise mesh screens or bags that are lowered into the water and used to intercept macroplastic that is flowing in the river fig 2c they are typically deployed from a fixed point such as a bridge but they may also be used from a boat e g haberstroh et al 2020 schöneich argent et al 2020 or from the riverbank or bed e g munari et al 2021 taryono et al 2020 nets can be utilised to measure floating sub surface or even benthic transport of macroplastic using buoys and weights to position them in the desired location within the water column e g moore et al 2011 morritt et al 2014 they can also be deployed in fleets several nets connected to the same frame to sample different parts of the water column simultaneously e g van emmerik et al 2019a 2019b nets are deployed for predefined measurement times or until the net becomes full or clogged with debris in published studies this ranges from 30 s to 3 days table s3 once the measurement period is over the nets are retrieved from the water the contents are then inspected to isolate count categorise and weigh the macroplastic component the use of nets represents the mostly commonly utilised physical interception based technique for measuring macroplastic flows table s1 the proportion of the total riverine macroplastic load captured by this method depends on the parameters of the net and its deployment first the size of the net opening aperture will determine both the proportion of the river cross section and the volume of water that can be sampled during the measurement period second the mesh size of the net establishes the lower size of plastic that is retained third the location and depth of deployment in the river cross section will define the transport pathway floating sub surface benthic that is assessed by this technique factors such as the selected mesh size the length of the net the flow velocity of the river and the total suspended load will also impact the length of the useful deployment time in a given environmental setting based on the clogging of the net harmonisation between these many factors is dependant upon a thorough description of the specific methodological details some studies do not report important criteria that can define what a given deployment specifically measured for example only six out of fifteen studies that deploy nets at the water surface describe the extent to which the nets were submerged in the water table s4 a factor which dictates the volume of water sampled and has potential implications for the sampling of floating macroplastic of different sizes minimum reporting requirements should form the basis of harmonised methods and this is addressed in more detail in section 4 1 the thresholds associated with the deployment of nets with different configurations and under different flow and plastic load conditions requires testing this testing will help to optimise the technique and ensure safe deployment in the field a submerged net produces drag a force with an orientation opposite to that of the water flow drag results in additional turbulence in water and the reduction of the downstream transport of plastic in the vicinity of the net mouth upstream this in turn lowers the likelihood that an item will be captured be the net drag and hence turbulence is linearly proportional to the stream flow velocity at low flow velocities while it increases quadratically at high flow velocities drag force also depends on the drag coefficient imposed by the geometry of the net which increases as the net accumulates material flow velocity immediately upstream of a clogged net can even approach zero rendering further sampling ineffective maintaining adequate control of operational conditions of nets with a given geometry and mesh and in given river conditions is therefore essential to enable quantitative and reliable assessments and comparable and interoperable data generation the selection of mesh size should also be considered for example weideman et al 2020 reported that flow velocities up to 3 m s 1 were manageable for a 0 6 0 3 m net with a 300 µm mesh set at the water surface in the orange vaal river system south africa under lower flow conditions reported as 0 002 m s 1 the presence of the net introduced turbulence that prevented some plastic items from entering the net and being captured the debris instead flowed around at higher velocities the potential for damaging the net increases and the drag force acting on the nets becomes too great for safe manual deployment and retrieval this was noted by geraeds et al 2019 who selected a 2 5 cm mesh to ensure safe deployment of a 0 67 0 67 m net in the klang river malaysia flow velocity between 0 5 and 1 m s 1 changes in one variable flow velocity mesh size deployment duration etc will affect other variables so this technique should be adapted to the specific research questions and conditions in the river this will determine the total length of time temporal scale that a single measurement can account for and the representativeness of the net as a sampling technique nets represent the second most commonly utilised technique for assessing macroplastic flows table s1 yet there is currently very little harmonisation between monitoring efforts that utilise this method for example only two studies use the same net configuration with regards to aperture mesh size degree of submersion for surface nets or depth location of deployment fig 3 haberstroh et al 2021 2020 given the lack of a standardised description of which nets are appropriate for macroplastic monitoring in different contexts it is likely that the choice of the net characteristics adopted in the different studies is at least partly contingent to what was locally available or had precedence in a research group it is unlikely that a single net configuration can be recommended for all rivers as several of the above mentioned factors are tailored to the conditions in the river instead method calibration aiming to define the operability window of a given net in a given environmental setting should proceed deployment results of such calibration should be presented along with monitoring results and constitute a set of parameters and knowledge to increase confidence in the comparability and interoperability of data rather than being based on a set of technical specifications standardisation in this area should be achieved through a shared set of quality criteria relative to pre calibration of the net operability a venue to achieve this type of standardisation could be through the deployment of nets in artificial flumes during ad hoc calibration experiments that aim to test what net parameters e g mesh size are optimal for different hydrological conditions and plastic loads this could provide model parameterisation to predict behaviours of macroplastic capturing devices under different conditions reduce calibration effort prior to monitoring and produce guidelines for the types of nets to be used in riverine macroplastic monitoring this should also comprise a quantitative assessment of the errors associated with net design and operation in addition harmonisation efforts should address the data collection and reporting to ensure that critical differences between studies are described and can be accounted for 2 2 2 booms booms are floating barriers that extend across all or part of the channel and collect buoyant debris including macroplastics as they accumulate at the water surface upstream fig 2d they are typically used as clean up or pollution prevention measures but may also be used as a sampling methodology by adding a procedure to isolate count categorise and weigh the macroplastic component of collected debris booms are emptied by carefully dragging the floating accumulation to the bank or other suitable location for retrieval some more advanced installations include automated collection for example by lifting debris from the water or directing it towards a collection container e g vriend et al 2020b booms may also include a mesh or screen that extends below the floating line to collect near surface debris flows vriend et al 2020b booms can measure the macroplastic load that is transported in the uppermost part of the water column across the full or partial river width depending on the nature of deployment for the duration of boom deployment if a net or screen is present below the floating component of the boom the coverage of the total cross section of course increases the mesh size used for this net screen will determine the lower size limit that can be captured from this near surface flow only six studies have thus far utilised booms as a sampling method table s5 all of these use structures that were already established as part of ongoing clean up or debris removal schemes before being used in monitoring it is notable that studies rarely report important criteria about the structure of the device or the parameters of any given measurement specifically this includes sparse reporting of the dimensions of the boom the presence of any mesh or screen the depth of the submerged part the rate at which the boom was emptied the proportion of the channel width intercepted by the boom or the capacity of the boom structure table s5 these represent crucial details for interpreting data derived from this methodological approach and the lack of reporting is a barrier to harmonisation without these details it is difficult to conclude on the efficacy of booms as a sampling method for measuring macroplastic flows in order to transform this approach into a validated sampling methodology methods testing is required for example malik et al 2020 established that this method is best suited to slower moving water as the capture rate is highest this was further explored by roy et al 2021 for the specific context of covid 19 related floating waste they found that the structure design can influence the surface streamflow dynamics affecting how waste can be channelled into a collection device or how it could potentially bypass the boom structure particularly in the case of configurations that only partially cross the river width yet based on their study it was not possible to observe significant differences between the trapping efficiencies of different structures for the plastic types investigated the authors also noted that plastic items may slip under the boom structures during periods of high flow roy et al 2021 further methods testing should specifically assess the capture rate of different boom structures under different deployment conditions this includes the maximum working conditions in terms of the maximum flow rate or maximum working load i e the maximum amount of floating debris that can be retained by the boom and how this changes over time e g as the boom fills up the influence of high flow conditions should also be further studied for example the thresholds above which plastics could pass over or under the boom structure and be lost the retention capacity of the boom as it nears full capacity should also be investigated as this could set important guidelines for the duration of deployment as booms are typically deployed over longer time periods the variability in flow conditions in this time should be accounted for within the final measurement for example the potential losses that may have occurred whilst the boom was in operation this information can transform the data from the deployment of a boom into a number that represents a known proportion of the riverine macroplastic load over a given timescale one further aspect relates to the potential for non plastic material to complicate measurements much of the debris collected by a boom may be non plastic in composition gasperi et al 2014 found that 92 0 99 1 of the mass of debris collected by a network of 26 booms on the seine river in paris was vegetal where the percentage of plastic ranged between just 0 8 and 5 1 such sample composition introduces new challenges for the isolation of the plastic component particularly for smaller particles sizes and handling of waste in terms of personnel requirements and infrastructure for removing the sorted debris this should form the basis of further study to help identify the optimal conditions for boom deployment and interpretation of results 2 2 3 waste collection activities riverine macroplastic flows may also be measured using data from waste collection activities which include both litter clean up actions from the river channel banks or beaches and operations linked for example to the maintenance of gauges or dams or dredging activities litter clean up was utilised by lahens et al 2018 for the saigon river in vietnam and bauer civiello et al 2019 for the ross river in australia table s6 as an approach to estimate riverine macroplastic transport both studies manually cleared floating debris from the water surface lahens et al 2018 used data from a public clean up company that employ nets with 2 cm mesh towed from the side of boats to clear 0 10 cm depth of debris in channels with slow moving water five subsamples were taken from the total load to assess the composition bauer civiello et al 2019 instead present data from complete clearance by hand by 2 3 people on kayaks of a defined sampling area utilisation of waste collected data as a method for measuring macroplastic flows hinges upon the successful harmonisation of data collection and reporting standard data collection forms should be developed in parallel with the delivery of training or development of detailed protocols to describe how macroplastic data should be collected and reported this include details such as i the spatial extent that was covered during the clean up activity ii an estimate of the total capture rate of the activity iii basic river morphological and hydrological data to enable scaling for total flow assessment iv the time elapsed since any previous clean up activities v the approaches to categorising macroplastic and separating plastic from other waste types and vi how to report macroplastic counts or weights 2 3 other approaches in addition to the methods identified during the critical review of studies table s1 other approaches could also serve as a means for measuring macroplastic flows as part of monitoring activities remote sensing has been proposed as a promising new approach to observation based monitoring although the spatial resolution may be too coarse to detect small macroplastics unless they are accumulated or entrapped in vegetation patches for example al zawaidah et al 2021 schreyers et al 2021b tasseron et al 2021 trash racks a coarse screen or gridded cage that is placed across a channel to catch large debris represent a relatively common form of riverine infrastructure that is used to capture litter carleton and nielsen 1990 several other devices have also been specifically designed for the purpose of intercepting plastics in river or estuarine systems helinski et al 2021 these techniques could theoretically be adapted to provide measurements of macroplastic flows in a similar way as has already been done for booms or waste collection activities such adaptations should be accompanied by a process of method testing and validation to ascertain what such a method can accurately measure and any associated thresholds or limitations the selection of methodological approach es to be included in a given study should be based on the specific objectives of the study a consideration of the local environmental context a clear definition of what constitutes macroplastic pollution in the study and the outcome of methods testing and validation related to an understanding of what each method is capable of measuring in addition to this more general selection criteria could include the time and cost efficiency of methods 3 towards a holistic assessment of riverine macroplastic flows 3 1 measuring total macroplastic flux there are some scenarios in which the total macroplastic flux could be discerned using a single approach for example if the visibility is very good and observation based methods can be used to view all plastics flowing in the river or if the water level is low paired with low flow velocities or plastic loads and a physical interception technique can safely isolate plastics from the whole river cross section however these descriptions do not marry well with the realities of most river systems globally in more complex settings no single measurement can be taken to assess the total macroplastic flux instead it is more common to combine multiple techniques or deployments e g haberstroh et al 2020 van emmerik et al 2018 and or undertake statistical extrapolations to upscale measured values e g taryono et al 2020 van emmerik et al 2019b this creates an urgent need to understand exactly what fraction of the total macroplastic load each method can sample both theoretically through method testing and validation exercises and practically as part of a qa qc procedure such efforts can improve the accuracy of estimates of the total macroplastic flux in rivers not covered in this review methods for assessing macroplastic concentrations in other parts of the river system should also be developed and optimised van emmerik et al 2022a this includes establishing the storage of macroplastic on the riverbed in riverbanks or floodplain environments and in riparian vegetation liro et al 2020 it should be noted that many of these environments are subject to discharge conditions for example during flood events and macroplastic stored in these zones may be introduced to or resume active transport in the river channel the methods required to measure stores of macroplastic in the river system differ from those used to assess active flows and as such should be addressed in further review and critical evaluation an important goal of such work should be to identify opportunities to report data in units that can be combined with outputs from different methods data on riverine macroplastic storage should be combined with measurements of flows to establish a more holistic perspective of riverine macroplastic dynamics and provide more accurate flux calculations as well as shed light on the processes that govern the partitioning between different components of the river 3 2 quantifying variabilities thus far the majority of studies of riverine macroplastic flows have concentrated on two main geographic regions europe and south east asia fig 1 whilst there is significant variability in catchment characteristics hydrogeomorphology and flow regimes within these regions the uneven geographic distribution of study sites thus far may omit additional unique challenges elsewhere in the world where current methods may be unsuited for macroplastic monitoring some examples include anastomosing or braided channels or ephemeral streams methods that can be applied in a wide variety of settings can ease efforts towards harmonisation optimisation of methods should prioritise approaches that have greater geographic applicability and do not preclude use in globally important river channel types or flow regimes this is also relevant on a finer scale where methods should be adaptable to different river environments within regions or catchments for example with differing river widths tidal effect flow velocity variation anthropogenic modification or activity extent of vegetation or with different geomorphological profiles gonzález et al 2016 any specific factors which rule out the deployment of different methods in different settings should be evaluated to help identify study sites within regions or catchments which represent the optimum locations for undertaking sampling understanding spatiotemporal variability in macroplastic flows forms a key focus within ongoing monitoring and research several studies have together begun to identify some important trends for example the occurrence of higher macroplastic flows during wet seasons or flood events roebroek et al 2021 van calcar and van emmerik 2019 there are also additional factors which may impart an important control on macroplastic flows that remain poorly understood roebroek et al 2022 the variability across short term temporal scales such as day night cycles the occurrence of a first flush response during flooding or the dynamics of macroplastic accumulation and flushing associated with ephemeral streams represent three such examples related to temporal variability vriend et al 2020b point out that rivers typically exhibit a unique plastic footprint which is tied to spatial and temporal trends in source dynamics and fate and transport processes understanding the variability in macroplastic typologies across time and space is essential for tailoring and refining policy instruments or remediation actions to reduce riverine pollution for example more data on the spatial variability of macroplastic within a river system could help to identify plastic sources and identify hotspots associated with potential risks posed by macroplastic pollution such as interaction with organisms impacts on amenities or impact on flood risk consideration and where possible quantification of uncertainties is also critical to better understand macroplastic riverine flows and how they vary across space and time for example high flow events have been highlighted as periods of increased macroplastic transport due to the greater connectivity with land based sources to rivers and flushing of plastic stored in the catchment as a result of increased surface runoff and discharge roebroek et al 2022 yet these events also impose additional challenges to effectively monitor macroplastic in rivers due to safety aspects higher flow velocities and increased turbulence and or turbidity that can affect visibility as such there is a current lack of data globally to effectively measure macroplastic fluxes across an entire hydrograph and in different local environmental contexts model estimates provide some preliminary data to quantify the potential magnitude of flood events on macroplastic flows roebroek et al 2022 further research is now needed to refine these estimates using monitoring and experimental investigations to more accurately assess the errors associated with riverine macroplastic data 3 3 fate and transport of riverine macroplastic 3 3 1 fate and transport processes the majority of studies conducted thus far concentrate on how much macroplastic moves through rivers rather than the transport dynamics that govern this movement newbould 2021 no clear pattern related to density size or morphology has emerged in the current evidence to detail specifically how these factors influence the way in which macroplastic debris moves through riverine environments yet there are indications that they represent important controls on how plastic is transported for example several studies point towards the dominance of the floating component of riverine macroplastic e g haberstroh et al 2021 van emmerik et al 2019b 2019a however in other river systems a more complex pattern of transport has been observed throughout the river cross section including dominant flows at greater depths e g broere et al 2021 haberstroh et al 2020 in studies of macroplastic flows in rivers movement of the litter is implicit yet this is often not the case several papers report that plastic litter follows a complicated journey lechthaler et al 2020 liro et al 2020 newbould et al 2021 schreyers et al 2021a van emmerik et al 2022a williams and simmons 1997 transport of litter is discontinuous and stranding in sediments vegetation or turbulent eddies is common and can occur repeatedly and for varying durations as a plastic item travels downstream cesarini and scalici 2022 schreyers et al 2021a williams and simmons 1997 characteristics such as size morphology and density play an important role in controlling this temporary trapping or deposition and the thresholds for remobilisation williams and simmons 1997 but this has not yet been specifically established for a range of different litter types the spatial and temporal scales over which these processes operate are also essentially unknown this complexity is highly relevant when designing sampling programmes and interpreting results plastic flows in the river may reflect source dynamics proximity magnitude of release etc but they are also a net result of the processes that facilitate transport or remobilisation studies utilising plastic litter tracers that are representative of a range of different sizes shapes and polymer composition are needed to support monitoring and modelling assessments to better quantify and predict the movement of plastic in rivers this has been performed for plastic bottles duncan et al 2020 newbould 2021 tramoy et al 2020a and plastic films and sanitary products williams and simmons 1997 but more knowledge is needed regarding the fate of different items including those that represent the most abundant types in river systems 3 3 2 riverine discharges of plastic to the ocean there is often an assumption that all plastic that is released into rivers eventually reaches the marine environment in some cases rivers are described as conduits for plastic to the ocean with the implication that they represent smooth pipelines delivering plastic along their course however this does not account for the high level of complexity inherent in riverine environments the global diversity in catchment characteristics hydrology and fluvial geomorphology and the inherent and variable characteristics of macroplastics affecting transport efficiency kallenbach et al 2021 the time at which a macroplastic item that is inputted into a river could be expected to theoretically be released into the marine environment remains a persistent knowledge gap this gap has the potential to undermine estimates of plastic release to the marine environment that utilise for example waste mis management data or quantify specific sources to rivers in fact there is now increasing evidence that substantially less than 100 of the plastic that enters a river is released into the ocean van emmerik et al 2022a this was initially observed as a marked discrepancy between estimates for plastic emissions based on waste mis management data versus the results from monitoring activities revealing a difference of up to 98 5 meijer et al 2021 van emmerik et al 2019a the potential for macroplastic to enter temporary sinks within river catchments has already been stated an additional factor includes the removal of plastic through pollution remediation efforts e g sidek et al 2016 although data on the total volumes collected or the efficacy of different technologies remains sparse helinski et al 2021 on the other hand the extent to which discrepancies between measured and estimated values could be explained by for example the accuracy of estimates of mismanaged waste item to mass conversions model uncertainties or the difficulties associated with accurately measuring macroplastic emissions during flood events remains unknown roebroek et al 2022 this issue is also confounded by the influence of estuarine environments estuaries represent complex and dynamic systems that sit at the interface of riverine and marine environments practically measuring flows of macroplastic in these settings introduces an additional level of complexity compared to riverine methods and it has been recommended to focus on downstream sections of the main river channel to overcome this issue gonzález et al 2016 movement within the estuarine environment is complicated by factors such as bidirectional flow dynamics tramoy et al 2020a van emmerik et al 2020b which can also bring marine derived plastic litter upstream ryan and perold 2021 and salinity gradients which can affect the transport of macroplastics estuarine beaches and vegetated areas such as mangroves represent sinks for macroplastic do sul et al 2014 gonçalves et al 2020 with residence times in the order of several decades tramoy et al 2020b the fate of plastic entering estuarine environments remains a persistent knowledge gap dris et al 2020 based on this measurements of macroplastic flux taken in the downstream zone of a river may not represent the actual emission to the ocean van emmerik et al 2020b the role of estuaries as macroplastic sinks requires further scrutiny to better establish the fate of riverine macroplastic debris and its potential for release into the oceans across different temporal scales schernewski et al 2021 4 optimising monitoring data 4 1 harmonisation of data collection and reporting harmonisation is a necessary task to facilitate comparability and interoperability of data generated in different studies and different geographical contexts this applies to both the method s used and the way in which data is collected and reported a hindrance to harmonisation efforts include the lack of detail in reporting methodological parameters and results future studies should aim to converge methods and data reporting for example standard data collection forms should be generated in parallel with the delivery of training or the development of detailed protocols to describe how macroplastic should be quantified and categorised and how data should be reported mobile applications such as crowdwater tasseron et al 2020 van emmerik et al 2020a or the floating litter monitoring app gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 have been developed with this goal flexibility is still important especially given that rivers often present a unique plastic footprint vriend et al 2020b but this should be nested within broader standardised categories to allow for interoperability standardisation of the definitions for macroplastic sizes and types and methods for establishing the quantity number weight is important reporting units should also be addressed within the context of riverine macroplastic pollution several different units have been used to quantify macroplastic fluxes thus far many of which are not comparable exemplified in table s7 where possible studies should report in multiple units to assist in harmonisation efforts and facilitate wider utilisation of data outputs for example reporting totals relative to river discharge or time to further improve the potential for comparing between datasets or even datapoints reporting in units that account for additional factors should be considered for example reporting data in a way that accounts for the width of the river at a site or the total discharge can help to avoid drawing false conclusions when comparing two sites that have different characteristics even within the same study some monitoring methods typically observation based approaches generate data in the form of counts for establishing policy and regulations mass based data may be the preferred option this has already been recognised by some researchers who have used a combination of approaches to help establish a conversion van emmerik et al 2018 or applied an assumed conversion factor castro jiménez et al 2019 kataoka and nihei 2020 the need for data in particular forms may dictate what is the most suitable monitoring method for a given study and this detail should form part of the ongoing optimisation of monitoring methods to facilitate data reporting and interpretation of results additional parameters associated with practical measurements must also be recorded table 1 presents a summary of different details related to the method and the environmental conditions that represent critical information for interpreting and contextualising macroplastic data for example it is important to record the flow velocity in the river alongside each plastic measurement that is taken changes in velocity even on short temporal scales can affect the number of plastic items flowing past a measurement point and it therefore represents a useful parameter for interpreting results it can be measured using different techniques such as with flow meters or the simpler pooh sticks approach moss et al 2021 alternatively monitoring could be conducted in locations where routine hydrological monitoring is already undertaken such as close to gauging stations many studies do not provide important variables that can affect the interpretation of results tables s2 s6 such as the lower size limit detected the visibility conditions the location and duration of net deployment in the river cross section and the proportion of the total river cross section that each measurement relates to this further hinders the potential for harmonisation as it becomes more difficult to account for potential differences in methods or compare results future monitoring should report measurement parameters and environmental conditions as a standard requirement of the data reporting several studies report macroplastic data with reference to the polymer type e g lahens et al 2018 van calcar and van emmerik 2019 van emmerik et al 2018 a standardised approach is needed to ensure that categorisation by composition is undertaken in a verifiable or reproducible manner for example the astm international resin identification coding system represents a useful resource in this case e g blettler et al 2019 although a physical interception based method is needed to facilitate inspection for such codes and in some cases degradation may lead to a loss of this information many studies report polymer type based on the function of the litter item for example plastic bottles are recorded as polyethylene terephthalate pet data generated through this approach should indicate the potential for uncertainty here based on the diversity of polymer types used for some applications to facilitate harmonised data collection and reproducible results a standardised set of polymer categories with explicit definitions should be established this should aim to increase the convertibility of existing categorisation lists to translate item or polymer based information vriend et al 2020a specific polymeric data if analysed experimentally such as with infrared spectroscopy techniques should be collected and verified using validated methods reference libraries or library search algorithms should be used to confirm polymer type and minimum requirements for data reporting should be observed 4 2 tailoring methodologies to different data applications 4 2 1 estimates of riverine emission to the ocean establishing the release of macroplastics from a river is an important goal for many monitoring campaigns this is linked to a strong marine focus in the plastic pollution domain and is often in response to modelling studies that report substantial releases of plastics from many river catchments globally e g lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 schmidt et al 2017 yet there are several potential shortcomings inherent to flux estimates calculated from monitoring data section 3 3 2 namely they may not represent real releases to the marine environment for example by overlooking macroplastic sequestration in rivers or estuaries this matter aside efforts to tailor monitoring activities for the purpose of calculating estimates should focus on increasing the accuracy and representativeness of data generated the data should represent where possible the full river cross section and account for temporal variability selecting a location that is furthest downstream will generate an estimate that is closest to reality although this introduces challenges associated with handling tidal influence finally efforts should be paid towards harmonising how flux estimates are reported at present several different approaches to describe release have been presented in the literature table s7 undermining potential comparability selected units should conform to the resolution of the monitoring data for example data from a short temporal frame will render a high level of uncertainty in annual scale estimates reporting in multiple units may enhance the utilisation of flux estimates for different purposes 4 2 2 hydrological models riverine macroplastic modelling studies thus far have focused on upscaling estimates of plastic masses emitted from land to sea at the catchment national or global scale lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 sakti et al 2021 schmidt et al 2017 these have utilised data sources related to waste management practices consumption patterns land use or population density and catchment characteristics to generate outputs the resolution of models and the description of riverine macroplastic transport mechanisms can be further improved by focusing on processes occurring within the catchment to predict inputs and transport of plastic of different types such as the hydrological models established for micro and nanoplastics e g besseling et al 2017 nizzetto et al 2016 for hydrological models macroplastic monitoring data mainly mass based is needed to validate outputs ideally the resolution of the data should fit with the model frame and it is important to establish what the monitoring data represents i e what the selected method was able to accurately measure thus quality controlled data from validated methods are preferable monitoring campaigns that encompass both spatial and temporal variability are needed to improve the accuracy of models in particular monitoring efforts should span a range of representative hydrological conditions including hot spots and hot moments e g capturing flush effects when estimating seasonal or annual emissions additional insights into quantified inputs of plastics across space and time partitioning of plastic of different typologies in different components of the river system and dominant fate and transport processes represent critical data to parameterise models particularly at the catchment scale plastic typologies relevant for modelling purposes do not necessarily fit with those relevant to other applications while shape size and polymer are common and relevant characteristics degree of buoyancy is often lacking despite its control on transport processes and settling likelihood kooi et al 2018 hence reporting data from the water surface and below as well as ancillary information on net deployment depth and degree of submersion becomes essential 4 2 3 policy and governance governments worldwide have recognised plastic pollution as an urgent environmental social and political issue rognerud et al 2021 national and international regulations have already been proposed particularly for some components of the problem such as single use plastics e g patrício silva et al 2020 sun et al 2021 syberg et al 2018 at the resumed session of unea 5 175 countries endorsed a historic resolution to start the negotiations of a legally binding agreement on plastic pollution high modelled plastic emissions occur at the intersection of i increasing economic prosperity and material consumption and ii inadequate regulation or mis management of waste the collection analysis and reporting of plastic data detected in various environmental compartments is an essential source of information for developing targeted and efficient policies in all countries van emmerik et al 2022b however government action is also dependant on other data such as technological innovation policy assessments and the existence of less harmful or environmentally sustainable alternatives of particular importance to policy and governance is establishing the scale of the problem its origin or temporal frame the behaviour of the problem its impacts and interlinkages with other pressures data that can help to highlight potential solutions or evaluate the impact of mitigation or remediation actions are also relevant monitoring data tailored towards policy and governance should include typical descriptors of the debris such as the category of plastic or polymer type mass based data is typically preferred in the context of setting regulations additional identifying information such as brand name or provenance data can also be useful in identifying specific sources or release pathways that could be targeted through policy additional ancillary data includes anthropogenic factors such as waste management systems consumption patterns or cultural events occurring in spatial or temporal proximity to the sampling which can help to better understand observed plastic fluxes table 1 extending beyond the frame of a single study achieving harmonisation in riverine macroplastic monitoring globally is a critical task for setting appropriate well framed and realistic policy instruments ensuring comparability assessing the impact of concerted action and sharing of best practices and technological advances as the unea 5 2 resolution indicates a global legally binding agreement is expected to materialise in 2024 the agreement may include an effectiveness evaluation requirement for the parties of the agreement which requires time series of comparable data of plastic flux to prove the effectiveness of the measures taken by the parties this stresses the need for coherent standards definitions and a harmonised monitoring system across the different geographic locations in the world the current limited comparability between datasets represents a major hindrance promoting international collaboration on defining criteria converging methods towards interoperability and setting guidelines for data collection and reporting should represent important priorities for academics and policy makers alike 5 conclusions riverine macroplastic monitoring has already revealed numerous important findings this includes the scale of pollution in different regions dominant sources of plastic to river environments the role of seasonality and source dynamics in governing observed concentrations and indications of several fate and transport processes relevant for understanding how plastic waste moves through the environment yet the lack of comparability between several reported data from different studies sets limitations that prevent concrete conclusions from being drawn expanding upon the testing of methods undertaking method validation implementing qa qc protocols in sampling and reaching agreements internationally to set standards for harmonisation are urgently needed to progress in this arena this critical review has highlighted several opportunities for achieving this aim by reviewing the current utilisation of different methods aspects that require further testing have been identified in many cases this relates to better understanding the thresholds or limits of a given method this should be paired with qa qc procedures which will help to elucidate the suitability reliability and consistency of each methodology beyond this each monitoring study should understand what exactly is being measured and what the obtained data can reliably reveal similar effort directed towards stranded or sequestered plastics in riverine or estuarine settings is also needed a topic which was outside the scope of this present review fewer studies have investigated freshwater plastic sinks than flows of plastic litter yet this presents a crucial opportunity to harmonise methods before several different and potentially poorly comparable approaches emerge understanding the mechanisms and scales associated with the accumulation of plastic in freshwater environments is critical to gain a holistic perspective of plastic pollution accumulation zones may represent ideal sites to intercept pollution and target clean up actions plastic accumulation may be dependant on factors such as macroplastic size buoyancy or morphology therefore surveys that sample plastic flowing out from a river may underestimate a significant source of plastic to rivers that is preferentially retained due to its characteristics harmonisation is an ongoing task decisions need to be made internationally to set defining criteria and research priorities however early progress can be made towards the goal of harmonisation by facilitating comparability wherever possible practically this refers to undertaking qa qc during sampling and data analysis reporting data in multiple units or forms and providing ancillary data to enable effective interpretation of the data this should keep in mind the potential utilisation of data beyond the primary goal of the study and reporting should facilitate this where possible riverine macroplastic research is at a critical early stage establishing quality and harmonisation as a priority now will facilitate the collection of rigorous and comparable data from ongoing and future monitoring efforts this will provide essential information to help frame local national and international solutions to limit pollution and its associated impacts a legally binding global agreement on plastic pollution will emerge by 2024 and thereafter countries will prepare for ratification and implementation this imposes a time pressure on further advancing this field of research establishing a consensus on harmonised monitoring standards for riverine

14854,at present numerous heterogeneous catalysts have been synthesized to activate persulfate ps and produce various reactive species for antibiotic degradation from water however the systematic summary of the correlation among catalyst active sites ps activation pathway and pollutant degradation has not been reported this review summarized the effect of metal based carbon based and metal carbon composite catalysts on the degradation of antibiotics by activating ps metal and non metal sites are conducive to inducing different oxidation pathways so4 oh radical oxidation and 1o2 oxidation mediated electron transfer surface bound reactive complexes and high valent metal oxidation so4 and oh are easy to attack ch s n cn bonds cc double bonds and amino groups in antibiotics 1o2 is more selective to the structure of the aniline ring and amino group and also to attacking cs cn and ch bonds surface bound active species can cleave cc sn cs and cn bonds other non radical pathways may also induce different antibiotic degradation routes due to differences in oxidation potential and electronic properties this critical review clarified the functions of active sites in producing different reactive species for selective oxidation of antibiotics via featured pathways the outcomes will provide valuable guidance of oriented regulation of active sites in heterogeneous catalysts to produce on demand reactive species toward high efficiency removing antibiotics from water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heterogeneous catalysts persulfate active sites oxidative species degradation routes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years antibiotics have been used for human and animal disease treatment the consumption of which is rising worldwide kovalakova et al 2020 as an emerging contaminant antibiotics are persistent and cumulative which are difficult to be degraded the antibiotics in natural water can induce growth of drug resistant bacteria or genes posing potential threats to the ecological environment and human health therefore antibiotics cannot be ignored in the aquatic environment at present antibiotic contaminations have attracted widespread attention by the ministry of ecology and environment of china and the u s environmental protection agency epa the removal of such emerging pollutants has also been studied extensively persulfate ps based catalytic oxidation as an advanced oxidation process aop enables the efficient removal of antibiotics the ps including peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds can be activated to produce oxidative species by heat ultraviolet ultrasonic electricity carbon materials and transition metal oxides gao et al 2022b among them heterogeneous catalytic activation has been regarded as a highly promising method kohantorabi et al 2021 heterogeneous catalysts consist of metals single metals bi metals mixed metals and layered double hydroxides metal free materials and metal non metal includes metal supported and or metal doped composites oyekunle et al 2022 ps activation by catalysts can produce radicals such as sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 and non radicals such as singlet oxygen 1o2 catalyst ps complex and high valance state metals which have different redox potentials for antibiotics removal fig 1 significantly the active sites on the catalyst surface play a key role in the generation of reactive species li et al 2021 the category and population of reactive species will determine the degradation pathways of antibiotics as well as the toxicity of degradation intermediates these issues have been addressed in numerous studies yao et al reported a simple strategy to regulate the components and coordination of conc catalysts by adjusting the zn co ratio of bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks znxco1 zifs the adjustable active sites could regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species ros thus achieving selective degradation of target pollutants in a complex matrix yao et al 2022 xie et al proposed that 1o2 was the major ros in pms or pds system for sulfonamides sas and bisphenol decomposition besides oh and so4 played dominant roles in the degradation of triazine and cbz like compounds respectively xie et al 2022 however a summary of the relationships among catalyst active sites oxidative species and pollutant degradation pathways has not yet been reported in a heterogeneous catalytic ps system herein the performance of ps activated by different heterogeneous catalysts were summarized in detail and the effects of catalyst active sites on radical or non radical production were discussed in addition the specific attacked sites in antibiotics were also presented under different dominant active species finally this review provides valuable information for regulating the active sites on catalyst surface to generate desirable oxidative species and thus helps realize the directional degradation of target pollutants in actual wastewater treatment 2 ps activation by different heterogeneous catalysts at present common heterogeneous catalysts for ps activation include metal based carbon based and metal carbon composite catalysts fig 2 these catalysts have been widely used to activate ps for the treatment of multiple antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole smx tetracycline hydrochloride tc ofloxacin ofl and ciprofloxacin cip in wastewater as shown in fig 3 sulfonamides sas possess amino group nh2 benzene part sulfa bridge so2 nh and r substituent r substituent is attached to the core structure and determines the type of sas r substituents can be roughly divided into five six and other membered heterocyclic substituents tetracyclines are broad spectrum antibiotics tcs all contain the basic skeleton of tetraphene according to the type of r group tetracycline antibiotics mainly include chlortetracycline oxytetracycline and tetracycline the basic molecular framework of fluoroquinolones norfloxacin ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin is nitrogen hybrid double union ring structure with different r groups for metal based catalysts the redox potential of different metals determins the ability of electron transfer which further influences ps activation for instance the performance of cobalt oxide may be superior to other metal oxides e g copper iron and manganese oxide for pms activation in removing antibiotics for zero valent metals metal oxides and metal sulfides the ps adsorption and activation pathways are discrepant resulting in different catalytic activities besides metal content may affect the active sites of a catalyst stoichiometric ratios can also affect the catalytic activity of polymetal based catalysts carbon based catalysts can be divided into zero dimensional 0d one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d carbon materials the catalytic performances of carbon materials are determined by pore structure defects functional groups and intrinsic atom arrangements of carbon hybridization the surface properties and functional groups of carbon materials could be significantly changed by chemical or pyrolysis control affecting the active sites and catalytic activity carbon catalysts with higher molecular dimension possess more porous structure and larger specific surface area duan et al 2015 carbon catalysts with different structures present different active site distributions and carbon networks showing different abilities for ps pollutant adsorption and electron transfer thus carbon catalysts perform difference in ps activation for antibiotics removal for metal carbon composites the presence of carbon matrix can improve the dispersion and stability of metal sites the combination of carbon and metal catalysts can greatly improve the catalytic performance by accelerating the charge transfer at the interface zhang et al 2021c besides composites built by encapsulating metal inside graphitic carbon layers can further promote carbon catalysis thus the ability of metal carbon composites for ps activation can be optimized by adjusting the metal types metal contents loading forms and preparation conditions reasonably in addition some specific reaction routes may be generated under the influence of catalyst structure thus affecting the activation efficiency of ps for instance the availability selectivity and reactivity of free radicals were greatly enhanced when the oxidative degradation process occurred in the confined nanospace zhang et al 2022b more detailed information are showed in supporting information 3 relationships between active sites and oxidative species in general antibiotics are degraded by free radical and non radical pathways in ps systems so4 oh and o2 oxidation belong to the radical pathway while 1o2 direct electron transfer high valent metal and surface complexes can induce non radical oxidation zhou et al 2021 it is worth noting that radical or non radical pathway is largely dependent on the active sites on the catalyst surface li et al 2022b at present both metal and non metal sites have been focused on for ps activation simultaneously metal and non metal sites could initiate radical and non radical pathways fig 4 transition metal and noble metal were common sites which could activate ps to degrade contaminants comparatively non metal active sites were mainly composed of c n o and s related sites and defects the same active sites may induce different reaction mechanisms different shape structure surface chemistry doping and functionalization of catalysts and local environment around the active sites may induce diverse reaction paths the active sites may present different ps adsorption capacity or result in different bond breaking in ps generating various oxidative species the intimate interactions between pds and cuo termination modulated the electron rearrangement of adsorbed pds the absorbed pds as a surface confined ros could directly attack the target organics via outer sphere electron transfer without producing free radicals zhang et al 2014 3 1 relationships between active sites and radical production so4 and oh were the dominant radicals in the ps oxidation system fig 5 shows the mechanism of radical production by ps activation for metal sites ps was activated through cycles of valence state metals the introduction of zero valence metals cu0 co0 and fe0 could react with high valence metals realizing the redox cycles moreover zero valence metals could regulate the electronic properties of catalysts notably metal ions could form metal related complexes with ps or oh which could participate in the redox cycle c n and o related sites were effective for ps activation generally electron density changed between non metal atoms due to differences in electronegativity prolonging the oo bond length in ps molecules later the oo bond of ps might be cleaved to form so4 and oh in addition ov could accommodate o atoms in peroxy bonds which led to oo bonds rupture additionally radical transformation could be observed in the ps system with metal and non metal sites activation the metal sites could be used as electron donors to carry out the redox reactions of high and low valence ions eqs 1 4 and activate ps to produce so4 and oh pms could also further reduce me n 1 to men and generate so5 eq 3 with low redox potential 1 1 v but the reduction kinetics was slower than the oxidation process eqs

based catalysts co2 could activate pms and generate so4 and oh by eqs 1 and 2 generally heterogeneous activation of pms on co based catalyst surface was achieved by electron transfer from co site to pms the electron transfer between co sites and pms generated so4 so5 realizing the redox cycle of co ii co iii and maintaining catalytic activity higher electron density could facilitate electron transfer from active sites to pms wei et al 2021 gao et al 2022a co oh could also be formed from co2 and subsequently react with hso5 forming a complex to produce so4 eqs 5 and 6 the study of zero valent metals could reduce the rapid consumption of metal ions in ps catalytic system in co2 co3 redox cycle co could promote the reduction of co3 by acting as an electron donor for pms activation resulting in co2 so4 and oh generation eqs 7 9 fe0 fe2 and fe3 could also act as metal sites to activate pds for so4 and oh production eqs 10 13 5 c o 2 h 2 o coo h h 6 coo h hso 5 c o 3 o h so 4 7 c

however the cu ii cu i cycle mainly produced so4 and oh in pms system and cu ii pms complexes produced cu i and so5 by electron transfer from ligand to metal subsequently a single electron could be transferred from the surface cu i site to pms to generate so4 and oh ding et al 2022 14 cu ii hso 5 cu iii so 4 o h 15 cu iii oh ho o so 3 cu ii ooso 3 so 4 h 2 o 16 2 cu ii ooso 3 2 h 2 o 2 cu ii 2

and cu the lower valence metals co ii and cu ii could react with hso5 and generate so4 and higher valence metals co iii and cu iii eqs 20 and 21 high state metals e g co iii cu ii cu iii could induce the production of oh by reacting with hso5 thus maintaining the charge balance equation on the catalyst surface eqs 22 24 in addition cu i was conducive to the reduction of co iii thermodynamically e0

degrade antibiotics efficiently guo et al 2020 meanwhile the synergistic effects of other metal sites cufe comn and cofe could also be beneficial to improve the catalytic activity and promote the production of multiple free radicals thanh binh et al 2022 wang et al 2019c yang et al 2021a the redox couples of various metals in the system can provide the synergistic effect of electron transfer for ps activation and radicals generation thanh binh et al 2022 in fecunc pds system the cooperative mechanism of fecu dual atom sites promoted the activation of ps the electrons transfer from cu to fe maintained the low valence state of fe additionally adjacent cu atoms optimized the bonding orbital distribution of fe 3d orbitals effectively the synergy of fecu bimetallic sites promoted the

electronic regulation by doping fe into ilmenite cotio3 physicochemical properties and electronic structure could be regulated thus enhancing the redox cycle of co ii co iii in pms system the electron accumulation at co site was attributed to the higher electronegativity of co λ 1 88 than fe λ 1 83 fe doping could modulate the electronic structure of a catalyst leading to electron cloud migration and forming electron dissipation centers fe atoms and accumulation centers adjacent co atoms the dissipation center showed a good affinity for negatively charged hso5 which was conducive to pms adsorption and further accelerated electron transfer between pms and co site besides the electron accumulation on co site could provide one electron to pms for so4 production thus showing higher catalytic activity the reduction of co iii by fe ii was thermodynamically feasible and the catalyst containing fe and co induced the rapid regeneration of co ii wei et al 2021 eqs 26 29 in addition cu doping also regulated the active species by pms activation cu doping enhanced the electron transfer between heterogeneous perovskite and pms and promoted the generation of so4 and oh gao et al 2021 in

to generate radicals eqs 30 35 gao et al 2022b as presented in fig 4 sp2 hybrid carbon and electron rich groups including co and co might serve as interfacial sites for pms activation sp2 hybrid carbon was an excellent electron transport carrier which could generate so4 and oh by activating pms through electron transfer an accelerated π electron transfer and abundant structural defects of highly graphitic carbon lattice could further promote the migration of unpaired electrons and break oo bond of pms leading to the generation of so4 and oh cc with a free flowing π electron activated pms to produce so4 and oh eqs 32 and 33 the high content of sp2 hybrid carbon structure and co group could also transfer electrons to pds to generate so4 which could further react with h2o oh to form oh eqs 36 39 the c atoms in co and co can obtain electrons from nearby o atoms due to the electronegativity facilitating pms activation wang et al 2022a the electron rich co groups on the carbon

on the surface of n doped carbon layer and then the peroxide bonds oo of pms were cleaved after accepting electrons to generate so4 and oh eqs 40 and 41 in addition to n doping n substances also affected the catalytic activity the n signals included pyridinic n 397 6 ev pyrrolic n 399 2 ev graphitic n 400 9 ev and nitric oxide no 403 9 ev chen et al 2018 the introduction of graphitic n into carbon networks could promote ps adsorption and activation via electron transfer promotion due to the high ps adsorption energies and strong charge transfer capability of graphitic n zhang et al 2021b pyridinic n can promote the transfer of free flowing π electrons from sp2 hybridized carbon thus activating ps for so4 and oh production zhang et al 2022c quaternary n and pyridinic n could act as electron donors providing electrons to pms thus forming so4 the electronegative quaternary n could result in asymmetric spin density and low electron density of the adjacent carbon which was conducive to bonding with negatively charged oxygen on the peroxide oo bond in ps thus generating so4 zhu et al 2018 besides pyridinic and pyrrolic n as lewis basic sites with lone electron pairs were able to transfer electrons to break the oh bond in pms and generate radicals eq 40 compared with pyridinic and pyrrolic n quaternary n presented stronger adsorption to pms and quaternary ammonium salt might first adsorb hso5 and then provide an electron to break the oo bond hoso4 in pms with the assistance of abundant o n s groups in carbon materials pds could be adsorbed on the catalyst surface to form cs2o8 2 complex pyridinic n and thiophenic s acted as lewis basic sites to transfer electrons to electrophilic oxygen in cs2o8 2 complex leading to the cleavage of oo bond and generation of so4 and o2 eqs 42 and 43 graphitic n doping resulted in a greater length of oo bond exhibited a larger amount of electron transfer and lower e ads and induced more positively charged c atoms for ps adsorption than pyridinic n and pyrrolic n which could facilitate the generation of so4 zhang et al 2021b 40 hso 5 e so 4 o h 41 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 o h 42 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o 2 so 4 2 ho 2 3 h 43 s 2 o 8 2 ho 2 so

directly through electron transfer or react with h2o to produce oh which could further oxidize antibiotics through hydrogen capture or hydrogenation on the other hand lattice oxygen ions o2 in metal oxides provided electrons to maintain the equilibrium of catalyst surface charge eqs 44 46 oxygen vacancy ov and lattice oxygen ol could also play an important role in pms activation a moderate number of ov was beneficial to pms adsorption a more negative e ads value and dissociation ov could accommodate an o atom of the peroxy bond in pms leading to oo bond cleavage and pms conversion to hso4 zhang et al 2021b ov could also change the charge distribution resulting in a lower positive charge of ov connected atoms and greatly decrease the adsorption energy of pds 4 87 ev li et al 2021 44 s o

with ps leading to the generation of radicals the spin state of transition metals is important for the performance of catalysts the regulation of spin states on transition metals is of great significance for improving catalytic activity modulation of the active centers spin state affects the strength of metal ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of intermediates directly leading to difference in energy barriers and charge transfer at the interface zhang et al 2023c spin states can be regulated by heteroatomic doping edges defects valence change and external magnetic field zhong et al 2021 typically high spin states with large effective magnetic moments facilitated the overlap of d orbitals with oxygen containing species e g peroxides on metal sites promoting electron transfer and ps adsorption miao et al 2021 in fenx c pms system the relative content of high spin components fe ii and fe iii was positively correlated with the catalytic performance determining the active species generation and electron transfer pathway high spin fe ii configuration s 2 with 3dz 2 orbital occupied by single electrons were conducive to pms activation to produce so4 and oh via single electron transfer process zhang et al 2022a similarly cu ii n4 can induce dominant oh so4 production in cu sac pms system yang et al 2023 moreover charge delocalization and average d band centers of metal sites may determine the intrinsic catalytic activity of metal based catalysts the synergistic effect of the homo diatomic sites can modulate the d band center and electron delocalization leading to an upshift of the d band center the upshift can facilitate strong binding of oxygen related intermediates and thus improve pms activation the coupling of fe 3d orbitals among adjacent atoms at the fe2n6 sites induced the reduced contribution of antibonding state in the feo bond thus fe2cn catalyst activated pms via the radical pathway so4 and oh li et al 2022a the bonding and antibonding states of 3dz2 σ and 3dyz dxz π in fe2cn exhibited higher energy levels due to the higher shift of d band center of fe sites in fe2cn fewer electrons occupying the antibonding state can lead to a stronger bonding strength of the oxygen atom to fe in pms therefore pms underwent decomposition at the fe2cn site with the highest d band center to generate radicals li et al 2022a for non metal sites the deep mechanisms of ps activation and radicals production have not been explored which still need further research 3 2 relationships between active sites and non radical pathways metal and non metal sites induce a variety of non radical pathways fig 4 non radical pathways include 1o2 oxidation reactive complexes catalyst ps so4 oh direct electron transfer and high valent metal oxidation generally metals or metal oxides are testified to activate pms to release radicals whereas carbon based materials are more prone to induce non radical oxidation fu et al 2022 liang et al 2022 as depicted in fig 6 metal or non metal sites can promote ps activation and produce o2 subsequently o2 as an intermediate can be transformed into 1o2 in particular n substance connected with c can increase charge density in positive c atoms which can promote ps activation by weakening oo bond and then produce o2 besides the change of charge distribution caused by n modification can also induce ps to lose an electron leading to the formation of so5 moreover electrons can transfer from ps to electrophilic co groups resulting in so5 generation defects may also lead to the cleavage of the oh bond in ps to form so5 1o2 can be generated in the following reactions of so5 and h2o ol or ov can also promote ps activation for 1o2 generation surface oh with high adsorption capacity can form surface bound complexes metal sites can also activate the peroxide bond in ps and form the metastable peroxide intermediate to attack contaminants via inner sphere interactions n related sites can lead to negative binding energy or high low electron density regions to form surface bound reactive complexes carbon materials as a conductive bridge with high conductivity are more likely to mediate electron transfer in the ps system metal and c n o related sites with the capability of accepting or providing free electrons can promote direct electron transfer from contaminants to ps contaminants that lose electrons can be oxidized and degraded into small molecules high valent metals can be generated by electron transfer from fe ii co ii cu ii and mn ii to ps and acquire electrons from pollutants for degradation 1o2 oxidation was a common non radical pathway usually 1o2 could be generated by carbon and noble metal cu doped materials catalysis in ps system multiple pathways for 1o2 production included self decomposition of pms and conversion from ol or o2 zhou et al 2021 the self decomposition of pms could produce 1o2 eq 47 whereas the reaction speed was slow pms could act as both electron donors and acceptors in n doped graphene activated pms system with the increase of charge density in positive carbon atoms caused by n modification pms was likely to provide an electron leading to the formation of so5 thereafter so5 reacted with h2o to form 1o2 eqs 48 and 49 wang et al 2019b besides ol or ov in transition metal catalysts could also produce 1o2 lattice expansion resulted in the release of ol and conversion to reactive oxygen species o which could react with pms to produce 1o2 eqs 50 and 51 the formation of mo m m co mn bonds could optimize the electronic localization of metal ions in the co2mn1o4 pms system due to the strong spatial overlap between the eg and o2p orbitals of transition metals in addition mn ions with larger ionic radius replaced co ions at the tetrahedral site resulting in tunable electronic structures of active center and the creation of vacancies at o sites meanwhile part of the o was further converted to 1o2 eq 51 the generation of ov promoted the redox cycle of mn m n 1 m co mn in the lattice eq 52 and favored interfacial electron transfer thereby ov at the catalysts interface played an important role in the formation of 1o2 chen et al 2020 additionally the ketone carbonyl co groups could also produce 1o2 through nucleophilic addition and the interaction of peroxide intermediates with pms the co groups on the lattice boundary of sp2 conjugated carbon might be important for 1o2 production peng et al 2022 the ketonic co groups with unsaturated double bonds have electrophilic properties on the contrary pms with peroxide bonds have nucleophilic properties therefore electrons could transfer from pms electron donor to co groups electron acceptor and then so5 was produced leading to s2o8 2 so4 and 1o2 generation shao et al 2018 moreover density functional theory dft calculations had been conducted to prove the thermodynamic feasibility of 1o2 generation from the interaction between pms and co sites liu et al 2021b meng et al 2020 a total exothermic energy of 8 04 ev between pms and biochar with co group proved the easy generation of 1o2 meng et al 2020 n site such as graphitic n was considered active for 1o2 production in ps system zhang et al 2022c graphitic n and pyridinic n could enhance the attraction between ps and carbon material through adjacent c atoms to weaken the oo bond and mediate 1o2 generation o2 exists as an intermediate in the production of 1o2 metal non metal sites such as pyridinic n thiophenic s fe loaded sp2 hybrid carbon structure coh co group and structural defects could promote ps activation and o2 production subsequently 1o2 could be generated either by direct reactions between o2 and h2o2 eqs 53 or by self recombination of o2 eq 54 or by recombination of superoxide ions and metastable hypervalent metal related radicals eqs 55 57 for the sdbc composite both n doping and fe loading onto the carbon layer could act as important sites to produce o2 or 1o2 eqs 58 60 and o2 could be further oxidized to 1o2 eq 53 yin et al 2019 47 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 1 o 2 48 hso 5 e so 5 h 49 2 so 5 h 2 o 2 hso 4 1 5 1 o 2 50 o v o 51 o hso 5 1 o 2 hso 4 52 2 m

an important role in the selective production of 1o2 notably adjusting the coordination environment can change the geometric structure and electronic state of active sites enabling the targeted production of 1o2 con2 2 sites were formed by electronegative n atoms and the central electropositive co atom the energy barrier was caused by the weakly positive co atoms in the coordination environment leading to the electrons transfer from pms to con2 2 and the selective generation of 1o2 mi et al 2021 the electron accumulation advantage on oo bond of pms under synergistic effect of the dual cozn sites facilitated the oo bond cleavage to form hso4 o intermediates the overlap of d orbitals of co and tdos at the fermi energy level revealed the dominant contribution of cobalt introduction to electron transfer capability the high spin density and electron accumulation advantage allowed the cozn site to adsorb specific o sites of pms thus promoting the formation of 1o2 selectively moreover fen4 sites in fe1 cn tended to adsorb the terminal o of pms promoting the formation of so5 and then generation of 1o2 selectively zhang et al 2021a however deeper mechanisms of 1o2 production by ps activation with non metal sites lack deep study surface mediated electron transfer was another non radical pathway the catalyst acted as a conductive bridge to facilitate electrons transfer from the contaminant electron donor to active complex intermediate electron acceptor the impedance of carbon catalyst affects electron transfer typically mediated electron transfer was more likely to occur in ps system activated by carbon materials rather than metals due to the good conductivity of carbon materials zhou et al 2021 a highly graphitic carbon framework together with co and n groups could facilitate electron transfer from the pollutants to the ps carbon complex initiating a non radical pathway co group was considered the main active site of the non radical pathway and the electron deficient co could perform as a mediator to promote electron transfer the n in the carbon skeleton could disrupt the chemical inertness of the carbon lattice and produce charge transfer intermediates resulting in direct charge transfer in particular in addition to carbonaceous materials similar electron migration had been found in precious metal e g ru rh ir pt and au catalyzed pms systems ahn et al 2019 notably a unique electron transfer mechanism had been demonstrated in pms system by cobalt catalysis in nanoconfined space the spike of contaminant might alter the electron transfer pathway the nanoconfined co crystal was no longer the electron donor but it might act as electron mediator transferring electrons from contaminants to pms the presence of contaminant inhibited pms decomposition which was contrary to the usual mediated electron transfer cui et al 2022 different from mediated electron transfer the reactive complex formed by surface binding could oxidize contaminants in ps systems with carbon materials and metal based catalysts the binding of marginal nitrogen configurations pyridinic n and pyrrolic n could facilitate surface adsorption and surface bound complex generation via the formation of low and high electron density regions graphitic n could lead to the negative binding energy with pms and large amounts of transferred electrons between pms and catalyst enhancing pms adsorption and surface activated pms formation with a rearranged electronic structure chen et al 2018 the interfacial interaction caused pms charge rearrangement which made the complex more reactive therefore surface characteristics of a catalyst e g hydroxyl density and zero point charge were crucial for the binding of pms on catalyst surface zhou et al 2021 besides metal free carbon materials with weak electron donating ability are not enough to break through the energy barrier of oo bond which can only make the oo bond elongate to form a surface active complex liu et al 2022a surface confined complexes can also be formed on metal sites such as cu i in pms system via inner sphere interactions without forming new chemical bond the interactions between pms and cu can manipulate the redox potential of pms and prolong the peroxide oo bond the possible inner sphere interactions may include pmsads o hc organicfree or pmsads o c organicfree bonds li et al 2020 usually the free radicals came from the reaction between ps and sp2 hybrid carbon skeleton in carbonaceous materials or electron rich groups in catalysts or from the redox reaction between ps and transition metals besides pms adsorption level determined the redox capacity of the complex and oxidation capacity in pollutant degradation metal sites transition metal oxides and noble metals can activate ps to form surface bound complexes with high reactivity yang et al 2022b ps activation can be achieved by attaching ps to the catalyst surface to form metastable and highly reactive peroxides notably the active spin states of catalyst can affect the oxidation capacity of active species and electron transfer rate during the activation of ps in mncnts m co fe mn or ni pms system pms coupled with m n sites to form surface reactive complexes depending on the spatial configuration of the d orbitals in m n sites the eg orbital of transition metals participated in σ bonding with pms by overlapping with o 2p orbitals thereby affecting bonding strength and electron transfer rates and catalytic activity for pms activation miao et al 2021 moreover the magnetic moment of a metal center plays a key role in the binding energy between a catalyst and oxygen related matter the adsorption energy was negatively correlated with the effective magnetic moment the largest adsorption energy of pms at con sites indicated that activated ps molecules are tightly bound to form reactive complexes rather than releasing so4 miao et al 2021 it is noteworthy that the intrinsic relationship between non metal sites and ps activation for reactive complexes deserves further investigation high valent metal oxidation commonly exists in the process of ps activation by fe mn and co based catalysts high valent metals such as fe iv fe v are mild oxidants compared with radicals the redox potentials for fe iv fe iii and fe v fe iv couples are 2 0 v and 1 8 v usually high valent metal species are selective oxidants that not only react with electron rich organic compounds but also resist interference from common coexisting substrates e g chlorides and bi carbonates shao et al 2022 the surface high valent metals were important active species in ps system the most common species are high valent iron species e g fe iv o fe iv and fe v fe iv was generated from fe2 by transferring two electrons to ps eqs 63 and 64 and the high valent iron acquired electrons directly from the pollutants to complete the degradation besides fe iv bound on the surface of metal based carbonaceous materials was also a major species for pollutants degradation other high valent metals such as co iv might also be generated by two electron transfer from the co ii site to pms eq 65 liu et al 2021a in addition the high valent copper and manganese cu iii and mn v were formed from the reactions of cu ii and mn ii with pms eq 66 69 chen et al 2022a generally high spin state sites with large magnetic moments were conducive to the coupling of pms promoting oxidation potential and accelerating electron transfer in fenx c pms system high spin fe iii s 5 2 sites were prone to bond with pms to produce fe v o complexes via a two electron and o atom transfer zhang et al 2022a 63 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o fe iv o 2 2 so 4 2 2 h 64 f e 2 hso 5 fe iv o 2 so 4 2 h 65 c o 2 hso 5 h 2 o co iv o 2 2 so 4 2 2 h 66 cu

were induced during ps activation due to the difference in surface adsorption energy electronic properties and charge transfer ability normally so4 and oh were generated by the breakdown of peroxygenic bonds in ps the electrons transfer and h abstraction reaction could affect the generation of so4 and oh in comparison with oh o2 and 1o2 the energy barrier required for so4 generation is the lowest liu et al 2022b two electron transfer from metal sites might lead to the formation of high valent metals surface hydroxyl groups could improve pms adsorption thus favoring the formation of surface complexes the introduction of defects affected the surface electronic properties and generated active centers defects may be more inclined to cleave the oh bond in pms to form so5 and thus to form 1o2 with h2o wang et al 2022b the inherent electronic nature of ov could accept and provide free electrons thus influencing the electron transfer orientation and transformation pathway in addition the active sites were prone to gaining or losing electrons thereby promoting pms activation through an electron transfer pathway without the involvement of ros wu et al 2021a in conclusion charge delocalization average d band centers and spin states may be the crucial factors for regulating ps activation and generating discrepant active species by metal sites in con3 pms system the unsaturated co sites with higher spin state exhibited enhanced electron donor capacity and electron flow triggering the production of high valent co species with valence change from co ii to co iv in con4 pms system the saturated co sites with lower spin states are more prone to radical generation co ii was converted to co iii with the generation of oh so4 song et al 2023 unsaturated metal sites with lower coordination possess more accessible d orbitals and less steric hindrance calle vallejo et al 2015 thus unsaturated sites with higher spin states present greater electron donating capacity higher spin states sites can induce non radical pathways via more electron transfer while sites with lower spin states may produce only radicals for non metal sites electronegativity structural defects and functional group properties differed leading to the difference of electron transfer capacity and charge density besides the different relative content of active sites in catalysts resulted in the discrepant formation of active species in ps system li et al 2021 by modulating the types of active sites carbonaceous catalysts can achieve the transition from electron donor to electron mediator the oxygen containing group contents and degree of defects are altered thus changing the dominant active species zhang et al 2022d however the internal mechanisms of ps activation by the active sites deserve further investigation so as to distinguish the specific mechanism of different sites for oxidative species generation clearly as mentioned above active sites play the key role in the formation of various active species furthermore the reaction system may also affect the generated active species the ph value of water affects the type of active species and coexisting substances can quench free radicals zhang et al 2023b for example oh and so4 can be consumed by cl resulting in the formation of less active cloh cl and cl2 chen et al 2022b wang et al 2016 co3 2 hco3 react with oh and so4 to form co3 and hco3 nevertheless the presence of co3 2 hco3 can lead to the conversion of oh and so4 wang and wang 2021 besides so4 may be the dominant radicals at low ph while so4 can react with oh to produce more oh under alkaline conditions 4 relationships between oxidative species and degradation routes ps catalytic oxidation system could produce reactive species with different oxidation potential the common active species consisted of so4 2 5 3 1 v vs nhe oh 1 9 2 7 v vs nhe and 1o2 0 81 v vs nhe xie et al 2022 gu et al 2022 different reactive species attacked specific structures or diverse groups of antibiotics thus triggering various degradation pathways free radical and non radical oxidation depended on radical and electrophilic attacks respectively 4 1 free radical attack electrophilic and radical attack sites in smx were predicted by fukui functions of f and f0 the atoms with high f values were more easily to lose electron and be oxidized by the electrophilic attack while the atoms with larger f0 values were more vulnerable to radical attack cao et al 2021 wang et al 2022b the f regions were mainly located at the benzene ring aniline and five membered ring of smx e g 2 c 4 c 6 c amino n while the f0 regions were distributed throughout the whole aniline of smx wang et al 2022b as presented in fig 7 a aniline sn bond terminal benzene ring isoxazole ring and methyl group of smx were possible reaction sites sn bond breakage benzene ring hydroxylation and aniline partial oxidation were the main pathways for smx degradation in the presence of so4 and oh due to the strong oxidability of so4 the s position in smx was vulnerable to radical attack leading to s n bond breakage since s was the most vulnerable site for free radical attack the cleavage of sn and sc bonds between the two rings favored the deep oxidation of smx yin et al 2020 after sn bond breaking oh addition on the olefinic double bonds of isoxazole rings occurred in the presence of surface bound oh due to the high reactivity of oh besides the cc in the isoxazole ring was further oxidized and the amine group in the benzene ring could be substituted by oh zhang et al 2022e the electron receiving ability of so4 was superior than oh which was beneficial for electron transfer thus so4 could attack the aniline part to generate free radical cations and then react with h2o quickly to form hydroxylated smx products besides unsaturated cc in the nitrogen containing heterocyclic ring was sensitive to be attacked via electron transfer xie et al 2022 thereby so4 could also attack the olefinic double bond in the isoxazole ring and then further hydrolyze for hydroxylation alternatively oh attacked smx molecules directly forming oh smx through addition reactions xu et al 2020 since the kinetic energy barrier values δg by oh 9 17 11 7 kcal mol 1 were lower than so4 10 2 15 6 kcal mol 1 and oh was more likely to attack compounds via hydrogen atom abstraction haa and radical adduct formation raf gao et al 2020b xie et al 2022 the oh addition onto smx δg 0 is a thermodynamically favorable process for the oh and o2 dominated systems main attack paths of smx also included aniline group oxidation hydroxylation and sn sc bond breakage specifically oh or o2 could attack the n site of the benzene ring to oxidize the amino group the high reactivity of oh with alkene double bonds in the isoxazole ring could also lead to the hydroxylation of smx xu et al 2020 in general the basic structure of sas includes the parent sulfanilamide and other substituents sulfanilamide containing aniline in sas may be the main attack site by reactive species e g oh and so4 xie et al 2022 tc is stable with a delocalized π bond however the functional groups attached to it need to be removed before the destruction of the hydrogenated tetrabenzene core the functional groups in tc e g double bonds phenolic and amine groups were vulnerable to be attacked by free radicals due to the high electron density fig 7b the c n and o atoms with larger f0 values presented high reactivity with radicals such as so4 and oh yang et al 2022a cn bond could be attacked by so4 to remove the n methyl group in 4 c the functional groups in 6 c could also be further oxidized with the existence of so4 as an electrophilic species so4 was easy to react with electron rich parts of tc such as phenolic hydroxyl to form hydrolyzable so4 adduct intermediates in solution hua et al 2022 considerable f0 values were noticed in 11a c and 2 c atoms and the 2 c 3 c and 11a c 12 c double bonds were available sites for radical attack especially oh addition yang et al 2021b common fluoroquinolones fqs include nor ofl and cip the standard redox potentials of so4 and oh are higher than the activation energies of piperazine ring hydroxylation quinolone group defluorination and hydroxylation therefore quinolones and piperazinyl might be defluorinated and dehydroxylated in the process of fluoroquinolone antibiotics degradation by ps oxidation so4 usually reacted with organic compounds through electron transfer while oh mainly reacted through hydrogen atom abstraction and minor electron transfer chen et al 2019 wu et al 2021b as shown in fig 7c for ofl 8 c 15 c and 18 c with negative pk parr functions through dft calculations exhibited high vulnerability to be attacked by electrophilic species such as so4 and oh resulting in cleavage of quinolone ring and 8 c 5 n bond in addition 9 c 2 n and 5 n of the ring and 23 o of the carboxyl group were also easy to be cracked adduced or oxidized fan et al 2020 besides the piperazine ring with high frontier electron density and oxidability can be readily attacked by oh and o2 the cc and nc bonds may be broken in the process wang et al 2018 in co knoc pms system oh was dominant in cip degradation 64 8 and followed by so4 34 2 usually cip could be degraded by defluorination quinolone ring opening and piperazine epoxidation under the attack of oh the piperazine ring in cip was attacked by oh to form c10h10fno3 quinolone ring opening and defluorination could decompose cip into c7h9no2 and c6h13n in addition c10h10fno3 oxidation could also produce c7h9no2 and downstream c6h13n and then further oxidized and transformed them into simpler organic intermediates finally mineralized to co2 and h2o liang et al 2022 generally so4 oh and o2 were more likely to attack n 5 o 25 o 23 c 17 and c 11 atoms in cip zhu et al 2022 in summary the initial reaction of free radicals with organics can significantly affect the subsequent reactions radicals with different redox potential tend to show different ability to break bonds the electron receiving ability of so4 is superior electron transfer between contaminant and so4 presents the lower free energy barrier compared with oh so4 tends to attack contaminants via an electron transfer initially rather than raf and haa so4 shows selectivity and stability while oh acts as a non selective radical therefore so4 prefers to attack electron donating groups such as amino nh2 hydroxyl ho and amide nhco r oh presents high reactivity toward most organic pollutants via electrophilic radical addition electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction kohantorabi et al 2021 based on the structure of organics the oxidative degradation path of antibiotics can be predicted and determined according to the selectivity and oxidation ability of free radicals 4 2 non radical oxidation 1o2 presented an unoccupied π 2p molecular orbital and strong electrophilic reactivity electron rich benzene and isoxazole rings in smx might undergo haa reactions whereas non radical pathway might lead to isomerization and methyl oxidation kohantorabi et al 2020 xu et al 2020 for sas aniline was electron rich which was more likely to be attacked by 1o2 rather than other pathways such as haa xie et al 2022 as shown in fig 7a 1 o2 could readily oxidize amino n in the aniline ring since the amino n with the highest f value could lose electron easily and be attacked electrophilically wang et al 2022b in addition 1o2 could also attack the highly active 2 c 4 c and 6 c atoms in the aniline of smx molecule break c s bond and crack benzene ring since these atoms with high f value were more vulnerable to electrophilic attack fig 7a the smx degradation pathway by 1o2 oxidation was different from that by oh radicals the o atom in oh is sp2 hybridization with one bonding orbital two n orbitals and one orbital occupied by an unpaired electron zhang et al 2023a the mechanism of oh attack on aromatic compounds is similar to that of electrophilic substitution the electron affinity and high reactivity of oh radicals make them less selective the 1o2 with mild oxidation capacity strong electrophilicity and selectivity can remove electrons from electron rich substances zhang et al 2021a electronic configuration of antiparallel spin paired electrons in outer orbits of 1o2 leads to the unique interaction with hydrocarbons the unique configuration allows 1o2 to attach to the electron rich double bond of the unsaturated hydrocarbon at a high rate electron rich molecular sites contribute electrons to the empty orbitals in 1o2 resulting in electrophilic interactions zeinali et al 2019 1o2 was more selective towards the amino n atom and aniline ring structure in sdbc pds system 1o2 as the dominant active species degraded smx through the following pathways oxidation of amino n to form nitro substitutional smx attack on the 6 c atom to produce n 5 methylisoxazol 3 yl sulfonic amide and n 5 methylisoxazol 3 yl methane sulfonamide and attack on the 2 c 4 c or 6 c atom to further decompose smx yin et al 2019 in addition the 1o2 was more inclined to attack the amino group of benzene ring in smx in nrgo activated pms system for example the degradation products of smx were identified as 4 nitro benzenesulfonic acids rather than sulfanilic acid which might result from s n bond breaking and 4 nitro desulfonated smx rather than desulfonated smx meanwhile 4 nitro smx formed by amino oxidation on the benzene ring 4 amino n iminomethylene benzenesulfonamide formed by isoxazole oxidation and 4 nitro n iminomethylene benzenesulfonamides obtained by further oxidation were detected the above products might be attributed to rapid oxidation of the amino group in the benzene ring by 1o2 wang et al 2019b for other non radical oxidation paths high valent metal oxo species could attack organic compounds via oxygen atom transfer hydrogen abstraction and or electron transfer zong et al 2020 fe iv was a transient species and then transformed to fe3 with the oxidation of smx semiquinone radicals would form on catalyst surface and then react with fe3 to produce fe2 the long lasting generation of fe2 resulted in the ongoing generation of fe iv dominant fe iv could lead to hydroxylation aniline oxidation and sn bond cleavage during smx degradation fig 7a in contrast the surface mediated electron transfer would result in the opening of isoxazole ring liang et al 2021 generally oh can be added to aromatic ring by electrophilic addition to form substituted hydroxylation products during the oxidation mediated by oh and so4 radical aromatics adducts eliminate oh and so4 2 to form hydroxylation products and aromatics radical cations the initial attack of fe iv on aromatic ring is also accomplished by electrophilic addition however fe iv aromatic ring adduct binds oxo oxygen atom of fe iv o2 to aromatic ring with the elimination of fe2 resulting in the formation of hydroxylation products wang et al 2022c besides the 1o2 non radicals can cause hydroxylation of pollutants via electron transfer pathway or via the formation of endoperoxide intermediates hydroxyl derivatives may be produced by the formation of aniline radicals or endoperoxide intermediates zhou et al 2017 moreover the degradation pathway of smx included hydroxylation desulfuration sn cleavage and cs cleavage with dominant surface bound reactive species wang and wang 2022 as shown in fig 7b besides electrophilic so4 and oh the non radical 1o2 could also initiate the electrophilic attack for tcs degradation the active n atom connected with 4 c also exhibited a large value of f0 0 0412 which made the n demethylation reaction more easily to occur yang et al 2021b cn bond could also be attacked by 1o2 since the low bond energy resulted in the removal of n methyl group in 4 c tc degradation was also conducted through the opening of the 6a c 10a c bond at hydrogen tetrabenzene nuclear phenyl group by electrophilic attack of 1o2 the hydrogen addition at 1 c and 11 c and the claisen rearrangement of unstable enols at 2 c 3 c and 11a c 12 c were more likely to occur during radical reactions besides the functional groups in 4 c and 6 c could be further oxidized in the presence of 1o2 moreover the demethylation and deamidation of dimethylamino group could also occur with 1o2 oxidation and electron transfer ye et al 2020 pms adsorbed by carbon based catalyst was activated to a metastable state the oo bond was weak for the electron alignment with the carbon skeleton once the electron rich pollutant was added the pollutant acted as electron donors and metastable pms acted as electron acceptors in a direct redox reaction carbon bridge can be used as an electron mediator to promote the electron transfer from pollutants to pms so as to achieve the oxidation of pollutants for the fe iv o involved system tc degradation could be achieved by electron transfer fe iv o could be reduced to fe iii due to the acceptance of electrons thus the electron donating groups of tc hydroxyl groups were more vulnerable to be attacked by active species besides the low bond energy of nc contributed to the occurrence of n demethylation fig 7b peng et al 2022 for the system dominated by surface bound radicals so4 oh nc bonds and cc bonds could be the active sites fig 7b besides hydroxyl group might be added on the phenol group of tc demethylation deamidation and hydroxylation could also occur surface bound radicals was produced and confined to the activator surface and could only react with tc on the surface or in the solution around it duan et al 2022 weng et al 2022 once the hydrogenated tetrobenzene core was opened the intermediates were more susceptible to further oxidation to simpler alcohols aldehydes and ketones and ultimately to co2 and h2o xiao et al 2022 as depicted in fig 7c the attached sites included piperazinyl substituent oxazine substituent and carboxyl group in a 1o2 dominant ofl degradation system gao et al 2019 1o2 could firstly attack nc bond and remove methyl of piperazinyl substituent to form c17h18fn3o4 subsequently c17h18fn3o4 could be transformed into c17h18fn3o5 and c15h16fn3o4 due to the oh addition oxazinyl substituent demethylation and decarboxylation besides cn bond could be attacked resulting in the open of the ring in piperazinyl substituent thus c17h18fn3o5 was transformed into c15h13fn2o4 and c11h7fn2o2 in α mno2 nanoflower pms system 1o2 and o2 dominated under alkaline conditions similar to so4 and oh 1o2 could act as an electrophilic species to rapidly react with unsaturated cc bonds and amines in cip molecules deng et al 2017 1o2 electrophilic attack could be performed on o 25 n 5 c 11 c 14 and o 23 zhu et al 2022 in addition oxidation of the piperazine ring occurred due to the dominant effect of surface bound so4 during cip degradation oyekunle et al 2021 generally free radicals own higher redox potential than pristine oxidants e g kmno4 cl2 hclo h2o2 and o3 non radical oxidation paths are considered to possess higher selectivity better ph adaptability and stronger anti interference ability e g natural organic matter oxygen containing acid ions yu et al 2022 besides the electron deficient sites low electron density can facilitate ps oxidation for 1o2 release the electron rich sites tend to promote ps reduction to form free radicals so4 and oh gao et al 2018 1o2 is selective for electron rich organics due to its electrophilic nature the selectivity of electron transfer path is based on the feasibility of ps organics adsorption on catalyst to construct ternary reaction interface and the possibility and efficiency of electron transfer among them yu et al 2022 the electron transfer path is also suitable for the degradation of electron rich substances high valent metals as a relatively powerful oxidant can react with organics via electron or atom transfer high valent meals are more reactive with electron rich moieties e g phenols anilines and amines or contaminants with low ionization potential the high selectivity of non radical paths is conducive to the efficient oxidation of target organics with high adsorption capacity and low ionized potentials avoiding the interference of impurities moreover due to the mild oxidation potential and favorable reaction pathway non radical paths can also trigger polymerization with high selectivity inducing value added polymers generation rather than simple mineralization can be a characteristic reaction of non radicals however the actual transformation paths of pollutants are also related to the type and structure of pollutants the redox properties of organic compounds will directly affect the efficiency of their conversion into polymers typically compared with high oxidizing radical systems the oxidation capacities of non radical systems are moderate leading to insufficient degradation of organic pollutants nevertheless non radical oxidation pathways are less susceptible to be influenced by coexisting substances exhibiting unique advantages in treating actual water chemical inputs can be reduced in non radical systems and the redox potential of non radical paths can be regulated by the structure composition and physicochemical properties of catalysts ren et al 2022 besides second order reaction rates k ros contaminant the types of active species concentration of active species and the reaction time can determine the degradation efficiency together therefore 1o2 has acted as the dominant active species in many research rather than so4 or oh xie et al 2022 currently the continuous flow reactors have been developed for the practical applications of ps aops due to the convenient operation and low energy consumption gao et al 2020a non radical paths have also been proved to be suitable for continuous flow reactors for example a continuous flow fixed bed pms reactor with distilled spirits lees derived biochar dslbs quartz wool was designed for smx degradation the dominant contribution of 1o2 was confirmed the continuous degradation can be achieved with a removal efficiency greater than 73 7 after 20 h indicating the stable degradation capacity of the continuous flow reactor wang et al 2022a hierarchical reactor with co3o4 pms exhibited efficient degradation of aromatic pollutants in flow mode co iv was shown to be the dominant active species playing the critical role in phenol removal the reactor can also exhibit stable catalytic performance during a 10 day experiment yi et al 2022 5 conclusion and perspective in summary the ability of different heterogeneous catalysts to activate ps was analyzed systematically moreover the contribution of active sites to the production of reactive species and the relationship between reactive species and attacked sites in antibiotics were also clarified the main conclusions are described below 1 transition metal e g co cu fe sites co co cc ch graphitic n pyridinic n ol ov and surface oh are beneficial to induce so4 and oh oxidation besides pyrrolic n and thiophenic s also favor the production of so4

and au catalysis in pms systems besides transition metals sites 6 may also produce high valent metals for organics degradation 3 so4 and oh can easily attack ch sn cc amino and cn bonds in the antibiotic ring in addition so4 may also easily attack cs no phenolic hydroxyl realizing the demethylation dehydroxylation deamidation and decarboxylation of antibiotics 4 1o2 is more selective to the aniline ring and amino group which could attack cs cn and ch achieving the dehydroxylation demethylation and decarboxylation of antibiotics in addition 1o2 can also attack the hydrogen tetrabenzene nuclear phenyl group in tc electrophilically surface bound reactive species can lead to hydroxylation demethylation deacylamination desulfurization the cleavage of cc sn and cs high valent iron species are easy to attack the electron donor group e g hydroxyl cc which can lead to hydroxylation aniline oxidation demethylation splitting of sn and nc surface mediated electron transfer can break no bond and open the substituent ring which may also lead to demethylation and deacylamination of pollutants although the ps aops systems based on heterogeneous catalysis have been widely used for the removal of antibiotics in water the following points still need to be considered in future research 1 the potential interactions may exist among different active sites affecting the production of reactive species the interactions may affect electronic properties and reaction energy barrier of active sites different modes of action may lead to differential charge transfer and affect surface reactions besides the interactions may also cause obvious neighboring effects which lead to different adsorption energies among active sites neighboring effects may cause the migration of adsorption sites of ps organics the interaction effects may also result in indistinguishable selectivity of active sites for oxidative species however the major difficulty lies in extracting relevant information from different active sites the local chemical environment of the active sites can be effectively regulated by heteroatom doping different heteroatoms and species type of the same heteroatom can significantly affect the interaction of active sites the regulation of active sites can produce more favorable interactions for ideal reactive species generation which is of great significance for rational design of catalysts therefore it is necessary to recognize the interactions among different active sites and the impact on the formation of reactive species 2 different reactive species have certain selectivity for the specific attacked sites in antibiotics rational regulation of reactive species can achieve oxidation products with low toxicity alternatively the conversion of contaminants into more valuable addition polymers rather than simple mineralization would be more beneficial to achieve the carbon peaking and neutrality in complex sewage systems with multiple organic pollutants and other substances metal inorganic ions and natural organic matter selective and directional oxidation of pollutants is more necessary thus it is of great practical value to consider the optimal distribution and combination of reactive species to achieve the directional transformation of pollutants at present large knowledge and technical gaps are still presented in the relationship boundary between organic mineralization complete and non selective oxidation and polymerization selective oxidation in ps aop systems 3 currently most reports are limited to sequential batch experiments and the recycling and rational utilization of catalysts have not been better implemented in the process of actual water treatment an intelligent continuous flow reactor should be designed the stability of catalysts and utilization rate of ps oxidants can be improved by establishing feedback responses to intelligent monitoring of concentration dose which can maximize the chemicals utilization therefore it is desirable to design an intelligent continuous flow reactor in order to accelerate the application of catalytic ps aops systems in real water treatment 4 dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in wastewater dom may also be transformed when treating target pollutants in a ps aops system the interaction role between dom and heterogeneous catalysts is still unclear and the effect of dom on the reactivity of active sites is also ambiguous compared with free radical reaction non radical paths possess better selectivity and higher oxidant utilization in water with complex substances e g dom inorganic ions and natural organic matter however the reaction degree between dom and oxidation species and the inhibition of dom to target pollutants removal is lack of exploration dom complex behavior is one of the important factors affecting the migration bioavailability and toxicity of organic pollutants thus whether the biological toxicity increases after pollutants degradation is also worth further discussion more attention should be paid to the dom effects in sewage and its conversion regulation in a heterogeneous catalytic system the dom transformation path could be better regulated reducing its inhibition to target pollutants removal credit authorship contribution statement ning li conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing review editing jingya ye

14854,at present numerous heterogeneous catalysts have been synthesized to activate persulfate ps and produce various reactive species for antibiotic degradation from water however the systematic summary of the correlation among catalyst active sites ps activation pathway and pollutant degradation has not been reported this review summarized the effect of metal based carbon based and metal carbon composite catalysts on the degradation of antibiotics by activating ps metal and non metal sites are conducive to inducing different oxidation pathways so4 oh radical oxidation and 1o2 oxidation mediated electron transfer surface bound reactive complexes and high valent metal oxidation so4 and oh are easy to attack ch s n cn bonds cc double bonds and amino groups in antibiotics 1o2 is more selective to the structure of the aniline ring and amino group and also to attacking cs cn and ch bonds surface bound active species can cleave cc sn cs and cn bonds other non radical pathways may also induce different antibiotic degradation routes due to differences in oxidation potential and electronic properties this critical review clarified the functions of active sites in producing different reactive species for selective oxidation of antibiotics via featured pathways the outcomes will provide valuable guidance of oriented regulation of active sites in heterogeneous catalysts to produce on demand reactive species toward high efficiency removing antibiotics from water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heterogeneous catalysts persulfate active sites oxidative species degradation routes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years antibiotics have been used for human and animal disease treatment the consumption of which is rising worldwide kovalakova et al 2020 as an emerging contaminant antibiotics are persistent and cumulative which are difficult to be degraded the antibiotics in natural water can induce growth of drug resistant bacteria or genes posing potential threats to the ecological environment and human health therefore antibiotics cannot be ignored in the aquatic environment at present antibiotic contaminations have attracted widespread attention by the ministry of ecology and environment of china and the u s environmental protection agency epa the removal of such emerging pollutants has also been studied extensively persulfate ps based catalytic oxidation as an advanced oxidation process aop enables the efficient removal of antibiotics the ps including peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds can be activated to produce oxidative species by heat ultraviolet ultrasonic electricity carbon materials and transition metal oxides gao et al 2022b among them heterogeneous catalytic activation has been regarded as a highly promising method kohantorabi et al 2021 heterogeneous catalysts consist of metals single metals bi metals mixed metals and layered double hydroxides metal free materials and metal non metal includes metal supported and or metal doped composites oyekunle et al 2022 ps activation by catalysts can produce radicals such as sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 and non radicals such as singlet oxygen 1o2 catalyst ps complex and high valance state metals which have different redox potentials for antibiotics removal fig 1 significantly the active sites on the catalyst surface play a key role in the generation of reactive species li et al 2021 the category and population of reactive species will determine the degradation pathways of antibiotics as well as the toxicity of degradation intermediates these issues have been addressed in numerous studies yao et al reported a simple strategy to regulate the components and coordination of conc catalysts by adjusting the zn co ratio of bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks znxco1 zifs the adjustable active sites could regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species ros thus achieving selective degradation of target pollutants in a complex matrix yao et al 2022 xie et al proposed that 1o2 was the major ros in pms or pds system for sulfonamides sas and bisphenol decomposition besides oh and so4 played dominant roles in the degradation of triazine and cbz like compounds respectively xie et al 2022 however a summary of the relationships among catalyst active sites oxidative species and pollutant degradation pathways has not yet been reported in a heterogeneous catalytic ps system herein the performance of ps activated by different heterogeneous catalysts were summarized in detail and the effects of catalyst active sites on radical or non radical production were discussed in addition the specific attacked sites in antibiotics were also presented under different dominant active species finally this review provides valuable information for regulating the active sites on catalyst surface to generate desirable oxidative species and thus helps realize the directional degradation of target pollutants in actual wastewater treatment 2 ps activation by different heterogeneous catalysts at present common heterogeneous catalysts for ps activation include metal based carbon based and metal carbon composite catalysts fig 2 these catalysts have been widely used to activate ps for the treatment of multiple antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole smx tetracycline hydrochloride tc ofloxacin ofl and ciprofloxacin cip in wastewater as shown in fig 3 sulfonamides sas possess amino group nh2 benzene part sulfa bridge so2 nh and r substituent r substituent is attached to the core structure and determines the type of sas r substituents can be roughly divided into five six and other membered heterocyclic substituents tetracyclines are broad spectrum antibiotics tcs all contain the basic skeleton of tetraphene according to the type of r group tetracycline antibiotics mainly include chlortetracycline oxytetracycline and tetracycline the basic molecular framework of fluoroquinolones norfloxacin ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin is nitrogen hybrid double union ring structure with different r groups for metal based catalysts the redox potential of different metals determins the ability of electron transfer which further influences ps activation for instance the performance of cobalt oxide may be superior to other metal oxides e g copper iron and manganese oxide for pms activation in removing antibiotics for zero valent metals metal oxides and metal sulfides the ps adsorption and activation pathways are discrepant resulting in different catalytic activities besides metal content may affect the active sites of a catalyst stoichiometric ratios can also affect the catalytic activity of polymetal based catalysts carbon based catalysts can be divided into zero dimensional 0d one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d carbon materials the catalytic performances of carbon materials are determined by pore structure defects functional groups and intrinsic atom arrangements of carbon hybridization the surface properties and functional groups of carbon materials could be significantly changed by chemical or pyrolysis control affecting the active sites and catalytic activity carbon catalysts with higher molecular dimension possess more porous structure and larger specific surface area duan et al 2015 carbon catalysts with different structures present different active site distributions and carbon networks showing different abilities for ps pollutant adsorption and electron transfer thus carbon catalysts perform difference in ps activation for antibiotics removal for metal carbon composites the presence of carbon matrix can improve the dispersion and stability of metal sites the combination of carbon and metal catalysts can greatly improve the catalytic performance by accelerating the charge transfer at the interface zhang et al 2021c besides composites built by encapsulating metal inside graphitic carbon layers can further promote carbon catalysis thus the ability of metal carbon composites for ps activation can be optimized by adjusting the metal types metal contents loading forms and preparation conditions reasonably in addition some specific reaction routes may be generated under the influence of catalyst structure thus affecting the activation efficiency of ps for instance the availability selectivity and reactivity of free radicals were greatly enhanced when the oxidative degradation process occurred in the confined nanospace zhang et al 2022b more detailed information are showed in supporting information 3 relationships between active sites and oxidative species in general antibiotics are degraded by free radical and non radical pathways in ps systems so4 oh and o2 oxidation belong to the radical pathway while 1o2 direct electron transfer high valent metal and surface complexes can induce non radical oxidation zhou et al 2021 it is worth noting that radical or non radical pathway is largely dependent on the active sites on the catalyst surface li et al 2022b at present both metal and non metal sites have been focused on for ps activation simultaneously metal and non metal sites could initiate radical and non radical pathways fig 4 transition metal and noble metal were common sites which could activate ps to degrade contaminants comparatively non metal active sites were mainly composed of c n o and s related sites and defects the same active sites may induce different reaction mechanisms different shape structure surface chemistry doping and functionalization of catalysts and local environment around the active sites may induce diverse reaction paths the active sites may present different ps adsorption capacity or result in different bond breaking in ps generating various oxidative species the intimate interactions between pds and cuo termination modulated the electron rearrangement of adsorbed pds the absorbed pds as a surface confined ros could directly attack the target organics via outer sphere electron transfer without producing free radicals zhang et al 2014 3 1 relationships between active sites and radical production so4 and oh were the dominant radicals in the ps oxidation system fig 5 shows the mechanism of radical production by ps activation for metal sites ps was activated through cycles of valence state metals the introduction of zero valence metals cu0 co0 and fe0 could react with high valence metals realizing the redox cycles moreover zero valence metals could regulate the electronic properties of catalysts notably metal ions could form metal related complexes with ps or oh which could participate in the redox cycle c n and o related sites were effective for ps activation generally electron density changed between non metal atoms due to differences in electronegativity prolonging the oo bond length in ps molecules later the oo bond of ps might be cleaved to form so4 and oh in addition ov could accommodate o atoms in peroxy bonds which led to oo bonds rupture additionally radical transformation could be observed in the ps system with metal and non metal sites activation the metal sites could be used as electron donors to carry out the redox reactions of high and low valence ions eqs 1 4 and activate ps to produce so4 and oh pms could also further reduce me n 1 to men and generate so5 eq 3 with low redox potential 1 1 v but the reduction kinetics was slower than the oxidation process eqs

based catalysts co2 could activate pms and generate so4 and oh by eqs 1 and 2 generally heterogeneous activation of pms on co based catalyst surface was achieved by electron transfer from co site to pms the electron transfer between co sites and pms generated so4 so5 realizing the redox cycle of co ii co iii and maintaining catalytic activity higher electron density could facilitate electron transfer from active sites to pms wei et al 2021 gao et al 2022a co oh could also be formed from co2 and subsequently react with hso5 forming a complex to produce so4 eqs 5 and 6 the study of zero valent metals could reduce the rapid consumption of metal ions in ps catalytic system in co2 co3 redox cycle co could promote the reduction of co3 by acting as an electron donor for pms activation resulting in co2 so4 and oh generation eqs 7 9 fe0 fe2 and fe3 could also act as metal sites to activate pds for so4 and oh production eqs 10 13 5 c o 2 h 2 o coo h h 6 coo h hso 5 c o 3 o h so 4 7 c

however the cu ii cu i cycle mainly produced so4 and oh in pms system and cu ii pms complexes produced cu i and so5 by electron transfer from ligand to metal subsequently a single electron could be transferred from the surface cu i site to pms to generate so4 and oh ding et al 2022 14 cu ii hso 5 cu iii so 4 o h 15 cu iii oh ho o so 3 cu ii ooso 3 so 4 h 2 o 16 2 cu ii ooso 3 2 h 2 o 2 cu ii 2

and cu the lower valence metals co ii and cu ii could react with hso5 and generate so4 and higher valence metals co iii and cu iii eqs 20 and 21 high state metals e g co iii cu ii cu iii could induce the production of oh by reacting with hso5 thus maintaining the charge balance equation on the catalyst surface eqs 22 24 in addition cu i was conducive to the reduction of co iii thermodynamically e0 1 64 v eq 25 due to the higher redox potential of co iii co ii 1 81 v compared to cu ii cu i 0 17 v by completing the redox cycle between various cu and co valence numerous so4 and oh were produced to degrade antibiotics efficiently guo et al 2020 meanwhile the synergistic effects of other metal sites cufe comn and cofe could also be beneficial to improve the catalytic activity and promote the production of multiple free radicals thanh binh et al 2022 wang et al 2019c yang et al 2021a the redox couples of various metals in the system can provide the synergistic effect of electron transfer for ps activation and radicals generation thanh binh et al 2022 in fecunc pds system the cooperative mechanism of fecu dual atom sites promoted the activation of ps the electrons transfer from cu to fe maintained the low valence state of fe additionally adjacent cu atoms optimized the bonding orbital distribution of fe 3d orbitals effectively the synergy of fecu bimetallic sites promoted the adsorption and cleavage of pds significantly favoring the production of active species e g so4 and oh wu et al 2022 20 co ii hso 5 co iii so 4 o h 21 cu ii hso 5 cu iii so 4 o h 22 co i i i hso 5 co i

electronic regulation by doping fe into ilmenite cotio3 physicochemical properties and electronic structure could be regulated thus enhancing the redox cycle of co ii co iii in pms system the electron accumulation at co site was attributed to the higher electronegativity of co λ 1 88 than fe λ 1 83 fe doping could modulate the electronic structure of a catalyst leading to electron cloud migration and forming electron dissipation centers fe atoms and accumulation centers adjacent co atoms the dissipation center showed a good affinity for negatively charged hso5 which was conducive to pms adsorption and further accelerated electron transfer between pms and co site besides the electron accumulation on co site could provide one electron to pms for so4 production thus showing higher catalytic activity the reduction of co iii by fe ii was thermodynamically feasible and the catalyst containing fe and co induced the rapid regeneration of co ii wei et al 2021 eqs 26 29 in addition cu doping also regulated the active species by pms activation cu doping enhanced the electron transfer between heterogeneous perovskite and pms and promoted the generation of so4 and oh gao et al 2021 in

to generate radicals eqs 30 35 gao et al 2022b as presented in fig 4 sp2 hybrid carbon and electron rich groups including co and co might serve as interfacial sites for pms activation sp2 hybrid carbon was an excellent electron transport carrier which could generate so4 and oh by activating pms through electron transfer an accelerated π electron transfer and abundant structural defects of highly graphitic carbon lattice could further promote the migration of unpaired electrons and break oo bond of pms leading to the generation of so4 and oh cc with a free flowing π electron activated pms to produce so4 and oh eqs 32 and 33 the high content of sp2 hybrid carbon structure and co group could also transfer electrons to pds to generate so4 which could further react with h2o oh to form oh eqs 36 39 the c atoms in co and co can obtain electrons from nearby o atoms due to the electronegativity facilitating pms activation wang et al 2022a the electron rich co groups on the carbon clusters with high adsorption energy e ads can enhance ps adsorption and electron transfer zhang et al 2021b co group can also prolong the oo bond in ps with the potential to convert ps into so4 and oh noticeably carbon centered persistent free radical pfr ch group was used as an electron donor to transfer electrons to pds for so4 generation subsequently ch group was oxidized into co double bond

on the surface of n doped carbon layer and then the peroxide bonds oo of pms were cleaved after accepting electrons to generate so4 and oh eqs 40 and 41 in addition to n doping n substances also affected the catalytic activity the n signals included pyridinic n 397 6 ev pyrrolic n 399 2 ev graphitic n 400 9 ev and nitric oxide no 403 9 ev chen et al 2018 the introduction of graphitic n into carbon networks could promote ps adsorption and activation via electron transfer promotion due to the high ps adsorption energies and strong charge transfer capability of graphitic n zhang et al 2021b pyridinic n can promote the transfer of free flowing π electrons from sp2 hybridized carbon thus activating ps for so4 and oh production zhang et al 2022c quaternary n and pyridinic n could act as electron donors providing electrons to pms thus forming so4 the electronegative quaternary n could result in asymmetric spin density and low electron density of the adjacent carbon which was conducive to bonding with negatively charged oxygen on the peroxide oo bond in ps thus generating so4 zhu et al 2018 besides pyridinic and pyrrolic n as lewis basic sites with lone electron pairs were able to transfer electrons to break the oh bond in pms and generate radicals eq 40 compared with pyridinic and pyrrolic n quaternary n presented stronger adsorption to pms and quaternary ammonium salt might first adsorb hso5 and then provide an electron to break the oo bond hoso4 in pms with the assistance of abundant o n s groups in carbon materials pds could be adsorbed on the catalyst surface to form cs2o8 2 complex pyridinic n and thiophenic s acted as lewis basic sites to transfer electrons to electrophilic oxygen in cs2o8 2 complex leading to the cleavage of oo bond and generation of so4 and o2 eqs 42 and 43 graphitic n doping resulted in a greater length of oo bond exhibited a larger amount of electron transfer and lower e ads and induced more positively charged c atoms for ps adsorption than pyridinic n and pyrrolic n which could facilitate the generation of so4 zhang et al 2021b 40 hso 5 e so 4 o h 41 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 o h 42 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o 2 so 4 2 ho 2 3 h 43 s 2 o 8 2 ho 2 so

directly through electron transfer or react with h2o to produce oh which could further oxidize antibiotics through hydrogen capture or hydrogenation on the other hand lattice oxygen ions o2 in metal oxides provided electrons to maintain the equilibrium of catalyst surface charge eqs 44 46 oxygen vacancy ov and lattice oxygen ol could also play an important role in pms activation a moderate number of ov was beneficial to pms adsorption a more negative e ads value and dissociation ov could accommodate an o atom of the peroxy bond in pms leading to oo bond cleavage and pms conversion to hso4 zhang et al 2021b ov could also change the charge distribution resulting in a lower positive charge of ov connected atoms and greatly decrease the adsorption energy of pds 4 87 ev li et al 2021 44 s o

with ps leading to the generation of radicals the spin state of transition metals is important for the performance of catalysts the regulation of spin states on transition metals is of great significance for improving catalytic activity modulation of the active centers spin state affects the strength of metal ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of intermediates directly leading to difference in energy barriers and charge transfer at the interface zhang et al 2023c spin states can be regulated by heteroatomic doping edges defects valence change and external magnetic field zhong et al 2021 typically high spin states with large effective magnetic moments facilitated the overlap of d orbitals with oxygen containing species e g peroxides on metal sites promoting electron transfer and ps adsorption miao et al 2021 in fenx c pms system the relative content of high spin components fe ii and fe iii was positively correlated with the catalytic performance determining the active species generation and electron transfer pathway high spin fe ii configuration s 2 with 3dz 2 orbital occupied by single electrons were conducive to pms activation to produce so4 and oh via single electron transfer process zhang et al 2022a similarly cu ii n4 can induce dominant oh so4 production in cu sac pms system yang et al 2023 moreover charge delocalization and average d band centers of metal sites may determine the intrinsic catalytic activity of metal based catalysts the synergistic effect of the homo diatomic sites can modulate the d band center and electron delocalization leading to an upshift of the d band center the upshift can facilitate strong binding of oxygen related intermediates and thus improve pms activation the coupling of fe 3d orbitals among adjacent atoms at the fe2n6 sites induced the reduced contribution of antibonding state in the feo bond thus fe2cn catalyst activated pms via the radical pathway so4 and oh li et al 2022a the bonding and antibonding states of 3dz2 σ and 3dyz dxz π in fe2cn exhibited higher energy levels due to the higher shift of d band center of fe sites in fe2cn fewer electrons occupying the antibonding state can lead to a stronger bonding strength of the oxygen atom to fe in pms therefore pms underwent decomposition at the fe2cn site with the highest d band center to generate radicals li et al 2022a for non metal sites the deep mechanisms of ps activation and radicals production have not been explored which still need further research 3 2 relationships between active sites and non radical pathways metal and non metal sites induce a variety of non radical pathways fig 4 non radical pathways include 1o2 oxidation reactive complexes catalyst ps so4 oh direct electron transfer and high valent metal oxidation generally metals or metal oxides are testified to activate pms to release radicals whereas carbon based materials are more prone to induce non radical oxidation fu et al 2022 liang et al 2022 as depicted in fig 6 metal or non metal sites can promote ps activation and produce o2 subsequently o2 as an intermediate can be transformed into 1o2 in particular n substance connected with c can increase charge density in positive c atoms which can promote ps activation by weakening oo bond and then produce o2 besides the change of charge distribution caused by n modification can also induce ps to lose an electron leading to the formation of so5 moreover electrons can transfer from ps to electrophilic co groups resulting in so5 generation defects may also lead to the cleavage of the oh bond in ps to form so5 1o2 can be generated in the following reactions of so5 and h2o ol or ov can also promote ps activation for 1o2 generation surface oh with high adsorption capacity can form surface bound complexes metal sites can also activate the peroxide bond in ps and form the metastable peroxide intermediate to attack contaminants via inner sphere interactions n related sites can lead to negative binding energy or high low electron density regions to form surface bound reactive complexes carbon materials as a conductive bridge with high conductivity are more likely to mediate electron transfer in the ps system metal and c n o related sites with the capability of accepting or providing free electrons can promote direct electron transfer from contaminants to ps contaminants that lose electrons can be oxidized and degraded into small molecules high valent metals can be generated by electron transfer from fe ii co ii cu ii and mn ii to ps and acquire electrons from pollutants for degradation 1o2 oxidation was a common non radical pathway usually 1o2 could be generated by carbon and noble metal cu doped materials catalysis in ps system multiple pathways for 1o2 production included self decomposition of pms and conversion from ol or o2 zhou et al 2021 the self decomposition of pms could produce 1o2 eq 47 whereas the reaction speed was slow pms could act as both electron donors and acceptors in n doped graphene activated pms system with the increase of charge density in positive carbon atoms caused by n modification pms was likely to provide an electron leading to the formation of so5 thereafter so5 reacted with h2o to form 1o2 eqs 48 and 49 wang et al 2019b besides ol or ov in transition metal catalysts could also produce 1o2 lattice expansion resulted in the release of ol and conversion to reactive oxygen species o which could react with pms to produce 1o2 eqs 50 and 51 the formation of mo m m co mn bonds could optimize the electronic localization of metal ions in the co2mn1o4 pms system due to the strong spatial overlap between the eg and o2p orbitals of transition metals in addition mn ions with larger ionic radius replaced co ions at the tetrahedral site resulting in tunable electronic structures of active center and the creation of vacancies at o sites meanwhile part of the o was further converted to 1o2 eq 51 the generation of ov promoted the redox cycle of mn m n 1 m co mn in the lattice eq 52 and favored interfacial electron transfer thereby ov at the catalysts interface played an important role in the formation of 1o2 chen et al 2020 additionally the ketone carbonyl co groups could also produce 1o2 through nucleophilic addition and the interaction of peroxide intermediates with pms the co groups on the lattice boundary of sp2 conjugated carbon might be important for 1o2 production peng et al 2022 the ketonic co groups with unsaturated double bonds have electrophilic properties on the contrary pms with peroxide bonds have nucleophilic properties therefore electrons could transfer from pms electron donor to co groups electron acceptor and then so5 was produced leading to s2o8 2 so4 and 1o2 generation shao et al 2018 moreover density functional theory dft calculations had been conducted to prove the thermodynamic feasibility of 1o2 generation from the interaction between pms and co sites liu et al 2021b meng et al 2020 a total exothermic energy of 8 04 ev between pms and biochar with co group proved the easy generation of 1o2 meng et al 2020 n site such as graphitic n was considered active for 1o2 production in ps system zhang et al 2022c graphitic n and pyridinic n could enhance the attraction between ps and carbon material through adjacent c atoms to weaken the oo bond and mediate 1o2 generation o2 exists as an intermediate in the production of 1o2 metal non metal sites such as pyridinic n thiophenic s fe loaded sp2 hybrid carbon structure coh co group and structural defects could promote ps activation and o2 production subsequently 1o2 could be generated either by direct reactions between o2 and h2o2 eqs 53 or by self recombination of o2 eq 54 or by recombination of superoxide ions and metastable hypervalent metal related radicals eqs 55 57 for the sdbc composite both n doping and fe loading onto the carbon layer could act as important sites to produce o2 or 1o2 eqs 58 60 and o2 could be further oxidized to 1o2 eq 53 yin et al 2019 47 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 1 o 2 48 hso 5 e so 5 h 49 2 so 5 h 2 o 2 hso 4 1 5 1 o 2 50 o v o 51 o hso 5 1 o 2 hso 4 52 2 m

an important role in the selective production of 1o2 notably adjusting the coordination environment can change the geometric structure and electronic state of active sites enabling the targeted production of 1o2 con2 2 sites were formed by electronegative n atoms and the central electropositive co atom the energy barrier was caused by the weakly positive co atoms in the coordination environment leading to the electrons transfer from pms to con2 2 and the selective generation of 1o2 mi et al 2021 the electron accumulation advantage on oo bond of pms under synergistic effect of the dual cozn sites facilitated the oo bond cleavage to form hso4 o intermediates the overlap of d orbitals of co and tdos at the fermi energy level revealed the dominant contribution of cobalt introduction to electron transfer capability the high spin density and electron accumulation advantage allowed the cozn site to adsorb specific o sites of pms thus promoting the formation of 1o2 selectively moreover fen4 sites in fe1 cn tended to adsorb the terminal o of pms promoting the formation of so5 and then generation of 1o2 selectively zhang et al 2021a however deeper mechanisms of 1o2 production by ps activation with non metal sites lack deep study surface mediated electron transfer was another non radical pathway the catalyst acted as a conductive bridge to facilitate electrons transfer from the contaminant electron donor to active complex intermediate electron acceptor the impedance of carbon catalyst affects electron transfer typically mediated electron transfer was more likely to occur in ps system activated by carbon materials rather than metals due to the good conductivity of carbon materials zhou et al 2021 a highly graphitic carbon framework together with co and n groups could facilitate electron transfer from the pollutants to the ps carbon complex initiating a non radical pathway co group was considered the main active site of the non radical pathway and the electron deficient co could perform as a mediator to promote electron transfer the n in the carbon skeleton could disrupt the chemical inertness of the carbon lattice and produce charge transfer intermediates resulting in direct charge transfer in particular in addition to carbonaceous materials similar electron migration had been found in precious metal e g ru rh ir pt and au catalyzed pms systems ahn et al 2019 notably a unique electron transfer mechanism had been demonstrated in pms system by cobalt catalysis in nanoconfined space the spike of contaminant might alter the electron transfer pathway the nanoconfined co crystal was no longer the electron donor but it might act as electron mediator transferring electrons from contaminants to pms the presence of contaminant inhibited pms decomposition which was contrary to the usual mediated electron transfer cui et al 2022 different from mediated electron transfer the reactive complex formed by surface binding could oxidize contaminants in ps systems with carbon materials and metal based catalysts the binding of marginal nitrogen configurations pyridinic n and pyrrolic n could facilitate surface adsorption and surface bound complex generation via the formation of low and high electron density regions graphitic n could lead to the negative binding energy with pms and large amounts of transferred electrons between pms and catalyst enhancing pms adsorption and surface activated pms formation with a rearranged electronic structure chen et al 2018 the interfacial interaction caused pms charge rearrangement which made the complex more reactive therefore surface characteristics of a catalyst e g hydroxyl density and zero point charge were crucial for the binding of pms on catalyst surface zhou et al 2021 besides metal free carbon materials with weak electron donating ability are not enough to break through the energy barrier of oo bond which can only make the oo bond elongate to form a surface active complex liu et al 2022a surface confined complexes can also be formed on metal sites such as cu i in pms system via inner sphere interactions without forming new chemical bond the interactions between pms and cu can manipulate the redox potential of pms and prolong the peroxide oo bond the possible inner sphere interactions may include pmsads o hc organicfree or pmsads o c organicfree bonds li et al 2020 usually the free radicals came from the reaction between ps and sp2 hybrid carbon skeleton in carbonaceous materials or electron rich groups in catalysts or from the redox reaction between ps and transition metals besides pms adsorption level determined the redox capacity of the complex and oxidation capacity in pollutant degradation metal sites transition metal oxides and noble metals can activate ps to form surface bound complexes with high reactivity yang et al 2022b ps activation can be achieved by attaching ps to the catalyst surface to form metastable and highly reactive peroxides notably the active spin states of catalyst can affect the oxidation capacity of active species and electron transfer rate during the activation of ps in mncnts m co fe mn or ni pms system pms coupled with m n sites to form surface reactive complexes depending on the spatial configuration of the d orbitals in m n sites the eg orbital of transition metals participated in σ bonding with pms by overlapping with o 2p orbitals thereby affecting bonding strength and electron transfer rates and catalytic activity for pms activation miao et al 2021 moreover the magnetic moment of a metal center plays a key role in the binding energy between a catalyst and oxygen related matter the adsorption energy was negatively correlated with the effective magnetic moment the largest adsorption energy of pms at con sites indicated that activated ps molecules are tightly bound to form reactive complexes rather than releasing so4 miao et al 2021 it is noteworthy that the intrinsic relationship between non metal sites and ps activation for reactive complexes deserves further investigation high valent metal oxidation commonly exists in the process of ps activation by fe mn and co based catalysts high valent metals such as fe iv fe v are mild oxidants compared with radicals the redox potentials for fe iv fe iii and fe v fe iv couples are 2 0 v and 1 8 v usually high valent metal species are selective oxidants that not only react with electron rich organic compounds but also resist interference from common coexisting substrates e g chlorides and bi carbonates shao et al 2022 the surface high valent metals were important active species in ps system the most common species are high valent iron species e g fe iv o fe iv and fe v fe iv was generated from fe2 by transferring two electrons to ps eqs 63 and 64 and the high valent iron acquired electrons directly from the pollutants to complete the degradation besides fe iv bound on the surface of metal based carbonaceous materials was also a major species for pollutants degradation other high valent metals such as co iv might also be generated by two electron transfer from the co ii site to pms eq 65 liu et al 2021a in addition the high valent copper and manganese cu iii and mn v were formed from the reactions of cu ii and mn ii with pms eq 66 69 chen et al 2022a generally high spin state sites with large magnetic moments were conducive to the coupling of pms promoting oxidation potential and accelerating electron transfer in fenx c pms system high spin fe iii s 5 2 sites were prone to bond with pms to produce fe v o complexes via a two electron and o atom transfer zhang et al 2022a 63 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o fe iv o 2 2 so 4 2 2 h 64 f e 2 hso 5 fe iv o 2 so 4 2 h 65 c o 2 hso 5 h 2 o co iv o 2 2 so 4 2 2 h 66 cu

were induced during ps activation due to the difference in surface adsorption energy electronic properties and charge transfer ability normally so4 and oh were generated by the breakdown of peroxygenic bonds in ps the electrons transfer and h abstraction reaction could affect the generation of so4 and oh in comparison with oh o2 and 1o2 the energy barrier required for so4 generation is the lowest liu et al 2022b two electron transfer from metal sites might lead to the formation of high valent metals surface hydroxyl groups could improve pms adsorption thus favoring the formation of surface complexes the introduction of defects affected the surface electronic properties and generated active centers defects may be more inclined to cleave the oh bond in pms to form so5 and thus to form 1o2 with h2o wang et al 2022b the inherent electronic nature of ov could accept and provide free electrons thus influencing the electron transfer orientation and transformation pathway in addition the active sites were prone to gaining or losing electrons thereby promoting pms activation through an electron transfer pathway without the involvement of ros wu et al 2021a in conclusion charge delocalization average d band centers and spin states may be the crucial factors for regulating ps activation and generating discrepant active species by metal sites in con3 pms system the unsaturated co sites with higher spin state exhibited enhanced electron donor capacity and electron flow triggering the production of high valent co species with valence change from co ii to co iv in con4 pms system the saturated co sites with lower spin states are more prone to radical generation co ii was converted to co iii with the generation of oh so4 song et al 2023 unsaturated metal sites with lower coordination possess more accessible d orbitals and less steric hindrance calle vallejo et al 2015 thus unsaturated sites with higher spin states present greater electron donating capacity higher spin states sites can induce non radical pathways via more electron transfer while sites with lower spin states may produce only radicals for non metal sites electronegativity structural defects and functional group properties differed leading to the difference of electron transfer capacity and charge density besides the different relative content of active sites in catalysts resulted in the discrepant formation of active species in ps system li et al 2021 by modulating the types of active sites carbonaceous catalysts can achieve the transition from electron donor to electron mediator the oxygen containing group contents and degree of defects are altered thus changing the dominant active species zhang et al 2022d however the internal mechanisms of ps activation by the active sites deserve further investigation so as to distinguish the specific mechanism of different sites for oxidative species generation clearly as mentioned above active sites play the key role in the formation of various active species furthermore the reaction system may also affect the generated active species the ph value of water affects the type of active species and coexisting substances can quench free radicals zhang et al 2023b for example oh and so4 can be consumed by cl resulting in the formation of less active cloh cl and cl2 chen et al 2022b wang et al 2016 co3 2 hco3 react with oh and so4 to form co3 and hco3 nevertheless the presence of co3 2 hco3 can lead to the conversion of oh and so4 wang and wang 2021 besides so4 may be the dominant radicals at low ph while so4 can react with oh to produce more oh under alkaline conditions 4 relationships between oxidative species and degradation routes ps catalytic oxidation system could produce reactive species with different oxidation potential the common active species consisted of so4 2 5 3 1 v vs nhe oh 1 9 2 7 v vs nhe and 1o2 0 81 v vs nhe xie et al 2022 gu et al 2022 different reactive species attacked specific structures or diverse groups of antibiotics thus triggering various degradation pathways free radical and non radical oxidation depended on radical and electrophilic attacks respectively 4 1 free radical attack electrophilic and radical attack sites in smx were predicted by fukui functions of f and f0 the atoms with high f values were more easily to lose electron and be oxidized by the electrophilic attack while the atoms with larger f0 values were more vulnerable to radical attack cao et al 2021 wang et al 2022b the f regions were mainly located at the benzene ring aniline and five membered ring of smx e g 2 c 4 c 6 c amino n while the f0 regions were distributed throughout the whole aniline of smx wang et al 2022b as presented in fig 7 a aniline sn bond terminal benzene ring isoxazole ring and methyl group of smx were possible reaction sites sn bond breakage benzene ring hydroxylation and aniline partial oxidation were the main pathways for smx degradation in the presence of so4 and oh due to the strong oxidability of so4 the s position in smx was vulnerable to radical attack leading to s n bond breakage since s was the most vulnerable site for free radical attack the cleavage of sn and sc bonds between the two rings favored the deep oxidation of smx yin et al 2020 after sn bond breaking oh addition on the olefinic double bonds of isoxazole rings occurred in the presence of surface bound oh due to the high reactivity of oh besides the cc in the isoxazole ring was further oxidized and the amine group in the benzene ring could be substituted by oh zhang et al 2022e the electron receiving ability of so4 was superior than oh which was beneficial for electron transfer thus so4 could attack the aniline part to generate free radical cations and then react with h2o quickly to form hydroxylated smx products besides unsaturated cc in the nitrogen containing heterocyclic ring was sensitive to be attacked via electron transfer xie et al 2022 thereby so4 could also attack the olefinic double bond in the isoxazole ring and then further hydrolyze for hydroxylation alternatively oh attacked smx molecules directly forming oh smx through addition reactions xu et al 2020 since the kinetic energy barrier values δg by oh 9 17 11 7 kcal mol 1 were lower than so4 10 2 15 6 kcal mol 1 and oh was more likely to attack compounds via hydrogen atom abstraction haa and radical adduct formation raf gao et al 2020b xie et al 2022 the oh addition onto smx δg 0 is a thermodynamically favorable process for the oh and o2 dominated systems main attack paths of smx also included aniline group oxidation hydroxylation and sn sc bond breakage specifically oh or o2 could attack the n site of the benzene ring to oxidize the amino group the high reactivity of oh with alkene double bonds in the isoxazole ring could also lead to the hydroxylation of smx xu et al 2020 in general the basic structure of sas includes the parent sulfanilamide and other substituents sulfanilamide containing aniline in sas may be the main attack site by reactive species e g oh and so4 xie et al 2022 tc is stable with a delocalized π bond however the functional groups attached to it need to be removed before the destruction of the hydrogenated tetrabenzene core the functional groups in tc e g double bonds phenolic and amine groups were vulnerable to be attacked by free radicals due to the high electron density fig 7b the c n and o atoms with larger f0 values presented high reactivity with radicals such as so4 and oh yang et al 2022a cn bond could be attacked by so4 to remove the n methyl group in 4 c the functional groups in 6 c could also be further oxidized with the existence of so4 as an electrophilic species so4 was easy to react with electron rich parts of tc such as phenolic hydroxyl to form hydrolyzable so4 adduct intermediates in solution hua et al 2022 considerable f0 values were noticed in 11a c and 2 c atoms and the 2 c 3 c and 11a c 12 c double bonds were available sites for radical attack especially oh addition yang et al 2021b common fluoroquinolones fqs include nor ofl and cip the standard redox potentials of so4 and oh are higher than the activation energies of piperazine ring hydroxylation quinolone group defluorination and hydroxylation therefore quinolones and piperazinyl might be defluorinated and dehydroxylated in the process of fluoroquinolone antibiotics degradation by ps oxidation so4 usually reacted with organic compounds through electron transfer while oh mainly reacted through hydrogen atom abstraction and minor electron transfer chen et al 2019 wu et al 2021b as shown in fig 7c for ofl 8 c 15 c and 18 c with negative pk parr functions through dft calculations exhibited high vulnerability to be attacked by electrophilic species such as so4 and oh resulting in cleavage of quinolone ring and 8 c 5 n bond in addition 9 c 2 n and 5 n of the ring and 23 o of the carboxyl group were also easy to be cracked adduced or oxidized fan et al 2020 besides the piperazine ring with high frontier electron density and oxidability can be readily attacked by oh and o2 the cc and nc bonds may be broken in the process wang et al 2018 in co knoc pms system oh was dominant in cip degradation 64 8 and followed by so4 34 2 usually cip could be degraded by defluorination quinolone ring opening and piperazine epoxidation under the attack of oh the piperazine ring in cip was attacked by oh to form c10h10fno3 quinolone ring opening and defluorination could decompose cip into c7h9no2 and c6h13n in addition c10h10fno3 oxidation could also produce c7h9no2 and downstream c6h13n and then further oxidized and transformed them into simpler organic intermediates finally mineralized to co2 and h2o liang et al 2022 generally so4 oh and o2 were more likely to attack n 5 o 25 o 23 c 17 and c 11 atoms in cip zhu et al 2022 in summary the initial reaction of free radicals with organics can significantly affect the subsequent reactions radicals with different redox potential tend to show different ability to break bonds the electron receiving ability of so4 is superior electron transfer between contaminant and so4 presents the lower free energy barrier compared with oh so4 tends to attack contaminants via an electron transfer initially rather than raf and haa so4 shows selectivity and stability while oh acts as a non selective radical therefore so4 prefers to attack electron donating groups such as amino nh2 hydroxyl ho and amide nhco r oh presents high reactivity toward most organic pollutants via electrophilic radical addition electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction kohantorabi et al 2021 based on the structure of organics the oxidative degradation path of antibiotics can be predicted and determined according to the selectivity and oxidation ability of free radicals 4 2 non radical oxidation 1o2 presented an unoccupied π 2p molecular orbital and strong electrophilic reactivity electron rich benzene and isoxazole rings in smx might undergo haa reactions whereas non radical pathway might lead to isomerization and methyl oxidation kohantorabi et al 2020 xu et al 2020 for sas aniline was electron rich which was more likely to be attacked by 1o2 rather than other pathways such as haa xie et al 2022 as shown in fig 7a 1 o2 could readily oxidize amino n in the aniline ring since the amino n with the highest f value could lose electron easily and be attacked electrophilically wang et al 2022b in addition 1o2 could also attack the highly active 2 c 4 c and 6 c atoms in the aniline of smx molecule break c s bond and crack benzene ring since these atoms with high f value were more vulnerable to electrophilic attack fig 7a the smx degradation pathway by 1o2 oxidation was different from that by oh radicals the o atom in oh is sp2 hybridization with one bonding orbital two n orbitals and one orbital occupied by an unpaired electron zhang et al 2023a the mechanism of oh attack on aromatic compounds is similar to that of electrophilic substitution the electron affinity and high reactivity of oh radicals make them less selective the 1o2 with mild oxidation capacity strong electrophilicity and selectivity can remove electrons from electron rich substances zhang et al 2021a electronic configuration of antiparallel spin paired electrons in outer orbits of 1o2 leads to the unique interaction with hydrocarbons the unique configuration allows 1o2 to attach to the electron rich double bond of the unsaturated hydrocarbon at a high rate electron rich molecular sites contribute electrons to the empty orbitals in 1o2 resulting in electrophilic interactions zeinali et al 2019 1o2 was more selective towards the amino n atom and aniline ring structure in sdbc pds system 1o2 as the dominant active species degraded smx through the following pathways oxidation of amino n to form nitro substitutional smx attack on the 6 c atom to produce n 5 methylisoxazol 3 yl sulfonic amide and n 5 methylisoxazol 3 yl methane sulfonamide and attack on the 2 c 4 c or 6 c atom to further decompose smx yin et al 2019 in addition the 1o2 was more inclined to attack the amino group of benzene ring in smx in nrgo activated pms system for example the degradation products of smx were identified as 4 nitro benzenesulfonic acids rather than sulfanilic acid which might result from s n bond breaking and 4 nitro desulfonated smx rather than desulfonated smx meanwhile 4 nitro smx formed by amino oxidation on the benzene ring 4 amino n iminomethylene benzenesulfonamide formed by isoxazole oxidation and 4 nitro n iminomethylene benzenesulfonamides obtained by further oxidation were detected the above products might be attributed to rapid oxidation of the amino group in the benzene ring by 1o2 wang et al 2019b for other non radical oxidation paths high valent metal oxo species could attack organic compounds via oxygen atom transfer hydrogen abstraction and or electron transfer zong et al 2020 fe iv was a transient species and then transformed to fe3 with the oxidation of smx semiquinone radicals would form on catalyst surface and then react with fe3 to produce fe2 the long lasting generation of fe2 resulted in the ongoing generation of fe iv dominant fe iv could lead to hydroxylation aniline oxidation and sn bond cleavage during smx degradation fig 7a in contrast the surface mediated electron transfer would result in the opening of isoxazole ring liang et al 2021 generally oh can be added to aromatic ring by electrophilic addition to form substituted hydroxylation products during the oxidation mediated by oh and so4 radical aromatics adducts eliminate oh and so4 2 to form hydroxylation products and aromatics radical cations the initial attack of fe iv on aromatic ring is also accomplished by electrophilic addition however fe iv aromatic ring adduct binds oxo oxygen atom of fe iv o2 to aromatic ring with the elimination of fe2 resulting in the formation of hydroxylation products wang et al 2022c besides the 1o2 non radicals can cause hydroxylation of pollutants via electron transfer pathway or via the formation of endoperoxide intermediates hydroxyl derivatives may be produced by the formation of aniline radicals or endoperoxide intermediates zhou et al 2017 moreover the degradation pathway of smx included hydroxylation desulfuration sn cleavage and cs cleavage with dominant surface bound reactive species wang and wang 2022 as shown in fig 7b besides electrophilic so4 and oh the non radical 1o2 could also initiate the electrophilic attack for tcs degradation the active n atom connected with 4 c also exhibited a large value of f0 0 0412 which made the n demethylation reaction more easily to occur yang et al 2021b cn bond could also be attacked by 1o2 since the low bond energy resulted in the removal of n methyl group in 4 c tc degradation was also conducted through the opening of the 6a c 10a c bond at hydrogen tetrabenzene nuclear phenyl group by electrophilic attack of 1o2 the hydrogen addition at 1 c and 11 c and the claisen rearrangement of unstable enols at 2 c 3 c and 11a c 12 c were more likely to occur during radical reactions besides the functional groups in 4 c and 6 c could be further oxidized in the presence of 1o2 moreover the demethylation and deamidation of dimethylamino group could also occur with 1o2 oxidation and electron transfer ye et al 2020 pms adsorbed by carbon based catalyst was activated to a metastable state the oo bond was weak for the electron alignment with the carbon skeleton once the electron rich pollutant was added the pollutant acted as electron donors and metastable pms acted as electron acceptors in a direct redox reaction carbon bridge can be used as an electron mediator to promote the electron transfer from pollutants to pms so as to achieve the oxidation of pollutants for the fe iv o involved system tc degradation could be achieved by electron transfer fe iv o could be reduced to fe iii due to the acceptance of electrons thus the electron donating groups of tc hydroxyl groups were more vulnerable to be attacked by active species besides the low bond energy of nc contributed to the occurrence of n demethylation fig 7b peng et al 2022 for the system dominated by surface bound radicals so4 oh nc bonds and cc bonds could be the active sites fig 7b besides hydroxyl group might be added on the phenol group of tc demethylation deamidation and hydroxylation could also occur surface bound radicals was produced and confined to the activator surface and could only react with tc on the surface or in the solution around it duan et al 2022 weng et al 2022 once the hydrogenated tetrobenzene core was opened the intermediates were more susceptible to further oxidation to simpler alcohols aldehydes and ketones and ultimately to co2 and h2o xiao et al 2022 as depicted in fig 7c the attached sites included piperazinyl substituent oxazine substituent and carboxyl group in a 1o2 dominant ofl degradation system gao et al 2019 1o2 could firstly attack nc bond and remove methyl of piperazinyl substituent to form c17h18fn3o4 subsequently c17h18fn3o4 could be transformed into c17h18fn3o5 and c15h16fn3o4 due to the oh addition oxazinyl substituent demethylation and decarboxylation besides cn bond could be attacked resulting in the open of the ring in piperazinyl substituent thus c17h18fn3o5 was transformed into c15h13fn2o4 and c11h7fn2o2 in α mno2 nanoflower pms system 1o2 and o2 dominated under alkaline conditions similar to so4 and oh 1o2 could act as an electrophilic species to rapidly react with unsaturated cc bonds and amines in cip molecules deng et al 2017 1o2 electrophilic attack could be performed on o 25 n 5 c 11 c 14 and o 23 zhu et al 2022 in addition oxidation of the piperazine ring occurred due to the dominant effect of surface bound so4 during cip degradation oyekunle et al 2021 generally free radicals own higher redox potential than pristine oxidants e g kmno4 cl2 hclo h2o2 and o3 non radical oxidation paths are considered to possess higher selectivity better ph adaptability and stronger anti interference ability e g natural organic matter oxygen containing acid ions yu et al 2022 besides the electron deficient sites low electron density can facilitate ps oxidation for 1o2 release the electron rich sites tend to promote ps reduction to form free radicals so4 and oh gao et al 2018 1o2 is selective for electron rich organics due to its electrophilic nature the selectivity of electron transfer path is based on the feasibility of ps organics adsorption on catalyst to construct ternary reaction interface and the possibility and efficiency of electron transfer among them yu et al 2022 the electron transfer path is also suitable for the degradation of electron rich substances high valent metals as a relatively powerful oxidant can react with organics via electron or atom transfer high valent meals are more reactive with electron rich moieties e g phenols anilines and amines or contaminants with low ionization potential the high selectivity of non radical paths is conducive to the efficient oxidation of target organics with high adsorption capacity and low ionized potentials avoiding the interference of impurities moreover due to the mild oxidation potential and favorable reaction pathway non radical paths can also trigger polymerization with high selectivity inducing value added polymers generation rather than simple mineralization can be a characteristic reaction of non radicals however the actual transformation paths of pollutants are also related to the type and structure of pollutants the redox properties of organic compounds will directly affect the efficiency of their conversion into polymers typically compared with high oxidizing radical systems the oxidation capacities of non radical systems are moderate leading to insufficient degradation of organic pollutants nevertheless non radical oxidation pathways are less susceptible to be influenced by coexisting substances exhibiting unique advantages in treating actual water chemical inputs can be reduced in non radical systems and the redox potential of non radical paths can be regulated by the structure composition and physicochemical properties of catalysts ren et al 2022 besides second order reaction rates k ros contaminant the types of active species concentration of active species and the reaction time can determine the degradation efficiency together therefore 1o2 has acted as the dominant active species in many research rather than so4 or oh xie et al 2022 currently the continuous flow reactors have been developed for the practical applications of ps aops due to the convenient operation and low energy consumption gao et al 2020a non radical paths have also been proved to be suitable for continuous flow reactors for example a continuous flow fixed bed pms reactor with distilled spirits lees derived biochar dslbs quartz wool was designed for smx degradation the dominant contribution of 1o2 was confirmed the continuous degradation can be achieved with a removal efficiency greater than 73 7 after 20 h indicating the stable degradation capacity of the continuous flow reactor wang et al 2022a hierarchical reactor with co3o4 pms exhibited efficient degradation of aromatic pollutants in flow mode co iv was shown to be the dominant active species playing the critical role in phenol removal the reactor can also exhibit stable catalytic performance during a 10 day experiment yi et al 2022 5 conclusion and perspective in summary the ability of different heterogeneous catalysts to activate ps was analyzed systematically moreover the contribution of active sites to the production of reactive species and the relationship between reactive species and attacked sites in antibiotics were also clarified the main conclusions are described below 1 transition metal e g co cu fe sites co co cc ch graphitic n pyridinic n ol ov and surface oh are beneficial to induce so4 and oh oxidation besides pyrrolic n and thiophenic s also favor the production of so4

transition metal sites co co cc ch graphitic n ol and ov may lead to the surface mediated electron transfer sites 5 and similar electron migration had been found with precious metals e g ru rh ir pt and au catalysis in pms systems besides transition metals sites 6 may also produce high valent metals for organics degradation 3 so4 and oh can easily attack ch sn cc amino and cn bonds in the antibiotic ring in addition so4 may also easily attack cs no phenolic hydroxyl realizing the demethylation dehydroxylation deamidation and decarboxylation of antibiotics 4 1o2 is more selective to the aniline ring and amino group which could attack cs cn and ch achieving the dehydroxylation demethylation and decarboxylation of antibiotics in addition 1o2 can also attack the hydrogen tetrabenzene nuclear phenyl group in tc electrophilically surface bound reactive species can lead to hydroxylation demethylation deacylamination desulfurization the cleavage of cc sn and cs high valent iron species are easy to attack the electron donor group e g hydroxyl cc which can lead to hydroxylation aniline oxidation demethylation splitting of sn and nc surface mediated electron transfer can break no bond and open the substituent ring which may also lead to demethylation and deacylamination of pollutants although the ps aops systems based on heterogeneous catalysis have been widely used for the removal of antibiotics in water the following points still need to be considered in future research 1 the potential interactions may exist among different active sites affecting the production of reactive species the interactions may affect electronic properties and reaction energy barrier of active sites different modes of action may lead to differential charge transfer and affect surface reactions besides the interactions may also cause obvious neighboring effects which lead to different adsorption energies among active sites neighboring effects may cause the migration of adsorption sites of ps organics the interaction effects may also result in indistinguishable selectivity of active sites for oxidative species however the major difficulty lies in extracting relevant information from different active sites the local chemical environment of the active sites can be effectively regulated by heteroatom doping different heteroatoms and species type of the same heteroatom can significantly affect the interaction of active sites the regulation of active sites can produce more favorable interactions for ideal reactive species generation which is of great significance for rational design of catalysts therefore it is necessary to recognize the interactions among different active sites and the impact on the formation of reactive species 2 different reactive species have certain selectivity for the specific attacked sites in antibiotics rational regulation of reactive species can achieve oxidation products with low toxicity alternatively the conversion of contaminants into more valuable addition polymers rather than simple mineralization would be more beneficial to achieve the carbon peaking and neutrality in complex sewage systems with multiple organic pollutants and other substances metal inorganic ions and natural organic matter selective and directional oxidation of pollutants is more necessary thus it is of great practical value to consider the optimal distribution and combination of reactive species to achieve the directional transformation of pollutants at present large knowledge and technical gaps are still presented in the relationship boundary between organic mineralization complete and non selective oxidation and polymerization selective oxidation in ps aop systems 3 currently most reports are limited to sequential batch experiments and the recycling and rational utilization of catalysts have not been better implemented in the process of actual water treatment an intelligent continuous flow reactor should be designed the stability of catalysts and utilization rate of ps oxidants can be improved by establishing feedback responses to intelligent monitoring of concentration dose which can maximize the chemicals utilization therefore it is desirable to design an intelligent continuous flow reactor in order to accelerate the application of catalytic ps aops systems in real water treatment 4 dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in wastewater dom may also be transformed when treating target pollutants in a ps aops system the interaction role between dom and heterogeneous catalysts is still unclear and the effect of dom on the reactivity of active sites is also ambiguous compared with free radical reaction non radical paths possess better selectivity and higher oxidant utilization in water with complex substances e g dom inorganic ions and natural organic matter however the reaction degree between dom and oxidation species and the inhibition of dom to target pollutants removal is lack of exploration dom complex behavior is one of the important factors affecting the migration bioavailability and toxicity of organic pollutants thus whether the biological toxicity increases after pollutants degradation is also worth further discussion more attention should be paid to the dom effects in sewage and its conversion regulation in a heterogeneous catalytic system the dom transformation path could be better regulated reducing its inhibition to target pollutants removal credit authorship contribution statement ning li conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing review editing jingya ye
