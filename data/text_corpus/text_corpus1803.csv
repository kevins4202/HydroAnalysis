9015,iran experiences insufficient precipitation resulting in excessive use of groundwater resources leading to negative water balances in many plains as a result the ministry of energy began implementing the groundwater rehabilitation and balancing plan grbp in 2006 to replenish the aquifers the plan includes measures such as blocking illegal wells biw equipping wells with volumetric meters ewvm increasing patrol and control ipc and inspecting the degree of exploitation of groundwater etc in this study researchers examined the level of social agreement between farmers and experts on the effectiveness of the ministry of energy s policies for the grbp and assessed the farmers response to droughts in this descriptive analytic study the data were collected using questionnaires designed in likert scale and they were analyzed in r programming language using the t test independent sample t test and friedman test it was found that 84 and 58 of the farmers have negative attitudes towards biw and ipc respectively farmers have demonstrated the greatest level of cooperation 90 towards the use of pressured irrigation system ipis the study revealed that farmers and experts disagree about the effectiveness of all measures in reviving and balancing groundwater resources farmers are not willing to cooperate with the government on the implementation of measures that limit their agricultural freedom according to friedman s results unlike farmers experts prefer structural and procedural measures such as blocking unauthorized wells instead of relying on educational methods and culturalization this study demonstrates how understating and discrediting farmers roles in sustainable water resources and constructing a monocentric governance system has led to the current situation which is not ideal for groundwater sustainability abbreviations grbp groundwater rehabilitation and balancing plan biw blocking illegal wells ewvm equipping wells with volumetric

879debb0bc524817a150355c359f435f 1 introduction the majority of iran is located on the world s desert belt this in addition to rapid population growth in the 21st century and food insecurity has created controversy over natural resources in iran sadeghi et al 2004 parhizkari et al 2015 jafarzadeh et al 2016 yadegari et al 2018 in iran like a lot of arid and semi arid countries groundwater is the main resource for domestic industrial and agricultural uses recently accelerating urbanization industrialization and climate changes pose threats to the quantity and quality of groundwater huan et al 2018 untapped exploitation and increasing water withdrawal from aquifers aggravate the threat to groundwater resources jafarzadeh et al 2016 the cumulative groundwater depletion has risen from 65 to 109 billion cubic meters in the period of 1994 2014 water abstraction in 291 out of 609 main aquifers in iran has been banned due to over exploitation of aquifers moridi 2017 to prevent this harmful process and preserve resources it is necessary to implement reduction and balancing policies the successful implementation of these policies needs cooperation among all stakeholders gregory and leo 2003 mohammadi kangarani and rafsanjani nezhad 2015 curtis et al 2014 prager et al 2015 qobadpour et al 2018 valizadeh et al 2017 higuchi et al 2020 the effectiveness of policies depends on the social agreement and cooperation among farmers and the government the experts and planners better understanding of farmers behavior and attitude and vice versa is fundamental to the success of any management policy therefore identifying factors influencing farmers motivation in social participation is one of the most important components of any project savari and shokati amghani 2021 a study undertaken by afshar identified factors such as the economic status of exploiters collectivist spirit the scope of farming education attitudes toward participatory irrigation management and the age of farmers are the most important factors in their willingness to participate in irrigation management the study concluded that before a water supply organization can be established conducting attitude assessment surveys selecting leading people with appropriate characteristics improving irrigation facilities and their active and sustainable participation will attract the participation of users in irrigation management afshar and zarafshani 2011 the results of a study of five irrigation networks showed that the small size of land plots and the low income of network operators are the cause of miss management problems in these networks montazer and hedarian 2000 a study by karbasi et al on the relationship and participation of researchers and farmers in the wheat production process showed that gaining farmers trust relies on measures such as raising the level of experience and skills of experts timely consultation of farmers and experts visiting professional experts and supervisors and motivating farmers to cooperate with experts karbasi et al 2010 using different methods of production and transfer technology is not only a way to develop the participation and further interaction of researchers and farmers but also change the attitude of farmers and increase their awareness croxton 1999 in their study regarding farmers satisfaction with the agricultural extension services in northwestern ethiopia elias et al identified that about 45 of farmers were dissatisfied with the extension services which showed that this program needs to be improved also their results showed that the development of demand driven extension services instead of supply based services is more effective elias et al 2016 bashirzadeh et al analyzed the existing relationships between important water sectors in iran using ucint and netdraw software and network analysis and identified the main stakeholders as well as the most vulnerable ones the study revealed that some sectors such as farmers water cooperatives and the land and water organization are not sufficiently connected with others the efficiency of water policy in tehran assessed using network analysis methods and components of governance was found to be low due to the lack of balanced distribution of power and lack of coordination and communication between water authorities and not paying attention to the good governance component in water management bashirzadeh et al 2009 studies showed that the success of farmers participation in the implementation of any water resources management policy depends on the actual involvement of farmers associations sheikh et al 2016 the implementation of such a plan has many stages and takes a long time therefore in developing such plans attention should be paid to the attitude and interest of the users montazer and hedarian 2000 regarding the level of acceptance of pressurized irrigation technologies by farmers in dashtestan city a study showed that the knowledge variable has the highest impact among other variables such as agriculture economics technic individual psychology and support affecting the acceptance of pressurized irrigation technology behbahani motlagh et al 2017 a study by zawojska led to the development of a model that showed the relationship between farmers trust and the different dimensions of the agencies performance on restructuring and modernization of the irrigation network representatives in poland this model showed that farmers trust and satisfaction with these institutions had a relationship with how agencies work and the level of services and programs provided by agencies zawojska 2010 investigation of farmers satisfaction with the installation of smart meters on water wells in the mahidasht region of kermanshah province by ghobadpour et al using a questionnaire showed that farmer s satisfaction is impacted by factors such as farmers attitude towards water protection understanding the value of water protection fair installation of meters the usefulness of meters income the farmer s opinion of his her impact on water protection access to resources needed for the protection of water education and training after meter installation qobadpour et al 2018 research carried out by alipour et al regarding the status of the groundwater rehabilitation and balancing plan grbp in the neishabour plain in iran showed that there is no necessary infrastructure to implement the project problems such as delays in information and annual statistics of protection mistakes in the water budget use of different methods to calculate water balance uninformed statistics of illegal wells and even legal withdrawals and unavailability of funds and patrols and inspections groups salaries have made the project difficult alipour et al 2016 donya and sarraf assessed the status of the plan with a view of integrated water resources management from respective of the structural administrative and social economic systems to find solutions to the existing challenges according to the analysis the formation of joint working groups of the ministry of energy and the judicial system to remove obstacles and review to accelerate the judicial process in this area and also create incentive packages to improve the cultivation pattern with changes in administrative structure and policy of defining the guidelines of the plan are among the necessities for reviewing the plan in order to promote and achieve great goals donyaei and sarraf 2018 there is a pressing need to address these problems because a considerable amount of iranian irrigation water comes from groundwater resulting in a negative balance in many aquifers therefore the grbp has been developed by the ministry of energy to prevent the decline of groundwater levels the plan is being implemented in the plains of iran such the as qazvin aquifer qp qp is one of the plains known for widespread agricultural production which like many other plains in iran has a negative groundwater balance the agricultural sector of this region by contributing 2 38 of the value added to the total agricultural sector is the second largest producer of agricultural and horticultural products in iran qazvin economic affairs and finance 2015 and accounts for more than 93 of the total water consumption in the plain abkhan consulting engineers 2013 the implementation of the grbp has been a costly project for instance in qp the cost of 15 inspection patrols to prevent violations of water resources for 24 months has been one million dollars three million dollars have been spent in 12 months to block illegal wells and 1 5 million dollars to equip 1000 wells with a volumetric meter even though more than 10 years have passed since the start of the grbp the aquifer continues to experience the same annual water level decline due to such high costs without any improvement of the groundwater level the evaluation of the project during implementation the identification of potential strengths and weaknesses and efforts to encourage the strengths and reduce the weaknesses are essential to do this we have investigated the opinions of farmers and experts about the management measures of the grbp in qp by analysis of data collected using questionnaires the study provides useful information for the ministry of energy the ministry of agriculture jahad exporters and farmers 2 data and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location of study area qazvin province with a total area of 15821 square kilometers is located between a longitude of 48 45 e to 50 50 e and a latitude of 35 37 to 36 45 in the northern and western half of the salt lake catchment of iran fig 1 the mountainous and the plain areas in the plain amount to an area of 4492 and 5059 square kilometers respectively the elevations within the plain range from 2902 to 1131 m fig 1 shows the climatic classification location of water resources and cropping pattern in the research area 2 1 2 challenges to the groundwater resources of the study area groundwater resources of qp are under serious threat fig 2 shows the changes in the unit hydrograph of the groundwater table over a 21 year period from 1998 to 2018 the period could be divided into two periods before and after the implementation of the grbp as shown in fig 2 the groundwater table continues to decline after the implementation of the grbp the aquifer has an annual negative balance of 314 million cubic meters and the withdrawal rate of renewable water is 1 26 m abkhan consulting engineers 2013 2 2 data tool 2 2 1 questionnaire separate questionnaires were developed for farmers and experts in the study in order to validate the questionnaire a 15 member panel of academicians and officials was invited to participate they have experience in sociology agriculture economics hydrology hydrogeology and social hydrology the scientists on the panel have also worked on assessing the projects and officials from the regional water company and the center for agriculture and natural resources research and education also participated people who helped revise the questionnaires were not asked to complete the questionnaire the farmers questionnaire contains two main parts while the experts questionnaire contains three main parts these questions were designed to evaluate farmers and expert reactions to groundwater reclamation and conservation strategies during droughts accordingly questionnaires with 21 questions for farmers and 12 questions for experts were developed in the case of farmers as a result of their illiteracy a face to face method was used in the case of experts it was used to avoid misunderstandings to receive precise answers and to save their time the first part of both the farmers and experts questionnaires contain questions that assess independent research variables table 1 in the second part of the questionnaire of farmers and experts containing two subparts the dependent research variables were assessed through a set of questions with five choice answers from very low to very high in the form of a likert scale the questionnaire of experts contains a third section designed to investigate their opinion about the effectiveness of the nine strategies implemented to conserve groundwater resources the detailed structure and the content of the questionnaire of both farmers and experts are given in table 1 below in this study the statistical populations were farmers and experts from agricultural jihad experts and regional water companies in the cities buin zahra takestan alborz qazvin and abyek located on qa due to the dispersion of the farmers in small cities such as abyek and buin zahra 10 villages and other cities 20 villages have been selected to determine the sample of the farmers villages that have been impacted by all grbp strategies are randomly selected in each city experts were selected from all service centers and offices of qazvin agriculture jihad organization and qazvin regional water company that have been involved in implementing grbp multi stage random sampling was employed to select the target sample from the five cities in qa this survey was conducted with 290 farmers and 100 experts according to the krejcie and morgan methods krejcie and morgan 1970 in the case of farmers as a result of their illiteracy a face to face method was used in the case of experts it was used to avoid misunderstandings to receive precise answers and to save their time 2 3 used statistical tests to analyze the data kolmogorov smirnov normality k s test chakravati laha and roy 1967 was used in this study to determine the most appropriate analysis method for the data distribution k s test results showed all variables except the last question of the expert s questionnaire followed the normal distribution at 95 confidence level based on the result of the k s test one sample t test and independent t test were used for the farmers questionnaire and first two parts of the expert questionnaire which followed normal distribution data and friedman test for the last question of the expert questionnaire to test whether farmers and experts average opinions regarding each of the study variables are statistically different from the hypothesized mean m 3 an one sample t test tos is performed kent state university libraries 2017 an independent sample t test tis is then performed to compare the means of two independent groups farmers and experts kent state university libraries 2017 the friedman fm test is conducted at the end of the analysis which is a non parametric statistical test similar to repeated measures anova it is used for comparing and ranking the mean of k strategies friedman 1937 hence we used fm test to rank the data collected from the last question in the expert questionnaire the tests were all performed in the r programming language at a 95 confidence level 3 results and discussions 3 1 respondents information a the experts according to the collected data 84 of the experts are male 25 of the respondents have 6 10 years of experience and 52 of them have a master s degree most of them are expected to have the necessary ability to make decisions due to their work experience and high level of education b the farmers the average age of the farmers is 45 years old and most of them are in the age group of 30 50 years which indicates that they are mostly in the educable and young age group in terms of gender all respondents except one were male the level of education of 74 of the farmers is secondary education or less analysis of data related to the variable having or not having a non agricultural job showed that 84 of the farmers have agriculture as their main occupation and 38 of them have jobs other than agriculture in order to assess the acceptability of agricultural jobs among the farmers the willingness of the farmers children for future agricultural jobs was investigated options for obstacles to continue farming included insufficient income water crisis lack of agricultural knowledge and interest and attractiveness of other jobs it is found that 66 of respondents children are unwilling to continue farming for two reasons insufficient income and water crisis as the statistical results showed the farming community of qp is composed of relatively young people who are forced to migrate to cities and the capital due to a lack of job security and insufficient income therefore creating jobs in other industries and fields such as tourism handicrafts carpet weaving and animal husbandry that do not require higher knowledge and education in addition to conserving water resources can prevent social harm caused by water shortages in the future 3 2 evaluation of the effectiveness of the implemented strategies 3 2 1 the level of farmers cooperation to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented strategies on the rehabilitation and balancing of groundwater resources the experts opinions on the reaction of the farmers to the implemented strategies in the region including blocking illegal wells biw equipping wells with volumetric meters ewvm increasing patrol and control ipc and implementing pressured irrigation system ipis was examined table 2 table 2 illustrates that 83 of the experts believe that the farmers did not cooperate with biw in order to preserve groundwater resources and 17 believed in the farmers cooperative behavior half of the experts believe that the farmers have cooperated by equipping wells with volumetric and smart meters and 42 of them believe that the farmers are cooperative towards ipc according to most of the experts 90 of the farmers have cooperated with the measure of applying pressurized irrigation systems according to the experts the farmers do not cooperate with any strategy that led to the reduction of water extraction and areas under cultivation as a result the feasibility of such schemes will be fraught with difficulty lawlessness and sometimes heavy financial and social costs thus considering the cooperative behavior of the farmers towards the application of pressurized irrigation systems the expansion of this system without affecting the area under cultivation should be given more attention and support by the government 3 2 2 evaluating the effectiveness of the strategies implemented in this section the opinion of farmers and experts on the effectiveness of measures taken in maintaining groundwater resources were examined table 3 also to determine the level of awareness of the perspective of the farmers by the experts the answers obtained were tested using t is table 4 3 2 2 1 analysis of the experts opinion the average response of the experts to the impact of measures such as biw t 99 4 45 p 000 ewvm t 99 5 26 p 000 ipc t 99 3 61 p 000 and ipis t 99 2 88 p 005 taken to maintain groundwater resources differed significantly from the theoretical average m 3 according to experts their impacts have been high 3 2 2 2 analysis of the farmers opinion according to the t os obtained there is no significant difference between the average farmer s opinion and the theoretical average m 3 of the two proposed measures biw t 289 0 21 p 83 and ewvm t 289 0 51 p 61 according to the farmers the reason for the ineffectiveness of these methods is the lack of comprehensiveness of the plan throughout the region as well as the intermittent neutrality of government officials in the proper implementation of these strategies which lead to farmers breaking the rules of the system the method and guidelines used to execute grbp cause farmers to move to other places or options where there is a lack of rules and government practices because they do not want to reduce the area of cropland or change the cropping pattern additionally the mean of the farmers response on the two measures of ipc and ipis have significant differences from the theoretical average m 3 this difference is negative for ipc strategy which indicates the inefficiency of this measure on the restoration of aquifers according to the farmers t 289 3 77 p 000 the difference of the actions of ipis is positive which indicates the effectiveness of this action on the restoration of the aquifer from the perspective of the farmers t 289 12 66 p 000 3 2 2 3 the level of agreement between experts and farmers table 4 shows that farmers m 3 02 sem 0 10 differ from experts m 3 52 sem 0 12 regarding the impact of blocking illegal wells on groundwater quantity t 388 3 25 p 001 the average value of farmers opinions m 3 05 sem 0 09 about ewvm was lower than the average value of experts m 3 51 sem 0 10 according to an independent test t 388 3 42 p 0 001 thus farmers did not believe the measure would end the negative balance compared with the average opinions of farmers m 2 67 sem 0 09 experts thought m 3 38 sem 0 11 patrols and control should be increased t 388 5 19 p 000 in addition farmers m 4 02 sem 0 08 and experts m 3 29 sem 0 10 disagreed about ipis effectiveness t 388 5 68 p 000 as shown in fig 2 the trend of water table changes has not changed after the implementation of the grbp while according to the experts this plan is considered to be effective and efficient unfortunately the government tends to implement measures that are only temporary solutions without considering the opinion of all stockholders such measures wouldn t address the problem this stresses the importance of formulating management measures that are agreed on by all stakeholders and that treat the root cause of the problem 3 2 3 the effect of the measures taken on farmers incomes the average response of the farmers on the effectiveness of all four measures taken has a significant difference from the theoretical average table 5 this difference is positive for the measures biw t 289 5 81 p 000 and ewvm t 289 5 70 p 000 and negative for ipc t 289 3 13 p 002 indicating a significant and low impact of the measures in the reduction of the income of farmers respectively the average of the significant difference of ipis was positive hence according to the farmers opinion had a positive impact on their income t 289 17 73 p 000 analysis of the results of the previous measures shows that in order to increase the success of the project and the agreement of stakeholders using pressurized irrigation system while keeping the area under cultivation constant can be implemented as a priority followed by options such as biw and ewvm the farmers and experts believe that the effect of ipc on reducing the drawdown of the aquifer and their income has been low table 3 table 4 thus the continuation of the current system of ipc has no justification and it is necessary to apply smart patrolling and controlling and revise the current method the analysis of the farmers behavior shows that they have been cooperative in applying methods that have positively affected their income this implies that the government should look for solutions that cause the least financial and social harm to the farmer as they are one of the most vulnerable stakeholders the government can establish and support low water consuming industries in arid and semi arid regions of the country to preserve the employment and livelihood of the farmers in this way while controlling the decline of the aquifer attention can be paid to maintaining the livelihood of the farmers 3 3 evaluation of the future of project implementation 3 3 1 evaluation of the effectiveness of future measures in this section possible future measures including government support for the water market reduction of import tariffs on agricultural products and the impact of pre planting crop prices on the cultivation pattern and the water resources management from the perspective of the farmers and the experts are discussed table 6 3 3 1 1 analysis of the experts opinion as can be seen in table 6 the mean of the responses of the experts on the two strategies are government support for the water market t 99 6 44 p 48 and determining the cultivation pattern based on the specified price of products t 99 13 08 p 001 has a significant difference from the theoretical average m 3 the difference is positive which implies that the effectiveness of each of these strategies on groundwater resources management will be high in fact according to the experts if the price of crops before planting is known the farmers acceptance of planting more affordable crops will be high the mean of the experts responses on the strategy of reducing import tariffs does not differ significantly t 99 1 25 p 012 from the theoretical average m 3 this shows that the effectiveness of this strategy on groundwater management will be moderate 3 3 1 2 analysis of the farmers opinion examining the effectiveness of the strategies on groundwater resources management from the perspective of the farmers based on the results of t os in table 6 shows there are statistically significant differences between the theoretical mean m 3 and the mean response of the farmers on different strategies the difference between the theoretical mean and the mean farmers response to the two strategies government support for the water market t 289 3 04 p 003 and the reduction of import tariffs on agricultural products is negative t 289 8 05 p 000 which indicates the low impact of these strategies on groundwater resources management the farmers oppose this strategy because lowering import tariffs on agricultural products will reduce sales of domestic products the difference between the theoretical mean m 3 and the mean response of the farmers on the strategy of determining the cultivation pattern based on the specified price of crops is positive t 289 16 53 p 000 which shows that determining the price in the market before planting the crop would have a great effect on the cultivation pattern similar to research from hashemi et al 2019 this study found that the farmers determine the pattern of cultivation based on the most profitable crops 3 3 1 3 the level of agreement between experts and farmers as a result of comparing the opinions of experts and farmers about the effectiveness of the above strategies table 7 shows that the experts m 3 65 sem 0 10 and farmers m 2 73 sem 0 09 disagree with the government s support for the water market strategy t 388 6 85 p 000 the average response of the experts to the strategy was higher than that of the farmers suggesting that the experts viewed the case as more effective than the farmers similar to the strategy of reducing agricultural import tariffs experts m 3 15 sem 0 12 had a higher average than farmers m 2 34 sem 0 08 t 388 5 58 p 001 the results of t is in table 7 showed that there is a similarity between the opinions of the experts m 4 01 sem 0 08 and the farmers m 4 09 sem 0 07 about the strategy of determining the cultivation pattern based on the specified price of crops t 388 0 82 p 41 given this issue if the government sets a guaranteed purchase price for products with high economic value and low water consumption positive change will be observed in the process of reviving the aquifer measures such as reducing import tariffs on agricultural products and supporting the water market which have not been considered by the farmers can play an effective role in reviving the aquifer because they provide information about the price of water and products and will automatically prevent the planting of products that have no real economic justification with better information about water prices the choice of cultivation pattern according to the amount of water consumption the improvement of water use efficiency and the use of modern technologies will rapidly accelerate reducing import tariffs will also prevent prices from rising too much in such circumstances if the government creates a platform for the formation of other industries with less water needs the farmers will be led to choose the best strategy 3 4 farmers response to water shortages and review of solutions in case of an insufficient farmers income 3 4 1 the farmers response to water shortages from the perspective of farmers and the experts table 8 measures proposed to be implemented to address water shortage drought are discussed including planting crops that require less water reducing the area under cultivation and avoiding the planting of crops and selling water 3 4 1 1 analysis of the experts opinion the average of the responses of experts on strategies of avoiding planting crops and selling water t 99 5 65 p 001 and reducing the area under cultivation t 99 2 55 p 012 are significantly different from the theoretical average table 8 the difference is negative which shows that the farmers are less inclined to choose these strategies during the dry season the average of the response of experts on the strategy of planting crops with less water requirement t 99 071 p 48 is not significantly different from the theoretical average m 3 which shows that according to the experts the farmers tendency to choose this strategy during the dry season is moderate 3 4 1 2 analysis of the farmers opinion based on the t os given in table 8 the mean of the responses of the farmers on all of the three strategies deviates significantly from the theoretical average the difference between the theoretical average and the mean of the response of the farmers on the measure to reduce the area underplanting crops t 289 6 30 p 000 is a large positive number showing that the use of this strategy during the dry season will be of interest to the farmers while the use of planting crops with less water requirements t 289 9 04 p 000 and avoiding planting crops and selling water is of lower interest t 289 20 67 p 000 the results show that the farmers are not willing to choose the option of no planting under low water conditions this will lead to further extractions from the aquifer and the creation of a reverse hydraulic gradient in qp the reverse gradient near the salt marsh has caused the salt to enter the aquifer even under such problems agriculture continues in the region this underscores the importance of the farmers job security and should be given serious consideration by the government through methods such as expanding other occupations when reviewing rehabilitation policies 3 4 1 3 the level of agreement between experts and farmers the values of t is obtained are used to compare the opinions of experts and farmers on measures to be taken during drought these values indicate that there is no agreement between the opinions of the experts and the farmers towards all the three measures proposed table 9 for the strategy of planting crops with less water requirement the experts average opinion m 2 93 sem 0 10 was higher than the farmers m 2 18 sem 0 09 t 388 5 60 p 000 additionally for the strategy of not planting crops and selling water farmers m 1 59 sem 0 07 had a lower average than experts m 2 42 sem 0 10 t 388 6 76 p 000 therefore experts believe farmers choose these two strategies because they are the most effective on the other hand the average opinion of the farmers about the strategy of reducing the area under cultivation m 3 57 sem 0 09 is higher than of the experts m 2 67 sem 0 13 which indicates that the farmers reduce the area under cultivation in times of drought t 388 5 71 p 000 3 4 2 review of some strategies used in case of insufficient income from agriculture in this section the degree of effectiveness of measures such as changing the pattern of cultivation and job technology development water purchase and sale of water in the absence of agricultural income is assessed table 10 3 4 2 1 analysis of experts opinions the t os corresponding to the response of the experts show that the mean of the response of experts on the two management measures changing the pattern of cultivation t 99 3 68 p 001 and application of pressurized irrigation system t 99 5 16 p 001 is significantly different from the theoretical average table 10 the averages of the response of the experts on the selected solutions changing job t 99 0 42 p 67 water purchase t 99 0 92 p 35 and water sale t 99 0 74 p 46 do not have a significant difference from the theoretical average m 3 indicating the low contribution of the solutions to support the farmers 3 4 2 2 analysis of farmers opinion the results of t os in table 10 showed that the average of the response of the farmers on the use of modern irrigation methods in case of insufficient income from agricultural products t 289 0 48 p 64 is not significantly different from the theoretical average m 3 this indicates that the farmers do not choose to use the method according to the farmers the use of strategies including changing the pattern of cultivation t 289 4 16 p 001 water sales t 289 30 02 p 001 changing job t 289 4 49 p 001 and water purchase t 289 2 55 p 01 have a significant difference from the theoretical average 3 the negative average difference in all four strategies showed that the use of the strategies is minimal as the initial information about the farmers showed most of them do not have a high level of literacy or a specific profession other than agriculture thus agriculture is the only job they can do and as the results showed they incline less to change jobs if agriculture does not support them 3 4 2 3 the level of agreement between experts and farmers as the results of t is in table 11 showed there is no agreement between the opinions of the experts m 3 34 sem 0 09 and the farmers m 2 61 sem 0 10 on the choice of strategy changing the cultivation pattern t 388 5 55 p 000 according to farmers m 2 95 sem 0 10 applying pressurized irrigation systems improves their livelihood in contrast to experts m 3 46 sem 0 09 t 388 3 72 p 000 in terms of changing jobs there was no agreement between famers m 2 57 sem 0 10 and experts m 2 96 sem 0 10 t 388 2 89 p 004 farmers opinions on changing jobs were significantly higher than those of experts also both farmers m 1 34 sem 0 9 and experts m 3 08 sem 1 08 opposed selling water in times of low agricultural income t 388 14 36 p 000 in the mentioned strategy the average of the experts opinion was higher than the farmers which showed that the experts believe that the farmers support the strategies more than the farmers say they choose those strategies but the farmers m 2 76 sem 0 10 and the experts m 2 91 sem 0 10 agreed on the choice of water purchase strategy to further increase income t 388 1 11 p 226 3 5 ranks of policies in order of their effectiveness in the rehabilitation of groundwater reserves the friedman ranking test was used to compare and rank nine policies based on their effectiveness in the conservation of groundwater reserves based on the opinion of experts according to the results of the friedman test biw is highly effective and has the first rank while the policy of creating trust between the farmers and managers of the agricultural sector is the least effective one and stood ninth the ranks of all the nine policies are given in table 12 below based on the results of friedman s test presented in table 12 it can be inferred that the experts prefer investing in the implementation of strategies with structural measures such as blocking unauthorized wells and applying pressurized irrigation systems to policies including nonstructural measures such as building trust and raising awareness as the results of the previous sections showed the farmers do not show participatory behavior towards such strategies based on the independent t test both framers and exporters disagreed on most of the strategies given that the implementation of any action requires a series of financial credit technical social and cultural infrastructures it seems that the measures envisaged in this plan have been selected without considering all the effective aspects the policies that are selected as the most effective ones by the experts are only quick fixes that would worsen the problem in the long run instead of reversing the problem which in management is called a fix that backfires braun 2002 4 conclusion this study investigated the opinion of and agreement between farmers and experts on groundwater rehabilitation strategies implemented in qp by collecting data using two separate questionnaires the opinion of farmers and experts regarding the effectiveness of possible future measures are also investigated furthermore based on the response of the experts nine policies affecting the conservation of groundwater reserves were ranked based on their degree of effectiveness by doing so the study unveils the reasons behind the failure of the groundwater rehabilitation strategies to meet their target of replenishing the groundwater reserve in qp the study identified a significant difference of opinion and a lack of social agreement between farmers and experts on the impact and implementation of the plan the study attributes the following reasons to the failure of the plan to meet its target preparation of the plan without thorough study of social issues arising from it and lack of sufficient credit to run measures simultaneously in iran around 80 of farmers have farming land less than 10 ha in size and 11 have less than one hectare these farms less than 10 ha make up about 37 of the cultivated area but produces less than 10 of marked agricultural production faostat 2017 that means many of them are mainly subsistence farmers and any decision that reduces his or her water rights will be met with a reaction which needs to be considered at the highest level as was proven by yazdanpanah et al 2014 and mahdavi 2021 additionally farmers with less than 10 ha account for a greater percentage of the irrigated areas about 50 faostat 2017 as a result agriculture sectors small farms represent the highest portion of water use which is not associated with a large economic impact a conflict exists between farmers and the government which must be considered in order to find an equilibrium nobody wants to disrupt based on the analysis and interpretation of the results of this study the following conclusions are made a careful and thorough study on the reaction of farmers and their cooperation towards the implementation of groundwater resources rehabilitation policies should precede the implementation of the policies strategies included in the groundwater rehabilitation plan should focus on treatment of the root cause of the problem rather than the symptoms of the problem talking to farmers and convincing them to change their practice should necessarily be done before the implementation of groundwater resources rehabilitation plans the consent of all stakeholders involved must be obtained before implementing management measures in addition it is important to mention the limitations of the study to collect data researchers have had to travel to different locations which has taken a lot of time and money lack of funding and time constraints have limited research on psychological variables especially trust moreover farmers illiteracy impacted the level of questions that we were able to ask 5 recommendations the implementation of the grbp has different results in different regions depending on the available water resources diversity of industries other sources of income and the number of small landowners in order to improve the plan the hydraulic economic and social parameters should be defined in such a way that the plan has the same result for everyone therefore it is suggested that the implementation of each project be accompanied by social economic and hydrological evaluation of working groups in the pilot areas to examine the pros and cons of the project according to the hydraulic economic and social results for future research it is suggested that the cooperation of sociologists and water experts the degree of effectiveness of the rehabilitation and balancing plan and the priorities given to each action within the plan be investigated the study did not assess psychological variables that lead to agreement between farmers and experts we suggest future studies analyze this research gap declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9015,iran experiences insufficient precipitation resulting in excessive use of groundwater resources leading to negative water balances in many plains as a result the ministry of energy began implementing the groundwater rehabilitation and balancing plan grbp in 2006 to replenish the aquifers the plan includes measures such as blocking illegal wells biw equipping wells with volumetric meters ewvm increasing patrol and control ipc and inspecting the degree of exploitation of groundwater etc in this study researchers examined the level of social agreement between farmers and experts on the effectiveness of the ministry of energy s policies for the grbp and assessed the farmers response to droughts in this descriptive analytic study the data were collected using questionnaires designed in likert scale and they were analyzed in r programming language using the t test independent sample t test and friedman test it was found that 84 and 58 of the farmers have negative attitudes towards biw and ipc respectively farmers have demonstrated the greatest level of cooperation 90 towards the use of pressured irrigation system ipis the study revealed that farmers and experts disagree about the effectiveness of all measures in reviving and balancing groundwater resources farmers are not willing to cooperate with the government on the implementation of measures that limit their agricultural freedom according to friedman s results unlike farmers experts prefer structural and procedural measures such as blocking unauthorized wells instead of relying on educational methods and culturalization this study demonstrates how understating and discrediting farmers roles in sustainable water resources and constructing a monocentric governance system has led to the current situation which is not ideal for groundwater sustainability abbreviations grbp groundwater rehabilitation and balancing plan biw blocking illegal wells ewvm equipping wells with volumetric

created controversy over natural resources in iran sadeghi et al 2004 parhizkari et al 2015 jafarzadeh et al 2016 yadegari et al 2018 in iran like a lot of arid and semi arid countries groundwater is the main resource for domestic industrial and agricultural uses recently accelerating urbanization industrialization and climate changes pose threats to the quantity and quality of groundwater huan et al 2018 untapped exploitation and increasing water withdrawal from aquifers aggravate the threat to groundwater resources jafarzadeh et al 2016 the cumulative groundwater depletion has risen from 65 to 109 billion cubic meters in the period of 1994 2014 water abstraction in 291 out of 609 main aquifers in iran has been banned due to over exploitation of aquifers moridi 2017 to prevent this harmful process and preserve resources it is necessary to implement reduction and balancing policies the successful implementation of these policies needs cooperation among all stakeholders gregory and leo 2003 mohammadi kangarani and rafsanjani nezhad 2015 curtis et al 2014 prager et al 2015 qobadpour et al 2018 valizadeh et al 2017 higuchi et al 2020 the effectiveness of policies depends on the social agreement and cooperation among farmers and the government the experts and planners better understanding of farmers behavior and attitude and vice versa is fundamental to the success of any management policy therefore identifying factors influencing farmers motivation in social participation is one of the most important components of any project savari and shokati amghani 2021 a study undertaken by afshar identified factors such as the economic status of exploiters collectivist spirit the scope of farming education attitudes toward participatory irrigation management and the age of farmers are the most important factors in their willingness to participate in irrigation management the study concluded that before a water supply organization can be established conducting attitude assessment surveys selecting leading people with appropriate characteristics improving irrigation facilities and their active and sustainable participation will attract the participation of users in irrigation management afshar and zarafshani 2011 the results of a study of five irrigation networks showed that the small size of land plots and the low income of network operators are the cause of miss management problems in these networks montazer and hedarian 2000 a study by karbasi et al on the relationship and participation of researchers and farmers in the wheat production process showed that gaining farmers trust relies on measures such as raising the level of experience and skills of experts timely consultation of farmers and experts visiting professional experts and supervisors and motivating farmers to cooperate with experts karbasi et al 2010 using different methods of production and transfer technology is not only a way to develop the participation and further interaction of researchers and farmers but also change the attitude of farmers and increase their awareness croxton 1999 in their study regarding farmers satisfaction with the agricultural extension services in northwestern ethiopia elias et al identified that about 45 of farmers were dissatisfied with the extension services which showed that this program needs to be improved also their results showed that the development of demand driven extension services instead of supply based services is more effective elias et al 2016 bashirzadeh et al analyzed the existing relationships between important water sectors in iran using ucint and netdraw software and network analysis and identified the main stakeholders as well as the most vulnerable ones the study revealed that some sectors such as farmers water cooperatives and the land and water organization are not sufficiently connected with others the efficiency of water policy in tehran assessed using network analysis methods and components of governance was found to be low due to the lack of balanced distribution of power and lack of coordination and communication between water authorities and not paying attention to the good governance component in water management bashirzadeh et al 2009 studies showed that the success of farmers participation in the implementation of any water resources management policy depends on the actual involvement of farmers associations sheikh et al 2016 the implementation of such a plan has many stages and takes a long time therefore in developing such plans attention should be paid to the attitude and interest of the users montazer and hedarian 2000 regarding the level of acceptance of pressurized irrigation technologies by farmers in dashtestan city a study showed that the knowledge variable has the highest impact among other variables such as agriculture economics technic individual psychology and support affecting the acceptance of pressurized irrigation technology behbahani motlagh et al 2017 a study by zawojska led to the development of a model that showed the relationship between farmers trust and the different dimensions of the agencies performance on restructuring and modernization of the irrigation network representatives in poland this model showed that farmers trust and satisfaction with these institutions had a relationship with how agencies work and the level of services and programs provided by agencies zawojska 2010 investigation of farmers satisfaction with the installation of smart meters on water wells in the mahidasht region of kermanshah province by ghobadpour et al using a questionnaire showed that farmer s satisfaction is impacted by factors such as farmers attitude towards water protection understanding the value of water protection fair installation of meters the usefulness of meters income the farmer s opinion of his her impact on water protection access to resources needed for the protection of water education and training after meter installation qobadpour et al 2018 research carried out by alipour et al regarding the status of the groundwater rehabilitation and balancing plan grbp in the neishabour plain in iran showed that there is no necessary infrastructure to implement the project problems such as delays in information and annual statistics of protection mistakes in the water budget use of different methods to calculate water balance uninformed statistics of illegal wells and even legal withdrawals and unavailability of funds and patrols and inspections groups salaries have made the project difficult alipour et al 2016 donya and sarraf assessed the status of the plan with a view of integrated water resources management from respective of the structural administrative and social economic systems to find solutions to the existing challenges according to the analysis the formation of joint working groups of the ministry of energy and the judicial system to remove obstacles and review to accelerate the judicial process in this area and also create incentive packages to improve the cultivation pattern with changes in administrative structure and policy of defining the guidelines of the plan are among the necessities for reviewing the plan in order to promote and achieve great goals donyaei and sarraf 2018 there is a pressing need to address these problems because a considerable amount of iranian irrigation water comes from groundwater resulting in a negative balance in many aquifers therefore the grbp has been developed by the ministry of energy to prevent the decline of groundwater levels the plan is being implemented in the plains of iran such the as qazvin aquifer qp qp is one of the plains known for widespread agricultural production which like many other plains in iran has a negative groundwater balance the agricultural sector of this region by contributing 2 38 of the value added to the total agricultural sector is the second largest producer of agricultural and horticultural products in iran qazvin economic affairs and finance 2015 and accounts for more than 93 of the total water consumption in the plain abkhan consulting engineers 2013 the implementation of the grbp has been a costly project for instance in qp the cost of 15 inspection patrols to prevent violations of water resources for 24 months has been one million dollars three million dollars have been spent in 12 months to block illegal wells and 1 5 million dollars to equip 1000 wells with a volumetric meter even though more than 10 years have passed since the start of the grbp the aquifer continues to experience the same annual water level decline due to such high costs without any improvement of the groundwater level the evaluation of the project during implementation the identification of potential strengths and weaknesses and efforts to encourage the strengths and reduce the weaknesses are essential to do this we have investigated the opinions of farmers and experts about the management measures of the grbp in qp by analysis of data collected using questionnaires the study provides useful information for the ministry of energy the ministry of agriculture jahad exporters and farmers 2 data and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location of study area qazvin province with a total area of 15821 square kilometers is located between a longitude of 48 45 e to 50 50 e and a latitude of 35 37 to 36 45 in the northern and western half of the salt lake catchment of iran fig 1 the mountainous and the plain areas in the plain amount to an area of 4492 and 5059 square kilometers respectively the elevations within the plain range from 2902 to 1131 m fig 1 shows the climatic classification location of water resources and cropping pattern in the research area 2 1 2 challenges to the groundwater resources of the study area groundwater resources of qp are under serious threat fig 2 shows the changes in the unit hydrograph of the groundwater table over a 21 year period from 1998 to 2018 the period could be divided into two periods before and after the implementation of the grbp as shown in fig 2 the groundwater table continues to decline after the implementation of the grbp the aquifer has an annual negative balance of 314 million cubic meters and the withdrawal rate of renewable water is 1 26 m abkhan consulting engineers 2013 2 2 data tool 2 2 1 questionnaire separate questionnaires were developed for farmers and experts in the study in order to validate the questionnaire a 15 member panel of academicians and officials was invited to participate they have experience in sociology agriculture economics hydrology hydrogeology and social hydrology the scientists on the panel have also worked on assessing the projects and officials from the regional water company and the center for agriculture and natural resources research and education also participated people who helped revise the questionnaires were not asked to complete the questionnaire the farmers questionnaire contains two main parts while the experts questionnaire contains three main parts these questions were designed to evaluate farmers and expert reactions to groundwater reclamation and conservation strategies during droughts accordingly questionnaires with 21 questions for farmers and 12 questions for experts were developed in the case of farmers as a result of their illiteracy a face to face method was used in the case of experts it was used to avoid misunderstandings to receive precise answers and to save their time the first part of both the farmers and experts questionnaires contain questions that assess independent research variables table 1 in the second part of the questionnaire of farmers and experts containing two subparts the dependent research variables were assessed through a set of questions with five choice answers from very low to very high in the form of a likert scale the questionnaire of experts contains a third section designed to investigate their opinion about the effectiveness of the nine strategies implemented to conserve groundwater resources the detailed structure and the content of the questionnaire of both farmers and experts are given in table 1 below in this study the statistical populations were farmers and experts from agricultural jihad experts and regional water companies in the cities buin zahra takestan alborz qazvin and abyek located on qa due to the dispersion of the farmers in small cities such as abyek and buin zahra 10 villages and other cities 20 villages have been selected to determine the sample of the farmers villages that have been impacted by all grbp strategies are randomly selected in each city experts were selected from all service centers and offices of qazvin agriculture jihad organization and qazvin regional water company that have been involved in implementing grbp multi stage random sampling was employed to select the target sample from the five cities in qa this survey was conducted with 290 farmers and 100 experts according to the krejcie and morgan methods krejcie and morgan 1970 in the case of farmers as a result of their illiteracy a face to face method was used in the case of experts it was used to avoid misunderstandings to receive precise answers and to save their time 2 3 used statistical tests to analyze the data kolmogorov smirnov normality k s test chakravati laha and roy 1967 was used in this study to determine the most appropriate analysis method for the data distribution k s test results showed all variables except the last question of the expert s questionnaire followed the normal distribution at 95 confidence level based on the result of the k s test one sample t test and independent t test were used for the farmers questionnaire and first two parts of the expert questionnaire which followed normal distribution data and friedman test for the last question of the expert questionnaire to test whether farmers and experts average opinions regarding each of the study variables are statistically different from the hypothesized mean m 3 an one sample t test tos is performed kent state university libraries 2017 an independent sample t test tis is then performed to compare the means of two independent groups farmers and experts kent state university libraries 2017 the friedman fm test is conducted at the end of the analysis which is a non parametric statistical test similar to repeated measures anova it is used for comparing and ranking the mean of k strategies friedman 1937 hence we used fm test to rank the data collected from the last question in the expert questionnaire the tests were all performed in the r programming language at a 95 confidence level 3 results and discussions 3 1 respondents information a the experts according to the collected data 84 of the experts are male 25 of the respondents have 6 10 years of experience and 52 of them have a master s degree most of them are expected to have the necessary ability to make decisions due to their work experience and high level of education b the farmers the average age of the farmers is 45 years old and most of them are in the age group of 30 50 years which indicates that they are mostly in the educable and young age group in terms of gender all respondents except one were male the level of education of 74 of the farmers is secondary education or less analysis of data related to the variable having or not having a non agricultural job showed that 84 of the farmers have agriculture as their main occupation and 38 of them have jobs other than agriculture in order to assess the acceptability of agricultural jobs among the farmers the willingness of the farmers children for future agricultural jobs was investigated options for obstacles to continue farming included insufficient income water crisis lack of agricultural knowledge and interest and attractiveness of other jobs it is found that 66 of respondents children are unwilling to continue farming for two reasons insufficient income and water crisis as the statistical results showed the farming community of qp is composed of relatively young people who are forced to migrate to cities and the capital due to a lack of job security and insufficient income therefore creating jobs in other industries and fields such as tourism handicrafts carpet weaving and animal husbandry that do not require higher knowledge and education in addition to conserving water resources can prevent social harm caused by water shortages in the future 3 2 evaluation of the effectiveness of the implemented strategies 3 2 1 the level of farmers cooperation to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented strategies on the rehabilitation and balancing of groundwater resources the experts opinions on the reaction of the farmers to the implemented strategies in the region including blocking illegal wells biw equipping wells with volumetric meters ewvm increasing patrol and control ipc and implementing pressured irrigation system ipis was examined table 2 table 2 illustrates that 83 of the experts believe that the farmers did not cooperate with biw in order to preserve groundwater resources and 17 believed in the farmers cooperative behavior half of the experts believe that the farmers have cooperated by equipping wells with volumetric and smart meters and 42 of them believe that the farmers are cooperative towards ipc according to most of the experts 90 of the farmers have cooperated with the measure of applying pressurized irrigation systems according to the experts the farmers do not cooperate with any strategy that led to the reduction of water extraction and areas under cultivation as a result the feasibility of such schemes will be fraught with difficulty lawlessness and sometimes heavy financial and social costs thus considering the cooperative behavior of the farmers towards the application of pressurized irrigation systems the expansion of this system without affecting the area under cultivation should be given more attention and support by the government 3 2 2 evaluating the effectiveness of the strategies implemented in this section the opinion of farmers and experts on the effectiveness of measures taken in maintaining groundwater resources were examined table 3 also to determine the level of awareness of the perspective of the farmers by the experts the answers obtained were tested using t is table 4 3 2 2 1 analysis of the experts opinion the average response of the experts to the impact of measures such as biw t 99 4 45 p 000 ewvm t 99 5 26 p 000 ipc t 99 3 61 p 000 and ipis t 99 2 88 p 005 taken to maintain groundwater resources differed significantly from the theoretical average m 3 according to experts their impacts have been high 3 2 2 2 analysis of the farmers opinion according to the t os obtained there is no significant difference between the average farmer s opinion and the theoretical average m 3 of the two proposed measures biw t 289 0 21 p 83 and ewvm t 289 0 51 p 61 according to the farmers the reason for the ineffectiveness of these methods is the lack of comprehensiveness of the plan throughout the region as well as the intermittent neutrality of government officials in the proper implementation of these strategies which lead to farmers breaking the rules of the system the method and guidelines used to execute grbp cause farmers to move to other places or options where there is a lack of rules and government practices because they do not want to reduce the area of cropland or change the cropping pattern additionally the mean of the farmers response on the two measures of ipc and ipis have significant differences from the theoretical average m 3 this difference is negative for ipc strategy which indicates the inefficiency of this measure on the restoration of aquifers according to the farmers t 289 3 77 p 000 the difference of the actions of ipis is positive which indicates the effectiveness of this action on the restoration of the aquifer from the perspective of the farmers t 289 12 66 p 000 3 2 2 3 the level of agreement between experts and farmers table 4 shows that farmers m 3 02 sem 0 10 differ from experts m 3 52 sem 0 12 regarding the impact of blocking illegal wells on groundwater quantity t 388 3 25 p 001 the average value of farmers opinions m 3 05 sem 0 09 about ewvm was lower than the average value of experts m 3 51 sem 0 10 according to an independent test t 388 3 42 p 0 001 thus farmers did not believe the measure would end the negative balance compared with the average opinions of farmers m 2 67 sem 0 09 experts thought m 3 38 sem 0 11 patrols and control should be increased t 388 5 19 p 000 in addition farmers m 4 02 sem 0 08 and experts m 3 29 sem 0 10 disagreed about ipis effectiveness t 388 5 68 p 000 as shown in fig 2 the trend of water table changes has not changed after the implementation of the grbp while according to the experts this plan is considered to be effective and efficient unfortunately the government tends to implement measures that are only temporary solutions without considering the opinion of all stockholders such measures wouldn t address the problem this stresses the importance of formulating management measures that are agreed on by all stakeholders and that treat the root cause of the problem 3 2 3 the effect of the measures taken on farmers incomes the average response of the farmers on the effectiveness of all four measures taken has a significant difference from the theoretical average table 5 this difference is positive for the measures biw t 289 5 81 p 000 and ewvm t 289 5 70 p 000 and negative for ipc t 289 3 13 p 002 indicating a significant and low impact of the measures in the reduction of the income of farmers respectively the average of the significant difference of ipis was positive hence according to the farmers opinion had a positive impact on their income t 289 17 73 p 000 analysis of the results of the previous measures shows that in order to increase the success of the project and the agreement of stakeholders using pressurized irrigation system while keeping the area under cultivation constant can be implemented as a priority followed by options such as biw and ewvm the farmers and experts believe that the effect of ipc on reducing the drawdown of the aquifer and their income has been low table 3 table 4 thus the continuation of the current system of ipc has no justification and it is necessary to apply smart patrolling and controlling and revise the current method the analysis of the farmers behavior shows that they have been cooperative in applying methods that have positively affected their income this implies that the government should look for solutions that cause the least financial and social harm to the farmer as they are one of the most vulnerable stakeholders the government can establish and support low water consuming industries in arid and semi arid regions of the country to preserve the employment and livelihood of the farmers in this way while controlling the decline of the aquifer attention can be paid to maintaining the livelihood of the farmers 3 3 evaluation of the future of project implementation 3 3 1 evaluation of the effectiveness of future measures in this section possible future measures including government support for the water market reduction of import tariffs on agricultural products and the impact of pre planting crop prices on the cultivation pattern and the water resources management from the perspective of the farmers and the experts are discussed table 6 3 3 1 1 analysis of the experts opinion as can be seen in table 6 the mean of the responses of the experts on the two strategies are government support for the water market t 99 6 44 p 48 and determining the cultivation pattern based on the specified price of products t 99 13 08 p 001 has a significant difference from the theoretical average m 3 the difference is positive which implies that the effectiveness of each of these strategies on groundwater resources management will be high in fact according to the experts if the price of crops before planting is known the farmers acceptance of planting more affordable crops will be high the mean of the experts responses on the strategy of reducing import tariffs does not differ significantly t 99 1 25 p 012 from the theoretical average m 3 this shows that the effectiveness of this strategy on groundwater management will be moderate 3 3 1 2 analysis of the farmers opinion examining the effectiveness of the strategies on groundwater resources management from the perspective of the farmers based on the results of t os in table 6 shows there are statistically significant differences between the theoretical mean m 3 and the mean response of the farmers on different strategies the difference between the theoretical mean and the mean farmers response to the two strategies government support for the water market t 289 3 04 p 003 and the reduction of import tariffs on agricultural products is negative t 289 8 05 p 000 which indicates the low impact of these strategies on groundwater resources management the farmers oppose this strategy because lowering import tariffs on agricultural products will reduce sales of domestic products the difference between the theoretical mean m 3 and the mean response of the farmers on the strategy of determining the cultivation pattern based on the specified price of crops is positive t 289 16 53 p 000 which shows that determining the price in the market before planting the crop would have a great effect on the cultivation pattern similar to research from hashemi et al 2019 this study found that the farmers determine the pattern of cultivation based on the most profitable crops 3 3 1 3 the level of agreement between experts and farmers as a result of comparing the opinions of experts and farmers about the effectiveness of the above strategies table 7 shows that the experts m 3 65 sem 0 10 and farmers m 2 73 sem 0 09 disagree with the government s support for the water market strategy t 388 6 85 p 000 the average response of the experts to the strategy was higher than that of the farmers suggesting that the experts viewed the case as more effective than the farmers similar to the strategy of reducing agricultural import tariffs experts m 3 15 sem 0 12 had a higher average than farmers m 2 34 sem 0 08 t 388 5 58 p 001 the results of t is in table 7 showed that there is a similarity between the opinions of the experts m 4 01 sem 0 08 and the farmers m 4 09 sem 0 07 about the strategy of determining the cultivation pattern based on the specified price of crops t 388 0 82 p 41 given this issue if the government sets a guaranteed purchase price for products with high economic value and low water consumption positive change will be observed in the process of reviving the aquifer measures such as reducing import tariffs on agricultural products and supporting the water market which have not been considered by the farmers can play an effective role in reviving the aquifer because they provide information about the price of water and products and will automatically prevent the planting of products that have no real economic justification with better information about water prices the choice of cultivation pattern according to the amount of water consumption the improvement of water use efficiency and the use of modern technologies will rapidly accelerate reducing import tariffs will also prevent prices from rising too much in such circumstances if the government creates a platform for the formation of other industries with less water needs the farmers will be led to choose the best strategy 3 4 farmers response to water shortages and review of solutions in case of an insufficient farmers income 3 4 1 the farmers response to water shortages from the perspective of farmers and the experts table 8 measures proposed to be implemented to address water shortage drought are discussed including planting crops that require less water reducing the area under cultivation and avoiding the planting of crops and selling water 3 4 1 1 analysis of the experts opinion the average of the responses of experts on strategies of avoiding planting crops and selling water t 99 5 65 p 001 and reducing the area under cultivation t 99 2 55 p 012 are significantly different from the theoretical average table 8 the difference is negative which shows that the farmers are less inclined to choose these strategies during the dry season the average of the response of experts on the strategy of planting crops with less water requirement t 99 071 p 48 is not significantly different from the theoretical average m 3 which shows that according to the experts the farmers tendency to choose this strategy during the dry season is moderate 3 4 1 2 analysis of the farmers opinion based on the t os given in table 8 the mean of the responses of the farmers on all of the three strategies deviates significantly from the theoretical average the difference between the theoretical average and the mean of the response of the farmers on the measure to reduce the area underplanting crops t 289 6 30 p 000 is a large positive number showing that the use of this strategy during the dry season will be of interest to the farmers while the use of planting crops with less water requirements t 289 9 04 p 000 and avoiding planting crops and selling water is of lower interest t 289 20 67 p 000 the results show that the farmers are not willing to choose the option of no planting under low water conditions this will lead to further extractions from the aquifer and the creation of a reverse hydraulic gradient in qp the reverse gradient near the salt marsh has caused the salt to enter the aquifer even under such problems agriculture continues in the region this underscores the importance of the farmers job security and should be given serious consideration by the government through methods such as expanding other occupations when reviewing rehabilitation policies 3 4 1 3 the level of agreement between experts and farmers the values of t is obtained are used to compare the opinions of experts and farmers on measures to be taken during drought these values indicate that there is no agreement between the opinions of the experts and the farmers towards all the three measures proposed table 9 for the strategy of planting crops with less water requirement the experts average opinion m 2 93 sem 0 10 was higher than the farmers m 2 18 sem 0 09 t 388 5 60 p 000 additionally for the strategy of not planting crops and selling water farmers m 1 59 sem 0 07 had a lower average than experts m 2 42 sem 0 10 t 388 6 76 p 000 therefore experts believe farmers choose these two strategies because they are the most effective on the other hand the average opinion of the farmers about the strategy of reducing the area under cultivation m 3 57 sem 0 09 is higher than of the experts m 2 67 sem 0 13 which indicates that the farmers reduce the area under cultivation in times of drought t 388 5 71 p 000 3 4 2 review of some strategies used in case of insufficient income from agriculture in this section the degree of effectiveness of measures such as changing the pattern of cultivation and job technology development water purchase and sale of water in the absence of agricultural income is assessed table 10 3 4 2 1 analysis of experts opinions the t os corresponding to the response of the experts show that the mean of the response of experts on the two management measures changing the pattern of cultivation t 99 3 68 p 001 and application of pressurized irrigation system t 99 5 16 p 001 is significantly different from the theoretical average table

the response of the farmers on the use of modern irrigation methods in case of insufficient income from agricultural products t 289 0 48 p 64 is not significantly different from the theoretical

showed that the use of the strategies is minimal as the initial information about the farmers showed most of them do not have a high level of literacy or a specific profession other than agriculture thus agriculture is the only job they can do and as the results showed they incline less to change jobs if agriculture does not support them 3 4 2 3 the level of agreement between experts and farmers

groundwater reserves the friedman ranking test was used to compare and rank nine policies based on their effectiveness in the conservation of groundwater reserves based on the opinion of experts according to the results of the friedman test biw is highly effective and has the first rank while the policy of creating trust between the farmers and managers of the agricultural sector is the least effective one and stood ninth the ranks of all the nine policies are given in table 12 below based on the results of friedman s test presented in table 12 it can be inferred that the experts prefer investing in the implementation of strategies with structural measures such as blocking unauthorized wells and applying pressurized irrigation systems to policies including nonstructural measures such as building trust and raising awareness as the results of the previous sections showed the farmers do not show participatory behavior towards such strategies based on the independent t test both framers and exporters disagreed on most of the strategies given that the implementation of any action requires a series of financial credit technical social and cultural infrastructures it seems that the measures envisaged in this plan have been selected without considering all the effective aspects the policies that are selected as the most effective ones by the experts are only quick fixes that would worsen the problem in the long run instead of reversing the problem which in management is called a fix that backfires braun 2002 4 conclusion this study investigated the opinion of and agreement between farmers and experts on groundwater rehabilitation strategies implemented in qp by collecting data using two separate questionnaires the opinion of farmers and experts regarding the effectiveness of possible future measures are also investigated furthermore based on the response of the experts nine policies affecting the conservation of groundwater reserves were ranked based on their degree of effectiveness by doing so the study unveils the reasons behind the failure of the groundwater rehabilitation strategies to meet their target of replenishing the groundwater reserve in qp the study identified a significant difference of opinion and a lack of social agreement between farmers and experts on the impact and implementation of the plan the study attributes the following reasons to the failure of the plan to meet its target preparation of the plan without thorough study of social issues arising from it and lack of sufficient credit to run measures simultaneously in iran around 80 of farmers have farming land less than 10 ha in size and 11 have less than one hectare these farms less than 10 ha make up about 37 of the cultivated area but produces less than 10 of marked agricultural production faostat 2017 that means many of them are mainly subsistence farmers and any decision that reduces his or her water rights will be met with a reaction which needs to be considered at the highest level as was proven by yazdanpanah et al 2014 and mahdavi 2021 additionally farmers with less than 10 ha account for a greater percentage of the irrigated areas about 50 faostat 2017 as a result agriculture sectors small farms represent the highest portion of water use which is not associated with a large economic impact a conflict exists between farmers and the government which must be considered in order to find an equilibrium nobody wants to disrupt based on the analysis and interpretation of the results of this study the following conclusions are made a careful and thorough study on the reaction of farmers and their cooperation towards the implementation of groundwater resources rehabilitation policies should precede the implementation of the policies strategies included in the groundwater rehabilitation plan should focus on treatment of the root cause of the problem rather than the symptoms of the problem talking to farmers and convincing them to change their practice should necessarily be done before the implementation of groundwater resources rehabilitation plans the consent of all stakeholders involved must be obtained before implementing management measures in addition it is important to mention the limitations of the study to collect data researchers have had to travel to different locations which has taken a lot of time and money lack of funding and time constraints have limited research on psychological variables especially trust moreover farmers illiteracy impacted the level of questions that we were able to ask 5 recommendations the implementation of the grbp has different results in different regions depending on the available water resources diversity of industries other sources of income and the number of small landowners in order to improve the plan the hydraulic economic and social parameters should be defined in such a way that the plan has the same result for everyone therefore it is suggested that the implementation of each project be accompanied by social economic and hydrological evaluation of working groups in the pilot areas to examine the pros and cons of the project according to the hydraulic economic and social results for future research it is suggested that the cooperation of sociologists and water experts the degree of effectiveness of the rehabilitation and balancing plan and the priorities given to each action within the plan be investigated the study did not assess psychological variables that lead to agreement between farmers and experts we suggest future studies analyze this research gap declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

9016,maize production is essential for global food security and represents a major supply in several value chains however the projected effects of climate change are likely to decrease drastically water availability for crops in many regions affecting yield agrivoltaics av systems are an innovative solution that may improve maize resilience in water scarce regions mainly by protecting plants from excessive radiation and by reducing irrigation needs however shade from panels may also affect crop development and production this study addresses the interplay between radiation transmission crop development and irrigation needs of maize cropping in field conditions by the description of crop development dynamics distinguishing between fixed and dynamic panels we showed that maize crop responded to both independent and combined stresses shade and water deficit with a significant decrease in leaf area index total dry matter and grain yield concerning water use we showed the potential of av to reduce irrigation inputs by up to 19 47 compared to unshaded plots via reduced soil water depletion and reference evapotranspiration the crop development was impacted by shade by increasing phyllochron and causing a generalized delay in phenology at a finer temporal scale we concluded that maize leaves react to shade by reducing stomatal conductance net assimilation of co2 and leaf temperature in a correlated way to radiation opening the possibility to use this behavior to optimize water use and shading strategies the spatial heterogeneities of radiation in fixed av systems compared to dynamic av systems were identified as a second order effect at the plot level on leaf area index and phyllochron compared to the effect of radiation reduction moreover dynamic av showed their ability to reduce the spatial heterogeneities in soil water depletion showing the importance of controlled shade strategies in av systems concerning water use keywords agrivoltaic systems maize shading deficit irrigation crop production data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction maize is one of the most important cereals in the world together with rice and wheat currently produced on nearly 55 million hectares in 174 countries faostat 2022 its production is essential for global food security and represents a primary source of food in several countries worldwide mainly in latin america asia and africa poehlman 2013 due to their irreplaceable nutritional content playing at the same time an important role in the livelihoods of millions of poor farmers from an economical point of view maize grain and its derivatives provide raw materials for industry oil fibers fermentable sugars starch etc and their supply is important for several value chains

withdrawals constraints shen et al 2008 will have significant negative effects on maize production basso and ritchie 2014 even if maize has an efficient use of water high yields require between 500 and 800 mm of water per season depending on the climate making it necessary to provide irrigation in many regions of the world conversely global cereal production on irrigated land would decrease by 47 without irrigation supply corresponding to a loss of around 20 of the total cereal production siebert and döll 2010 additionally models reveal that climate changes could increase the net irrigation water requirement of maize by up to 20 in 2080 depending on the region oumarou abdoulaye et al 2019 this should exacerbate the already high tensions on water resources particularly in water scarce regions agrivoltaics av systems are an innovative solution that would make it possible to grow crops while preserving land resources and producing renewable energy mamun et al 2022 since the first agrivoltaic experiments were performed in france marrou et al 2013a marrou et al 2013b av systems have proven their capacity to protect crops face to some climatic hazards particularly by intercepting radiations that would be excessive for the crops wang and sun 2018 and by improving the resilience of cropping systems to climate variability amaducci et al 2018 av systems also represent a potential way to save water by reducing irrigation needs due to the decrease of evapotranspiration elamri et al 2018 barron gafford et al 2019 al agele et al 2021 various types of av systems have been developed the most common with fixed panels only mounted over the crop fixed av more recently structures integrating sophisticated tracking systems dynamic av or dav have made it possible to control the movement of panels generally to maximize energy production by maintaining direct exposure of the panels to the sun rotation of panels can be thought to optimize radiation available for the crop grown under the panels valle 2017 this being one of the principal agronomic advantages of dynamic av compared to fixed av for crop production tahir and butt 2022 however the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of shading should be examined in detail in av distinguishing between fixed and dynamic systems particularly as the temporal patterns of transmitted radiation to crops under dynamic av take place over the short term with characteristic times of a few minutes and short distances with characteristic lengths of a few centimeters when following the movements of the panels modifying and complexifying the spatial characteristics of crop environment compared to full sun conditions or fixed av despite the above advantages solar panels also compete with plants for radiation which can affect crop growth and production high shading during sensitive phenological stages of maize negatively affects dry matter reed et al 1988 yield components and grain quality andrade and ferreiro 1996 earley et al 1966 jia et al 2011 leaf and shoot growth and morphology ephrath et al 1993 gao et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 there are no detailed studies carried out on av to evaluate their agronomical impacts on maize crop dynamics phenology soil water depletion leaf expansion biomass production photosynthesis and transpiration agroforestry research has explored the impact of shaded environments but the differences in the nature of shading and its temporal variability in these systems make it difficult to extrapolate the results to av in agroforestry characterized by irregular and porous shade associated with the canopy cover while in av characterized by regular and not porous shade the influence of av on soil water balance has already been studied for various irrigated crops such as fruit trees and some cereals mamun et al 2022 for maize a crop particularly sensitive to the effect of soil water content on yield the potential of av to manage water stress remains to explore also considering the extensive worldwide range of water conditions of maize cropping these systems must be assessed under drought or deficit irrigation strategies considering erratic rainfall extreme weather or irrigation shortages particularly deficit or regulated deficit irrigation is one strategy for maximizing yields per unit of irrigation water applied to several crops including maize huang et al 2011 zou et al 2021 to remedy the current lack in the literature this paper essentially tackles the interplay between radiation transmission crop development and irrigation needs of maize cropping in field conditions this is done through the description of crop development dynamics and crop indicators as well as the differences of this interplay between fixed and dynamic av systems comparing them with control case full sun based on experiments we analyze contrasting situations in terms of shading conditions by different av devices generating different shading spatial and temporal patterns and water conditions irrigation treatments the aim is to create a knowledge base for further studies of the complementary controls piloting of the shade and piloting of irrigation and their optimization in terms of water consumption energy production and crop development which are known to be partially conflicting goals 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and environmental conditions this study was conducted in the south of france mediterranean climate maize crop zea mays l ragt ixabel was grown for three years 2019 2020 and 2021 in the agrivoltaic experimental platform of lavalette inrae montpellier france 43 6466 n 3 8715 e covering an area of 1720 m² fig 1 sowing in the 2020 and 2021 seasons took place on april 2 and april 16 respectively while in 2019 sowing took place on may 3 the length of the seasons was of 138 144 and 152 days for 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively sowing and harvest were done at the same date for all treatments each season the environmental conditions during the three cropping seasons were characterized by daily averaged values of five relevant meteorological variables measured in fullsun plot air temperature t air relative humidity of the air rh incident global radiation rg reference evapotranspiration eto and rainfall r supplementary fig s1 the total amount of rainfall was modified in av plots by using the methodology showed by elamri et al 2018b to consider the effect of panels in rainfall interception daily air temperatures varied between 12 and 31 c in 2019 between 10 and 28 c in 2020 and between 9 and 27 c in 2021 the 2019 and 2021 seasons were characterized by more overcast days particularly in 2021 while 2020 was characterized by cloudy days observed at the beginning of the cropping season and mostly sunny days during the irrigation period rainfall during the cropping periods amounted to 150 264 and 324 mm in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively this coupled with the fact that rainfall events were mainly out of the irrigation period in 2019 and 2020 indicates that in 2021 experiments occurred in a rainy season whereas in 2019 and 2020 during dry conditions typical cultural practices have been adopted in a similar way during the three cropping seasons sufficient nitrogen amounts have been delivered to all plots during sowing to prevent nitrogen stress conditions 2 2 experimental platform characteristics and experimental design the platform is composed of four av plots with photovoltaic panels held at 4 m above the ground resulting in different incoming radiation conditions for the crops the two fixed tilt av plots avfull and avhalf without tracker systems consist of monocrystalline photovoltaic panels 1 58 0 81 m installed with a fixed tilt angle of 25 with respect to the horizontal plane and aligned in strips of 22 4 m oriented in the east west direction the avfull plot corresponds to the full density of panels as in optimal design for a solar energy production plant producing a shading rate of approx 50 reduction of 50 of total global radiation available for the crop in the plot surface during a day the avhalf consists of the same design of avfull plot but with the half density of panels one row of panels removed out of two to limit radiation reduction producing a shading rate of approx 30 the two 1 axis dynamic av plots called dav dynamic agrivoltaics were added in 2014 on the eastern and western sides of the fixed subsystem with 3 and 4 strips respectively each strip in dav consists of monocrystalline photovoltaic panels 1 98 1 00 m aligned in 19 m long strips and oriented in the north south direction the strips are electrically controlled according to a horizontal axis rotation strategy thought to maximize radiation interception by the photovoltaic panels this strategy consists of the panels faces following the course of the sun by varying the tilt angle of the strips between 50 e and 50 w the resulting shading rate in dav devices is about 35 which is similar to the avhalf structure but with different subscale patterns regarding the drop shadows of the panels in space and time the control plot without panels is called fullsun representing a shading rate of 0 it covers an area of 1760 m² and is located immediately south of the av plots without being affected by the shadow generated by the panels more details about the av platform of lavalette were described by elamri et al 2018 depending on the season the shading conditions have been crossed with three different irrigation treatments fully irrigated treatment fi deficit irrigated treatment di and not irrigated treatment ni fi plots were irrigated when soil water potential dropped to 80 kpa comfort limit for the silt sandy soil texture of the site based on tensiometer readings watermark probes irrometer company riverside usa at different depths considering the dynamics of root water uptake and based on 30 cm readings between 60 and 80 days after sowing das on the mean of 30 60 cm between 80 and 100 das and on mean of 30 60 90 cm from 100 das until the end of irrigations around 120 das di plots were irrigated between 120 kpa to 150 kpa soil water potential range to induce moderate water stress the irrigation periods took place during das 55 112 57 days 69 122 53 days and 52 126 74 days in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively water was applied using an integral sprinkler system in fixed amounts of 40 mm to fill the soil water reserve of the first 30 cm and prevent water loss by deep percolation in av irrigated plots the amount was multiplied by 0 7 amounts of 28 mm in order to adapt to the approx 30 radiation reduction in dav and avhalf the pipes were installed each year before the irrigation period and removed before harvest irrigation applications to each treatment were measured with calibrated mechanical flow meters for each plot uniform water distribution among plots was ensured by a constant pressure water supply in a relatively flat topography controlled with a variable speed drive booster pump and control pressure valves table 1 shows the experimental design matrix indicating the level of combined stress and the variables studied for each cropping season 2 3 climate and soil water potential monitoring microclimate data were recorded with a 10 min time step at a height of 2 m a weather station was installed close to the fullsun plot the air temperature t air and relative humidity of the air rh by digital thermo hygrometer cs215 campbell sci inc incident global radiation rg and total global radiation rg tot that is a cumulated measure of rg in a period by pyranometer sp1110 campbell sci inc rain r by pluviometer 52203 rm young company and wind speed w by an anemometer 05103 l rm young company air temperature and global radiation measurements were also made in the av plots the thermo hygrometers in the av plots were installed in dav west and avfull plots for the 2019 cropping season and dav west and avhalf plots for the 2020 and 2021 cropping seasons the thermo hygrometers installed in av plots were installed at a point covered by panels to differentiate from not covered sensors in the weather station installed for fullsun conditions the pyranometers in av plots were installed in two different locations inter panels ip and under panels up to capture the differences in the spatial intra day patterns of radiation transmission under the photovoltaic strips reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated with the fao 56 equation allen et al 1998 using the recorded data of each plot at a daily timestep radiation in av plots was the average of ip and up sensors and rainfall amounts were corriged to consider the effect of the panels using the methodology showed by elamri et al 2018b the other variables relative humidity air temperature and wind speed less affected by the solar panels marrou et al 2013a due to the height of the structure about the crop were assumed as the same for all treatments and taken from the fullsun weather station soil water status was monitored by soil water potential measurements swp using soil water potential sensors watermark also recorded every 10 min at 4 depths 30 60 90 120 cm since solar panels are likely to cause large heterogeneity on soil moisture after rainfalls elamri et al 2018b swp was also measured in two positions ip and up for av plots similarly to radiation measurements see fig 2 2 4 crop phenology vegetative growth and production plant emergence was characterized by counting the number of visible plants that emerged in 12 rows per treatment through a determined stripe of 13 m covering an area of 123 m² the emergence stage date was reported when the percentage of emerged plants reached at least 50 the phenological development of the maize crop was monitored under the different water and radiative conditions by median dates of vegetative stages leaf number and flowering stages tasselling and silking which corresponded to the date when 50 of the plants reached the stage the count in vegetative and flowering stages was carried out under each plot and for different rows in 430 tagged maize plants covering an average total area of 60 m² per plot leaf number monitoring was carried out only for the 2021 cropping season from v2 2 leaf stage until first visible flowers appeared n leaf stage corresponding to final number of leaves by weekly counting of deployed leaves commonly the ligulate leaves for the maize crop iowa scale commonly used in maize studies as described by abendroth et al 2011 the dates of the reproductive stages were identified in the 2020 and 2021 cropping seasons tasseling vt and silking r1 starting when at least one extruded anther or one extruded silk was visible in all tagged plants all the phenology results are presented using plant age time das commonly used in agronomy during the three years of experiments the vegetative growth has been characterized by around 12 weekly measurements of leaf area index lai using the lai 2200 c licor system from early vegetative development until observing a decrease in lai after the maximum lai values measuring ten values of lai across a parallel central line between two central rows in each plot crop production has been estimated at harvest by sampling of 40 tagged plants to estimate the total dry matter tdm of aerial part only leaves stem ears and dry grain yield gy for the three seasons following standard methods individual plants sampled without the root were separated into leaves stem and ears the samples were then oven dried at a constant temperature of 65 c for 72 h and weighed individually separating the ears from the leaves and the shoots dry kernels were separated from the cob to estimate gy harvest index values hi have been calculated as the ratio of gy and aerial tdm at maturity kawano 1990 data on tdm and gy were subjected to analysis of variance anova using r package r stats version 2 0 the means were considered different if the p value was less or equal to 0 05 p 0 05 for all analyses the normality and the independence of residuals and the intra treatment variance equality were checked daily growing degree days gdd cd were calculated following the classical approach gdd t mean t base where t mean is the mean air temperature calculated as the daily average of 10 minute recorded data and t base is the base temperature assumed 6 c as identified for this species in the south of france conditions brisson et al 1992 then we evaluated the relationships between gdd and leaf number employing the phyllochron phy cd leaf concept also rendered as leaf appearance 1 dos santos et al 2022a the phy is used to describe the growth and development of plants especially cereals by the relationship between leaf number and thermal time gdd accumulation we fit linear models to compute phyllochron values where the slope of the line is the phy for the entire leaf vegetative period model fit was assessed by r squared to provide an additional angle of analysis we extrapolated this concept to analyze the radiation associated to the appearance of one more leaf by introducing the phy r mj leaf computed as phy but using radiative time accumulated daily rg tot instead of gdd 2 5 gas exchange measurements plant gas exchanges stomatal conductance and photosynthesis have been measured for different sunny days with clear sky conditions whenever possible during the 2021 season with a targas 1 portable photosynthesis system pp systems to identify the impacts of photosynthetic active radiation variations par on stomatal conductance gs and on the net photosynthesis assimilation rate a the apparatus was mounted to pinch a leaf horizontally taking care to avoid shadows from the plot or other plants measurements started early in the morning and ended in the afternoon 3 results 3 1 impact of the solar panels on agrometeorological variables fig 3 shows the total amounts of the key agrometeorological variables measured in the different shading conditions we preferred to show thermal time instead air temperature because is a more relevant empirical driver of crop growth and is mostly used in maize studies water inputs consider rainfall and irrigation in figs 4 6 we focus our study on radiation and air temperature reductions under panels which are the two expected and documented variables affected in av systems and that impact crop development in many ways relative humidity and wind were excluded from our analysis because of their marginal variations between the av devices of lavalette marrou et al 2013a and their secondary role in crop development in fig 3 the total solar radiation measured under the panels in the different av plots led to shading rates of 29 38 in dav 30 35 in avhalf and 54 56 in avfull depending on the season these measured rates are consistent with those obtained previously in the same plots valle et al 2017 the cumulated thermal time cumulated gdd did not vary significantly within the treatments mainly because of the slight differences observed in air temperature fig 4 as expected the reference evapotranspiration reductions in av were proportional to shading rates the analysis of total water input rainfall plus irrigation shows that fully irrigated plots reached in general the reference evapotranspiration except for fullsun in 2019 in deficit irrigated plots the water inputs were in general lower than eto by 21 44 in fullsun by 6 23 in dav and by 9 10 in avhalf in fullsun not irrigated plot water inputs were 51 53 lower than eto however in avfull these values were only 6 17 this is not surprising since radiation is the first driver of eto equation however these results partly describe the effect of panels on the water budget showing their impact on reduced reference evapotranspiration the solar panels could affect the wind speed in each plot differently in a minimal way see marrou et al 2013a which represents a limitation on the usefulness of the calculated eto values the study of the impacts of solar panels on water budget will be delved in section 3 2 thanks to soil water depletion analysis a more detailed analysis based on the water budget including actual evapotranspiration was not included given the uncertainties on different terms and due to spatial variability to analyze the intraday and daily dynamic patterns of incident radiation and air temperature we focus on the 2019 cropping season because this year the monitored plots had more similar hydric conditions reducing the risk of the influence of latent heat in air temperature measurements fig 4 shows that the daily means of air temperature were only slightly affected by the presence of panels for the three years of experiments with temperature reductions under panels in the range of 0 to 1 5 c however when considering hourly temperature means obtained from values taken each 10 min the differences between the av plots and the fullsun plot were wider ranging between 5 and 3 c in other words higher differences only exist in the intraday air temperature values with possible short term effects on crop health air temperature reductions in av plots occurred mainly during the nighttime and then around the solar midday fig 6a on the other hand air temperature augmentations in av plots were observed in the afternoon around 17 00 probably caused by air speed depletion around this time of the day the slight reductions in daily air temperature registered in av compared to fullsun also imply slightly reductions in daily gdd between 0 0 and 0 5 cd in dav and between 0 0 and 1 2 cd in avfull resulting in a seasonal reduction in cumulated gdd of 89 and 110 cd respectively fig 6b the spatial patterns of the available radiation under the av plots of lavalette have been modelled by valle 2017 who showed more homogeneous spatial distributions of cumulated radiation in dav plots when compared to avhalf and avfull plots confirmation is found in our experimental results as an example the daily cumulated radiation measured in dav for the inter panel ip 19 2 mj m2 and under panel up 18 7 mj m2 positions are very close on the sunny day of may 6 2019 fig 5a with 19 18 and 18 71 mj m2 respectively however we observed that their hourly dynamics displayed a mirror behavior curves in phase opposition with magnitudes controlled by a bell shaped curve in the course of any given sunny day in the fullsun conditions the temporal pattern was more irregular in the avhalf fig 5b and avfull plots fig 5c with far different cumulative daily radiation fig 6a between ip and up positions this difference in cumulative radiation amounts also exists when considering seasonal time scales fig 6b at the seasonal scale the heterogeneity observed between the ip and up positions for the avhalf plot was high the cumulated radiation measured at ip was around 65 of the up radiation whereas the up radiation was around 93 of the ip radiation for the dav plots in the avfull plot the difference between radiations in the ip and up positions was smaller than in avhalf ip radiation was 83 of up probably due to the homogenous shade observed in both positions before midday fig 5c 3 2 soil water potential dynamics soil water potential is an indicator of soil water content the evolution of which depends on evapotranspiration as an illustration we present the data collected during season 2020 where rain is less frequent during that year we also had the largest number of combinations of shading and irrigation levels see table 1 fig 7 shows the dynamics of soil water potential swp observed from das 65 to das 145 covering the whole irrigation period of the 2020 cropping season for clarity we chose to use the average between swp values measured at 30 60 and 90 cm depths which we roughly considered as a proxy of the effort to be made by plant roots for water uptake from the soil the first irrigation was applied on das 61 putting all irrigated plots fig 7a b d e g in water comfort conditions at the start of the measurements for the particular case of non irrigated plots swp monitoring started later on das 85 showing moderate to severe water stress over the whole monitored period and slightly conservation of soil moisture in avfull fig 7c compared to the fullsun conditions fig 7f leading to a greener appearance of the plants in the avfull plot the main general trends that we can draw from swp dynamics are that i soil drying was slower in the shaded plots when compared to the fullsun plots resulting in better soil water conservation and thus reducing irrigation needs in av and that ii soil drying dynamics and magnitudes were different between the ip and up positions under the fixed av device avhalf fig 7b when compared to the dynamic av device dav fig 7a d highlighting the advantage of using tracking systems to achieve a more regular soil water content in the plot surface going a bit more into detail we observe that soil drying in the ip position of the avhalf plot was slower when compared to the up position fig 7b as the up position receives more radiation fig 7d resulting in mild moderate water stress in the up position swp between 80 and 150 kpa for most of the irrigation period while soil water content was maintained high enough to hold swp under the 80 kpa stress limit a limitation of our results was the absence of rain redistribution and runoff water measurements during rainfall events 3 3 phenology and vegetative growth table 2 shows the days after sowing das to reach emergence ve tasseling vt and silking r1 phenological growth stages for the seven treatments during the 2020 and 2021 seasons we observed two general trends i a delay for all shaded plots compared to the fullsun conditions whatever the irrigation treatment in the emergence and flowering stages of 5 11 days depending on the shading rate and ii in all cases when combining moderate water stress and a moderate shade dav di and avhalf di plots the delay was larger than in fully irrigated or fullsun conditions in both 2020 and 2021 seasons the delays were 5 7 days for emergence in the moderate shade treatments dav and avhalf shading rate of around 30 35 and about 10 days in the high shade avfull shading rate of around 50 the delays in vt and r1 reproductive stages were different depending on the irrigation conditions in the moderate shade compared to fullsun 4 7 days for vt and 4 11 days for r1 moderate shade fully irrigated plots while in deficit irrigated plots this delay was of 4 5 days and 3 5 days respectively additionally no difference was observed between dav and avhalf except for r1 in 2021 the effect of irrigation conditions was also observed in the fullsun conditions where the time needed to reach the vt stage varied with the irrigation treatment being slightly longer 2 4 days for deficit irrigated than for fully irrigated conditions this analysis does not hold for ni conditions neither reaching the vt nor the r1 stages during the two years of monitoring whatever the shade level concerning vegetative development fig 8 shows the gdd and rg tot needed to develop a new leaf during the 2021 cropping season the only season with leaf number monitoring the main interpretations of fig 8 are i as expected the cumulated thermal time gdd and radiation rg tot variables were well associated with the leaf number as the analyses have been conducted separately ii the slope of the lines phyllochron for av were lower than those in fullsun conditions indicating that leaves in shade appear slower than in fullsun conditions and iii the key determinant for the number of leaves appears to be the shading or non shading conditions while the irrigation strategy plays a limiting cut off role as non irrigated treatments prevented full crop development the final number of leaves was optimal in the irrigated fullsun plots 15 16 leaves for the fi or di treatments while in the shaded av plots the maximum number of leaves was limited to 12 the effect of panels on the phyllochron phy was clear fig 8a in the non limiting light conditions fullsun the phy value was 64 cd leaf while in the av plots the phy values increased with increasing shading rate 79 and 81 cd leaf in the dav and avhalf plots respectively moderate level shade and 95 cd leaf in the avfull plot high level shade these results are consistent with those of birch et al 1998 who reported increased phyllochron values with reduced irradiance the phy value reported in not limited conditions fullsun fi is not far from the values reported by verheul et al 1996 among different maize cultivars between 38 and 52 cd leaf the irrigation strategy had no effect on phy values analysis not shown consistently leaf area index lai evolution largely depends on both radiative and hydric conditions as shown in fig 9 with the maximum values of lai leaf area index for all experimental conditions 2019 2021 and the seasonal variation of lai during year 2020 the most complete data as expected the maximal lai laimax values decrease when less radiation is present and or when water is limited during the course of the season fig 9a c the latter also affecting the shape of the lai curve fig 9d as an example in the presence of pronounced water stress red curves the lai curve was lower for high shading rates avfull than for fullsun conditions suggesting that the presence of panels is not sufficient to compensate the effect of water deficit in coherence similar dynamics are observed in av plots with similar shading rates dav avhalf and similar irrigation amounts suggesting that the dynamic rotation of panels in dav had no significant effect on lai dynamics finally similar lai dynamics were observed for moderate shading rates dav fi or moderate water deficit fullsun di which seems an interesting result for modelling purposes suggesting introducing an overall stress indicator affecting the evolution of lai 3 4 stomatal responses to shade fig 10 depicts the typical dynamics of measured photosynthetically active radiation par leaf temperature t leaf net assimilation rate a and stomatal conductance gs of maize leaves in different conditions fullsun fully irrigated fig 10a dav fully irrigated in the two up and ip positions fig 10b and d and dav deficit irrigated only in ip position fig 10c that can be compared to fig 10d in non limiting conditions fig 10a we observe that the values of all measured variables increased from the beginning of the measurements to reach a maximum near midday before a gradual decrease takes place to the end of the day while in av plots we observe the same trends but with the shading breaks from a few minutes to few hours in all processes measured more specifically the dynamics of a and gs were highly correlated to those of par in shaded or fullsun conditions for fully irrigated or deficit irrigation conditions and whatever the plant position to the panels ip or up the effects of panels can also be observed on t leaf but the changes were less pronounced furthermore the experimental data show that plant reaction to par changes is neither immediate nor unique during brief shadings the stomata had insufficient time to adapt to par variations see fig 11 which is a close up of fig 10d while in the case of prolonged shading the time needed to adapt was ca 10 min fig 11 shows that our data is coherent with those shown by pearcy et al 1997 indicating that responses of photosynthesis to increases in irradiance are not instantaneous and with the study of meidner and mansfield 1965 who showed evidence that the processes of stomatal opening and closing are different in nature and that one is not simply a reversal of the other 3 5 crop production total dry matter tdm and dry grain yield gy are provided in fig 12 for the three seasons the main observations of this figure are i as for the lai values both tdm and gy were reduced when irrigation and or radiation were reduced thus in comparison with the fullsun and fully irrigated conditions fig 12a ii moderate shading rates in dav 35 and avhalf 30 under fully irrigated conditions fig 12b c reduced irrigation amounts by 19 35 while for higher shading rates avfull fig 12d irrigation was reduced by 47 iii moderate shading rates in dav and avhalf under fully irrigated conditions produced similar tdm and gy compared to fullsun in deficit irrigation iv when combining moderate water and radiation stresses dav and avhalf in deficit irrigated conditions the reductions in tdm were 40 53 and 22 51 in gy indicating lower reductions in gy compared to tdm v finally not irrigated treatments whatever the shade level produces higher tdm and gy reduction between 71 and 80 and 66 83 respectively supporting the cut off effect on crop development of high water stress also shown in section 2 3 table 3 gathers the final indicators for the water budget and crop production for the different plots and treatments water productivity of irrigation wpi was higher in shaded plots under fully irrigated conditions especially in deficit irrigated plots however in terms of water productivity wp which also consider the rainfall inputs we observe the inverse trend finally the values of the harvest index hi varied between 0 48 and 0 57 in fully irrigated plots between 0 47 and 0 67 and between 0 45 and 0 6 in not irrigated plots additionally hi did not seem to be impacted neither by shade the values of the hi varied between 0 48 and 0 6 in fullsun plots between 0 47 and 0 67 in dav and avhalf moderate shade and between 0 45 and 0 52 in avfull high shade these values correspond to values reported in maize 0 20 0 56 for different growing conditions ion et al 2015 however our estimations were based only in aerial tdm without considering the underground biomass root system was not harvested taking into account root mass in the estimations should decrease hi in all plots 4 discussion 4 1 phenological and growth responses of maize to radiative and water stresses 4 1 1 phenological delay plant emergence was delayed proportionally to shade intensity as shown in table 2 plant emergence in maize is mainly influenced by soil temperature among other factors soil water content and seed depth in our study the only difference between plots during seeding was shading causing a reduction in soil temperature and directly impacting emergence time soil temperature reduction under panels in the agrivoltaic platform of lavalette was not presented here but had already been reported by marrou et al 2013a b both in irrigated and not irrigated conditions a reduction in soil temperature was also described under field av conditions in germany armstrong et al 2016 and italy amaducci et al 2018 suggesting a generalized effect of shade cooling soil temperature at least in temperate and mediterranean conditions the delay observed in flowering stages vt and r1 were maintained in a similar proportion to shade such as in emergence the first hypothesis that could be derived from this fact is that the earlier delay in emergence may be the principal factor affecting the subsequent phenological development leaf stages and flowering in this sense earley et al 1966 also reported flowering delay in maize under shading but when shade was applied during vegetative growth avoiding the delay in emergence such as in our experiments thus the delay in flowering was probably more related to leaf stages development also affected by shade indeed a reduced final number of leaves fig 8 may explain the delay in vt and r1 stages as the time elapsing to flowering from emergence is associated with the final number of leaves per plant tollenaar et al 1979 moreover birch et al 1998 also reported similarly a reduction in the number of leaves under 55 73 level of shade the inhibition of flowering due to severe water stress was clear but moderate stress such as in deficit irrigated plots seems not to affect vt however this can lead to a slight delay between vt and r1 in shaded and in unshaded conditions which was not observed in fully irrigated conditions this effect was more evident in 2020 likely due to the drier conditions of the season this delay between vt and r1 is related to the anthesis silk interval asi one of the best indicators of how plants respond to stress water light nutrients during flowering a similar response of maize was described by nesmith and ritchie 1992 under hydric deficit conditions in our experiments we did not observe a delay between vt and r1 under shade suggesting that the presence of panels in av does not influence asi 4 1 2 vegetative development in a more detailed analysis of vegetative development one of our main findings is the influence of shade on phyllochron fig 8 the emphasis is placed here on the fact that more temperature is needed for a new leaf formation when less radiation is available similar results were discussed by birch et al 1998 in both controlled atmosphere and field conditions they reported that shading lengthened phyllochron causing an increase of 2 4 cd for each mj decreased in daily par since leaf appearance phyllochron 1 is commonly linked only to thermal time it was not expected that soil water or light influenced phyllochron from our results in the case of soil water we can reaffirm that this factor water has not influence on phyllochron the mentioned influence of shade on phyllochron led us to propose the relationship of leaf appearance to radiation time cumulated rg tot instead of thermal time cumulated gdd to compare both relationships separately supplementary fig s2 it was interesting to observe that leaf appearance showed a similar linear dependence on radiation such as with thermal time padilla and otegui 2005 this was probably due to the close relationship between radiation and air temperature and because leaves and plant temperature is also strongly affected by radiation moreover when computing phy r phyllochron using radiation instead of temperature and distinguishing between data obtained in up under panel and ip inter panel positions in av plots we observed differences in phy r values between the up and ip in the fixed devices avhalf and avfull these differences could be ignored almost certainly when using a classical thermal time relationship because of the slight variations in air temperatures recorded under panels compared to fullsun see figs 5 6 this last statement suggests that one could use phy r instead of phy in systems with strong spatial heterogeneities in radiation this may open new pathways to define the determinants and controls of crop development especially for spatial discrete crop modelling in av systems and probably also in agroforestry another way to improve phyllochron estimation in av systems may be the use of plant or leaf steam or canopy temperatures instead of air temperature since this temperature is more impacted by the presence of panels directly determined by energy balance than the mean air temperature as suggested by leaf temperature dynamics see fig 10 we could not deepen this idea without monitoring of daily plant based temperatures but we suggest exploring it in further experiments or by modelling i e blonder and michaletz 2018 to improve carbon and water fluxes estimations therefore models using thermal time could be enriched by including shade effects on phyllochron or energy balance to better aggregate the possible misrepresented physiological responses of the crops in av the complementary analysis of vegetative growth using leaf area index lai dynamics fig 9 and maximal values of lai laimax led us to affirm that water deficit and shade have more impact on individual leaf size than on leaf appearance thus in total leaf area of the plant and of the plot this response is well known and related to plant adaptive traits most of them showing that water and carbon emerge as the main limiting factors of leaf expansion pantin et al 2011 even if the literature remains controversial about their respective contributions to final leaf area some of the more cited responses to stress water shade nutrients at the leaf level are the reductions in leaf area mass and thickness givnish 1988 and photosynthetic characteristics modifications i e ren et al 2016 concerning the effects of the solar tracking panel rotation strategy implemented in dav compared to avhalf plots having different intraday patterns but similar daily total irradiance as shown in figs 5 6 we did not observe a clear difference in laimax values fig 9 in fully irrigated conditions neither in deficit irrigated conditions this is in contrast with the inverse relationship between the optimal maximum photosynthetic capacity and the frequency of low to high light transitions reported by retkute et al 2015 who suggest that the effects of shade in leaf growth will depend also on the intraday patterns of shade the effects of dynamic panels in leaf appearance were neither clearly affected in dav compared to avhalf in fig 8 these findings suggest that vegetative growth i e leaf appearance and canopy size at the plot scale were not strongly affected by the spatial heterogeneity of radiation transmission to the crop to complement this analysis specific allometric measurements of lai in the up and ip positions could be used to describe canopy growth heterogeneities especially in fixed av installations characterized by high crop irradiance heterogeneity also we encourage the general use of lai to describe vegetative development in av systems i e for modelling purposes since this index is a critical variable in processes such as photosynthesis and respiration and allows to capture the effects of both stresses analyzed here when we do not require a fine spatial discretization of crop growth 4 1 3 crop production concerning the final agricultural production we observed in fig 12 the negative effects of irradiance reduction and or water stress as documented by several authors in different maize shaded experiments e g mbewe and hunter zhang et al 2006 yuan et al 2021 and in other crops that are not tolerant to shade grown in av weselek et al 2019 particularly our results differ from those reported by amaducci et al 2018 who reported higher average maize yield under av scenarios than under not shaded conditions when water was limiting results from simulations performed with climate data from 37 years this shows the limitations of current formalisms used in crop models to simulate yield production the reduction of the maximal and final values of lai combined with the higher phyllochron lower leaf appearance rate caused by the panels figs 8 9 likely affect light interception and seem prone to explain the reported negative effects on the final tdm and gy values furthermore yield production studies have shown that the effects of stress depend on the type severity and duration of the stress as well as on the stage of development of the plant when the stress is applied the reproductive stages vt and r1 being the most detrimental to dry grain yield earley et al 1967 tollenaar 1977 in particular grain filling is said to be affected at the start of the critical period of grain set formation if solar radiation or and temperature sharply declines during this period otegui and bonhomme 1998 thus reducing the number of grains per grain set loomis and connor 1992 in all of our shaded plots the shade was permanent explaining the high yield reductions as documented by ren et al 2016 who also reported the lowest reduction of net photosynthetic rate when shade was applied only from the sixth leaf stage v6 to silk r1 in turn earley et al 1966 showed that shading for 21 days during the reproductive phase was more detrimental to grain production per plant than shading for longer periods during vegetative and maturation phases they also reported that a reduction of light from 100 to 70 essentially eliminated the development of the second ear which was similar to that in our experiments concerning the effects of water in fig 7 we can observe that water depletion was high in the pre flowering and flowering periods for deficit irrigated treatments affecting crops during this sensitive period in not irrigated maize plots whatever the shading rate the effect of water stress particularly in 2020 fig 12 was evident confirming the sensitivity of maize to the erratic behavior of rains campos et al 2004 we highlight the strong effect of water deficit in not irrigated plots on flowering failure under shade or not affecting crop production however the data shown in fig 12 for fullsun not irrigated plots correspond to survival plants in the plot where most of them died while in avfull most of them were still green at harvest in maize grain filling shows a dependence on anthesis silk interval asi and is particularly associated with a reduction in photosynthate formed during grain formation edmeades et al 2000 probably impacting grain yield in deficit irrigated plots the smaller relative reduction of gy in comparison with tdm in the fully irrigated av plots and some of the deficit irrigated plots shown in section 3 5 can be explained by the photosynthetic acclimation process hirth et al 2013 and possibly also by the internal mechanisms of maize plants to recycle the surplus of water during grain filling zhang et al 2022 photosynthetic acclimation is how plants alter their leaf composition and physiology over time to enhance photosynthetic efficiency productivity and allocation we hypothesized that the maize plants adjust the light response characteristics to balance the efficient use of absorbed energy in fluctuating light varying in both intensity and frequency to maximize daily carbon gain and to maintain a specific level of photosynthesis this affects leaf growth but promotes at the same time a concentration of assimilates on grain formation reducing the impact on gy however this hypothesis should be taken carefully because in c4 plants photosynthesis is less phenotypically plastic than c3 photosynthesis and this may contribute to the more restricted adaptation to intermittent light sage and mckown 2006 the water recycling mechanism of maize plants by back flows capacity via the pedicel phloem xylem system connecting grain and cob could allow the storage of the surplus water applied during water comfort periods for example just after an irrigation event in cob tissue ensuring water availability for grain filling during slight or moderate water stress in deficit irrigated plots thus complementary measurements of photosynthetic rates would be needed for the evaluation of this specific effect of shading considering the effect of growth stages and water status of the plant on the photosynthesis response of maize in 2021 we observed smaller reductions of tdm and gy in all cases even when water irrigation reductions on deficit irrigation di treatments were higher 71 76 compared to 2019 and 2020 44 60 this is because 2021 was a rainy year with significant rainfall events throughout the season 323 5 mm of cumulated rain during the crop season compared to 264 mm and 149 5 mm during 2020 and 2019 respectively this is confirmed by fig 7 in which we observe that water depletion was high around das 80 100 pre flowering and flowering period in deficit irrigated plots in 2020 so deficit irrigated plots were less stressed during vegetative pre flowering and grain filling stages in 2021 which are the most sensitive stages to stress shade or limited water as shown by several authors e g tollenaar 1977 this resulted in higher production with fewer irrigations in 2021 however grain yield production in stress conditions depends on the type severity and duration of the stress as well as on the stage of development of the plant when the stress is applied mbewe and hunter 1986 highlighting the need for more trials with stress applied in different stages to complete the analysis 4 1 4 some considerations to interpret the results it is important to note that the different shading patterns implemented for this experiment in the dav plot represented only the so called solar tracking strategy implemented in our experiments which is a shading strategy devoted to maximizing light interception and not favoring crop production in addition the fixed av devices studied here are not the only configurations that could be implemented since a multitude of other possibilities exist in terms of panels orientation spacing dimensions height and movements degrees of freedom our experimental designs raise questions about the potential to generalize results because the shade applied could be different in other configurations inducing different crop responses thus further studies are necessary to evaluate different shading strategies particularly in dav devices adapting the tracking panels strategy and shading rate to the different phenological stages intending to minimize the effects of both stresses studied here finally we aimed to analyze and illustrate contrasted cases and especially to evaluate the differences between dynamic and fixed plots to draw some preliminary conclusions hopefully useful and generic enough for future modelling aims additionally it is still difficult to affirm that the crop responses shown here are specific to the light limitation in av since there are many adaptation traits in plants that vary in response to irradiance level and to other environmental factors many of which are themselves correlated with irradiance level givnish 1988 furthermore different maize genotypes may respond differently to shading yuan et al 2021 adding a feature to minimize crop loss production in av by shade tolerant genotypes late sowing dates as in the 2019 cropping season may decrease the source sink ratio in maize bonelli et al 2016 which can also help to explain the lower yield in 2019 fig 12 4 2 intermittent shading in av as a way to manage water scarcity the shading patterns from the panels improved the water status on maize reducing applied water in fully irrigated plots fig 12 in a similar proportion compared with previous results in other crops studied under similar av systems such as lettuce elamri et al 2018 and apple trees juillion et al 2022 higher water productivity of irrigation wpi in deficit irrigated plots shaded or not compared with fully irrigated conditions shown in table 3 supports previous data showing higher yields per unit of irrigation water applied in maize under regulated deficit strategies huang et al 2011 zou et al 2021 improved wpi in av in fully irrigated conditions reported in table 3 is probably related to the capacity of av systems to i reduce reference evaporative demand eto under shade fig 3 and ii to slow down soil water depletion fig 7 both reducing the actual evapotranspiration of any crop not measured directly in our study it is also important highlight the fact that in av systems radiation reduction seems to be the first order factor affecting eto estimations when comparing with reduced air temperature and reduced relative humidity under panels and to hypothetical wind speed reduced under panels of 30 see supplementary fig s4 an interesting fact that we observed in fig 7 is that in fixed av systems for example in the avhalf plot on fig 7b soil water conservation was strongly different depending on the up under panel or ip inter panel positions when radiation distribution is heterogeneous indeed in fixed devices the rain redistribution is always impacted by solar panels with a high concentration of intercepted rain onto the soil at the lower edge of the solar arrays and much less runoff to the soil area under the panels as showed by elamri et al 2018b in the same experimental platform of our study they also mentioned that this redistribution is to some extent attenuated within the soil due to lateral transfers at the soil surface ponding and within the soil profile where significant lateral dispersion coexists with gravity this underlines the relevance and the potential benefits of tilting angle panels or other dynamic structures to homogenize altogether i transmitted radiation as showed in fig 6 ii rain redistribution as demonstrated by elamri et al 2018b and iii soil water depletion as demonstrated in fig 7 this is probably related to reduced crop development and growth in ip areas thus reducing root activity and reduced water uptake capacity root development and underground biomass were not measured in our experiments however it is well known that shading has a strong impact on the development of roots in the upper soil layer significantly decreasing the root morphologic and activity indices gao et al 2017 a similar effect on soil water conservation is observed in finely textured soils by making soil water available at critical stages of maize development huang et al 2011 hence provided the radiative and water stresses are not too limiting the use of predefined or real time control algorithms of the panels is expected to be powerful enough to force a daily shading strategy throughout the crop season able to fulfill several objectives i reduce water application during the irrigation period ii protect the crops during the hottest days of the season or during water sensitive periods of the crop iii reduce yield losses in conditions requiring deficit irrigation strategies particularly in not irrigated or water scarce contexts operating the panels to permit soil drying at the seedling stage plus further mild soil drying at the stem elongation stage or applying deficit irrigation from v8 to maturity may be an optimum irrigation method to maximize maize production as reported by kang et al 2000 and zou et al 2021 in semi arid conditions additionally the delay observed in flowering or those of the other phenological stages may also be used to prevent or dampen the risk of water stress during the critical period for grain set around flowering hall et al 1971 for example in an attempt to match flowering with rain forecasts especially given the uncertainties in projected future rainfall and water allocations this could be relevant in regions where rainfall mostly occurs in the early crop growth stages before the crop faces water stress from the pre flowering to late grain filling stages declining crop production the seasonal scale shading strategies could also be combined with shading strategies decided at much shorter temporal scales throughout the day to i reduce water depletion and daily evapotranspiration ii protect the crop during the hottest period of the day to reduce crop stress or ii optimize diurnal photosynthesis until the saturation point is reached i e maximize biomass production the potential optimization of water use within agrivoltaics is expected to be substantial by improving the efficiency of water use at the plant level however in order to implement finer strategies of shadow control it seems necessary to explore the factors controlling stomatal behavior specifically irradiance and leaf water potential as well as their interactions in a preliminary attempt a careful analysis of the comparisons in fig 10 leads to two key generalizations i the stomatal behavior measured for maize leaves under different stresses water and light responds directly to radiation in all cases and ii the responses seem proportional to radiation in further research this could give the possibility of real time control based only on radiation dynamics considering shading periods to target simultaneously water savings and reduction of productivity losses caused by radiation stress however this generalization must be taken carefully because stomatal closure can appear before light reduction under moderate severe water stress supplementary fig s3 making more complex the optimization in water deficit conditions spatial heterogeneities make difficult the estimation of actual evapotranspiration through water budget the presence of panels negatively influences rain redistribution uniformity super imposed with the spatial patterns due to irrigation application but with distinct spatial and temporal patterns models could be used to characterize these patterns see e g elamri et al 2018b for rain distribution but we recommend specific measurements to evaluate actual evapotranspiration for instance with the use of lysimeters and validate the water budget modelling under av systems as well these results highlight the need to investigate the use of solar arrays for water harvesting with the aim to limit water run off to the plot perimeter and to redistribute this harvested water by uniform irrigation a parallel study in av systems targeted this subject chekired et al 2022 clearly the possibility to orient solar panels opens a large diversity of optimization strategies of agrivoltaic structures in terms of design and real time operation whether for example water use efficiency or economic yields are to be maximized 4 3 perspectives for maize yield prediction in av towards time and spatial discretization the global radiation transmitted to a specific point under the av structure varies within the day causing different dynamics depending on the configuration of the panels and is mainly controlled by the density of modules and the chosen operation strategies in dynamic devices however prediction tools crop models water balance phenology chart are mainly based on photoperiod and temperature values kiniry bonhomme 1991 ignoring intra day variations by using daily averaged values can lead to significant errors in terms of estimated light interception and carbon assimilation by crops and then of crop development as shown by chopard 2021 the results presented here for maize in different intermittent shadow patterns reveal the importance of space discretization in some cases since radiation transmitted to the crop can be irregular at different degree according to the location within the plot in our case ip and up locations for example we can consider that in dav the daily solar radiation can be representative of the plot because the cumulative solar radiation evolution is more uniform in space despite the dynamic intraday patterns having slight effects on plants located at different points or rows while in fixed panels this condensed value cannot be representative to estimate crop growth in all the plot with potential differences between plants depending on their position as shown in section 3 1 the inclusion of temporal discretization to improve the simulation of crop development in stressed conditions may be particularly interesting for example by implementing a mechanistic approach to estimate photosynthesis and respiration processes at a timescale of a few minutes or hours to influence and improve prediction at a daily or seasonal scale this may be useful to i optimize water and biomass crop production that can contribute to minimizing crop yield losses related to shading and ii to adapt these systems to any water context by controlling both panels design or control and irrigation finally the distinction between diffuse and direct radiation which was not considered in our experiments is another perspective to improve photosynthesis modelling 5 conclusions and perspectives in our experimental study it has been demonstrated that the maize crop growth and production responded to both independent stresses studied here shade and deficit irrigation in a combined but not cumulative way compared to no stress conditions full sun and fully irrigated in general a delay of crop development and a significant decrease in leaf area index total dry matter and grain yield were observed in stressed conditions regarding water use in av systems studied here we can conclude that shade has an interesting potential to increase irrigation water productivity in both fully and deficit irrigated conditions by reducing the water inputs by up to 19 47 compared to unshaded plots under fully irrigated conditions and by managing soil moisture particularly in dynamic dav systems thus even if av systems decrease crop yield these systems have the potential to save water especially in water limited systems an innovative finding in terms of phenology was a strong association of leaf appearance to radiation showed by an observed increase of phyllochron under shade due to the slight impact of panels on air temperature and thermal time we consider that crop growth and production processes were probably more influenced by shading effects exposing the relevance of radiative climate in phenology monitoring in av systems we then suggested that radiation may be included in complement to thermal time in phyllochron estimation in av systems particularly in crop modelling studies additionally we did not observe a clear difference in leaf appearance phyllochron or leaf canopy area lai between fixed and dynamic av systems concluding that the crop phenology and vegetative growth is more affected by the total irradiance received during the daytime that by the intraday dynamics of this radiation another interesting conclusion is that at the leaf level the responses studied here stomatal conductance net assimilation rate of co2 and leaf temperature reacted in a well correlated way to photosynthetically active radiation this behavior opens new opportunities to optimize water use and shading strategies in further research by using a modelling approach crop modelling can be a valuable tool to assess numerous scenarios in silico crossing the two principal drivers studied here shading rate and irrigation and applying these stresses in shade and or in water tolerant stages of maize to find the good combination that could tackle the optimization target however adaptations of current formalisms may be implemented to consider the specific effects of intermittent shade in the crop processes at plot and leaf scales also specifically in the case of water budget modelling the most frequently used crop models may be limited regarding their ability to simulate eto as showed by kimball et al 2019 constraining the accurate analysis of water fluxes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9016,maize production is essential for global food security and represents a major supply in several value chains however the projected effects of climate change are likely to decrease drastically water availability for crops in many regions affecting yield agrivoltaics av systems are an innovative solution that may improve maize resilience in water scarce regions mainly by protecting plants from excessive radiation and by reducing irrigation needs however shade from panels may also affect crop development and production this study addresses the interplay between radiation transmission crop development and irrigation needs of maize cropping in field conditions by the description of crop development dynamics distinguishing between fixed and dynamic panels we showed that maize crop responded to both independent and combined stresses shade and water deficit with a significant decrease in leaf area index total dry matter and grain yield concerning water use we showed the potential of av to reduce irrigation inputs by up to 19 47 compared to unshaded plots via reduced soil water depletion and reference evapotranspiration the crop development was impacted by shade by increasing phyllochron and causing a generalized delay in phenology at a finer temporal scale we concluded that maize leaves react to shade by reducing stomatal conductance net assimilation of co2 and leaf temperature in a correlated way to radiation opening the possibility to use this behavior to optimize water use and shading strategies the spatial heterogeneities of radiation in fixed av systems compared to dynamic av systems were identified as a second order effect at the plot level on leaf area index and phyllochron compared to the effect of radiation reduction moreover dynamic av showed their ability to reduce the spatial heterogeneities in soil water depletion showing the importance of controlled shade strategies in av systems concerning water use keywords agrivoltaic systems maize

agrivoltaic experiments were performed in france marrou et al 2013a marrou et al 2013b av systems have proven their capacity to protect crops face to some climatic hazards particularly by intercepting radiations that would be excessive for the crops wang and sun 2018 and by improving the resilience of cropping systems to climate variability amaducci et al 2018 av systems also represent a potential way to save water by reducing irrigation needs due to the decrease of evapotranspiration elamri et al 2018 barron gafford et al 2019 al agele et al 2021 various types of av systems have been developed the most common with fixed panels only mounted over the crop fixed av more recently structures integrating sophisticated tracking systems dynamic av or dav have made it possible to control the movement of panels generally to maximize energy production by maintaining direct exposure of the panels to the sun rotation of panels can be thought to optimize radiation available for the crop grown under the panels valle 2017 this being one of the principal agronomic advantages of dynamic av compared to fixed av for crop production tahir and butt 2022 however the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of shading should be examined in detail in av distinguishing between fixed and dynamic systems particularly as the temporal patterns of transmitted radiation to crops under dynamic av take place over the short term with characteristic times of a few minutes and short distances with characteristic lengths of a few centimeters when following the movements of the panels modifying and complexifying the spatial characteristics of crop environment compared to full sun conditions or fixed av despite the above advantages solar panels also compete with plants for radiation which can affect crop growth and production high shading during sensitive phenological stages of maize negatively affects dry matter reed et al 1988 yield components and grain quality andrade and ferreiro 1996 earley et al 1966 jia et al 2011 leaf and shoot growth and morphology ephrath et al 1993 gao et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 there are no detailed studies carried out on av to evaluate their agronomical impacts on maize crop dynamics phenology soil water depletion leaf expansion biomass production photosynthesis and transpiration agroforestry research has explored the impact of shaded environments but the differences in the nature of shading and its temporal variability in these systems make it difficult to extrapolate the results to av in agroforestry characterized by irregular and porous shade associated with the canopy cover while in av characterized by regular and not porous shade the influence of av on soil water balance has already been studied for various irrigated crops such as fruit trees and some cereals mamun et al 2022 for maize a crop particularly sensitive to the effect of soil water content on yield the potential of av to manage water stress remains to explore also considering the extensive worldwide range of water conditions of maize cropping these systems must be assessed under drought or deficit irrigation strategies considering erratic rainfall extreme weather or irrigation shortages particularly deficit or regulated deficit irrigation is one strategy for maximizing yields per unit of irrigation water applied to several crops including maize huang et al 2011 zou et al 2021 to remedy the current lack in the literature this paper essentially tackles the interplay between radiation transmission crop development and irrigation needs of maize cropping in field conditions this is done through the description of crop development dynamics and crop indicators as well as the differences of this interplay between fixed and dynamic av systems comparing them with control case full sun based on experiments we analyze contrasting situations in terms of shading conditions by different av devices generating different shading spatial and temporal patterns and water conditions irrigation treatments the aim is to create a knowledge base for further studies of the complementary controls piloting of the shade and piloting of irrigation and their optimization in terms of water consumption energy production and crop development which are known to be partially conflicting goals 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and environmental conditions this study was conducted in the south of france mediterranean climate maize crop zea mays l ragt ixabel was grown for three years 2019 2020 and 2021 in the agrivoltaic experimental platform of lavalette inrae montpellier france 43 6466 n 3 8715 e covering an area of 1720 m² fig 1 sowing in the 2020 and 2021 seasons took place on april 2 and april 16 respectively while in 2019 sowing took place on may 3 the length of the seasons was of 138 144 and 152 days for 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively sowing and harvest were done at the same date for all treatments each season the environmental conditions during the three cropping seasons were characterized by daily averaged values of five relevant meteorological variables measured in fullsun plot air temperature t air relative humidity of the air rh incident global radiation rg reference evapotranspiration eto and rainfall r supplementary fig s1 the total amount of rainfall was modified in av plots by using the methodology showed by elamri et al 2018b to consider the effect of panels in rainfall interception daily air temperatures varied between 12 and 31 c in 2019 between 10 and 28 c in 2020 and between 9 and 27 c in 2021 the 2019 and 2021 seasons were characterized by more overcast days particularly in 2021 while 2020 was characterized by cloudy days observed at the beginning of the cropping season and mostly sunny days during the irrigation period rainfall during the cropping periods amounted to 150 264 and 324 mm in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively this coupled with the fact that rainfall events were mainly out of the irrigation period in 2019 and 2020 indicates that in 2021 experiments occurred in a rainy season whereas in 2019 and 2020 during dry conditions typical cultural practices have been adopted in a similar way during the three cropping seasons sufficient nitrogen amounts have been delivered to all plots during sowing to prevent nitrogen stress conditions 2 2 experimental platform characteristics and experimental design the platform is composed of four av plots with photovoltaic panels held at 4 m above the ground resulting in different incoming radiation conditions for the crops the two fixed tilt av plots avfull and avhalf without tracker systems consist of monocrystalline photovoltaic panels 1 58 0 81 m installed with a fixed tilt angle of 25 with respect to the horizontal plane and aligned in strips of 22 4 m oriented in the east west direction the avfull plot corresponds to the full density of panels as in optimal design for a solar energy production plant producing a shading rate of approx 50 reduction of 50 of total global radiation available for the crop in the plot surface during a day the avhalf consists of the same design of avfull plot but with the half density of panels one row of panels removed out of two to limit radiation reduction producing a shading rate of approx 30 the two 1 axis dynamic av plots called dav dynamic agrivoltaics were added in 2014 on the eastern and western sides of the fixed subsystem with 3 and 4 strips respectively each strip in dav consists of monocrystalline photovoltaic panels 1 98 1 00 m aligned in 19 m long strips and oriented in the north south direction the strips are electrically controlled according to a horizontal axis rotation strategy thought to maximize radiation interception by the photovoltaic panels this strategy consists of the panels faces following the course of the sun by varying the tilt angle of the strips between 50 e and 50 w the resulting shading rate in dav devices is about 35 which is similar to the avhalf structure but with different subscale patterns regarding the drop shadows of the panels in space and time the control plot without panels is called fullsun representing a shading rate of 0 it covers an area of 1760 m² and is located immediately south of the av plots without being affected by the shadow generated by the panels more details about the av platform of lavalette were described by elamri et al 2018 depending on the season the shading conditions have been crossed with three different irrigation treatments fully irrigated treatment fi deficit irrigated treatment di and not irrigated treatment ni fi plots were irrigated when soil water potential dropped to 80 kpa comfort limit for the silt sandy soil texture of the site based on tensiometer readings watermark probes irrometer company riverside usa at different depths considering the dynamics of root water uptake and based on 30 cm readings between 60 and 80 days after sowing das on the mean of 30 60 cm between 80 and 100 das and on mean of 30 60 90 cm from 100 das until the end of irrigations around 120 das di plots were irrigated between 120 kpa to 150 kpa soil water potential range to induce moderate water stress the irrigation periods took place during das 55 112 57 days 69 122 53 days and 52 126 74 days in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively water was applied using an integral sprinkler system in fixed amounts of 40 mm to fill the soil water reserve of the first 30 cm and prevent water loss by deep percolation in av irrigated plots the amount was multiplied by 0 7 amounts of 28 mm in order to adapt to the approx 30 radiation reduction in dav and avhalf the pipes were installed each year before the irrigation period and removed before harvest irrigation applications to each treatment were measured with calibrated mechanical flow meters for each plot uniform water distribution among plots was ensured by a constant pressure water supply in a relatively flat topography controlled with a variable speed drive booster pump and control pressure valves table 1 shows the experimental design matrix indicating the level of combined stress and the variables studied for each cropping season 2 3 climate and soil water potential monitoring microclimate data were recorded with a 10 min time step at a height of 2 m a weather station was installed close to the fullsun plot the air temperature t air and relative humidity of the air rh by digital thermo hygrometer cs215 campbell sci inc incident global radiation rg and total global radiation rg tot that is a cumulated measure of rg in a period by pyranometer sp1110 campbell sci inc rain r by pluviometer 52203 rm young company and wind speed w by an anemometer 05103 l rm young company air temperature and global radiation measurements were also made in the av plots the thermo hygrometers in the av plots were installed in dav west and avfull plots for the 2019 cropping season and dav west and avhalf plots for the 2020 and 2021 cropping seasons the thermo hygrometers installed in av plots were installed at a point covered by panels to differentiate from not covered sensors in the weather station installed for fullsun conditions the pyranometers in av plots were installed in two different locations inter panels ip and under panels up to capture the differences in the spatial intra day patterns of radiation transmission under the photovoltaic strips reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated with the fao 56 equation allen et al 1998 using the recorded data of each plot at a daily timestep radiation in av plots was the average of ip and up sensors and rainfall amounts were corriged to consider the effect of the panels using the methodology showed by elamri et al 2018b the other variables relative humidity air temperature and wind speed less affected by the solar panels marrou et al 2013a due to the height of the structure about the crop were assumed as the same for all treatments and taken from the fullsun weather station soil water status was monitored by soil water potential measurements swp using soil water potential sensors watermark also recorded every 10 min at 4 depths 30 60 90 120 cm since solar panels are likely to cause large heterogeneity on soil moisture after rainfalls elamri et al 2018b swp was also measured in two positions ip and up for av plots similarly to radiation measurements see fig 2 2 4 crop phenology vegetative growth and production plant emergence was characterized by counting the number of visible plants that emerged in 12 rows per treatment through a determined stripe of 13 m covering an area of 123 m² the emergence stage date was reported when the percentage of emerged plants reached at least 50 the phenological development of the maize crop was monitored under the different water and radiative conditions by median dates of vegetative stages leaf number and flowering stages tasselling and silking which corresponded to the date when 50 of the plants reached the stage the count in vegetative and flowering stages was carried out under each plot and for different rows in 430 tagged maize plants covering an average total area of 60 m² per plot leaf number monitoring was carried out only for the 2021 cropping season from v2 2 leaf stage until first visible flowers appeared n leaf stage corresponding to final number of leaves by weekly counting of deployed leaves commonly the ligulate leaves for the maize crop iowa scale commonly used in maize studies as described by abendroth et al 2011 the dates of the reproductive stages were identified in the 2020 and 2021 cropping seasons tasseling vt and silking r1 starting when at least one extruded anther or one extruded silk was visible in all tagged plants all the phenology results are presented using plant age time das commonly used in agronomy during the three years of experiments the vegetative growth has been characterized by around 12 weekly measurements of leaf area index lai using the lai 2200 c licor system from early vegetative development until observing a decrease in lai after the maximum lai values measuring ten values of lai across a parallel central line between two central rows in each plot crop production has been estimated at harvest by sampling of 40 tagged plants to estimate the total dry matter tdm of aerial part only leaves stem ears and dry grain yield gy for the three seasons following standard methods individual plants sampled without the root were separated into leaves stem and ears the samples were then oven dried at a constant temperature of 65 c for 72 h and weighed individually separating the ears from the leaves and the shoots dry kernels were separated from the cob to estimate gy harvest index values hi have been calculated as the ratio of gy and aerial tdm at maturity kawano 1990 data on tdm and gy were subjected to analysis of variance anova using r package r stats version 2 0 the means were considered different if the p value was less or equal to 0 05 p 0 05 for all analyses the normality and the independence of residuals and the intra treatment variance equality were checked daily growing degree days gdd cd were calculated following the classical approach gdd t mean t base where t mean is the mean air temperature calculated as the daily average of 10 minute recorded data and t base is the base temperature assumed 6 c as identified for this species in the south of france conditions brisson et al 1992 then we evaluated the relationships between gdd and leaf number employing the phyllochron phy cd leaf concept also rendered as leaf appearance 1 dos santos et al 2022a the phy is used to describe the growth and development of plants especially cereals by the relationship between leaf number and thermal time gdd accumulation we fit linear models to compute phyllochron values where the slope of the line is the phy for the entire leaf vegetative period model fit was assessed by r squared to provide an additional angle of analysis we extrapolated this concept to analyze the radiation associated to the appearance of one more leaf by introducing the phy r mj leaf computed as phy but using radiative time accumulated daily rg tot instead of gdd 2 5 gas exchange measurements plant gas exchanges stomatal conductance and photosynthesis have been measured for different sunny days with clear sky conditions whenever possible during the 2021 season with a targas 1 portable photosynthesis system pp systems to identify the impacts of photosynthetic active radiation variations par on stomatal conductance gs and on the net photosynthesis assimilation rate a the apparatus was mounted to pinch a leaf horizontally taking care to avoid shadows from the plot or other plants measurements started early in the morning and ended in the afternoon 3 results 3 1 impact of the solar panels on agrometeorological variables fig 3 shows the total amounts of the key agrometeorological variables measured in the different shading conditions we preferred to show thermal time instead air temperature because is a more relevant empirical driver of crop growth and is mostly used in maize studies water inputs consider rainfall and irrigation in figs 4 6 we focus our study on radiation and air temperature reductions under panels which are the two expected and documented variables affected in av systems and that impact crop development in many ways relative humidity and wind were excluded from our analysis because of their marginal variations between the av devices of lavalette marrou et al 2013a and their secondary role in crop development in fig 3 the total solar radiation measured under the panels in the different av plots led to shading rates of 29 38 in dav 30 35 in avhalf and 54 56 in avfull depending on the season these measured rates are consistent with those obtained previously in the same plots valle et al 2017 the cumulated thermal time cumulated gdd did not vary significantly within the treatments mainly because of the slight differences observed in air temperature fig 4 as expected the reference evapotranspiration reductions in av were proportional to shading rates the analysis of total water input rainfall plus irrigation shows that fully irrigated plots reached in general the reference evapotranspiration except for fullsun in 2019 in deficit irrigated plots the water inputs were in general lower than eto by 21 44 in fullsun by 6 23 in dav and by 9 10 in avhalf in fullsun not irrigated plot water inputs were 51 53 lower than eto however in avfull these values were only 6 17 this is not surprising since radiation is the first driver of eto equation however these results partly describe the effect of panels on the water budget showing their impact on reduced reference evapotranspiration the solar panels could affect the wind speed in each plot differently in a minimal way see marrou et al 2013a which represents a limitation on the usefulness of the calculated eto values the study of the impacts of solar panels on water budget will be delved in section 3 2 thanks to soil water depletion analysis a more detailed analysis based on the water budget including actual evapotranspiration was not included given the uncertainties on different terms and due to spatial variability to analyze the intraday and daily dynamic patterns of incident radiation and air temperature we focus on the 2019 cropping season because this year the monitored plots had more similar hydric conditions reducing the risk of the influence of latent heat in air temperature measurements fig 4 shows that the daily means of air temperature were only slightly affected by the presence of panels for the three years of experiments with temperature reductions under panels in the range of 0 to 1 5 c however when considering hourly temperature means obtained from values taken each 10 min the differences between the av plots and the fullsun plot were wider ranging between 5 and 3 c in other words higher differences only exist in the intraday air temperature values with possible short term effects on crop health air temperature reductions in av plots occurred mainly during the nighttime and then around the solar midday fig 6a on the other hand air temperature augmentations in av plots were observed in the afternoon around 17 00 probably caused by air speed depletion around this time of the day the slight reductions in daily air temperature registered in av compared to fullsun also imply slightly reductions in daily gdd between 0 0 and 0 5 cd in dav and between 0 0 and 1 2 cd in avfull resulting in a seasonal reduction in cumulated gdd of 89 and 110 cd respectively fig 6b the spatial patterns of the available radiation under the av plots of lavalette have been modelled by valle 2017 who showed more homogeneous spatial distributions of cumulated radiation in dav plots when compared to avhalf and avfull plots confirmation is found in our experimental results as an example the daily cumulated radiation measured in dav for the inter panel ip 19 2 mj m2 and under panel up 18 7 mj m2 positions are very close on the sunny day of may 6 2019 fig 5a with 19 18 and 18 71 mj m2 respectively however we observed that their hourly dynamics displayed a mirror behavior curves in phase opposition with magnitudes controlled by a bell shaped curve in the course of any given sunny day in the fullsun conditions the temporal pattern was more irregular in the avhalf fig 5b and avfull plots fig 5c with far different cumulative daily radiation fig 6a between ip and up positions this difference in cumulative radiation amounts also exists when considering seasonal time scales fig 6b at the seasonal scale the heterogeneity observed between the ip and up positions for the avhalf plot was high the cumulated radiation measured at ip was around 65 of the up radiation whereas the up radiation was around 93 of the ip radiation for the dav plots in the avfull plot the difference between radiations in the ip and up positions was smaller than in avhalf ip radiation was 83 of up probably due to the homogenous shade observed in both positions before midday fig 5c 3 2 soil water potential dynamics soil water potential is an indicator of soil water content the evolution of which depends on evapotranspiration as an illustration we present the data collected during season 2020 where rain is less frequent during that year we also had the largest number of combinations of shading and irrigation levels see table 1 fig 7 shows the dynamics of soil water potential swp observed from das 65 to das 145 covering the whole irrigation period of the 2020 cropping season for clarity we chose to use the average between swp values measured at 30 60 and 90 cm depths which we roughly considered as a proxy of the effort to be made by plant roots for water uptake from the soil the first irrigation was applied on das 61 putting all irrigated plots fig 7a b d e g in water comfort conditions at the start of the measurements for the particular case of non irrigated plots swp monitoring started later on das 85 showing moderate to severe water stress over the whole monitored period and slightly conservation of soil moisture in avfull fig 7c compared to the fullsun conditions fig 7f leading to a greener appearance of the plants in the avfull plot the main general trends that we can draw from swp dynamics are that i soil drying was slower in the shaded plots when compared to the fullsun plots resulting in better soil water conservation and thus reducing irrigation needs in av and that ii soil drying dynamics and magnitudes were different between the ip and up positions under the fixed av device avhalf fig 7b when compared to the dynamic av device dav fig 7a d highlighting the advantage of using tracking systems to achieve a more regular soil water content in the plot surface going a bit more into detail we observe that soil drying in the ip position of the avhalf plot was slower when compared to the up position fig 7b as the up position receives more radiation fig 7d resulting in mild moderate water stress in the up position swp between 80 and 150 kpa for most of the irrigation period while soil water content was maintained high enough to hold swp under the 80 kpa stress limit a limitation of our results was the absence of rain redistribution and runoff water measurements during rainfall events 3 3 phenology and vegetative growth table 2 shows the days after sowing das to reach emergence ve tasseling vt and silking r1 phenological growth stages for the seven treatments during the 2020 and 2021 seasons we observed two general trends i a delay for all shaded plots compared to the fullsun conditions whatever the irrigation treatment in the emergence and flowering stages of 5 11 days depending on the shading rate and ii in all cases when combining moderate water stress and a moderate shade dav di and avhalf di plots the delay was larger than in fully irrigated or fullsun conditions in both 2020 and 2021 seasons the delays were 5 7 days for emergence in the moderate shade treatments dav and avhalf shading rate of around 30 35 and about 10 days in the high shade avfull shading rate of around 50 the delays in vt and r1 reproductive stages were different depending on the irrigation conditions in the moderate shade compared to fullsun 4 7 days for vt and 4 11 days for r1 moderate shade fully irrigated plots while in deficit irrigated plots this delay was of 4 5 days and 3 5 days respectively additionally no difference was observed between dav and avhalf except for r1 in 2021 the effect of irrigation conditions was also observed in the fullsun conditions where the time needed to reach the vt stage varied with the irrigation treatment being slightly longer 2 4 days for deficit irrigated than for fully irrigated conditions this analysis does not hold for ni conditions neither reaching the vt nor the r1 stages during the two years of monitoring whatever the shade level concerning vegetative development fig 8 shows the gdd and rg tot needed to develop a new leaf during the 2021 cropping season the only season with leaf number monitoring the main interpretations of fig 8 are i as expected the cumulated thermal time gdd and radiation rg tot variables were well associated with the leaf number as the analyses have been conducted separately ii the slope of the lines phyllochron for av were lower than those in fullsun conditions indicating that leaves in shade appear slower than in fullsun conditions and iii the key determinant for the number of leaves appears to be the shading or non shading conditions while the irrigation strategy plays a limiting cut off role as non irrigated treatments prevented full crop development the final number of leaves was optimal in the irrigated fullsun plots 15 16 leaves for the fi or di treatments while in the shaded av plots the maximum number of leaves was limited to 12 the effect of panels on the phyllochron phy was clear fig 8a in the non limiting light conditions fullsun the phy value was 64 cd leaf while in the av plots the phy values increased with increasing shading rate 79 and 81 cd leaf in the dav and avhalf plots respectively moderate level shade and 95 cd leaf in the avfull plot high level shade these results are consistent with those of birch et al 1998 who reported increased phyllochron values with reduced irradiance the phy value reported in not limited conditions fullsun fi is not far from the values reported by verheul et al 1996 among different maize cultivars between 38 and 52 cd leaf the irrigation strategy had no effect on phy values analysis not shown consistently leaf area index lai evolution largely depends on both radiative and hydric conditions as shown in fig 9 with the maximum values of lai leaf area index for all experimental conditions 2019 2021 and the seasonal variation of lai during year 2020 the most complete data as expected the maximal lai laimax values decrease when less radiation is present and or when water is limited during the course of the season fig 9a c the latter also affecting the shape of the lai curve fig 9d as an example in the presence of pronounced water stress red curves the lai curve was lower for high shading rates avfull than for fullsun conditions suggesting that the presence of panels is not sufficient to compensate the effect of water deficit in coherence similar dynamics are observed in av plots with similar shading rates dav avhalf and similar irrigation amounts suggesting that the dynamic rotation of panels in dav had no significant effect on lai dynamics finally similar lai dynamics were observed for moderate shading rates dav fi or moderate water deficit fullsun di which seems an interesting result for modelling purposes suggesting introducing an overall stress indicator affecting the evolution of lai 3 4 stomatal responses to shade fig 10 depicts the typical dynamics of measured photosynthetically active radiation par leaf temperature t leaf net assimilation rate a and stomatal conductance gs of maize leaves in different conditions fullsun fully irrigated fig 10a dav fully irrigated in the two up and ip positions fig 10b and d and dav deficit irrigated only in ip position fig 10c that can be compared to fig 10d in non limiting conditions fig 10a we observe that the values of all measured variables increased from the beginning of the measurements to reach a maximum near midday before a gradual decrease takes place to the end of the day while in av plots we observe the same trends but with the shading breaks from a few minutes to few hours in all processes measured more specifically the dynamics of a and gs were highly correlated to those of par in shaded or fullsun conditions for fully irrigated or deficit irrigation conditions and whatever the plant position to the panels ip or up the effects of panels can also be observed on t leaf but the changes were less pronounced furthermore the experimental data show that plant reaction to par changes is neither immediate nor unique during brief shadings the stomata had insufficient time to adapt to par variations see fig 11 which is a close up of fig 10d while in the case of prolonged shading the time needed to adapt was ca 10 min fig 11 shows that our data is coherent with those shown by pearcy et al 1997 indicating that responses of photosynthesis to increases in irradiance are not instantaneous and with the study of meidner and mansfield 1965 who showed evidence that the processes of stomatal opening and closing are different in nature and that one is not simply a reversal of the other 3 5 crop production total dry matter tdm and dry grain yield gy are provided in fig 12 for the three seasons the main observations of this figure are i as for the lai values both tdm and gy were reduced when irrigation and or radiation were reduced thus in comparison with the fullsun and fully irrigated conditions fig 12a ii moderate shading rates in dav 35 and avhalf 30 under fully irrigated conditions fig 12b c reduced irrigation amounts by 19 35 while for higher shading rates avfull fig 12d irrigation was reduced by 47 iii moderate shading rates in dav and avhalf under fully irrigated conditions produced similar tdm and gy compared to fullsun in deficit irrigation iv when combining moderate water and radiation stresses dav and avhalf in deficit irrigated conditions the reductions in tdm were 40 53 and 22 51 in gy indicating lower reductions in gy compared to tdm v finally not irrigated treatments whatever the shade level produces higher tdm and gy reduction between 71 and 80 and 66 83 respectively supporting the cut off effect on crop development of high water stress also shown in section 2 3 table 3 gathers the final indicators for the water budget and crop production for the different plots and treatments water productivity of irrigation wpi was higher in shaded plots under fully irrigated conditions especially in deficit irrigated plots however in terms of water productivity wp which also consider the rainfall inputs we observe the inverse trend finally the values of the harvest index hi varied between 0 48 and 0 57 in fully irrigated plots between 0 47 and 0 67 and between 0 45 and 0 6 in not irrigated plots additionally hi did not seem to be impacted neither by shade the values of the hi varied between 0 48 and 0 6 in fullsun plots between 0 47 and 0 67 in dav and avhalf moderate shade and between 0 45 and 0 52 in avfull high shade these values correspond to values reported in maize 0 20 0 56 for different growing conditions ion et al 2015 however our estimations were based only in aerial tdm without considering the underground biomass root system was not harvested taking into account root mass in the estimations should decrease hi in all plots 4 discussion 4 1 phenological and growth responses of maize to radiative and water stresses 4 1 1 phenological delay plant emergence was delayed proportionally to shade intensity as shown in table 2 plant emergence in maize is mainly influenced by soil temperature among other factors soil water content and seed depth in our study the only difference between plots during seeding was shading causing a reduction in soil temperature and directly impacting emergence time soil temperature reduction under panels in the agrivoltaic platform of lavalette was not presented here but had already been reported by marrou et al 2013a b both in irrigated and not irrigated conditions a reduction in soil temperature was also described under field av conditions in germany armstrong et al 2016 and italy amaducci et al 2018 suggesting a generalized effect of shade cooling soil temperature at least in temperate and mediterranean conditions the delay observed in flowering stages vt and r1 were maintained in a similar proportion to shade such as in emergence the first hypothesis that could be derived from this fact is that the earlier delay in emergence may be the principal factor affecting the subsequent phenological development leaf stages and flowering in this sense earley et al 1966 also reported flowering delay in maize under shading but when shade was applied during vegetative growth avoiding the delay in emergence such as in our experiments thus the delay in flowering was probably more related to leaf stages development also affected by shade indeed a reduced final number of leaves fig 8 may explain the delay in vt and r1 stages as the time elapsing to flowering from emergence is associated with the final number of leaves per plant tollenaar et al 1979 moreover birch et al 1998 also reported similarly a reduction in the number of leaves under 55 73 level of shade the inhibition of flowering due to severe water stress was clear but moderate stress such as in deficit irrigated plots seems not to affect vt however this can lead to a slight delay between vt and r1 in shaded and in unshaded conditions which was not observed in fully irrigated conditions this effect was more evident in 2020 likely due to the drier conditions of the season this delay between vt and r1 is related to the anthesis silk interval asi one of the best indicators of how plants respond to stress water light nutrients during flowering a similar response of maize was described by nesmith and ritchie 1992 under hydric deficit conditions in our experiments we did not observe a delay between vt and r1 under shade suggesting that the presence of panels in av does not influence asi 4 1 2 vegetative development in a more detailed analysis of vegetative development one of our main findings is the influence of shade on phyllochron fig 8 the emphasis is placed here on the fact that more temperature is needed for a new leaf formation when less radiation is available similar results were discussed by birch et al 1998 in both controlled atmosphere and field conditions they reported that shading lengthened phyllochron causing an increase of 2 4 cd for each mj decreased in daily par since leaf appearance phyllochron 1 is commonly linked only to thermal time it was not expected that soil water or light influenced phyllochron from our results in the case of soil water we can reaffirm that this factor water has not influence on phyllochron the mentioned influence of shade on phyllochron led us to propose the relationship of leaf appearance to radiation time cumulated rg tot instead of thermal time cumulated gdd to compare both relationships separately supplementary fig s2 it was interesting to observe that leaf appearance showed a similar linear dependence on radiation such as with thermal time padilla and otegui 2005 this was probably due to the close relationship between radiation and air temperature and because leaves and plant temperature is also strongly affected by radiation moreover when computing phy r phyllochron using radiation instead of temperature and distinguishing between data obtained in up under panel and ip inter panel positions in av plots we observed differences in phy r values between the up and ip in the fixed devices avhalf and avfull these differences could be ignored almost certainly when using a classical thermal time relationship because of the slight variations in air temperatures recorded under panels compared to fullsun see figs 5 6 this last statement suggests that one could use phy r instead of phy in systems with strong spatial heterogeneities in radiation this may open new pathways to define the determinants and controls of crop development especially for spatial discrete crop modelling in av systems and probably also in agroforestry another way to improve phyllochron estimation in av systems may be the use of plant or leaf steam or canopy temperatures instead of air temperature since this temperature is more impacted by the presence of panels directly determined by energy balance than the mean air temperature as suggested by leaf temperature dynamics see fig 10 we could not deepen this idea without monitoring of daily plant based temperatures but we suggest exploring it in further experiments or by modelling i e blonder and michaletz 2018 to improve carbon and water fluxes estimations therefore models using thermal time could be enriched by including shade effects on phyllochron or energy balance to better aggregate the possible misrepresented physiological responses of the crops in av the complementary analysis of vegetative growth using leaf area index lai dynamics fig 9 and maximal values of lai laimax led us to affirm that water deficit and shade have more impact on individual leaf size than on leaf appearance thus in total leaf area of the plant and of the plot this response is well known and related to plant adaptive traits most of them showing that water and carbon emerge as the main limiting factors of leaf expansion pantin et al 2011 even if the literature remains controversial about their respective contributions to final leaf area some of the more cited responses to stress water shade nutrients at the leaf level are the reductions in leaf area mass and thickness givnish 1988 and photosynthetic characteristics modifications i e ren et al 2016 concerning the effects of the solar tracking panel rotation strategy implemented in dav compared to avhalf plots having different intraday patterns but similar daily total irradiance as shown in figs 5 6 we did not observe a clear difference in laimax values fig 9 in fully irrigated conditions neither in deficit irrigated conditions this is in contrast with the inverse relationship between the optimal maximum photosynthetic capacity and the frequency of low to high light transitions reported by retkute et al 2015 who suggest that the effects of shade in leaf growth will depend also on the intraday patterns of shade the effects of dynamic panels in leaf appearance were neither clearly affected in dav compared to avhalf in fig 8 these findings suggest that vegetative growth i e leaf appearance and canopy size at the plot scale were not strongly affected by the spatial heterogeneity of radiation transmission to the crop to complement this analysis specific allometric measurements of lai in the up and ip positions could be used to describe canopy growth heterogeneities especially in fixed av installations characterized by high crop irradiance heterogeneity also we encourage the general use of lai to describe vegetative development in av systems i e for modelling purposes since this index is a critical variable in processes such as photosynthesis and respiration and allows to capture the effects of both stresses analyzed here when we do not require a fine spatial discretization of crop growth 4 1 3 crop production concerning the final agricultural production we observed in fig 12 the negative effects of irradiance reduction and or water stress as documented by several authors in different maize shaded experiments e g mbewe and hunter zhang et al 2006 yuan et al 2021 and in other crops that are not tolerant to shade grown in av weselek et al 2019 particularly our results differ from those reported by amaducci et al 2018 who reported higher average maize yield under av scenarios than under not shaded conditions when water was limiting results from simulations performed with climate data from 37 years this shows the limitations of current formalisms used in crop models to simulate yield production the reduction of the maximal and final values of lai combined with the higher phyllochron lower leaf appearance rate caused by the panels figs 8 9 likely affect light interception and seem prone to explain the reported negative effects on the final tdm and gy values furthermore yield production studies have shown that the effects of stress depend on the type severity and duration of the stress as well as on the stage of development of the plant when the stress is applied the reproductive stages vt and r1 being the most detrimental to dry grain yield earley et al 1967 tollenaar 1977 in particular grain filling is said to be affected at the start of the critical period of grain set formation if solar radiation or and temperature sharply declines during this period otegui and bonhomme 1998 thus reducing the number of grains per grain set loomis and connor 1992 in all of our shaded plots the shade was permanent explaining the high yield reductions as documented by ren et al 2016 who also reported the lowest reduction of net photosynthetic rate when shade was applied only from the sixth leaf stage v6 to silk r1 in turn earley et al 1966 showed that shading for 21 days during the reproductive phase was more detrimental to grain production per plant than shading for longer periods during vegetative and maturation phases they also reported that a reduction of light from 100 to 70 essentially eliminated the development of the second ear which was similar to that in our experiments concerning the effects of water in fig 7 we can observe that water depletion was high in the pre flowering and flowering periods for deficit irrigated treatments affecting crops during this sensitive period in not irrigated maize plots whatever the shading rate the effect of water stress particularly in 2020 fig 12 was evident confirming the sensitivity of maize to the erratic behavior of rains campos et al 2004 we highlight the strong effect of water deficit in not irrigated plots on flowering failure under shade or not affecting crop production however the data shown in fig 12 for fullsun not irrigated plots correspond to survival plants in the plot where most of them died while in avfull most of them were still green at harvest in maize grain filling shows a dependence on anthesis silk interval asi and is particularly associated with a reduction in photosynthate formed during grain formation edmeades et al 2000 probably impacting grain yield in deficit irrigated plots the smaller relative reduction of gy in comparison with tdm in the fully irrigated av plots and some of the deficit irrigated plots shown in section 3 5 can be explained by the photosynthetic acclimation process hirth et al 2013 and possibly also by the internal mechanisms of maize plants to recycle the surplus of water during grain filling zhang et al 2022 photosynthetic acclimation is how plants alter their leaf composition and physiology over time to enhance photosynthetic efficiency productivity and allocation we hypothesized that the maize plants adjust the light response characteristics to balance the efficient use of absorbed energy in fluctuating light varying in both intensity and frequency to maximize daily carbon gain and to maintain a specific level of photosynthesis this affects leaf growth but promotes at the same time a concentration of assimilates on grain formation reducing the impact on gy however this hypothesis should be taken carefully because in c4 plants photosynthesis is less phenotypically plastic than c3 photosynthesis and this may contribute to the more restricted adaptation to intermittent light sage and mckown 2006 the water recycling mechanism of maize plants by back flows capacity via the pedicel phloem xylem system connecting grain and cob could allow the storage of the surplus water applied during water comfort periods for example just after an irrigation event in cob tissue ensuring water availability for grain filling during slight or moderate water stress in deficit irrigated plots thus complementary measurements of photosynthetic rates would be needed for the evaluation of this specific effect of shading considering the effect of growth stages and water status of the plant on the photosynthesis response of maize in 2021 we observed smaller reductions of tdm and gy in all cases even when water irrigation reductions on deficit irrigation di treatments were higher 71 76 compared to 2019 and 2020 44 60 this is because 2021 was a rainy year with significant rainfall events throughout the season 323 5 mm of cumulated rain during the crop season compared to 264 mm and 149 5 mm during 2020 and 2019 respectively this is confirmed by fig 7 in which we observe that water depletion was high around das 80 100 pre flowering and flowering period in deficit irrigated plots in 2020 so deficit irrigated plots were less stressed during vegetative pre flowering and grain filling stages in 2021 which are the most sensitive stages to stress shade or limited water as shown by several authors e g tollenaar 1977 this resulted in higher production with fewer irrigations in 2021 however grain yield production in stress conditions depends on the type severity and duration of the stress as well as on the stage of development of the plant when the stress is applied mbewe and hunter 1986 highlighting the need for more trials with stress applied in different stages to complete the analysis 4 1 4 some considerations to interpret the results it is important to note that the different shading patterns implemented for this experiment in the dav plot represented only the so called solar tracking strategy implemented in our experiments which is a shading strategy devoted to maximizing light interception and not favoring crop production in addition the fixed av devices studied here are not the only configurations that could be implemented since a multitude of other possibilities exist in terms of panels orientation spacing dimensions height and movements degrees of freedom our experimental designs raise questions about the potential to generalize results because the shade applied could be different in other configurations inducing different crop responses thus further studies are necessary to evaluate different shading strategies particularly in dav devices adapting the tracking panels strategy and shading rate to the different phenological stages intending to minimize the effects of both stresses studied here finally we aimed to analyze and illustrate contrasted cases and especially to evaluate the differences between dynamic and fixed plots to draw some preliminary conclusions hopefully useful and generic enough for future modelling aims additionally it is still difficult to affirm that the crop responses shown here are specific to the light limitation in av since there are many adaptation traits in plants that vary in response to irradiance level and to other environmental factors many of which are themselves correlated with irradiance level givnish 1988 furthermore different maize genotypes may respond differently to shading yuan et al 2021 adding a feature to minimize crop loss production in av by shade tolerant genotypes late sowing dates as in the 2019 cropping season may decrease the source sink ratio in maize bonelli et al 2016 which can also help to explain the lower yield in 2019 fig 12 4 2 intermittent shading in av as a way to manage water scarcity the shading patterns from the panels improved the water status on maize reducing applied water in fully irrigated plots fig 12 in a similar proportion compared with previous results in other crops studied under similar av systems such as lettuce elamri et al 2018 and apple trees juillion et al 2022 higher water productivity of irrigation wpi in deficit irrigated plots shaded or not compared with fully irrigated conditions shown in table 3 supports previous data showing higher yields per unit of irrigation water applied in maize under regulated deficit strategies huang et al 2011 zou et al 2021 improved wpi in av in fully irrigated conditions reported in table 3 is probably related to the capacity of av systems to i reduce reference evaporative demand eto under shade fig 3 and ii to slow down soil water depletion fig 7 both reducing the actual evapotranspiration of any crop not measured directly in our study it is also important highlight the fact that in av systems radiation reduction seems to be the first order factor affecting eto estimations when comparing with reduced air temperature and reduced relative humidity under panels and to hypothetical wind speed reduced under panels of 30 see supplementary fig s4 an interesting fact that we observed in fig 7 is that in fixed av systems for example in the avhalf plot on fig 7b soil water conservation was strongly different depending on the up under panel or ip inter panel positions when radiation distribution is heterogeneous indeed in fixed devices the rain redistribution is always impacted by solar panels with a high concentration of intercepted rain onto the soil at the lower edge of the solar arrays and much less runoff to the soil area under the panels as showed by elamri et al 2018b in the same experimental platform of our study they also mentioned that this redistribution is to some extent attenuated within the soil due to lateral transfers at the soil surface ponding and within the soil profile where significant lateral dispersion coexists with gravity this underlines the relevance and the potential benefits of tilting angle panels or other dynamic structures to homogenize altogether i transmitted radiation as showed in fig 6 ii rain redistribution as demonstrated by elamri et al 2018b and iii soil water depletion as demonstrated in fig 7 this is probably related to reduced crop development and growth in ip areas thus reducing root activity and reduced water uptake capacity root development and underground biomass were not measured in our experiments however it is well known that shading has a strong impact on the development of roots in the upper soil layer significantly decreasing the root morphologic and activity indices gao et al 2017 a similar effect on soil water conservation is observed in finely textured soils by making soil water available at critical stages of maize development huang et al 2011 hence provided the radiative and water stresses are not too limiting the use of predefined or real time control algorithms of the panels is expected to be powerful enough to force a daily shading strategy throughout the crop season able to fulfill several objectives i reduce water application during the irrigation period ii protect the crops during the hottest days of the season or during water sensitive periods of the crop iii reduce yield losses in conditions requiring deficit irrigation strategies particularly in not irrigated or water scarce contexts operating the panels to permit soil drying at the seedling stage plus further mild soil drying at the stem elongation stage or applying deficit irrigation from v8 to maturity may be an optimum irrigation method to maximize maize production as reported by kang et al 2000 and zou et al 2021 in semi arid conditions additionally the delay observed in flowering or those of the other phenological stages may also be used to prevent or dampen the risk of water stress during the critical period for grain set around flowering hall et al 1971 for example in an attempt to match flowering with rain forecasts especially given the uncertainties in projected future rainfall and water allocations this could be relevant in regions where rainfall mostly occurs in the early crop growth stages before the crop faces water stress from the pre flowering to late grain filling stages declining crop production the seasonal scale shading strategies could also be combined with shading strategies decided at much shorter temporal scales throughout the day to i reduce water depletion and daily evapotranspiration ii protect the crop during the hottest period of the day to reduce crop stress or ii optimize diurnal photosynthesis until the saturation point is reached i e maximize biomass production the potential optimization of water use within agrivoltaics is expected to be substantial by improving the efficiency of water use at the plant level however in order to implement finer strategies of shadow control it seems necessary to explore the factors controlling stomatal behavior specifically irradiance and leaf water potential as well as their interactions in a preliminary attempt a careful analysis of the comparisons in fig 10 leads to two key generalizations i the stomatal behavior measured for maize leaves under different stresses water and light responds directly to radiation in all cases and ii the responses seem proportional to radiation in further research this could give the possibility of real time control based only on radiation dynamics considering shading periods to target simultaneously water savings and reduction of productivity losses caused by radiation stress however this generalization must be taken carefully because stomatal closure can appear before light reduction under moderate severe water stress supplementary fig s3 making more complex the optimization in water deficit conditions spatial heterogeneities make difficult the estimation of actual evapotranspiration through water budget the presence of panels negatively influences rain redistribution uniformity super imposed with the spatial patterns due to irrigation application but with distinct spatial and temporal patterns models could be used to characterize these patterns see e g elamri et al 2018b for rain distribution but we recommend specific measurements to evaluate actual evapotranspiration for instance with the use of lysimeters and validate the water budget modelling under av systems as well these results highlight the need to investigate the use of solar arrays for water harvesting with the aim to limit water run off to the plot perimeter and to redistribute this harvested water by uniform irrigation a parallel study in av systems targeted this subject chekired et al 2022 clearly the possibility to orient solar panels opens a large diversity of optimization strategies of agrivoltaic structures in terms of design and real time operation whether for example water use efficiency or economic yields are to be maximized 4 3 perspectives for maize yield prediction in av towards time and spatial discretization the global radiation transmitted to a specific point under the av structure varies within the day causing different dynamics depending on the configuration of the panels and is mainly controlled by the density of modules and the chosen operation strategies in dynamic devices however prediction tools crop models water balance phenology chart are mainly based on photoperiod and temperature values kiniry bonhomme 1991 ignoring intra day variations by using daily averaged values can lead to significant errors in terms of estimated light interception and carbon assimilation by crops and then of crop development as shown by chopard 2021 the results presented here for maize in different intermittent shadow patterns reveal the importance of space discretization in some cases since radiation transmitted to the crop can be irregular at different degree according to the location within the plot in our case ip and up locations for example we can consider that in dav the daily solar radiation can be representative of the plot because the cumulative solar radiation evolution is more uniform in space despite the dynamic intraday patterns having slight effects on plants located at different points or rows while in fixed panels this condensed value cannot be representative to estimate crop growth in all the plot with potential differences between plants depending on their position as shown in section 3 1 the inclusion of temporal discretization to improve the simulation of crop development in stressed conditions may be particularly interesting for example by implementing a mechanistic approach to estimate photosynthesis and respiration processes at a timescale of a few minutes or hours to influence and improve prediction at a daily or seasonal scale this may be useful to i optimize water and biomass crop production that can contribute to minimizing crop yield losses related to shading and ii to adapt these systems to any water context by controlling both panels design or control and irrigation finally the distinction between diffuse and direct radiation which was not considered in our experiments is another perspective to improve photosynthesis modelling 5 conclusions and perspectives in our experimental study it has been demonstrated that the maize crop growth and production responded to both independent stresses studied here shade and deficit irrigation in a combined but not cumulative way compared to no stress conditions full sun and fully irrigated in general a delay of crop development and a significant decrease in leaf area index total dry matter and grain yield were observed in stressed conditions regarding water use in av systems studied here we can conclude that shade has an interesting potential to increase irrigation water productivity in both fully and deficit irrigated conditions by reducing the water inputs by up to 19 47 compared to unshaded plots under fully irrigated conditions and by managing soil moisture particularly in dynamic dav systems thus even if av systems decrease crop yield these systems have the potential to save water especially in water limited systems an innovative finding in terms of phenology was a strong association of leaf appearance to radiation showed by an observed increase of phyllochron under shade due to the slight impact of panels on air temperature and thermal time we consider that crop growth and production processes were probably more influenced by shading effects exposing the relevance of radiative climate in phenology monitoring in av systems we then suggested that radiation may be included in complement to thermal time in phyllochron estimation in av systems particularly in crop modelling studies additionally we did not observe a clear difference in leaf appearance phyllochron or leaf canopy area lai between fixed and dynamic av systems concluding that the crop phenology and vegetative growth is more affected by the total irradiance received during the daytime that by the intraday dynamics of this radiation another interesting conclusion is that at the leaf level the responses studied here stomatal conductance net assimilation rate of co2 and leaf temperature reacted in a well correlated way to photosynthetically active radiation this behavior opens new opportunities to optimize water use and shading strategies in further research by using a modelling approach crop modelling can be a valuable tool to assess numerous scenarios in silico crossing the two principal drivers studied here shading rate and irrigation and applying these stresses in shade and or in water tolerant stages of maize to find the good combination that could tackle the optimization target however adaptations of current formalisms may be implemented to consider the specific effects of intermittent shade in the crop processes at plot and leaf scales also specifically in the case of water budget modelling the most frequently used crop models may be limited regarding their ability to simulate eto as showed by kimball et al 2019 constraining the accurate analysis of water fluxes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9017,danube countries have witnessed numerous waves of drought events causing significant agro economic loss but three consecutive dry years amplified the debate on how to deal with future drought risk the european drought of 2022 has shown how important it is to look at food security from an environmental droughts risk assessment approach the coupling drought yield losses framework derives from the understanding that all land systems are connected through coupled human and natural systems and these social ecological and agro economic impacts are the result maize is considered a commodity and a staple food in europe with the largest market share in global maize exports drought heat stress war and subsequent limitations on ukrainian trade have created a shortage of maize

index evi2 is a commonly used remote sensing indicator that has the capability to track crop progress and evolution in green biomass there are also many studies using this index in europe it was used for research performed both in the whole of europe wu et al 2021 or in specified areas such as the pannonian basin crocetti et al 2020 and individual countries finland zou and mõttus 2017 sweden abdi

mondal 2011 the united states wu 2012 bolton and friedl 2013 zhang 2015 brazil kim et al 2010 and australia zhang et al 2014 another effective indicator of crop health is the evaporative stress index

maize production is limited 2 target region danube river basin the danube river basin drb is the second largest river basin in europe covering 801 463 km2 it lies to the west of the black sea in central and southeastern europe the digital elevation model of the drb and arable land use are shown in fig 2a b due to its large extension from the west to the east and diverse relief the drb can be divided into 3 main parts first the upper danube basin udb covers the black forest mountains to the gate of devín second the middle danube basin mdb covers from the gate of devín to the gorge of the danube at the iron gate which divides the southern carpathian mountains in the north and the balkan mountains in the south third the lower danube basin ldb covers the romanian bulgarian danube subbasin and the subbasins of the siret and prut rivers it is confined by the carpathians in the north by the bessarabian upland plateau in the east and by the dobrogea and balkan mountains in the south generally the danube basin is dominated by a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters however the heterogeneity of the relief especially the differences in the extent of exposure to the predominantly westerly winds as well as the differences in altitude diversify this general climate pattern the annual mean temperature increases from the west to the east of the drb table 1a the coldest temperatures are present on the mountain peaks in the alps and carpathians the annual precipitation ranges from 500 mm to 2000 mm based on differences in the regions the upper regions in the west show a strong influence from the atlantic climate with high precipitation whereas the eastern regions are affected by a continental climate with lower precipitation the mountain chains receive the highest annual precipitation 1000 3200 mm per year while the inner and outer basins vienna basin pannonian basin romanian and prut plains the lowlands of the czech morava and the delta region are very dry 350 600 mm per year the hydrologic regime of the danube river in particular the discharge regime is influenced by regional precipitation patterns in the future a decrease in river flows and an increase in the number of droughts with a large spatial extent are predicted in the danube countries or the vegetation period is expected to become shorter and a more irregular distribution of precipitation will occur jakubínský et al 2019 droughts that were deemed incipient mild or severe towards the end of the 20th century will have been a normal feature towards the end of the 21st century ferina et al 2021 dobri et al 2021 an increase in drought frequency duration and severity is expected for central europe hari et al 2020 trnka et al 2020 2022 bartošová et al 2022 potopová et al 2022 as well as carpathian basin agriculture and livestock farming are highly impacted by drought across the entire drb due to the climate sensitive nature of the sector 3 data and methods 3 1

used on arable lands at high spatial resolution remote sensing indices were averaged over each district area using only pixels with percent cropland 50 as defined by the modis product this threshold was selected to minimize contributions from pixels with predominantly forest urban or natural vegetation cover while still retaining a reasonable sample size for district averaging masking

activity was quantified by means of evi2 from the moderate resolution imaging at a spatial resolution of 5 km and averaged to a weekly frequency the evi2 was developed as a standard satellite vegetation product for modis spectroradiometers and it provides improved sensitivity in high biomass regions while minimizing soil and atmospheric influences the evi2 can be used for the measurement

the esi highlights areas with anomalously high or low rates of water use across arable lands and provides proxy information regarding rapidly evolving surface soil moisture and crop stress conditions the esi was calculated for 4 week and 12 week time windows advancing at 7 day intervals these indices were referred to as esi 4wk and esi 12wk the esi 4wk generally points to short term and rapidly evolving drought while esi 12wk points to more long term agricultural to hydrological droughts the standardized anomalies were computed relative to average conditions over 2001 2017 as a reference period of record jurečka et al 2021 the esi values typically range between 3 5 and 3 5 where negative values indicate reduced eta e g stress caused by drought and values close to 0 indicate normal conditions positive values indicate eta above the average indicating a high water supply esi can therefore indicate areas with a ratio higher or lower than normal for the reference period and can

weighted average according to the percentage of arable land in the pixels of the awr layer 3 3 copulas modelling 3 3 1 bivariate linkage as a preliminary analysis we investigated the presence of autocorrelation in the data of the five considered variables crop evi2 awr40 awr100 esi 4wk and esi 12wk if present we needed to subsample the data to avoid the presence of autocorrelation this means that for each variable we calculated the autocorrelation function and the relative confidence intervals with 1 and 5 levels of significance in this preliminary analysis we identified the best window for analysing the relation between crop yield evi2 and the explanatory variables awr40 awr100 esi for each nuts to determine the risk occurrences of drought induced maize yield losses and vegetation stress as a function of bivariate return periods we used the natural logarithm of the bivariate return periods as a predictor i e syrsmaize a b ln pr for bivariate copulas the return period rp is calculated as follows 1 rp µ pr x y ϵ r t where µ is the average interarrival time of events and r t is the critical region using survival functions and survival copulas therefore we constructed a joint bivariate linkage of eight compound modes awr40 yield coupling awr100 yield coupling esi4 yield coupling esi12 yield coupling awr40 evi2 coupling awr100 evi2 coupling esi4 evi2 and esi12 evi2 coupling 3 3 2 vine copulas multivariate probability model to assess how much maize production can be limited by the low soil water availability and the high rate of evaporative stress a multivariate joint cumulative distribution function was built here we first measured the association among the variables crop awr40 awr100 esi 4wk by calculating kendall s tau and spearman s rho two nonparametric indices for each pair of variables using the cor function in r r core team 2021 we have tested the significance of the association with 1 and 5 levels of significance then we used copulas to build up the multivariate four variate probability distribution salvadori et al 2007 and in particular the vine copulas bedford and cooke 2002 among the different typologies of vine copulas c vines d vine and r vines we have used a c vine structure of copulas considering that the variable crop is dependent on the other three for details about vine copulas see bedford and cooke 2002 and aas et al 2009 while for applications of vine copulas see pham et al 2016 shafaei et al 2017 bevacqua et al 2017 nazeri tahroudi et al 2022 let u1 u2 u3 and u4 denote the uniform variables in the interval 0 1 associated with crop awr40 awr100 and esi4wk respectively and with the four variate density of the copula since we are dealing with a four variate case the number of possible ways of building the c vine copula

is the number of joint distribution function parameters and n is the number of samples in this operation the maximum likelihood method was used to calculate the parameters of each bivariate copula selected among a list of forty copulas see the list in the package cdvinecopulaconditional once the multivariate probability model was built it was possible to simulate the joint behaviour of the variables and generate synthetic samples of the four variables we have generated synthetic samples of the variable u1 uniform transformation of the crop variable conditioned to the values of the other variables u2 u3 u4 uniform transformations of the variables awr40 awr100 esi and compared these to the observed ones to see the predictive power of the multivariate model in the application the expected value or alternatively the median value of u1 crop variable giving conditioning to fixed values of u2 u3 and u4 awr40 awr100 esi variables may be calculated by evaluating the expected or the median response of the vegetation for fixed values of the drivers in other words it is possible to identify some critical thresholds of the drivers which once passed can lead to delicate or problematic consequences for the vegetation in the next sections the statistical analysis will be illustrated with reference to one nuts ro411 then in sections 4 4 4 5 we will extend the analyses to all the other nuts 4 results and discussion 4 1 mapping drought induced vegetation stress on arable lands intense water loss through the esi has not occurred consistently each year over the danube river basin therefore only 12 of arable land was constantly affected by severe and extreme drought in the studied period dobri et al 2021 the most vulnerable risk prone areas related to esi 4wk are the northern regions of slovakia towards the south east and south west regions with a maximum in the podunajská lowland labudová et al 2017 the north and north eastern part of the hungarian serbian cross border area in the south southeast of romania including the territory of danube delta lungu et al 2012 and the southwest and northeast parts of bosnia and herzegovina hodzic et al 2011 the spatial evolution of the evaporative stress index for the 4 week and 12 week time windows detected areas with anomalously high rates of water use across the arable lands fig 3 the esi 4wk and esi 12wk detected the most risk prone areas with anomalously high rates of water stress in the most arable areas in 2003 severe summer drought 2012 severe summer drought after a dry winter 2015 short but severe summer drought 2017 severe spring and summer drought and 2018 summer drought in romania the driest year was 2003 with 25 6 of arable land affected by drought in contrast the wettest year was 2016 with only 10 8 of arable land affected by drought the wettest year was 2020 in cz and the appearance of excess water was at the end of the growing season therefore it directly complicates sowing winter cereals and inhibits harvesting operations for most crops the continuation of field water excess at the very beginning of the 2021 growing season was more disruptive to fieldwork than to plant growth soil moisture drought in topsoil and rootzone layers over the danube river basin is included in fig 4 a total of 52 of the old drava area southwestern part of hungary is likely threatened by droughts dezső et al 2019 the largest arable areas with stress soil moisture were also detected in 2012 and 2018 the minimum values of the awr40 and awr100 layers were recorded for 2012 in the mouldavian plateau the romanian plain the transylvanian plateau the dinaric mountains and the pannonian plain in 2018 the minimum values of the awr100 were recorded in the northeastern part of the mouldavian plateau and the northwestern part of the pannonian plain in 2012 from 20 to 30 weeks the most risk prone areas with an extreme lack of moisture were recorded in the mouldavian plateau the romanian plain the northwestern part of the pannonian plain and the dinaric mountains regions for the same period in 2018 the awr100 detected smaller areas with minimal soil moisture values at the rootzone layer in 2018 the highest vegetation stress was recorded in the mouldavian plateau the northwestern part of the pannonian plain and the southeastern part of germany according to evi2 which has the capability to track crop progress and evolution in green biomass there was one dry vegetation period every three years and in the period 2007 2018 the greenness dynamics were the most influenced by drought stress the evi2 also faced extreme drought events during 2012 and 2018 causing large areas with vegetation stress and great losses for the agricultural sector fig 5 a widespread drought affected much of the central and southern drb in 2012 in 2018 crop stress conditions were recorded in the northwestern part of the pannonian plain and the southeastern part of germany in 2015 extremely hot and dry weather during the flowering and grain filling period reduced grain quality and overall limited summer crop growth in major agricultural areas austria bosnia and herzegovina the czech republic croatia hungary serbia and the slovak republic reported high impacts on agriculture with the most significant impact on corn production in more than half of the drb countries impacts were also reported in the hydroenergy sector water quality high water temperature and in relation to ecology dried streams low water levels and eutrophication other impacts of drought in 2015 in the drb were observed regarding the forestry sector croatia fish farming the czech republic recreation bosnia and herzegovina and water quantity slovak republic this is consistent with a recent study performed in the pannonian basin crocetti et al 2020 4 2 identification of the window for peak correlation of coupling modes the plotting strategy used in fig 6a h visually summarizes the strength of the bivariate linkage of eight compound modes for multiple remote sensing indices and two different geographical regions as well as the timing of the peak signal these coupling modes of yield awr40 yield awr100 yield esi4 and yield esi12 explained the high rates of water use across the arable lands which resulted in low soil water availability in topsoil and rootzone and crop stress conditions the esi for the 4 week and 12 week time windows had a stronger link with crop yield than the weekly relative soil saturation at the topsoil and rootzone layers these plots also indicated a strong linkage among the coupling modes of evi2 esi4 evi2 esi12 evi2 awr40 and evi2 awr100 and provide estimates of greenness dynamics influenced by drought stress in a study by liu et al 2019 the strongest relationship was found for a 4 or 8 week window using yield esi4 coupling in the maze growing regions the peak correlations occur between weeks 28 and 32 mid july to mid august in dolj ro 2 wk earlier than in the south moravian region cz 30 33 weeks esi for a 12 week compositing window yield esi12 and the peak correlations occur between weeks 28 and 36 however this window was too broad to capture in detail drought stress occurring during specific critical phenological stages yield awr100 correlations 15 20 wk tend to peak earlier and at higher peaks than topsoil yield correlations of awr40 24 28 wk in the areas with a lack of soil moisture and high evapotranspiration ro maize growing regions conversely yield awr40 correlations 28 32 wk tend to peak earlier than yield awr100 correlations 24 28 wk in cz agriculture regions 4 3 statistical validation of multivariate probability model four variate c vine copula according to the results of kendall s tau and spearman s the accuracy of multivariate analyses between the multiple studied remote sensing indices is confirmed fig 7 the multivariate model is plotted using the many complexities that exist in terms of four dimensional copula functions parameter estimation tree sequences and conditional density fig s1 shows the pairwise plots of the pseudo i e transformed into data of uniform variables in the interval 0 1 observations of the four variables crop awr40 awr100 esi4wk we calculated spearman s rho for each pair the estimates at the two reference districts are given in figs s1 s8 the values were significant at the 1 and 5 levels then we indicated the variables with the following numbers to make the construction of the c vine copula easier crop 1 awr40 2 awr100 3 esi4k 4 we have identified the c vine copula with the highest rank in terms of akaike information criterion the selected four variate c vine copula has the following three trees in tree 1 node 4 esi4k is connected to each of the other three nodes 1 2 3 this means that tree1 is involved in the following pair copula densities c 41 c 42 c 43 the information relative to the trees of the c vine is reported in s1 s2 of supplementary materials we have generated 500 synthetic samples of size 20 of the variable crop conditioned to the observed values of the other variables and compared these to the observed sample fig 8a b fig 8a shows this comparison where the observed sample is reported with red circles and the 500 synthetic samples are summarized through boxplots the agreement between observed and synthetic samples is represented by the fact that the observations are within the whiskers of the boxplots which roughly represent the empirical 25th and 75th percentiles the results showed acceptable accuracy of the c vine copula in simulating the copula values of the drought induced maize yield losses after confirming the accuracy of the c vine copula the probability of occurrence of yield losses was obtained from the joint probability of occurrence of remote sensing indices the critical thresholds of the drivers that can lead to moderate to extreme impacts on maize production are building the four compound modes esi4 1 5 and syrs 0 50 coupling esi12 1 0 and syrs 0 50 coupling awr40 35 and syrs 0 50 coupling and awr100 45 and syrs 0 50 coupling this result is also consistent with studies by bevacqua et al 2017 and nazeri tahroudi et al 2022 which showed that this model can be used to simulate drought induced vegetation stress using multiple remote sensing indices for better water resource management in the basin 4 4 the timing of the peak response signal among remote sensing indices and maize yield the date of the peak response signal among remote sensing indices and yield is not uniform across the drb fig 9 demonstrates the consistency in peak correlation timing between districts spatiotemporal ranges of the timing of the peak signal of the esi4 yield correlations occur between weeks 27 28 early to mid july for 46 districts in bulgaria and romania weeks 29 30 occur for transylvania and most districts in hungary and the pannonian plain and weeks 31 33 occur for the districts of the czech republic slovakia slovenia western hungary eastern austria and northern croatia therefore in lower danube basin districts the peak of correlation shifts earlier in the growing season than in upper danube basin districts this southern region experiences higher interannual rainfall variability between weeks 16 and 35 with intense water loss through eta further exacerbating soil moisture conditions when there is a precipitation shortfall this leads to stronger yield variations and improved correlations with esi4 and esi12 indicators peak correlations for maize and esi 4wk range from 0 45 to 0 85 and occur 10 15 weeks before harvest in ro and 8 10 weeks in cz maize yield in the southern nuts has the strongest correlations with esi for 4 weeks compared to the northeast nuts one notable feature is that the evi2 with esi4 alignment shifts the peak correlation to an earlier date in southern districts of drb than that obtained for northern districts for evi2 peak correlations are also stronger with esi4 in most nuts with awr40 and awr100 yielding the lowest correlations evi2 and esi for 4 weeks provide an earlier indication of vegetation impacts by 14 days on average in comparison with esi for 12 weeks in the southeastern nuts awr40 and crop peak correlations occur 25 35 days earlier than evi2 and awr100 these results suggest that evi2 esi4 and awr40 can be used more effectively to demonstrate the progress of agricultural drought under varying climates and its impacts on crop yields thus in agricultural land districts with esi4 1 5 and awr40 35 moderate drought stress maize production is earlier limited by the soil moisture in the topsoil 4 5 spatial distribution of relationships among remote sensing indices and crop yield modelling the relationship between the compound risks of extreme ces and maize yield losses remains an important topic of ongoing research to capture regional differences in water limitations on crop growth the relationships were computed separately for each nuts with respect to peak correlation timing from fig 9 the maps from fig 10 demonstrate the regional strength of the relationship among the maize yield losses related to the high rate of esi coupling for the 4 week and 12 week time windows the yield losses and the low soil water availability in topsoil coupling and the yield losses and low soil water availability in rootzone coupling the spatial distribution of the peak correlation strength of the four coupling modes indicated that increased atmospheric moisture stress is most closely related to anomalies in soil moisture this indicated that the ability of the soil to retain water in the soil has been reduced correlations of esi4 yield as an effective indicator of crop health are significant p 0 01 for r 0 40 at 47 districts for r 0 60 at 15 districts and for r 0 70 at 8 districts for example drought maize yield losses compound events risk assessment using the syrs and esi4 wk in the south moravian region and dolj are presented in fig 11 these regions tend to have higher interannual yield variability the regional range in correlations of esi12 yield is similar to esi4 but with lower values thus esi anomalies computed over short time periods are most strongly correlated to yield anomalies the lowest esi yield correlations were obtained in districts with high water supply esi4 1 5 as well as the more humid austrian districts which experienced several episodes of flash drought during the study period higher esi yield correlations under the drier and warmer climates were found in districts with lower elevations and high crop areas in the drb characterizing moisture limiting growth conditions anomalous districts with relatively moderate to high esi yield correlations were found for the romanian bulgarian hungarian agriculture districts correlations of awr40 yield were significant for r 0 40 in 11 districts r 0 60 for 20 districts and r 0 70 for 12 districts for awr100 yield correlations are significant r 0 40 for 23 districts and r 0 60 for 10 districts r 0 70 for 43 districts these results confirm that the availability of soil water is one of the crucial indicators awr40 that explain the high degree of yield variability overall the large regional variability in the correlation patterns found during this study is similar to the analysis presented by jurečka et al 2021 and bartošová et al 2022 this is an alarming finding given the expected or increasing year to year variability in soil moisture in these regions correlations of evi2 esi4 are significant for r 0 40 at 38 districts r 0 60 at 24 districts r 0 70 at 5 districts the longer term esi anomalies are most strongly correlated with evi2 across the lowland nuts during the second half of the growing season fig 12 this strong linkage is consistent with a recent study on soybean cotton and corn in brazil anderson et al 2016b and on winter wheat and spring barley crop yields made in the czech republic anderson et al 2016a b jurečka et al 2021 the relationship between evi2 and awr40 awr100 varies with agroclimatic region with the strongest correlations identified in the more drought prone districts and weaker relationships in the wetter highland regions fig 12 much higher areas with significant correlations occur for evi2 awr40 and are significant for r 0 40 at 23 districts r 0 60 at 15 districts r 0 70 at 44 districts correlations of evi2 awr100 are significant for r 0 40 in 73 districts r 0 60 in 17 districts and r 0 70 in 33 districts the strong correlations between evi2 esi12 and evi2 awr40 found in this study also illustrate that the vegetation response to anomalies in evaporative demand is strongly influenced by soil moisture such as in june 2022 for example even if the atmospheric demand is higher than normal vegetation stress may not occur if sufficient soil moisture is available to meet the increased demand these results showed that it is important to monitor anomalies not only in atmospheric demand but also in soil moisture when assessing actual stress in vegetation this is consistent with recent studies in the assessment of drought induced vegetation stress otkin et al 2013 otkin et al 2014 anderson et al 2015 anderson et al 2016a nguyen et al 2020 lorenz et al 2021 4 6 yield losses drought compound events risk assessment across drb danube countries have witnessed numerous waves of drought episodes causing significant agro economic losses through appropriate planning of the planting harvesting cycle of dryland maize substantial socioeconomic damage can be avoided in the most important agricultural regions of the drb this is also supported by recent studies by jakubínský et al 2019 alsafadi et al 2020 and buzási et al 2021 during the past 20 years maize yield for the danube countries has exhibited substantial interannual variations which are significantly correlated p 0 05 with the drought conditions as quantified by the evaporative stress index and the relative water availability figs 10 12 the joint return periods and probability of yield loss risk assessment quantified by a four variate c vine copula model is summarized at the country level table 3 multivariate probabilistic model demonstrating the nonlinear response of yield to the increase in drought severity and detected years with the bimodal probability distribution of drought crop yield losses over the study region this was particularly true for the farming years 2018 and 2020 in 2018 the lowest maize yield occurred in the upper danube countries e g austria czech republic and a higher yield occurred in the lower danube basin e g romania in 2020 the geographical gradient of yield losses inverted in the opposite direction with the highest yield losses recorded in the southern part of the drb the acute high rate of evaporative stress and low soil water availability during 2020 recorded an outstanding equivalent in severity and duration to that of 2012 and 2007 conversely the wettest yield loss year was 2020 in the northern part of the drb countries the top three ranked drought yield losses with the highest frequency of joint high rate of evaporative stress and low soil water availability occurred in 2015 2018 and 2003 in austria for croatia bosnia and herz the highest occurrences of joint drought yield losses were both seen in 2012 2003 2007 2015 and 2011 while for bulgaria the highest occurrences were in 2003 2012 and 2020 the highest maize yield losses ranked at the top in 2022 and 2007 in the southern regions the return periods of drought yield loss signatures in the study region are less than 4 years the highest chances once every 2 50 2 86 years of the occurrence drought yield losses signature occurred in romania bulgaria slovakia bosnia and herz maize yield declined with an increasing rate of evaporative stress revealed by satellite remote sensing in the spring and summer of 2022 fig 13 the long lasting drought conditions in spring coupled with extremely summer high temperatures in 2022 affected maize crops grown in large parts of the drb maize production was earlier limited by the soil moisture in the topsoil in eastern and western romania high areas with a lack of soil moisture and high evapotranspiration were recorded in regions of the mouldavian plateau the romanian plain and the pannonian plain which coincided with the flowering stage resulting in reduced flower fertility in central slovenia croatia eastern slovakia and eastern hungary the persistent deficit of precipitation accompanied by the heatwaves in july august shortened the grain filling of maize crops with negative impacts on expected yields maize production experienced generally favourable conditions in austria and the czech republic in june including the sensitive period of maize flowering the ranges of simulated maize yield values in 2022 were generated by the c vine copula model fig s9 this year a very widespread drought yield loss signature was simulated over the study period our model indicated that the spring summer drought of 2022 caused a loss in yield from 2 5 tha 1 to 3 5 tha 1 for maize across danube countries the jrc mars july 2022 forecasted that the combined effect of irrigation water shortages and frequent heat waves would reduce grain maize by 8 9 grain maize yields were revised substantially downwards by 27 in hu and 7 6 in ro in slovakia however hot and dry june negatively impacted the yield formation of grain maize figs 13 14 show the evolution of the extreme drought conditions during the maize growing season of 2022 related to the high rate of evaporative stress index during the sowing period active leaves and cob development coupling for 4 week and 12 week time windows the low soil water availability in topsoil and rootzone during kernel filling and relative recovering vegetation conditions at the end of summer the emergence of maize occurred up to 2 weeks after sowing under cool and dry conditions there was no precipitation until june but low temperatures alleviated drought conditions in some regions of the drb and vegetation was managed according to evi2 even in central europe with the exception of hungary and eastern france we do not see this 2022 drought year causing dramatic damage to the condition of the vegetation the effect of drought on vegetation in southeastern europe leads to a decrease in the latter however the high rate of evaporative stress conditions of the hot and dry summer of 2022 also initiated extreme hydrological conditions in the danube river basin and rhine river the impact of continuous pollution was enhanced by higher salinity while harmful algal species only proliferate when salinity is high increase algae bloom with toxic effects on the fish population leading to fishkill in the rhine river 5 conclusion the main findings of this study allow a better understanding of the direct and indirect impacts on food safety hazards of selected environmental factors that are affected by climate change to understand the coupling drought yield losses mechanism the c vine copulas multivariate probability model has been built the weekly dynamics of the strength of bivariate linkage of eight compound modes were also assessed copulas modelling of maize yield losses drought compound events using the multiple remote sensing indices will be most beneficial for yield estimation in agricultural districts where crop productivity is primarily limited by warmer and drier events this combination of effects can cause short term concurrent hot and dry extremes characterized by rapid onset severe intensity and devastating impacts on crop production dry soils may amplify such extremes through feedback with evapotranspiration the esi for 12 week products may be of benefit to combine with evi2 in nonagricultural land cover classes the outputs of the spatial evolution of the selected multilayer remote sensing indices confirm that they exhibit relatively high levels of spatial consistency and short term drought stress occurring during the intense leaf growth stage and the silking period in danube countries the high water restriction reducing the number of kernels and limiting kernel filling has the greatest negative effect that maize yield was decreased across the danube river basin these predicted states can then be used alone or in combination with process based forecasts to drive process based crop and yield models the vine copulas approach combining model forecasts with observations could improve the predicted vegetation and yield anomalies drought years characteristic of large yield losses across the danube countries were captured by esi4 1 5 and awr40 35 esi12 2 5 and awr100 45 this equates to a yield loss of over 45 for maize in future research it is recommended to add more predictor variables to try to increase the predictive capacity of the drought yield loss assessment models the spatial distribution of the linkage of eight compound modes confirms that water restrictions applied during the vegetative growth stage negatively impact plant heights and biomass yields silage production therefore there was insufficient fodder supply to the livestock sector due to high water stress during the production season which finally led to substantially lower

9017,danube countries have witnessed numerous waves of drought events causing significant agro economic loss but three consecutive dry years amplified the debate on how to deal with future drought risk the european drought of 2022 has shown how important it is to look at food security from an environmental droughts risk assessment approach the coupling drought yield losses framework derives from the understanding that all land systems are connected through coupled human and natural systems and these social ecological and agro economic impacts are the result maize is considered a commodity and a staple food in europe with the largest market share in global maize exports drought heat stress war and subsequent limitations on ukrainian trade have created a shortage of maize supply in 2022 over europe this study focused on eighteen countries where maize production becomes highly susceptible to drought in the danube river basin drb austria bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria croatia the czech republic hungary montenegro romania serbia slovakia and slovenia to understand the coupling drought yield losses mechanism time series of maize yield datasets and multiple remote sensing indices were used on arable lands for 278 districts at a high spatial resolution the main objective of this study was to determine which regions respond to the changes in the rate of evapotranspiration and soil moisture and in which period and how much maize production is affected the time series of the two band enhanced vegetation index evi2 the evaporative stress index esi and the relative water availability awr were calculated the spatial evolution of the esi for 4 week and 12 week time windows evi2 and relative soil saturation at the topsoil and rootzone layers demonstrate the progress of agricultural drought under varying agroclimatic conditions and its impacts on maize yields our study adopted a novel mechanism based risk assessment approach using a four variate c vine copula in the perspective of modelling yield losses to assess how much maize production can be limited by drought stress the weekly dynamics of the strength of bivariate linkage of eight compound modes were provided the return periods of drought yield losses signatures in the study region were less than 4 years the highest chances once every 2 50 2 86 years of the occurrence of drought yield losses signature occurred in romania bulgaria slovakia bosnia and herzegovina the availability of soil water is one of the crucial indicators awr40 that explain the high degree of yield variability this is an alarming finding given the expected or increasing year to year variability in soil moisture in these regions the joint cumulative distribution function fcrop esi awr40 awr100 suggests that shorter term esi will be most beneficial for maize yield estimation in agricultural districts where crop productivity is primarily impaired by warmer and drier events this combination of effects can cause short term compound hot and dry extremes characterized by rapid onset severe intensity and devastating impacts on crop production droughts between 2015 and 2022 challenged

dependence on precipitation and soil moisture reserves during various growth stages žurovec 2017 lupu et al 2018 maize is considered a commodity and a staple food in europe with the largest market share in global maize exports the extreme drought of 2022 has created a shortage of maize supply in europe in 2022 the lack of precipitation significantly reduced the soil water content and led to

al 2017 one of the most widely used approaches for monitoring drought induced vegetation and crop stress conditions is based on remote sensing indices the two band version of the enhanced vegetation index evi2 is a commonly used remote sensing indicator that has the capability to track crop progress and evolution in green biomass there are also many studies using this index in europe it was used for research performed both in the whole of europe wu et al 2021 or in specified areas such as the pannonian basin crocetti et al 2020 and individual countries finland zou and mõttus 2017 sweden abdi

mondal 2011 the united states wu 2012 bolton and friedl 2013 zhang 2015 brazil kim et al 2010 and australia zhang et al 2014 another effective indicator of crop health is the evaporative stress index

structure salvadori et al 2007 our study adopted a novel mechanism based risk assessment approach using a four variate c vine copula in the perspective of modelling yield losses of drb the need to scrutinise copula mechanisms has already been stressed in aquifer management surface water and groundwater resource allocation and water resource management in basin hydrology pham et al 2016 shafaei et al 2017 bevacqua et al 2017 nazeri tahroudi et al 2022 however limited research has addressed this aspect in drought yield losses the potential of copulas in the risk assessment of maize yield losses from multiple variables compound events is explored in this study to date drought yield losses over the danube river basin have not been reported using a combination of copula mechanisms remote sensing indices and the spatial resolution used in the current study there is a great potential for a study of maize yield losses drought compound events risk assessment using multiple remote sensing indices over danube countries the main objective of this study was to determine which regions respond to the high rate of evapotranspiration and lack of soil moisture and in which period and how much maize production is limited 2 target region danube river basin the danube river basin drb is the second largest river basin in europe covering 801 463 km2 it lies to the west of the black sea in central and southeastern europe the digital elevation model of the drb and arable land use are shown in fig 2a b due to its large extension from the west to the east and diverse relief the drb can be divided into 3 main parts first the upper danube basin udb covers the black forest mountains to the gate of devín second the middle danube basin mdb covers from the gate of devín to the gorge of the danube at the iron gate which divides the southern carpathian mountains in the north and the balkan mountains in the south third the lower danube basin ldb covers the romanian bulgarian danube subbasin and the subbasins of the siret and prut rivers it is confined by the carpathians in the north by the bessarabian upland plateau in the east and by the dobrogea and balkan mountains in the south generally the danube basin is dominated by a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters however the heterogeneity of the relief especially the differences in the extent of exposure to the predominantly westerly winds as well as the differences in altitude diversify this general climate pattern the annual mean temperature increases from the west to the east of the drb table 1a the coldest temperatures are present on the mountain peaks in the alps and carpathians the annual precipitation ranges from 500 mm to 2000 mm based on differences in the regions the upper regions in the west show a strong influence from the atlantic climate with high precipitation whereas the eastern regions are affected by a continental climate with lower precipitation the mountain chains receive the highest annual precipitation 1000 3200 mm per year while the inner and outer basins vienna basin pannonian basin romanian and prut plains the lowlands of the czech morava and the delta region are very dry 350 600 mm per year the hydrologic regime of the danube river in particular the discharge regime is influenced by regional precipitation patterns in the future a decrease in river flows and an increase in the number of droughts with a large spatial extent are predicted in the danube countries or the vegetation period is expected to become shorter and a more irregular distribution of precipitation will occur jakubínský et al 2019 droughts that were deemed incipient mild or severe towards the end of the 20th century will have been a normal feature towards the end of the 21st century ferina et al 2021 dobri et al 2021 an increase in drought frequency duration and severity is expected for central europe hari et al 2020 trnka et al 2020 2022 bartošová et al 2022 potopová et al 2022 as well as carpathian basin agriculture and livestock farming are highly impacted by drought across the entire drb due to the climate sensitive nature of the sector 3 data and methods 3 1 yield and remote sensing datasets the crop yield and remote sensing datasets cover eighteen countries belonging to the danube river basin austria bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria croatia the czech republic hungary montenegro romania serbia slovakia and slovenia datasets for the period 2001 2020 were calculated at 278 districts in the nomenclature of units for territorial statistics level 3 nuts3 regions of the member states of the european union time series of remote sensing indices from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis on board of terra and aqua satellites were used on arable lands at high spatial resolution remote sensing indices were averaged over each district area using only pixels with percent cropland 50 as defined by the modis product this threshold was selected to minimize contributions from pixels with predominantly forest urban or natural vegetation cover while still retaining a reasonable sample size for district averaging masking contributions from the forest and other nonagricultural land cover improved remote sensing indices with yield correlations in the current study nuts 3 level maize yield datasets were obtained from eurostat 2020 which provides official data on planted area production and yield back to 2001 for all states in the drb the yield maize data were also collected through survey agents in the agricultural sector including farmers cooperatives rural extension and financial agents large agricultural areas in the danube basin benefit from arable land fig 2c nuts 3 level maize yield datasets were used to calculate the standardized yield residuals series for each country syrs potopová et al 2015 3 2 quantification of drought related indices the time series of the two band enhanced vegetation index evi2 the evaporative stress index esi and the soil relative water availability awr were calculated table 1b relative vegetation condition as an indicator of the photosynthetic activity was quantified by means of evi2 from the moderate resolution imaging at a spatial resolution of 5 km and averaged to a weekly frequency the evi2 was developed as a standard satellite vegetation product for modis spectroradiometers and it provides improved sensitivity in high biomass regions while minimizing soil and atmospheric influences the evi2 can be used for the measurement of land use intensity abdi et al 2021 for the determination of seasonal green vegetation cover kim et al 2010 zhang 2015 or for the length of the vegetation growing season zhang et al 2014 for the

impacts on plant productivity crocetti et al 2020 or for the general monitoring and forecasting of droughts trnka et al 2020 the evi2 index is often used for a comparison of results obtained using different indices vescovo et al 2012 wu 2012 zou and mõttus 2017 potopová et al 2020 or for their calibration obata et al 2016 the esi was calculated as a temporal anomaly in evapotranspiration based on the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model and land surface temperature inputs from modis hain and anderson 2017 the esi is expressed as standardized anomalies in the ratio of the actual reference evapotranspiration eta eto normalization by the eto reduces the impact of varying atmospheric evaporative demand on the et flux focusing more on soil moisture drivers anderson et al 2016a the esi highlights areas with anomalously high or low rates of water use across arable lands and provides proxy information regarding rapidly evolving surface soil moisture and crop stress conditions the esi was calculated for 4 week and 12 week time windows advancing at 7 day intervals these indices were referred to as esi 4wk and esi 12wk the esi 4wk generally points to short term and rapidly evolving drought while esi 12wk points to more long term agricultural to hydrological droughts the standardized anomalies were computed relative to average conditions over 2001 2017 as a reference period of record jurečka et al 2021 the esi values typically range between 3 5 and 3 5 where negative values indicate reduced eta e g stress caused by drought and values close to 0 indicate normal conditions positive values indicate eta above the average indicating a high water supply esi can therefore indicate areas with a ratio higher or lower than normal for the reference period and can provide an early warning of declining vegetation health caused e g by drought in the czech republic it was used in real time during the season and thus has great potential for decision making at the regional and district levels https www intersucho cz en mapcountry eu map 11 https droughtwatch eu relative water availability awr describes the amount of water available for plants based on the

relative soil saturation were aggregated for each district s topsoil 0 40 cm awr40 and rootzone layer 0 100 cm awr100 the aggregation is with respect to the distribution of arable land i e the weighted average according to the percentage of arable land in the pixels of the awr layer 3 3 copulas modelling 3 3 1 bivariate linkage as a preliminary analysis we investigated the presence of autocorrelation in the data of the five considered variables crop evi2 awr40 awr100 esi 4wk and esi 12wk if present we needed to subsample the data to avoid the presence of autocorrelation this means that for each variable we calculated the autocorrelation function and the relative confidence intervals with 1 and 5 levels of significance in this preliminary analysis we identified the best window for analysing the relation between crop yield evi2 and the explanatory variables awr40 awr100 esi for each nuts to determine the risk occurrences of drought induced maize yield losses and vegetation stress as a function of bivariate return periods we used the natural logarithm of the bivariate return periods as a predictor i e syrsmaize a b ln pr for bivariate copulas the return period rp is calculated as follows 1 rp µ pr x y ϵ r t where µ is the average interarrival time of events and r t is the critical region using survival functions and survival copulas therefore we constructed a joint bivariate linkage of eight compound modes awr40 yield coupling awr100 yield coupling esi4 yield coupling esi12 yield coupling awr40 evi2 coupling awr100 evi2 coupling esi4 evi2 and esi12 evi2 coupling 3 3 2 vine copulas multivariate probability model to assess how much maize production can be limited by the low soil water availability and the high rate of evaporative stress a multivariate joint cumulative distribution function was built here we first measured the association among the variables crop awr40 awr100 esi 4wk by calculating kendall s tau and spearman s rho two nonparametric indices for each pair of variables using the cor function in r r core team 2021 we have tested the significance of the association with 1 and 5 levels of significance then we used copulas to build up the multivariate four variate probability distribution salvadori et al 2007 and in particular the vine copulas bedford and cooke 2002 among the different typologies of vine copulas c vines d vine and r vines we have used a c vine structure of copulas considering that the variable crop is dependent on the other three for details about vine copulas see bedford and cooke 2002 and aas et al 2009 while for applications of vine copulas see pham et al 2016 shafaei et al 2017 bevacqua et al 2017 nazeri tahroudi et al 2022 let u1 u2 u3 and u4 denote the uniform variables in the interval 0 1 associated with crop awr40 awr100 and esi4wk respectively and with the four variate density of the copula since we are dealing with a four variate case the number of possible ways of building the c vine copula is twelve table 2 provides all the possibilities of building the four variate c vine copula along with the expression of its density last column of table 2 in this the symbol indicates the conditional operation while c 12 u 1 u 2 c 13 u 1 u 3 and c 14 u 1 u 4 are all pair copulas the structure of the c vine i e the identification of the root nodes for each tree and the edges has been selected considering all possible c vines fitted through the function cdvinecondrank of the r package cdvinecopulaconditional see bevacqua et al 2017 and ranking these through the akaike information criterion

is the number of joint distribution function parameters and n is the number of samples in this operation the maximum likelihood method was used to calculate the parameters of each bivariate copula selected among a list of forty copulas see the list in the package cdvinecopulaconditional once the multivariate probability model was built it was possible to simulate the joint behaviour of the variables and generate synthetic samples of the four variables we have generated synthetic samples of the variable u1 uniform transformation of the crop variable conditioned to the values of the other variables u2 u3 u4 uniform transformations of the variables awr40 awr100 esi and compared these to the observed ones to see the predictive power of the multivariate model in the application the expected value or alternatively the median value of u1 crop variable giving conditioning to fixed values of u2 u3 and u4 awr40 awr100 esi variables may be calculated by evaluating the expected or the median response of the vegetation for fixed values of the drivers in other words it is possible to identify some critical thresholds of the drivers which once passed can lead to delicate or problematic consequences for the vegetation in the next sections the statistical analysis will be illustrated with reference to one nuts ro411 then in sections 4 4 4 5 we will extend the analyses to all the other nuts 4 results and discussion 4 1 mapping drought induced vegetation stress on arable lands intense water loss through the esi has not occurred consistently each year over the danube river basin therefore only 12 of arable land was constantly affected by severe and extreme drought in the studied period dobri et al 2021 the most vulnerable risk prone areas related to esi 4wk are the northern regions of slovakia towards the south east and south west regions with a maximum in the podunajská lowland labudová et al 2017 the north and north eastern part of the hungarian serbian cross border area in the south southeast of romania including the territory of danube delta lungu et al 2012 and the southwest and northeast parts of bosnia and herzegovina hodzic et al 2011 the spatial evolution of the evaporative stress index for the 4 week and 12 week time windows detected areas with anomalously high rates of water use across the arable lands fig 3 the esi 4wk and esi 12wk detected the most risk prone areas with anomalously high rates of water stress in the most arable areas in 2003 severe summer drought 2012 severe summer drought after a dry winter 2015 short but severe summer drought 2017 severe spring and summer drought and 2018 summer drought in romania the driest year was 2003 with 25 6 of arable land affected by drought in contrast the wettest year was 2016 with only 10 8 of arable land affected by drought the wettest year was 2020 in cz and the appearance of excess water was at the end of the growing season therefore it directly complicates sowing winter cereals and inhibits harvesting operations for most crops the continuation of field water excess at the very beginning of the 2021 growing season was more disruptive to fieldwork than to plant growth soil moisture drought in topsoil and rootzone layers over the danube river basin is included in fig 4 a total of 52 of the old drava area southwestern part of hungary is likely threatened by droughts dezső et al 2019 the largest arable areas with stress soil moisture were also detected in 2012 and 2018 the minimum values of the awr40 and awr100 layers were recorded for 2012 in the mouldavian plateau the romanian plain the transylvanian plateau the dinaric mountains and the pannonian plain in 2018 the minimum values of the awr100 were recorded in the northeastern part of the mouldavian plateau and the northwestern part of the pannonian plain in 2012 from 20 to 30 weeks the most risk prone areas with an extreme lack of moisture were recorded in the mouldavian plateau the romanian plain the northwestern part of the pannonian plain and the dinaric mountains regions for the same period in 2018 the awr100 detected smaller areas with minimal soil moisture values at the rootzone layer in 2018 the highest vegetation stress was recorded in the mouldavian plateau the northwestern part of the pannonian plain and the southeastern part of germany according to evi2 which has the capability to track crop progress and evolution in green biomass there was one dry vegetation period every three years and in the period 2007 2018 the greenness dynamics were the most influenced by drought stress the evi2 also faced extreme drought events during 2012 and 2018 causing large areas with vegetation stress and great losses for the agricultural sector fig 5 a widespread drought affected much of the central and southern drb in 2012 in 2018 crop stress conditions were recorded in the northwestern part of the pannonian plain and the southeastern part of germany in 2015 extremely hot and dry weather during the flowering and grain filling period reduced grain quality and overall limited summer crop growth in major agricultural areas austria bosnia and herzegovina the czech republic croatia hungary serbia and the slovak republic reported high impacts on agriculture with the most significant impact on corn production in more than half of the drb countries impacts were also reported in the hydroenergy sector water quality high water temperature and in relation to ecology dried streams low water levels and eutrophication other impacts of drought in 2015 in the drb were observed regarding the forestry sector croatia fish farming the czech republic recreation bosnia and herzegovina and water quantity slovak republic this is consistent with a recent study performed in the pannonian basin crocetti et al 2020 4 2 identification of the window for peak correlation of coupling modes the plotting strategy used in fig 6a h visually summarizes the strength of the bivariate linkage of eight compound modes for multiple remote sensing indices and two different geographical regions as well as the timing of the peak signal these coupling modes of yield awr40 yield awr100 yield esi4 and yield esi12 explained the high rates of water use across the arable lands which resulted in low soil water availability in topsoil and rootzone and crop stress conditions the esi for the 4 week and 12 week time windows had a stronger link with crop yield than the weekly relative soil saturation at the topsoil and rootzone layers these plots also indicated a strong linkage among the coupling modes of evi2 esi4 evi2 esi12 evi2 awr40 and evi2 awr100 and provide estimates of greenness dynamics influenced by drought stress in a study by liu et al 2019 the strongest relationship was found for a 4 or 8 week window using yield esi4 coupling in the maze growing regions the peak correlations occur between weeks 28 and 32 mid july to mid august in dolj ro 2 wk earlier than in the south moravian region cz 30 33 weeks esi for a 12 week compositing window yield esi12 and the peak correlations occur between weeks 28 and 36 however this window was too broad to capture in detail drought stress occurring during specific critical phenological stages yield awr100 correlations 15 20 wk tend to peak earlier and at higher peaks than topsoil yield correlations of awr40 24 28 wk in the areas with a lack of soil moisture and high evapotranspiration ro maize growing regions conversely yield awr40 correlations 28 32 wk tend to peak earlier than yield awr100 correlations 24 28 wk in cz agriculture regions 4 3 statistical validation of multivariate probability model four variate c vine copula according to the results of kendall s tau and spearman s the accuracy of multivariate analyses between the multiple studied remote sensing indices is confirmed fig 7 the multivariate model is plotted using the many complexities that exist in terms of four dimensional copula functions parameter estimation tree sequences and conditional density fig s1 shows the pairwise plots of the pseudo i e transformed into data of uniform variables in the interval 0 1 observations of the four variables crop awr40 awr100 esi4wk we calculated spearman s rho for each pair the estimates at the two reference districts are given in figs s1 s8 the values were significant at the 1 and 5 levels then we indicated the variables with the following numbers to make the construction of the c vine copula easier crop 1 awr40 2 awr100 3 esi4k 4 we have identified the c vine copula with the highest rank in terms of akaike information criterion the selected four variate c vine copula has the following three trees in tree 1 node 4 esi4k is connected to each of the other three nodes 1 2 3 this means that tree1 is involved in the following pair copula densities c 41 c 42 c 43 the information relative to the trees of the c vine is reported in s1 s2 of supplementary materials we have generated 500 synthetic samples of size 20 of the variable crop conditioned to the observed values of the other variables and compared these to the observed sample fig 8a b fig 8a shows this comparison where the observed sample is reported with red circles and the 500 synthetic samples are summarized through boxplots the agreement between observed and synthetic samples is represented by the fact that the observations are within the whiskers of the boxplots which roughly represent the empirical 25th and 75th percentiles the results showed acceptable accuracy of the c vine copula in simulating the copula values of the drought induced maize yield losses after confirming the accuracy of the c vine copula the probability of occurrence of yield losses was obtained from the joint probability of occurrence of remote sensing indices the critical thresholds of the drivers that can lead to moderate to extreme impacts on maize production are building the four compound modes esi4 1 5 and syrs 0 50 coupling esi12 1 0 and syrs 0 50 coupling awr40 35 and syrs 0 50 coupling and awr100 45 and syrs 0 50 coupling this result is also consistent with studies by bevacqua et al 2017 and nazeri tahroudi et al 2022 which showed that this model can be used to simulate drought induced vegetation stress using multiple remote sensing indices for better water resource management in the basin 4 4 the timing of the peak response signal among remote sensing indices and maize yield the date of the peak response signal among remote sensing indices and yield is not uniform across the drb fig 9 demonstrates the consistency in peak correlation timing between districts spatiotemporal ranges of the timing of the peak signal of the esi4 yield correlations occur between weeks 27 28 early to mid july for 46 districts in bulgaria and romania weeks 29 30 occur for transylvania and most districts in hungary and the pannonian plain and weeks 31 33 occur for the districts of the czech republic slovakia slovenia western hungary eastern austria and northern croatia therefore in lower danube basin districts the peak of correlation shifts earlier in the growing season than in upper danube basin districts this southern region experiences higher interannual rainfall variability between weeks 16 and 35 with intense water loss through eta further exacerbating soil moisture conditions when there is a precipitation shortfall this leads to stronger yield variations and improved correlations with esi4 and esi12 indicators peak correlations for maize and esi 4wk range from 0 45 to 0 85 and occur 10 15 weeks before harvest in ro and 8 10 weeks in cz maize yield in the southern nuts has the strongest correlations with esi for 4 weeks compared to the northeast nuts one notable feature is that the evi2 with esi4 alignment shifts the peak correlation to an earlier date in southern districts of drb than that obtained for northern districts for evi2 peak correlations are also stronger with esi4 in most nuts with awr40 and awr100 yielding the lowest correlations evi2 and esi for 4 weeks provide an earlier indication of vegetation impacts by 14 days on average in comparison with esi for 12 weeks in the southeastern nuts awr40 and crop peak correlations occur 25 35 days earlier than evi2 and awr100 these results suggest that evi2 esi4 and awr40 can be used more effectively to demonstrate the progress of agricultural drought under varying climates and its impacts on crop yields thus in agricultural land districts with esi4 1 5 and awr40 35 moderate drought stress maize production is earlier limited by the soil moisture in the topsoil 4 5 spatial distribution of relationships among remote sensing indices and crop yield modelling the relationship between the compound risks of extreme ces and maize yield losses remains an important topic of ongoing research to capture regional differences in water limitations on crop growth the relationships were computed separately for each nuts with respect to peak correlation timing from fig 9 the maps from fig 10 demonstrate the regional strength of the relationship among the maize yield losses related to the high rate of esi coupling for the 4 week and 12 week time windows the yield losses and the low soil water availability in topsoil coupling and the yield losses and low soil water availability in rootzone coupling the spatial distribution of the peak correlation strength of the four coupling modes indicated that increased atmospheric moisture stress is most closely related to anomalies in soil moisture this indicated that the ability of the soil to retain water in the soil has been reduced correlations of esi4 yield as an effective indicator of crop health are significant p 0 01 for r 0 40 at 47 districts for r 0 60 at 15 districts and for r 0 70 at 8 districts for example drought maize yield losses compound events risk assessment using the syrs and esi4 wk in the south moravian region and dolj are presented in fig 11 these regions tend to have higher interannual yield variability the regional range in correlations of esi12 yield is similar to esi4 but with lower values thus esi anomalies computed over short time periods are most strongly correlated to yield anomalies the lowest esi yield correlations were obtained in districts with high water supply esi4 1 5 as well as the more humid austrian districts which experienced several episodes of flash drought during the study period higher esi yield correlations under the drier and warmer climates were found in districts with lower elevations and high crop areas in the drb characterizing moisture limiting growth conditions anomalous districts with relatively moderate to high esi yield correlations were found for the romanian bulgarian hungarian agriculture districts correlations of awr40 yield were significant for r 0 40 in 11 districts r 0 60 for 20 districts and r 0 70 for 12 districts for awr100 yield correlations are significant r 0 40 for 23 districts and r 0 60 for 10 districts r 0 70 for 43 districts these results confirm that the availability of soil water is one of the crucial indicators awr40 that explain the high degree of yield variability overall the large regional variability in the correlation patterns found during this study is similar to the analysis presented by jurečka et al 2021 and bartošová et al 2022 this is an alarming finding given the expected or increasing year to year variability in soil moisture in these regions correlations of evi2 esi4 are significant for r 0 40 at 38 districts r 0 60 at 24 districts r 0 70 at 5 districts the longer term esi anomalies are most strongly correlated with evi2 across the lowland nuts during the second half of the growing season fig 12 this strong linkage is consistent with a recent study on soybean cotton and corn in brazil anderson et al 2016b and on winter wheat and spring barley crop yields made in the czech republic anderson et al 2016a b jurečka et al 2021 the relationship between evi2 and awr40 awr100 varies with agroclimatic region with the strongest correlations identified in the more drought prone districts and weaker relationships in the wetter highland regions fig 12 much higher areas with significant correlations occur for evi2 awr40 and are significant for r 0 40 at 23 districts r 0 60 at 15 districts r 0 70 at 44 districts correlations of evi2 awr100 are significant for r 0 40 in 73 districts r 0 60 in 17 districts and r 0 70 in 33 districts the strong correlations between evi2 esi12 and evi2 awr40 found in this study also illustrate that the vegetation response to anomalies in evaporative demand is strongly influenced by soil moisture such as in june 2022 for example even if the atmospheric demand is higher than normal vegetation stress may not occur if sufficient soil moisture is available to meet the increased demand these results showed that it is important to monitor anomalies not only in atmospheric demand but also in soil moisture when assessing actual stress in vegetation this is consistent with recent studies in the assessment of drought induced vegetation stress otkin et al 2013 otkin et al 2014 anderson et al 2015 anderson et al 2016a nguyen et al 2020 lorenz et al 2021 4 6 yield losses drought compound events risk assessment across drb danube countries have witnessed numerous waves of drought episodes causing significant agro economic losses through appropriate planning of the planting harvesting cycle of dryland maize substantial socioeconomic damage can be avoided in the most important agricultural regions of the drb this is also supported by recent studies by jakubínský et al 2019 alsafadi et al 2020 and buzási et al 2021 during the past 20 years maize yield for the danube countries has exhibited substantial interannual variations which are significantly correlated p 0 05 with the drought conditions as quantified by the evaporative stress index and the relative water availability figs 10 12 the joint return periods and probability of yield loss risk assessment quantified by a four variate c vine copula model is summarized at the country level table 3 multivariate probabilistic model demonstrating the nonlinear response of yield to the increase in drought severity and detected years with the bimodal probability distribution of drought crop yield losses over the study region this was particularly true for the farming years 2018 and 2020 in 2018 the lowest maize yield occurred in the upper danube countries e g austria czech republic and a higher yield occurred in the lower danube basin e g romania in 2020 the geographical gradient of yield losses inverted in the opposite direction with the highest yield losses recorded in the southern part of the drb the acute high rate of evaporative stress and low soil water availability during 2020 recorded an outstanding equivalent in severity and duration to that of 2012 and 2007 conversely the wettest yield loss year was 2020 in the northern part of the drb countries the top three ranked drought yield losses with the highest frequency of joint high rate of evaporative stress and low soil water availability occurred in 2015 2018 and 2003 in austria for croatia bosnia and herz the highest occurrences of joint drought yield losses were both seen in 2012 2003 2007 2015 and 2011 while for bulgaria the highest occurrences were in 2003 2012 and 2020 the highest maize yield losses ranked at the top in 2022 and 2007 in the southern regions the return periods of drought yield loss signatures in the study region are less than 4 years the highest chances once every 2 50 2 86 years of the occurrence drought yield losses signature occurred in romania bulgaria slovakia bosnia and herz maize yield declined with an increasing rate of evaporative stress revealed by satellite remote sensing in the spring and summer of 2022 fig 13 the long lasting drought conditions in spring coupled with extremely summer high temperatures in 2022 affected maize crops grown in large parts of the drb maize production was earlier limited by the soil moisture in the topsoil in eastern and western romania high areas with a lack of soil moisture and high evapotranspiration were recorded in regions of the mouldavian plateau the romanian plain and the pannonian plain which coincided with the flowering stage resulting in reduced flower fertility in central slovenia croatia eastern slovakia and eastern hungary the persistent deficit of precipitation accompanied by the heatwaves in july august shortened the grain filling of maize crops with negative impacts on expected yields maize production experienced generally favourable conditions in austria and the czech republic in june including the sensitive period of maize flowering the ranges of simulated maize yield values in 2022 were generated by the c vine copula model fig s9 this year a very widespread drought yield loss signature was simulated over the study period our model indicated that the spring summer drought of 2022 caused a loss in yield from 2 5 tha 1 to 3 5 tha 1 for maize across danube countries the jrc mars july 2022 forecasted that the combined effect of irrigation water shortages and frequent heat waves would reduce grain maize by 8 9 grain maize yields were revised substantially downwards by 27 in hu and 7 6 in ro in slovakia however hot and dry june negatively impacted the yield formation of grain maize figs 13 14 show the evolution of the extreme drought conditions during the maize growing season of 2022 related to the high rate of evaporative stress index during the sowing period active leaves and cob development coupling for 4 week and 12 week time windows the low soil water availability in topsoil and rootzone during kernel filling and relative recovering vegetation conditions at the end of summer the emergence of maize occurred up to 2 weeks after sowing under cool and dry conditions there was no precipitation until june but low temperatures alleviated drought conditions in some regions of the drb and vegetation was managed according to evi2 even in central europe with the exception of hungary and eastern france we do not see this 2022 drought year causing dramatic damage to the condition of the vegetation the effect of drought on vegetation in southeastern europe leads to a decrease in the latter however the high rate of evaporative stress conditions of the hot and dry summer of 2022 also initiated extreme hydrological conditions in the danube river basin and rhine river the impact of continuous pollution was enhanced by higher salinity while harmful algal species only proliferate when salinity is high increase algae bloom with toxic effects on the fish population leading to fishkill in the rhine river 5 conclusion the main findings of this study allow a better understanding of the direct and indirect impacts on food safety hazards of selected environmental factors that are affected by climate change to understand the coupling drought yield losses mechanism the c vine copulas multivariate probability model has been built the weekly dynamics of the strength of bivariate linkage of eight compound modes were also assessed copulas modelling of maize yield losses drought compound events using the multiple remote sensing indices will be most beneficial for yield estimation in agricultural districts where crop productivity is primarily limited by warmer and drier events this combination of effects can cause short term concurrent hot and dry extremes characterized by rapid onset severe intensity and devastating impacts on crop production dry soils may amplify such extremes through feedback with evapotranspiration the esi for 12 week products may be of benefit to combine with evi2 in nonagricultural land cover classes the outputs of the spatial evolution of the selected multilayer remote sensing indices confirm that they exhibit relatively high levels of spatial consistency and short term drought stress occurring during the intense leaf growth stage and the silking period in danube countries the high water restriction reducing the number of kernels and limiting kernel filling has the greatest negative effect that maize yield was decreased across the danube river basin these predicted states can then be used alone or in combination with process based forecasts to drive process based crop and yield models the vine copulas approach combining model forecasts with observations could improve the predicted vegetation and yield anomalies drought years characteristic of large yield losses across the danube countries were captured by esi4 1 5 and awr40 35 esi12 2 5 and awr100 45 this equates to a yield loss of over 45 for maize in future research it is recommended to add more predictor variables to try to increase the predictive capacity of the drought yield loss assessment models the spatial distribution of the linkage of eight compound modes confirms that water restrictions applied during the vegetative growth stage negatively impact plant heights and biomass yields silage production therefore there was insufficient fodder supply to the livestock sector due to high water stress during the production season which finally led to substantially lower

9018,water saving irrigation technologies wsis for rice are widely used in china and are represented by alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd however there has been a lack of long term series simulations to investigate whether irrigation water inputs are saved using awd all the time to ascertain the performance of awd in six rice areas across china and to improve performance in this work 13 typical stations including awd and flooded irrigation fi in six major rice regions of china were selected and the rice irrigation demands of the typical stations from 2000 to 2020 were derived using the water balance model of paddy fields the performance of awd in different regions during different hydrological years were analyzed the results indicated that the amount and frequency of irrigation were reduced using awd in most cases while some even increased the ratio of increase accounted for 33 in late rice of hengyang which was especially obvious in dry years followed by normal years and less so in wet years the key reason for the above results was that future rainfall was not considered in the implementation of the wsis and rainfall occurs after irrigation gave rise to a regretful waste of both irrigation water and natural rainfall furthermore in our cases the use of awd to save water contributed to an increase in the effective use of rainfall and a reduction in both irrigation and drainage hence improving the effective use of rainfall is the key to water saving irrigation of rice considering future rainfall can further enhance the water savings of awd and effectively reduce needless irrigation keywords effective rainfall use irrigation demands alternate wetting and drying irrigation water saving irrigation future rainfall data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice is the main staple food for half of the world s population and china is the major rice producing country in the world hu et al 2016 muthayya et al 2014 seck et al 2012 currently rice is grown on 18 of the total planting area of food crops in china and its production is approximately 34 6 of the total food production chauhan et al 2017 rice as an aquatic flood tolerant crop requires a stable irrigation water supply to ensure no reduction in yield upadhyay 2016 however with the scarcity of global freshwater resources and the increase in global warming the availability of water for rice irrigation has reduced and water saving irrigation technologies wsis have gradually begun to attract attention to promote agricultural water conservation and emission reduction terjung et al 1984 yao et al 2012 he et al 2020 meng et al 2020 in the field of irrigation management whether to irrigate or drain both are controlled by the criteria of water depth consisting of the lower limit of water depth the upper limit of water depth and the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall the specific control principles have been described in detail in study chen et al 2022 at present there are two irrigation technologies in irrigation management for rice i e conventional irrigation and water saving irrigation the former mainly refers to flooded irrigation fi and the latter includes alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd controlled irrigation rain fed irrigation thin shallow wet and dry irrigation and so forth mao 2002 among them awd has been widely used in the major rice growing areas across china since the 1990s mao 2002 mushtaq et al 2006 and related studies have shown that awd performed better in saving water efficiently than fi while retaining yield moya et al 2004 bouman et al 2007 in regard to the typical irrigated lowlands in asia awd can reduce water use by up to 15 without yield losses when shallow groundwater remains within nearly 0 30 cm belder et al 2004 in addition to reducing the irrigation water input of rice it is reported that the practice of awd can be advantageous for the improvement of fertilizer e g nitrogen phosphorus use efficiency and water use efficiency song et al 2021 heavy metals reduction in grain das et al 2016 tanner et al 2018 and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions cheng et al 2022 islam et al 2022 however some investigations indicated that awd was not fully adopted by most farmers in practice and awd was mainly driven by water shortages instead of farmer s desire or first choice moya et al 2004 mushtaq et al 2006 moreover previous studies have indicated that the performance of awd was varied in different irrigation districts li and barker 2004 accordingly the water savings of awd were unstable at spatial scales for the varied performance of awd the suitable water depth combined with rainfall was considered for managing irrigation of paddy fields by kima et al 2015 which is an interesting way to improve the water savings of awd under climate change circumstances furthermore the lower limit of the water depth and the larger irrigation amount under awd compared with fi will incur vast field drainage if a great deal of rainfall occurs after irrigation therefore whether irrigation water can always be saved using awd remains to be seen to investigate the water savings of awd in field irrigation management the effect of rainfall should be considered fu et al 2012 over the years the role of rainfall in irrigation decision making has gradually received great interest many investigations have suggested that the variation in rice irrigation demands is mainly driven by rainwater especially in the growth period of early rice with abundant rainfall in southern china zhang et al 2019 luo et al 2022 in the practice of water saving irrigation excellent water saving effects are accompanied by a high efficiency of rainfall use massey et al 2018 consequently water catching and controlled irrigation technology have been proposed guo et al 2009 which reduced the amount and frequency of irrigation and drainage by increasing the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall and significantly enhanced rainfall use efficiency and water production efficiency without yield losses lu et al 2018 guo et al 2010 however rainfall contains a strong uncertainty and is sensitive to the external environment to better simulate the real situation for paddy fields an optimization model of a rice irrigation system considering random rainfall conditions was developed and the economic feasibility of the model was reported azhar et al 1992 cui et al 1999 chen et al 2022 additionally given that rainfall distribution in the rice growth period is extremely uneven the weather forecast has gradually been gaining attention in rice water saving irrigation with the purpose of conveniently obtaining more information concerning rainfall rochester and busch 1972 and a related study suggested that better use of rainfall in the early stages of rice growth is feasible but the accuracy of rainfall forecasts needs to be considered fu et al 2012 subsequently the performance of the rainfall forecast was considered acceptable after some investigations and its worth for application in the field of rice irrigation was illustrated by luo et al 2016 furthermore to maximize the efficiency of rainfall use in irrigation management for rice many studies have proposed many decision making methods for rice irrigation considering weather forecasting e g risk irrigation decision making based on distinct levels mishra et al 2013 cao et al 2019 and the reinforcement learning method has been applied for rice irrigation management chen et al 2021 nonetheless considering the impact of rainfall on rice irrigation several indistinct aspects remain unattended e g the variation of the efficiency of rainfall use and water savings under different rainfall scenarios and the relationship among water balance elements under a long series of scenarios in this paper two representative irrigation technologies awd and fi were selected to simulate the irrigation demands in six major rice regions of china from 2000 to 2020 the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate whether awd conserves irrigation water continually compared to fi in long term series 2 to evaluate the water savings of awd and the improvement of effective rainfall use in different hydrological years and 3 to further analyze the relationship among water balance elements in paddy fields under awd and fi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data according to the rice cultivation years planting area rice production and other related indicators thirteen typical stations were selected as the analysis objects in six major rice producing areas in china mei et al 1988 dali dl zhanjiang zj guilin gl gaoyou gy shaowu sw nanchang nc hengyang hy zhongxiang

and minimum temperature daily average temperature daily average relative humidity daily average wind speed daily sunshine duration and daily rainfall in addition the division of the rice growth period

tillering lt jointing booting jb heading flowering hf milk ripe mi and yellow ripe yr stages 2 2 calculation of irrigation demands for rice the irrigation demands of rice at thirteen stations were calculated by calculating the daily irrigation amount in the rice irrigation schedule and the daily irrigation amount was calculated as follows 1 i i h i h i 1 r i e t c i s i d i where i i is the irrigation amount on day i mm h i is the field water depth on day i mm h i 1 is the field water depth on day i 1 mm h i 1 30 mm at the initial field water depth and r i et ci d i and s i are rainfall actual crop water requirement drainage and seepage on day i respectively mm in this paper the daily seepage of paddy fields was set as a constant value which is 2 mm or 3 mm according to previous studies cao et al 2019 luo et al 2022 specific information is shown in table 2 this daily crop water requirement of rice et ci was calculated utilizing the single crop coefficient approach recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 and all stations are standard weather stations as recommended by the fao the et ci is calculated as follows 2 e t c i k s i k c i e t 0 i where k ci is the crop coefficient on day i et 0i is the reference evapotranspiration on day i mm which was computed using the penmanmonteith method allen et al 1998 and k si is the water stress coefficient on day i and rice growth cannot occur water stress under standard awd k si is set as 1 0 the reference value of the crop coefficient recommended by fao56 was used and the parameters were modified according to the wind speed average minimum and relative humidity in different growth periods liu et al 2009 the value of the crop coefficient was calculated as follows 3 k c k c s t d 0 04 u 2 2 0 04 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where k c is the modified crop coefficient selected by referring to the baseline value recommended by fao56 as follows k cini 1 05 k cmid 1 20 and k cend 0 90 k cstd is the crop coefficient value under standard conditions derived from fao56 u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s rh min is the average value of the lowest daily relative humidity in the growth stage and it can be obtained through t max using the method recommended by fao56 allen et al 1998 and h is the average height of the crop in the growth stage 0 9 during the middle growth stage and 1 2 at the end stage the water depth threshold of awd and fi are shown in appendix 1 dong et al 2020 zhou 2020 luo et al 2021 and the specific irrigation and drainage constraint conditions are as follows 4 i i h m i h i 0 h i h d i h i h d i 5 d i 0 h i 1 h u i h i 1 h u i h i 1 h u i where h mi is the upper limit of water depth after irrigation on day i mm h di is the lower limit of water depth before irrigation on day i mm and h ui is the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall on day i mm in this work the specific process of calculating the irrigation demands of rice is shown in fig 2 first the input data including weather data daily precipitation and initial water depth were imported and et0i was computed using the penmanmonteith method the decision variables i e water depth thresholds under two irrigation technologies were imported to the fi fie fim and fil and awd awde awdm and awdl then etc was calculated from the crop coefficients kci as modified by the fao56 recommended method and imported into the water balance model with the given seepage values and input data finally the output data i e irrigation water amount on day i drainage on day i and water depth on day i of two irrigation technologies were exported in addition it is worth noticing that kci was calculated according to the average minimum relative humidity for each growth stage rather than the long term average annual value which can effectively improve the accuracy of the computation compared with the traditional method 2 3 calculation of improvement in rainfall use efficiency the improved effect of effective rainfall use can be expressed by the following equation 6 δ r d a w d r r d f i r where δ is the improvement in rainfall use efficiency d awd indicates the drainage under awd d fi indicates the drainage under fi and r indicates the rainfall during the rice growth period the drainage d awd and d fi values were calculated by simultaneous eqs 1 2 4 and 5 2 4 pearson correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient is mainly utilized to test the correlation of two indices de winter et al 2016 the correlation between the indicators can be reflected by its value and it has been widely applied in signal analysis and risk prediction in this research the relation of different water balance elements can be obtained by the pearson correlation coefficient and the equation is as follows 7 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 1 2 where r x y is the correlation coefficient between x and y x i and y i are the values of the variables in year i of the series x and y are the average values of x and y respectively and n is the number of samples x and y represent a positive linear correlation when r x y 0 x and y represent a negative linear correlation when r x y 0 and x and y are independent of each other when r x y 0 the larger the absolute value of r x y is the stronger the correlation between the two variables and conversely the weaker the linear correlation or nonlinear correlation in this study to test the reliability of the correlation using a significance test a t test was used and a p value less than 0 05 or less than 0 01 indicated a significant correlation or extremely significant correlation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of irrigation demands under different irrigation technologies the difference in irrigation demands from 2000 to 2020 at the thirteen stations under awd and fi is presented in fig 3 the results illustrated that the difference in irrigation demands was above 0 in most cases which demonstrated that the overall water savings of awd were significant especially in zje zjl swe swl gym hye and djym and it could be visualized that the reduction in irrigation demands using awd was kept constant in gym the reduction ranged from 3 2 mm to 117 6 mm and zjl the reduction ranged from 2 7 mm to 143 3 mm while at other stations irrigation demands presented a small increase in some years approximately 40 mm at most with regard to the cases without saving irrigation water awd performed worst in hyl and fjm followed by hye gle ycm etc certainly due to the rainfall peak time varied from different regions the irrigation demands were different accordingly luo et al 2022 and the water savings of awd varied from station to station regarding the water savings of awd three cases were selected for analysis early and late rice in zhanjiang and middle rice in gaoyou in 2009 the variations in irrigation amount rainfall water depth and drainage under awd and fi are shown in fig 4 the results indicated that the amount of irrigation was reduced by 95 4 mm and the frequency of irrigation was reduced by 5 times in zje under awd compared to fi fig 4a and b and the reductions in zjl and gym were 68 04 mm and 4 times and 55 42 mm and 4 times respectively fig 4c d e and f therefore no matter which type of rice was planted the frequency and amount of irrigation were greatly reduced using awd meanwhile reaching the lower limit of water depth under awd required more time than fi fig 4 which means that the time interval of the non submerged period was extended to utilize natural rainfall readily in addition a stronger change in water depth in the paddy fields under awd positively improved the microenvironment of the rice root system cabangon et al 2001 song et al 2021 and the performance of awd in this work is in agreement with previous studies sureshkumar and pandian 2017 feng et al 2021 likewise two examples without conserving water were selected early rice of hengyang in 2002 and middle rice of fujin in 2007 as shown in fig 5 in fig 5a hye a series of rainfall events occurred after a large amount of single irrigation and the current water depth exceeded the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall thus a lot of rainwater was drained and wasted in fig 5b fjm the same situation appeared in the period of the first example as well but the period of the second example was close to the yellow ripe stage and massive drainage occurred in the non submerged period of paddy fields so that a proportion of irrigation water was not used effectively the drained water was also ineffective irrigation water najmuddin et al 2018 consequently rainfall occurs after irrigation and ineffective irrigation may contribute to massive drainage wasted rainwater and less efficient use of rainfall moreover the spatial discrepancy of water saving proportion of all typical stations under awd was presented in fig 6b and the water savings of awd showed a weakening trend from central china to the northsouth border specifically water savings under awd performed best in zjl and gym for 21 years while the other stations did not conserve irrigation water in a few years specifically the years without saving water accounted for 33 in fjm and hyl 24 for hye ncl zje gll and dlm 19 for ccm ycm kfm swe and swl 14 for gle 10 for zxm and 5 for djym and nce fig 6a it is worth noting that the nonwater saving frequency using awd in the growth period of early rice was less than that in the growth period of late rice except for zhanjiang generally abundant rainfall was concentrated in the growth period of early rice basically in southern china the early rice only requires less water luo et al 2022 thus awd can reduce more drainage to conserve more irrigation water based on the above results and analyses a great disparity in the performance of awd was shown in different years and stations commonly the amount of rainfall in northern china was less than that in southern china during the rice growth period dong et al 2020 and the distribution of rainfall events during the growth period of early middle and late rice varied as well cao et al 2019 accordingly the discrepancy of rainfall distribution naturally had an impact on the performance of awd islam et al 2022 moreover rice irrigation demands could be compensated to some degree by the rainfall during the rice growth period luo et al 2022 and many lakes and ponds could be stable irrigation water sources by storing plenty of rainwater in the rice region of southern china mushtaq et al 2006 thus the paddy field water depth was usually controlled by the lower limit of irrigation and by this time not considering the occurrence of rainfall events after irrigation may incur more drainage as early as the beginning of the 21st century relevant studies indicated that the performance of awd varied in different regions cabangon et al 2001 mao 2002 due to the limitation of experimental conditions paddy field experiments could not be carried out widely meanwhile the water savings under awd were confirmed but the variation in rice yield using awd was a focus of the argument because of different experimental conditions and treatments lampayan et al 2015 and owing to the surface drainage can incur nitrogen losses from paddy fields yoshinaga et al 2007 awd could reduce drainage up to a point han et al 2021 the nitrogen use efficiency could be improved dong et al 2012 and the negative environmental impacts could be reduced cheng et al 2022 in practice most farmers usually cannot practice awd on rice irrigation management completely mushtaq et al 2006 which might limit the advantages of awd compared to fi e g rainfall use drainage reduction consequently further analysis of the performance of awd in different hydrological years and the development of practical significant guidance for rice irrigation management are imminent 3 2 water savings and the improvement of rainfall use under awd in different hydrological years to further investigate the difference in water savings of awd in different hydrological years the hydrological years i e dry years normal years and wet years were divided based on the rainfall during the growth period of rice in different stations using the positive and negative anomaly method and the drought and flood index method yu 2013 fig 7 presents the spatial discrepancy of the water saving frequency using awd in different hydrological years the highest frequency of water savings was observed at stations along the yangtze river basin for dry years e g djy zx nc and gy fig 7a while a higher frequency of water savings was observed in the northern and western rice areas only for wet years with only a slight improvement in the frequency of water savings in the southern humid rice area fig 7c and for normal years fig 7b there was little difference in water savings among stations except for gym therefore in terms of the frequency of water savings awd performed best in wet years followed by normal years and worst in dry years generally awd can be practiced readily in dry season but not in wet season as abundant rainfall may interrupt the practice of awd islam et al 2022 although the above results denoted that the frequency of water savings using awd was more in wet years rather than dry years the water saving efficiency under awd was not clear it was imperative to further analyze the performance of awd for each station as a result of rainfall is inextricably linked with irrigation demands zhang et al 2019 and irrigation demands can be reduced through improving rainfall use efficiency luo et al 2022 thus the improvement of rainfall use efficiency irue at the thirteen stations under awd compared with fi was analyzed fig 8 dissimilar to the frequency of water savings with awd the effects of irue performed best in dry years followed by normal years and worst in wet years while the fluctuation in irue was the most drastic in dry years fig 8a b and c which should be the reason for the highest nonwater saving frequency in dry years moreover the irue of ncl performed best in dry years and exceeded others rainfall use efficiency increased by 0 27 0 60 in wet years in addition to kfm ycm and ccm the irue of other stations was not obvious and even the effective rainfall use decreased slightly in a few years in normal years the irue of each station was unstable the rainfall use efficiency decreased in some cases on the whole irue under awd was affected by rainfall during the growth period of rice but not just rainfall volume notably the above revealed results showed an interesting phenomenon specifically the frequency of water savings clearly indicated spatial discrepancy using awd fig 7 i e nonwater saving frequency was most in dry years followed by normal years and less so in wet years for irue it clearly described the water saving extent under awd compared to fi in different hydrological years i e awd performed best in dry years followed by normal years and worst in wet years and natural rainfall has a great influence on the performance of awd but abundant rainfall does not mean that awd has high water saving efficiency no matter which irrigation technology irrigation demands not only depend on the accumulated rainfall during the growth period of rice but are also closely related to the rainfall distribution luo et al 2022 currently growing water saving strategies are gradually being utilized to improve the efficiency of rainfall use in paddy fields for instance in southeast asia rain fed agriculture developed rapidly due to local abundant rainfall every year especially for rain fed lowland rice raes et al 2007 cha un et al 2017 in addition dry seeded rice technology was applied in wet season irrigated areas and dry seeded rice increased the water productivity of irrigation water over wet seeded and transplanted rice tuong and bouman 2003 in southern china abundant rainfall can compensate for rice water requirements in one way but it can be influenced easily by climate change luo et al 2022 kima et al 2015 therefore to better consider future climate change especially in rainfall in the irrigation management of rice how the water balance elements under wsis interact needs to be further investigated which will contribute to the improvement of rainfall use efficiency and the advancement of wsis 3 3 relationship of water balance elements under awd and fi pearson correlation analysis was applied to the water balance elements of paddy fields i e irrigation demands rainfall etc and drainage during the whole growth period of rice under the two irrigation technologies and the results of the correlation analysis are shown in table 3 as a whole a significantly negative linear correlation between irrigation demands and rainfall was demonstrated and awd performed more prominently than fi the correlation was not significant in nce under fi and irrigation demands were positively correlated with etc and fi was more stable than awd meanwhile irrigation demands and drainage presented a negative correlation as a whole under two irrigation technologies but the difference between them cannot be found in addition it is important to note that compared with other stations the correlation between rainfall and irrigation demands was not prominent in nce 0 431 under fi and this may be because the rainfall peak continually outstripped the etc peak during the growth period of rice in nce luo et al 2022 while rainfall was used more under awd the correlation of them became significant 0 526 under awd with respect to the correlation between irrigation demands and etc was not significant in a few stations e g 0 182 in djym under fi 0 066 in djym under awd and 0 412 in gle under fi for the reason that the volume of rainfall was much greater than etc during the whole growth period of rice fig 9 and the distribution of rainfall can better close the distribution of etc luo et al 2022 the slight variation of etc had little significance influence on irrigation demands theoretically etc can be compensated to a great extent by abundant rainfall during the growth period of rice luo et al 2022 but the amount of etc was far more than the rainfall volume in many cases fig 9 especially in ycm hyl gll and fjm certainly the role of rainfall distribution and duration cannot be ignored in rice irrigation management except for rainfall amount per growth period cao et al 2019 luo et al 2021 and it can be concluded from chapter 3 2 that awd performed better than fi in rainfall use although the amount of rainfall was far more than the etc still exist in many years the irrigation amount was basically above 0 fig 9 accordingly there is a lot of room for improving the efficiency of rainfall use under awd and focusing on the variation of rainfall distribution and duration in irrigation management of rice to improve awd should be a fascinating work in the future to further ascertain the correlation variation between irrigation demands and drainage under awd compared to fi the variation in the water saving amount and drainage reduction during the whole growth period of rice was shown in fig 10 the results indicated that the water saving amount was in line with the drainage reduction in most cases and the drainage reduction was much less than the savings of irrigation water in some stations in general water savings of awd mainly include drainage reduction reduction of deep percolation and etc reduction sriphirom et al 2019 akpoti et al 2021 in this work water savings of awd were incurred by drainage reduction and sometimes it was triggered by irrigation reduction before sun baking of paddy fields additionally due to the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall of the two irrigation technologies was not consistent in the different growth stages of rice carroll et al 2020 he et al 2020 which may make the variation in drainage greater than the variation in irrigation in a few cases and the reduction in irrigation demands and drainage at a few stations was simultaneously below 0 because awd was applied without saving water simultaneously the water saving amount was above 0 with drainage increase occasionally han et al 2021 moreover the variation trend of ws rd is generally divided by 0 points within a range above 0 the trend showed that the water savings outstripped the drainage reduction and the water savings were lower than the drainage reduction within a range below 0 overall the above results were realistic in practice and taking it by and large water savings were quite close to drainage reduction which was dominated by rainfall zhang et al 2019 in other words the nonwatery saving frequency was mainly affected by massive drainage in paddy fields at present extant wsis mainly consider the regulation of different upper or lower limits of water depth this is a passive approach as the importance of rainfall in irrigation management was appreciated rainfall forecasts began to be applied to the irrigation schedule cao et al 2019 and a risk based irrigation decision making method was developed by cao et al 2016 and nie et al 2017 recently an investigation proposed a method of using weather forecasts to guide the frequency and amount of irrigation chen et al 2021 previous cases have confirmed that considering future rainfall in rice irrigation management was significant thus paying close attention to the future rainfall to advance the water saving potential of current wsis should be imperative furthermore drainage reduction should be considered in irrigation management and few investigations have focused on the control of field drainage considering future rainfall generally at the end of the late tillering period of rice paddy fields need to be drained for a while to improve soil permeability and air content reduce ineffective tiller and promote carbohydrate accumulation dong et al 2020 sun et al 2020 and sun baking of paddy fields would require field surfaces without submergence tuong and bouman 2003 whenever the following days are sunny the paddy field water will be drained off immediately otherwise no drainage will be needed in fact regulating the drainage amount corresponding to future rainfall is beneficial for improving the efficiency of irrigation utilization peng et al 2015 in addition the current wsis address natural rainfall without dynamic regulation particularly the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall therefore how to control the drainage of paddy fields and dynamically regulate the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall will be vital for the improvement of current water saving practices which can further improve the efficiency of rainfall use and conserve irrigation water in the future the decision making of controlling irrigation and drainage based on weather forecasts should be considered to promote the development of water saving irrigation in paddy fields furthermore there are still some limitations in this study first the impact of rainfall distribution and duration on awd performance was not analyzed in detail because of the word count limitations of the article second the use of statistical methods in this paper is relatively simple more statistical methods would be adopted in the next work above mentioned limitations could be taken under consideration in future studies 4 conclusions based on the above results and analysis the following conclusions can be reached water savings of awd were significant in most cases compared with fi while the increase of irrigation demands occurred in a few cases due to rainfall occurs after irrigation and ineffective irrigation in paddy field twelve stations a weakening trend from central china to the northsouth border appeared for the performance of awd from 100 to 67 awd performed best in dry years followed by normal years and worst in wet years and nonwatery saving frequency was most in dry years followed by normal years and less so in wet years meanwhile rainfall had a vital impact on the performance of awd rainfall was more closely connected with irrigation demands under awd compared to fi and focusing on future rainfall distribution and duration during the growth period of rice could be a good way to improve wsis e g awd water saving amount corresponded with drainage reduction mostly therefore the improvement of the efficient utilization of rainfall is the key to the amelioration of extant wsis investigating the irrigation and drainage decision making of considering future rainfall will be the focus of future work declaration of competing interest the authors

9018,water saving irrigation technologies wsis for rice are widely used in china and are represented by alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd however there has been a lack of long term series simulations to investigate whether irrigation water inputs are saved using awd all the time to ascertain the performance of awd in six rice areas across china and to improve performance in this work 13 typical stations including awd and flooded irrigation fi in six major rice regions of china were selected and the rice irrigation demands of the typical stations from 2000 to 2020 were derived using the water balance model of paddy fields the performance of awd in different regions during different hydrological years were analyzed the results indicated that the amount and frequency of irrigation were reduced using awd in most cases while some even increased the ratio of increase accounted for 33 in late rice of hengyang which was especially obvious in dry years followed by normal years and less so in wet years the key reason for the above results was that future rainfall was not considered in the implementation of the wsis and rainfall occurs after irrigation gave rise to a regretful waste of both irrigation water and natural rainfall furthermore in our cases the use of awd to save water contributed to an increase in the effective use of rainfall and a reduction in both irrigation and drainage hence improving the effective use of rainfall is the key to water saving irrigation of rice considering future rainfall can further enhance the water savings of awd and effectively reduce needless irrigation keywords effective rainfall use irrigation demands alternate wetting and drying irrigation water saving irrigation future rainfall data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice is the main staple food for half of the world s population and china is the major rice producing country in the world hu et al 2016 muthayya et al 2014 seck et al 2012 currently rice is grown on 18 of the total planting area of food crops in china and its production is approximately 34 6 of the total food production chauhan et al 2017 rice as an aquatic flood tolerant crop requires a stable irrigation water supply to ensure no reduction in yield upadhyay 2016 however with the scarcity of global freshwater resources and the increase in global warming the availability of water for rice irrigation has reduced and water saving irrigation technologies wsis have gradually begun to attract attention to promote agricultural water conservation and emission reduction terjung et al 1984 yao et al 2012 he et al 2020 meng et al 2020 in the field of irrigation management whether to irrigate or drain both are controlled by the criteria of water depth consisting of the lower limit of water depth the upper limit of water depth and the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall the specific control principles have been described in detail in study chen et al 2022 at present there are two irrigation technologies in irrigation management for rice i e conventional irrigation and water saving irrigation the former mainly refers to flooded irrigation fi and the latter includes alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd controlled irrigation rain fed irrigation thin shallow wet and dry irrigation and so forth mao 2002 among them awd has been widely used in the major rice growing areas across china since the 1990s mao 2002 mushtaq et al 2006 and related studies have shown that awd performed better in saving water efficiently than fi while retaining yield moya et al 2004 bouman et al 2007 in regard to the typical irrigated lowlands in asia awd can reduce water use by up to 15 without yield losses when shallow groundwater remains within nearly 0 30 cm belder et al 2004 in addition to reducing the irrigation water input of rice it is reported that the practice of awd can be advantageous for the improvement of fertilizer e g nitrogen phosphorus use efficiency and water use efficiency song et al 2021 heavy metals reduction in grain das et al 2016 tanner et al 2018 and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions cheng et al 2022 islam et al 2022 however some investigations indicated that awd was not fully adopted by most farmers in practice and awd was mainly driven by water shortages instead of farmer s desire or first choice moya et al 2004 mushtaq et al 2006 moreover previous studies have indicated that the performance of awd was varied in different irrigation districts li and barker 2004 accordingly the water savings of awd were unstable at spatial scales for the varied performance of awd the suitable water depth combined with rainfall was considered for managing irrigation of paddy fields by kima et al 2015 which is an interesting way to improve the water savings of awd under climate change circumstances furthermore the lower limit of the water depth and the larger irrigation amount under awd compared with fi will incur vast field drainage if a great deal of rainfall occurs after irrigation therefore whether irrigation water can always be saved using awd remains to be seen to investigate the water savings of awd in field irrigation management the effect of rainfall should be considered fu et al 2012 over the years the role of rainfall in irrigation decision making has gradually received great interest many investigations have suggested that the variation in rice irrigation demands is mainly driven by rainwater especially in the growth period of early rice with abundant rainfall in southern china zhang et al 2019 luo et al 2022 in the practice of water saving irrigation excellent water saving effects are accompanied by a high efficiency of rainfall use massey et al 2018 consequently water catching and controlled irrigation technology have been proposed guo et al 2009 which reduced the amount and frequency of irrigation and drainage by increasing the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall and significantly enhanced rainfall use efficiency and water production efficiency without yield losses lu et al 2018 guo et al 2010 however rainfall contains a strong uncertainty and is sensitive to the external environment to better simulate the real situation for paddy fields an optimization model of a rice irrigation system considering random rainfall conditions was developed and the economic feasibility of the model was reported azhar et al 1992 cui et al 1999 chen et al 2022 additionally given that rainfall distribution in the rice growth period is extremely uneven the weather forecast has gradually been gaining attention in rice water saving irrigation with the purpose of conveniently obtaining more information concerning rainfall rochester and busch 1972 and a related study suggested that better use of rainfall in the early stages of rice growth is feasible but the accuracy of rainfall forecasts needs to be considered fu et al 2012 subsequently the performance of the rainfall forecast was considered acceptable after some investigations and its worth for application in the field of rice irrigation was illustrated by luo et al 2016 furthermore to maximize the efficiency of rainfall use in irrigation management for rice many studies have proposed many decision making methods for rice irrigation considering weather forecasting e g risk irrigation decision making based on distinct levels mishra et al 2013 cao et al 2019 and the reinforcement learning method has been applied for rice irrigation management chen et al 2021 nonetheless considering the impact of rainfall on rice irrigation several indistinct aspects remain unattended e g the variation of the efficiency of rainfall use and water savings under different rainfall scenarios and the relationship among water balance elements under a long series of scenarios in this paper two representative irrigation technologies awd and fi were selected to simulate the irrigation demands in six major rice regions of china from 2000 to 2020 the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate whether awd conserves irrigation water continually compared to fi in long term series 2 to evaluate the water savings of awd and the improvement of effective rainfall use in different hydrological years and 3 to further analyze the relationship among water balance elements in paddy fields under awd and fi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data according to the rice cultivation years planting area rice production and other related indicators thirteen typical stations were selected as the analysis objects in six major rice producing areas in china mei et al 1988 dali dl zhanjiang zj guilin gl gaoyou gy shaowu sw nanchang nc hengyang hy zhongxiang

2000 to 2020 was collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn to calculate the daily evapotranspiration of the thirteen typical stations including daily maximum and minimum temperature daily average temperature daily average relative humidity daily average wind speed daily sunshine duration and daily rainfall in addition the division of the rice growth period

tillering lt jointing booting jb heading flowering hf milk ripe mi and yellow ripe yr stages 2 2 calculation of irrigation demands for rice the irrigation demands of rice at thirteen stations were calculated by calculating the daily irrigation amount in the rice irrigation schedule and the daily irrigation amount was calculated as follows 1 i i h i h i 1 r i e t c i s i d i where i i is the irrigation amount on day i mm h i is the field water depth on day i mm h i 1 is the field water depth on day i 1 mm h i 1 30 mm at the initial field water depth and r i et ci d i and s i are rainfall actual crop water requirement drainage and seepage on day i respectively mm in this paper the daily seepage of paddy fields was set as a constant value which is 2 mm or 3 mm according to previous studies cao et al 2019 luo et al 2022 specific information is shown in table 2 this daily crop water requirement of rice et ci was calculated utilizing the single crop coefficient approach recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 and all stations are standard weather stations as recommended by the fao the et ci is calculated as follows 2 e t c i k s i k c i e t 0 i where k ci is the crop coefficient on day i et 0i is the reference evapotranspiration on day i mm which was computed using the penmanmonteith method allen et al 1998 and k si is the water stress coefficient on day i and rice growth cannot occur water stress under standard awd k si is set as 1 0 the reference value of the crop coefficient recommended by fao56 was used and the parameters were modified according to the wind speed average minimum and relative humidity in different growth periods liu et al 2009 the value of the crop coefficient was calculated as follows 3 k c k c s t d 0 04 u 2 2 0 04 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where k c is the modified crop coefficient selected by referring to the baseline value recommended by fao56 as follows k cini 1 05 k cmid 1 20 and k cend 0 90 k cstd is the crop coefficient value under standard conditions derived from fao56 u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s rh min is the average value of the lowest daily relative humidity in the growth stage and it can be obtained through t max using the method recommended by fao56 allen et al 1998 and h is the average height of the crop in the growth stage 0 9 during the middle growth stage and 1 2 at the end stage the water depth threshold of awd and fi are shown in appendix 1 dong et al 2020 zhou 2020 luo et al 2021 and the specific irrigation and drainage constraint conditions are as follows 4 i i h m i h i 0 h i h d i h i h d i 5 d i 0 h i 1 h u i h i 1 h u i h i 1 h u i where h mi is the upper limit of water depth after irrigation on day i mm h di is the lower limit of water depth before irrigation on day i mm and h ui is the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall on day i mm in this work the specific process of calculating the irrigation demands of rice is shown in fig 2 first the input data including weather data daily precipitation and initial water depth were imported and et0i was computed using the penmanmonteith method the decision variables i e water depth thresholds under two irrigation technologies were imported to the fi fie fim and fil and awd awde awdm and awdl then etc was calculated from the crop coefficients kci as modified by the fao56 recommended method and imported into the water balance model with the given seepage values and input data finally the output data i e irrigation water amount on day i drainage on day i and water depth on day i of two irrigation technologies were exported in addition it is worth noticing that kci was calculated according to the average minimum relative humidity for each growth stage rather than the long term average annual value which can effectively improve the accuracy of the computation compared with the traditional method 2 3 calculation of improvement in rainfall use efficiency the improved effect of effective rainfall use can be expressed by the following equation 6 δ r d a w d r r d f i r where δ is the improvement in rainfall use efficiency d awd indicates the drainage under awd d fi indicates the drainage under fi and r indicates the rainfall during the rice growth period the drainage d awd and d fi values were calculated by simultaneous eqs 1 2 4 and 5 2 4 pearson correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient is mainly utilized to test the correlation of two indices de winter et al 2016 the correlation between the indicators can be reflected by its value and it has been widely applied in signal analysis and risk prediction in this research the relation of different water balance elements can be obtained by the pearson correlation coefficient and the equation is as follows 7 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 1 2 where r x y is the correlation coefficient between x and y x i and y i are the values of the variables in year i of the series x and y are the average values of x and y respectively and n is the number of samples x and y represent a positive linear correlation when r x y 0 x and y represent a negative linear correlation when r x y 0 and x and y are independent of each other when r x y 0 the larger the absolute value of r x y is the stronger the correlation between the two variables and conversely the weaker the linear correlation or nonlinear correlation in this study to test the reliability of the correlation using a significance test a t test was used and a p value less than 0 05 or less than 0 01 indicated a significant correlation or extremely significant correlation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of irrigation demands under different irrigation technologies the difference in irrigation demands from 2000 to 2020 at the thirteen stations under awd and fi is presented in fig 3 the results illustrated that the difference in irrigation demands was above 0 in most cases which demonstrated that the overall water savings of awd were significant especially in zje zjl swe swl gym hye and djym and it could be visualized that the reduction in irrigation demands using awd was kept constant in gym the reduction ranged from 3 2 mm to 117 6 mm and zjl the reduction ranged from 2 7 mm to 143 3 mm while at other stations irrigation demands presented a small increase in some years approximately 40 mm at most with regard to the cases without saving irrigation water awd performed worst in hyl and fjm followed by hye gle ycm etc certainly due to the rainfall peak time varied from different regions the irrigation demands were different accordingly luo et al 2022 and the water savings of awd varied from station to station regarding the water savings of awd three cases were selected for analysis early and late rice in zhanjiang and middle rice in gaoyou in 2009 the variations in irrigation amount rainfall water depth and drainage under awd and fi are shown in fig 4 the results indicated that the amount of irrigation was reduced by 95 4 mm and the frequency of irrigation was reduced by 5 times in zje under awd compared to fi fig 4a and b and the reductions in zjl and gym were 68 04 mm and 4 times and 55 42 mm and 4 times respectively fig 4c d e and f therefore no matter which type of rice was planted the frequency and amount of irrigation were greatly reduced using awd meanwhile reaching the lower limit of water depth under awd required more time than fi fig 4 which means that the time interval of the non submerged period was extended to utilize natural rainfall readily in addition a stronger change in water depth in the paddy fields under awd positively improved the microenvironment of the rice root system cabangon et al 2001 song et al 2021 and the performance of awd in this work is in agreement with previous studies sureshkumar and pandian 2017 feng et al 2021 likewise two examples without conserving water were selected early rice of hengyang in 2002 and middle rice of fujin in 2007 as shown in fig 5 in fig 5a hye a series of rainfall events occurred after a large amount of single irrigation and the current water depth exceeded the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall thus a lot of rainwater was drained and wasted in fig 5b fjm the same situation appeared in the period of the first example as well but the period of the second example was close to the yellow ripe stage and massive drainage occurred in the non submerged period of paddy fields so that a proportion of irrigation water was not used effectively the drained water was also ineffective irrigation water najmuddin et al 2018 consequently rainfall occurs after irrigation and ineffective irrigation may contribute to massive drainage wasted rainwater and less efficient use of rainfall moreover the spatial discrepancy of water saving proportion of all typical stations under awd was presented in fig 6b and the water savings of awd showed a weakening trend from central china to the northsouth border specifically water savings under awd performed best in zjl and gym for 21 years while the other stations did not conserve irrigation water in a few years specifically the years without saving water accounted for 33 in fjm and hyl 24 for hye ncl zje gll and dlm 19 for ccm ycm kfm swe and swl 14 for gle 10 for zxm and 5 for djym and nce fig 6a it is worth noting that the nonwater saving frequency using awd in the growth period of early rice was less than that in the growth period of late rice except for zhanjiang generally abundant rainfall was concentrated in the growth period of early rice basically in southern china the early rice only requires less water luo et al 2022 thus awd can reduce more drainage to conserve more irrigation water based on the above results and analyses a great disparity in the performance of awd was shown in different years and stations commonly the amount of rainfall in northern china was less than that in southern china during the rice growth period dong et al 2020 and the distribution of rainfall events during the growth period of early middle and late rice varied as well cao et al 2019 accordingly the discrepancy of rainfall distribution naturally had an impact on the performance of awd islam et al 2022 moreover rice irrigation demands could be compensated to some degree by the rainfall during the rice growth period luo et al 2022 and many lakes and ponds could be stable irrigation water sources by storing plenty of rainwater in the rice region of southern china mushtaq et al 2006 thus the paddy field water depth was usually controlled by the lower limit of irrigation and by this time not considering the occurrence of rainfall events after irrigation may incur more drainage as early as the beginning of the 21st century relevant studies indicated that the performance of awd varied in different regions cabangon et al 2001 mao 2002 due to the limitation of experimental conditions paddy field experiments could not be carried out widely meanwhile the water savings under awd were confirmed but the variation in rice yield using awd was a focus of the argument because of different experimental conditions and treatments lampayan et al 2015 and owing to the surface drainage can incur nitrogen losses from paddy fields yoshinaga et al 2007 awd could reduce drainage up to a point han et al 2021 the nitrogen use efficiency could be improved dong et al 2012 and the negative environmental impacts could be reduced cheng et al 2022 in practice most farmers usually cannot practice awd on rice irrigation management completely mushtaq et al 2006 which might limit the advantages of awd compared to fi e g rainfall use drainage reduction consequently further analysis of the performance of awd in different hydrological years and the development of practical significant guidance for rice irrigation management are imminent 3 2 water savings and the improvement of rainfall use under awd in different hydrological years to further investigate the difference in water savings of awd in different hydrological years the hydrological years i e dry years normal years and wet years were divided based on the rainfall during the growth period of rice in different stations using the positive and negative anomaly method and the drought and flood index method yu 2013 fig 7 presents the spatial discrepancy of the water saving frequency using awd in different hydrological years the highest frequency of water savings was observed at stations along the yangtze river basin for dry years e g djy zx nc and gy fig 7a while a higher frequency of water savings was observed in the northern and western rice areas only for wet years with only a slight improvement in the frequency of water savings in the southern humid rice area fig 7c and for normal years fig 7b there was little difference in water savings among stations except for gym therefore in terms of the frequency of water savings awd performed best in wet years followed by normal years and worst in dry years generally awd can be practiced readily in dry season but not in wet season as abundant rainfall may interrupt the practice of awd islam et al 2022 although the above results denoted that the frequency of water savings using awd was more in wet years rather than dry years the water saving efficiency under awd was not clear it was imperative to further analyze the performance of awd for each station as a result of rainfall is inextricably linked with irrigation demands zhang et al 2019 and irrigation demands can be reduced through improving rainfall use efficiency luo et al 2022 thus the improvement of rainfall use efficiency irue at the thirteen stations under awd compared with fi was analyzed fig 8 dissimilar to the frequency of water savings with awd the effects of irue performed best in dry years followed by normal years and worst in wet years while the fluctuation in irue was the most drastic in dry years fig 8a b and c which should be the reason for the highest nonwater saving frequency in dry years moreover the irue of ncl performed best in dry years and exceeded others rainfall use efficiency increased by 0 27 0 60 in wet years in addition to kfm ycm and ccm the irue of other stations was not obvious and even the effective rainfall use decreased slightly in a few years in normal years the irue of each station was unstable the rainfall use efficiency decreased in some cases on the whole irue under awd was affected by rainfall during the growth period of rice but not just rainfall volume notably the above revealed results showed an interesting phenomenon specifically the frequency of water savings clearly indicated spatial discrepancy using awd fig 7 i e nonwater saving frequency was most in dry years followed by normal years and less so in wet years for irue it clearly described the water saving extent under awd compared to fi in different hydrological years i e awd performed best in dry years followed by normal years and worst in wet years and natural rainfall has a great influence on the performance of awd but abundant rainfall does not mean that awd has high water saving efficiency no matter which irrigation technology irrigation demands not only depend on the accumulated rainfall during the growth period of rice but are also closely related to the rainfall distribution luo et al 2022 currently growing water saving strategies are gradually being utilized to improve the efficiency of rainfall use in paddy fields for instance in southeast asia rain fed agriculture developed rapidly due to local abundant rainfall every year especially for rain fed lowland rice raes et al 2007 cha un et al 2017 in addition dry seeded rice technology was applied in wet season irrigated areas and dry seeded rice increased the water productivity of irrigation water over wet seeded and transplanted rice tuong and bouman 2003 in southern china abundant rainfall can compensate for rice water requirements in one way but it can be influenced easily by climate change luo et al 2022 kima et al 2015 therefore to better consider future climate change especially in rainfall in the irrigation management of rice how the water balance elements under wsis interact needs to be further investigated which will contribute to the improvement of rainfall use efficiency and the advancement of wsis 3 3 relationship of water balance elements under awd and fi pearson correlation analysis was applied to the water balance elements of paddy fields i e irrigation demands rainfall etc and drainage during the whole growth period of rice under the two irrigation technologies and the results of the correlation analysis are shown in table 3 as a whole a significantly negative linear correlation between irrigation demands and rainfall was demonstrated and awd performed more prominently than fi the correlation was not significant in nce under fi and irrigation demands were positively correlated with etc and fi was more stable than awd meanwhile irrigation demands and drainage presented a negative correlation as a whole under two irrigation technologies but the difference between them cannot be found in addition it is important to note that compared with other stations the correlation between rainfall and irrigation demands was not prominent in nce 0 431 under fi and this may be because the rainfall peak continually outstripped the etc peak during the growth period of rice in nce luo et al 2022 while rainfall was used more under awd the correlation of them became significant 0 526 under awd with respect to the correlation between irrigation demands and etc was not significant in a few stations e g 0 182 in djym under fi 0 066 in djym under awd and 0 412 in gle under fi for the reason that the volume of rainfall was much greater than etc during the whole growth period of rice fig 9 and the distribution of rainfall can better close the distribution of etc luo et al 2022 the slight variation of etc had little significance influence on irrigation demands theoretically etc can be compensated to a great extent by abundant rainfall during the growth period of rice luo et al 2022 but the amount of etc was far more than the rainfall volume in many cases fig 9 especially in ycm hyl gll and fjm certainly the role of rainfall distribution and duration cannot be ignored in rice irrigation management except for rainfall amount per growth period cao et al 2019 luo et al 2021 and it can be concluded from chapter 3 2 that awd performed better than fi in rainfall use although the amount of rainfall was far more than the etc still exist in many years the irrigation amount was basically above 0 fig 9 accordingly there is a lot of room for improving the efficiency of rainfall use under awd and focusing on the variation of rainfall distribution and duration in irrigation management of rice to improve awd should be a fascinating work in the future to further ascertain the correlation variation between irrigation demands and drainage under awd compared to fi the variation in the water saving amount and drainage reduction during the whole growth period of rice was shown in fig 10 the results indicated that the water saving amount was in line with the drainage reduction in most cases and the drainage reduction was much less than the savings of irrigation water in some stations in general water savings of awd mainly include drainage reduction reduction of deep percolation and etc reduction sriphirom et al 2019 akpoti et al 2021 in this work water savings of awd were incurred by drainage reduction and sometimes it was triggered by irrigation reduction before sun baking of paddy fields additionally due to the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall of the two irrigation technologies was not consistent in the different growth stages of rice carroll et al 2020 he et al 2020 which may make the variation in drainage greater than the variation in irrigation in a few cases and the reduction in irrigation demands and drainage at a few stations was simultaneously below 0 because awd was applied without saving water simultaneously the water saving amount was above 0 with drainage increase occasionally han et al 2021 moreover the variation trend of ws rd is generally divided by 0 points within a range above 0 the trend showed that the water savings outstripped the drainage reduction and the water savings were lower than the drainage reduction within a range below 0 overall the above results were realistic in practice and taking it by and large water savings were quite close to drainage reduction which was dominated by rainfall zhang et al 2019 in other words the nonwatery saving frequency was mainly affected by massive drainage in paddy fields at present extant wsis mainly consider the regulation of different upper or lower limits of water depth this is a passive approach as the importance of rainfall in irrigation management was appreciated rainfall forecasts began to be applied to the irrigation schedule cao et al 2019 and a risk based irrigation decision making method was developed by cao et al 2016 and nie et al 2017 recently an investigation proposed a method of using weather forecasts to guide the frequency and amount of irrigation chen et al 2021 previous cases have confirmed that considering future rainfall in rice irrigation management was significant thus paying close attention to the future rainfall to advance the water saving potential of current wsis should be imperative furthermore drainage reduction should be considered in irrigation management and few investigations have focused on the control of field drainage considering future rainfall generally at the end of the late tillering period of rice paddy fields need to be drained for a while to improve soil permeability and air content reduce ineffective tiller and promote carbohydrate accumulation dong et al 2020 sun et al 2020 and sun baking of paddy fields would require field surfaces without submergence tuong and bouman 2003 whenever the following days are sunny the paddy field water will be drained off immediately otherwise no drainage will be needed in fact regulating the drainage amount corresponding to future rainfall is beneficial for improving the efficiency of irrigation utilization peng et al 2015 in addition the current wsis address natural rainfall without dynamic regulation particularly the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall therefore how to control the drainage of paddy fields and dynamically regulate the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall will be vital for the improvement of current water saving practices which can further improve the efficiency of rainfall use and conserve irrigation water in the future the decision making of controlling irrigation and drainage based on weather forecasts should be considered to promote the development of water saving irrigation in paddy fields furthermore there are still some limitations in this study first the impact of rainfall distribution and duration on awd performance was not analyzed in detail because of the word count limitations of the article second the use of statistical methods in this paper is relatively simple more statistical methods would be adopted in the next work above mentioned limitations could be taken under consideration in future studies 4 conclusions based on the above results and analysis the following conclusions can be reached water savings of awd were significant in most cases compared with fi while the increase of irrigation demands occurred in a few cases due to rainfall occurs after irrigation and ineffective irrigation in paddy field twelve stations a weakening trend from central china to the northsouth border appeared for the performance of awd from 100 to 67 awd performed best in dry years followed by normal years and worst in wet years and nonwatery saving frequency was most in dry years followed by normal years and less so in wet years meanwhile rainfall had a vital impact on the performance of awd rainfall was more closely connected with irrigation demands under awd compared to fi and focusing on future rainfall distribution and duration during the growth period of rice could be a good way to improve wsis e g awd water saving amount corresponded with drainage reduction mostly therefore the improvement of the efficient utilization of rainfall is the key to the amelioration of extant wsis investigating the irrigation and drainage decision making of considering future rainfall will be the focus of future work declaration of competing interest the authors

9019,irrigated agriculture in the texas high plains thp region faces severe challenges due to rapidly declining groundwater levels in the underlying ogallala aquifer recurring droughts and projected warmer and drier future climatic conditions scheduling irrigation with appropriate deficits in different crop growth stages could improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue and thereby enable additional savings in valuable groundwater without severely compromising the crop yield our objective was to identify efficient growth stage based variable deficit irrigation gs vdi strategies for cotton production in the thp region for this purpose we used an evaluated decision support system agrotechnology transfer dssat cropgro cotton model based on measured data from a cotton iwue field experiment conducted at texas a m agrilife research center at halfway tx in the thp region this study considered four growth stages i first leaf to first square gs1 ii flower initiation early bloom gs2 iii peak bloom gs3 and iv cutout late bloom and boll opening stage gs4 long term 1977 2019 simulations were conducted with four deficit levels 30 50 70 and 90 evapotranspiration et replacements implemented in the above described four different growth stages resulting in 256 combinations of deficit irrigation scenarios based on the results of simulated seed cotton yield and iwue efficient gs vdi strategies were suggested for dry normal and wet years for example a strategy of 90 et replacement in gs1 to gs3 and of 30 et replacement in gs4 was found to be an ideal strategy in normal years to achieve higher seed cotton yield 8 less than that for the baseline scenario with 100 et replacement implemented in all growth stages while saving 65 mm of irrigation water results from this

introduction rapid decline in groundwater levels poses a threat to irrigated agriculture especially in semi arid and arid regions hoogesteger 2022 the semi arid texas high plains thp is one of the usa s most intensive irrigated agricultural areas primarily due to the underlying ogallala aquifer that is spread over 41 counties chen et al 2021 the southern portion of the ogallala aquifer has been mined extensively for agricultural irrigation for more than half a century colaizzi et al 2009 approximately 90 of the total water requirements and 95 of the total irrigation requirement in this region are met from this aquifer weinheimer et al 2013 himanshu et al 2021a however the well capacities in most parts of the southern ogallala aquifer region have declined due to withdrawals that exceed the natural recharge leading to difficulty in supplying water to meet the crop needs chaudhuri and ale 2014 scanlon et al 2012 ale et al 2021 these water shortages might exacerbate in the future due to projected increase in ambient temperature and changes in precipitation patterns as reported in climate change studies for this region islam et al 2012 modala et al 2017 as a result water districts in the thp have introduced restrictions on groundwater withdrawals to help sustain an agriculture based economy and prolong the life of the aquifer for example an annual groundwater extraction limit of 460 mm 18 in or 1 5 acre ft per acre is set by the high plains water district hpwd 2015 and the north plains underground water conservation district north plains gcd 2015 declining well capacities and groundwater pumping restrictions along with the recurring droughts and projected warmer and drier future climatic conditions in this region necessitate implementing efficient irrigation management strategies that could potentially reduce water use while sustaining agricultural productivity and profitability production of cotton gossypium hirsutum l a major irrigated cash crop in the thp region with about 52 of the total crop area usda nass 2022 is facing challenges from irrigation water shortages due to a rapid depletion in the groundwater level in the southern ogallala aquifer mcguire 2017 crop water stress is a common occurrence in this semi arid region that can be mitigated using efficient irrigation strategies zou et al 2021 fan et al 2022 although cotton plants can adapt well to water deficit irrigation ale et al 2020 himanshu et al 2021b there is a need to explore alternate irrigation strategies that could further reduce cotton irrigation demand and to sustain irrigated cotton production a growth stage based deficit irrigation strategy could be one such approach that can ensure improvements in irrigation water use efficiency iwue and crop water productivity kirda et al 2007 greaves and wang 2017 schaefer et al 2018 himanshu et al 2019 2021b several studies reported the benefits of optimal irrigation water allocation during different growth stages in water savings in cotton production systems bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 himanshu et al 2019 2021b li et al 2019 water deficit at specific growth stages of cotton can cause intense damage to crops reducing reproductive structures and affecting physiological processes with subsequent lint yield loss bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 recent studies reported that imposing water deficit during the peak bloom growth stage resulted in the lowest iwue and seed cotton yield while deficits during the early and late growth stages caused minimal effects on yield schaefer et al 2018 himanshu et al 2019 2021b the water requirement of cotton varies substantially during different growth stages and precipitation distribution and amount also significantly affects cotton growth and lint yield fisher and udeigwe 2012 himanshu et al 2021b therefore by imposing manageable variable deficits during different growth stages with consideration of growing season precipitation additional savings in valuable groundwater could be achieved without compromising the cotton lint yield comprehensive studies focusing on assessing the effects of growth stage based variable deficit irrigation gs vdi on cotton yield irrigation water use iwue are not reported in the literature and this study aims to identify such efficient gs vdi strategies for the thp region evaluating efficient irrigation strategies through long term experimental studies alone is difficult and limited by both cost and time crop simulation models serve as cost and time efficient tools to evaluate various crop growing environments and assess their long term effects on crop production and enable the development of efficient irrigation strategies for different agro climatic conditions thorp et al 2014 attia et al 2016 greaves and wang 2017 ale et al 2021 mauget et al 2021 himanshu et al 2022 however these models require a thorough calibration and evaluation based on measured data before their application himanshu et al 2019 2021a the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm is an effective tool for simulating crop growth and yield under varied soil crop management and weather conditions jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 the cropgro cotton module pathak et al 2007 2012 within the dssat csm has been used extensively to test the cotton yield outcomes of alternative irrigation and crop management practices and determine strategies for sustainable cotton production in the thp region ale et al 2020 2021 mauget et al 2017 2022 himanshu et al 2019 2021a b adhikari et al 2016 garibay et al 2019 kothari et al 2019 2021 in this study the dssat csm cropgro cotton model that was evaluated for halfway tx in the thp region in a prior study himanshu et al 2021a was used to achieve three main objectives i develop and evaluate efficient growth stage based variable deficit irrigation gs vdi strategies for cotton production in the thp ii assess the impacts of climate variability on cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue under simulated gs vdi strategies and iii suggest efficient gs vdi strategies for dry normal and wet years results from this study can provide valuable information to optimize cotton water use in the regions with limited irrigation water availability while avoiding water deficits during the critical periods of crop cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 cotton irrigation water use efficiency experiment at halfway tx a cotton iwue field experiment was conducted during the years 2017 2019 at the texas a m agrilife research center at halfway latitude 34 10 n longitude 101 56 w elevation 1075 m in the thp region fig 1 the thp is one of the world s most productive agricultural regions due to its fertile soils favorable growing conditions and availability of irrigation water from the underlying ogallala aquifer weinheimer et al 2013 this semi arid relatively flat and windy region with considerable variability in daily ambient temperature hashem et al 2020 himanshu et al 2021a is one of the most intensively irrigated agricultural areas and also a major cotton growing region contributing to about 25 and 64 of the us and texas cotton production respectively mauget et al 2017 usda nass 2022 other major irrigated crops in this region include grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l winter wheat triticum aestivum l and corn zea mays l during the summer growing season the thp region typically receives about 200 300 mm of rainfall weinheimer et al 2013 typical soil types in this thp region are clay loams and sandy loams the soil at the study site is deep well developed pullman clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustolls measured data from six treatments in this cotton iwue field experiment were used for evaluating the dssat cropgro cotton model himanshu et al 2021a the treatments included hhh lmh lmm hhh lmh and lmm where l is low 0 mm d 1 m is medium 3 2 mm d 1 and h is high 6 4 mm d 1 irrigation applications during vegetative reproductive and maturation growth stages and a plus symbol indicate additional irrigation applications in september the treatments were labeled according to the relative amount of irrigation water applied during different growth stages e g lmh treatment means low medium and high irrigation application rates during vegetative reproductive and maturation growth stages respectively accumulated growing degree days gdds at a threshold temperature of 15 6 c were used to define the irrigation periods bordovsky et al 2015 the in season crop physiological data canopy height and dates of onset of cotton phenological stages and end of the season lint yield data were measured during the 2017 2019 growing seasons cotton was planted at a density of 13 3 plants m 2 and irrigation was applied using a four span center pivot low energy precision application lepa irrigation system actuated using signals from a variable rate irrigation controller bordovsky and lyle 1996 bordovsky et al 2015 additional details about this field experiment can be found in bordovsky et al 2015 and himanshu et al 2021a 2 2 crop growth simulation model the dssat csm cropgro cotton model version 4 7 5 hoogenboom et al 2019 was used in this study the dssat operates on a daily time step the model uses soil weather and crop management data as well as genetic parameters to simulate crop growth development and lint yield in response to the soil plant atmosphere dynamics jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 dssat is used in a wide range of agricultural studies at various spatial and temporal scales at the field scale this model adequately captures the effect of weather and climatic variability on crop growth and it is extensively used in climate change impact assessment studies amnuaylojaroen and chanvichit 2022 dssat can be used in iwue studies to develop strategies for optimum utilization of limited available water resources the daily maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation and solar irradiance are the minimum weather data required to run the model while relative humidity wind speed and dew point temperature are optional weather inputs required genetic parameters include cultivar cul species spe and ecotype eco coefficients the soil parameters e g water holding capacity ph bulk density texture and nutrients and crop management inputs e g tillage planting harvesting fertilizer chemical applications and irrigation management were decided based on measurements from the field experiment as summarized in adhikari et al 2016 and himanshu et al 2021b 2 3 weather input data long term 1977 2019 daily weather data maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation solar irradiance wind speed and relative humidity were obtained from an on site weather station at the experimental farm the meteorological datasets provided by the west texas mesonet weather stations plainview 1 s and olton 6 s were used to fill the missing weather data schroeder et al 2005 there are large variations in daily air temperature at the experimental site and the recorded minimum temperature was 21 3 c and maximum temperature was 44 4 c the average 1977 2019 annual and growing season apr oct rainfall at the experimental site was 459 mm and 374 mm respectively the simulation years 1977 2019 were classified into i dry ii normal and iii wet years based on growing season precipitation to assess the impacts of environmental conditions during the growing season on seed cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue under different gs vdi strategies the first two years of simulation 1977 and 1978 were excluded from the analysis considering it as the model warm up period years 2011 and 2015 were extremely dry and wet years respectively and were found to be outliers hence they were also excluded from the analysis out of the remaining 39 years years with 385 mm 66th percentile and 265 mm 33rd percentile growing season precipitation were considered as wet and dry years respectively fig 2 years with growing season precipitation between the 33rd and 66th percentile were considered normal years with the above criteria years 1980 1983 1984 1990 1993 1994 1996 1998 2000 2001 2002 2003 2018 were classified as dry years and the years 1979 1981 1985 1986 1988 1989 1992 1995 1997 2004 2010 2014 2017 were classified as wet years the remaining years in the simulation period were classified as normal years each class ended up with thirteen years a similar approach for identifying weather variability classes has been adopted by various researchers kothari et al 2019 ale et al 2020 2021 himanshu et al 2021a 2021b this approach was validated with the long term observed weather records for this region this analysis resulted in a similar number of years under different weather variability classes each class consisted of about a third of total number of years considered 2 4 model evaluation the dssat cropgro cotton model was previously evaluated for the study site by himanshu et al 2021a based on the measured data from the halfway cotton iwue experiment over a period of three years from 2017 to 2019 and it was used in this study the model was calibrated and evaluated based on measured data from high irrigation hhh and hhh and deficit irrigation lmm lmh lmm and lmh treatments respectively the measured and simulated dates of onset of cotton phenological stages canopy height and seed cotton yield matched closely during the model calibration and evaluation as indicated by the evaluated model comparison statistics himanshu et al 2021a for the seed cotton yield calculation the index of agreement average percent error and coefficient of determination were 0 96 4 and 0 93 respectively during the calibration and 0 95 5 and 0 88 respectively during the evaluation himanshu et al 2021a the evaluated model responded well to different irrigation levels applied in six treatments over three growing seasons along with varying precipitation amounts and distribution patterns more details about the parameters adjusted during the model calibration and the model evaluation are given by himanshu et al 2021a 2 5 simulation of growth stage based variable deficit irrigation gs vdi strategies the evaluated cropgro cotton module himanshu et al 2021a was used to run long term 1977 2019 simulations for halfway tx with four levels of irrigation deficits 30 50 70 and 90 evapotranspiration et replacement implemented during four growth stages of cotton which resulted in 256 combinations of deficit irrigation strategies fig 3 the four growth stages considered in this study were i first leaf to first square gs1 ii flower initiation early bloom gs2 iii peak bloom gs3 and iv cutout late bloom and boll opening stage gs4 a control scenario 100 et replacement implemented in all four growth stages was also simulated to compare the results and assess the effects of simulated gs vdi strategies on iwue and seed cotton lint yield the iwue was estimated as the ratio of the difference in irrigated and dryland seed cotton lint yields and seasonal irrigation water applied himanshu et al 2019 ale et al 2020 for long term simulations a dssat seasonal project was established for the years 1977 2019 under a seasonal project the model initializes the initial soil conditions on january 1 each year and runs each year s simulation independently to ensure that there are no residual effects from previous years tovihoudji et al 2019 considering the observed soil moisture in early january in the study region and based on calibration results an initial soil water of 0 16 cm3 cm 3 was considered in this study since there is a substantial period between the simulation start date 1 january and the simulated planting date 11 may each year the impact of residual soil moisture from a previous year even under wet normal dry year transitions is expected to be minimal and the rainfall received during this spring period will replenish soil water to field capacity or higher levels starting simulations at the same initial soil moisture conditions would also enable more accurate evaluation of the specific effects of gs vdi strategies on cotton yield and irrigation water use while keeping the other factors the same similar to himanshu et al 2021a the priestley taylor method priestley et al 1972 was used for calculating the et the priestley taylor option was also used in several other dssat cotton modeling studies guerra et al 2007 gérardeaux et al 2018 himanshu et al 2021a ale et al 2021 and is recommended under limited soil water conditions flint and childs 1991 soil water evaporation was calculated based on surface soil water content and potential evaporation of the soil using the suleiman ritchie method ritchie et al 2009 detailed information on root water uptake soil water balance plant growth et estimation and partitioning of soil water evaporation and transpiration can be found in boote et al 2008 and thorp et al 2020 automatic irrigation option using the growth stage based controls using et as a trigger was adopted in this study kisekka et al 2022 this approach allows implementation of different et based triggers in different growth stages the et replacement indicates the et demand estimated as the accumulation of actual soil water evaporation plus daily potential plant transpiration minus infiltration from rainfall rain runoff himanshu et al 2021a kisekka et al 2022 the growth stage based irrigation controls are not supported by the dssat xbuild user interface therefore the simulation controls were created by manually editing the dssat cox experiment file in the text editor in this approach for et based automatic irrigation irrig in the cox file was set to e most of the user inputs in the cox file were similar to other methods of automatic irrigation but the variables ithru and imdep have different meanings variable ithru indicates the et demand supplied as irrigation water allowing deficit irrigation amounts to be applied whereas imdep indicates the threshold accumulation of et which triggers an irrigation event kisekka et al 2022 the minimum irrigation interval of three days with an irrigation efficiency of 0 95 was assumed for all gs vdi strategies the cropgro cotton module simulation runs were automated through the use of batch files in the r programming language all 257 combinations 256 gs vdi strategies and a control were run in batches and the outputs were generated in the text files the output text files were analyzed later using the r programming language venables and smith 2002 to evaluate different gs vdi strategies the simulated seed cotton yield and iwue under different gs vdi strategies were analyzed separately for dry normal and wet categories of years for each weather category strategies with 95th percentile of seed cotton yield and iwue were identified as efficient irrigation strategies out of the 256 gs vdi strategies 14 strategies each were identified as efficient strategies based on simulated seed cotton yield and iwue all efficient irrigation strategies under each category were further analyzed and compared for simulated seed cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue to identify ideal irrigation strategies finally a total of six ideal gs vdi strategies three based on seed cotton yield for dry normal and wet years and three based on iwue for dry normal and wet years were identified and suggested potential water savings and yield compromises with the identified gs vdi strategies were quantified under varying weather conditions in comparison to the control scenario 100 et replacement 3 results and discussion 3 1 seed cotton yield and iwue under different irrigation scenarios simulated median seed cotton yields and iwues for all 256 gs vdi scenarios grouped into different weather categories and associated irrigation water use are given in fig 4 with an increase in irrigation water applied seed cotton lint yield increased from 50 to 300 mm of irrigation water for the dry normal and wet years fig 4a this increase was nearly linear in normal years and the response for wet and dry years was different in wet years the median seed cotton lint yield per unit of irrigation water declines with increasing irrigation water and the opposite holds in dry years a severe water deficit can therefore lead to a significant reduction in seed cotton yield while the application of higher amounts of irrigation can lead to substantial yield gains in dry years these results are in agreement with the findings of himanshu et al 2019 2021b who reported lower water stress in wet years as compared to normal and dry years ale et al 2020 also reported that applying excess irrigation did not contribute to an increase in yield especially during wet years for a given amount of irrigation water the median seed cotton yield was always higher in wet years followed by normal and dry years within the range of irrigation water application considered in this study fig 4b the main reason for this trend could be that the semi arid thp region receives relatively low seasonal precipitation which is insufficient to meet cotton water needs especially under deficit irrigation therefore with an increase in precipitation amount the median seed cotton yield increased under deficit irrigation the simulated seed cotton yields were minimum when severe water deficits especially 30 and 50 et replacement were imposed in all growth stages under all weather conditions these results are consistent with the findings of jalota et al 2006 and cheng et al 2021 who reported that the regions with higher seasonal precipitation achieved higher seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation cheng et al 2021 reviewed the responses of seed cotton yield to deficit irrigation using a global meta analysis based on 74 published papers and reported that imposing water deficit throughout the growing season is the most undesirable measure simulated median iwue in wet years increased up to a certain limit about 120 150 mm with an increase in irrigation water and after that started declining fig 4b the median iwue became stable at relatively higher irrigation amount 250 mm in normal years in contrast in the case of dry years median iwue increased continuously with an increase in irrigation water a possible reason for higher iwue at lower irrigation water during wet years could be due to a decline in crop et at lower water availability cheng et al 2021 the median iwues were higher in wet years followed by normal and dry years especially under lower up to 200 mm irrigation water use however for higher irrigation water use 200 mm the iwues were higher in normal years than the wet years fig 4b the iwues were consistently lower in dry years irrespective of the amounts of irrigation water use fig 4b these results are consistent with the findings of other researchers in this region garibay et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 ale et al 2020 snowden et al 2013 suggested that different cultivars respond differently to amount of irrigation and therefore appropriate cultivars should be selected based on management and environmental factors 3 2 identification of efficient gs vdi scenarios the gs vdi scenarios with 95th percentile seed cotton yield table 1 fig 4a and iwue table 2 fig 4b were identified as efficient irrigation strategies simulated seed cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue under identified efficient gs vdi scenarios were then compared with those under the baseline scenario in dry fig 5 normal fig 6 and wet fig 7 years finally one ideal irrigation strategy was identified for each category i e based on yield or iwue criteria and for dry normal and wet years for example in dry years scenario 253 90 90 90 and 30 et replacement in gs1 gs2 gs3 and gs4 stages was identified as the ideal irrigation scenario based on yield and scenario 189 70 90 90 and 30 et replacement in gs1 gs2 gs3 and gs4 stages was identified as the ideal irrigation scenario based on iwue as expected in dry and normal years a higher yield was achieved based on the simulated seed cotton yield in scenarios with higher irrigation water s 253 s 254 s 255 s 256 table 1 figs 5a and 6a it is interesting to see that in all these four scenarios irrigation water use varied 30 et to 90 et replacement in gs4 only similarly in identified efficient gs vdi scenarios under wet years irrigation water use varied from 30 to 90 et replacement in gs4 table 1 fig 7a this indicates that imposing a water deficit during the gs4 did not significantly affect the seed lint yield these results are consistent with the findings of himanshu et al 2019 2021b who reported that cutout late bloom boll opening growth stage is less sensitive to water stress and imposing water deficit during this stage did not result in yield loss other researchers have also reported that applying irrigation towards the end of the growing season could reduce productivity due to an increase in boll rotting difficulty in defoliation and excessive vegetative growth grimes and dickens 1974 reba et al 2014 ale et al 2020 himanshu et al 2021a simulated median seed cotton yield in all identified efficient gs vdi scenarios under wet years was higher as compared to dry and normal years fig 4a however the irrigation water use in all efficient gs vdi scenarios under all weather conditions dry normal and wet was comparable fig 4a interestingly simulated seed cotton yield in all efficient gs vdi scenarios under wet weather conditions was similar fig 4a this indicates that the application of additional irrigation water 250 mm in this case did not contribute to an increase in yield and therefore it could significantly reduce the iwue in wet years maximum yield was achieved in the s 189 scenario 70 90 90 and 30 et replacement during gs1 gs2 gs3 and gs4 respectively these results again reiterate the findings of himanshu et al 2019 2021b who reported that imposing water deficit during initial and final growth stages especially in wet years resulted in minimum yield loss simulated median iwue in all identified gs vdi scenarios was higher in wet years as compared to dry and normal years fig 4b interestingly the irrigation water use for maximizing the iwue in wet years was significantly lower as compared to that for dry and normal years fig 4b these results agree with the findings of himanshu et al 2019 and indicated that maximum iwue could be achieved with comparatively less irrigation water under wet weather conditions results also indicated that a significant reduction in yield can be expected when efficient gs vdi scenarios based on iwue criteria are adopted in dry fig 5b normal fig 6b and wet fig 7b years however in the case of limited water availability the adoption of these efficient gs vdi scenarios could help in efficiently using the limited available water and a substantial amount of irrigation water could be saved with a relatively small reduction in yield 3 3 identification of ideal deficit irrigation scenarios seed cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue based on both seed cotton yield and iwue criteria for identified ideal irrigation scenarios for dry normal and wet years are summarized and compared with the control scenario in fig 8 as expected in wet years the seed cotton yields under the ideal irrigation scenarios and the control scenario were higher as compared to dry and normal years fig 8 simulated seed cotton yield under the ideal gs vdi scenarios based on seed cotton yield criteria was very close to seed cotton yield simulated under full irrigation control scenario especially during normal and wet years these results are consistent with the findings of basal et al 2009 and hussein et al 2011 who reported that a reduction in irrigation water within the range of 80 100 of full irrigation did not have a significant impact on seed cotton yield however in the case of dry years the yield gap between ideal gs vdi scenarios based on seed cotton yield criteria and the control scenario was much higher even iwue in the control scenario 0 7 was found to be slightly higher than that of the ideal scenario based on iwue criteria 0 7 during dry years therefore the implementation of 100 et replacement could be beneficial in dry years if there is enough irrigation water available the amount of irrigation water applied under all weather conditions in identified ideal gs vdi scenarios was much lesser during gs4 30 or 50 et replacement as compared to that applied during gs2 and gs3 stages 90 et replacement except in wet years these results are consistent with the finding of himanshu et al 2019 2021b who found that water deficit at the flower initiation early bloom and peak bloom growth stages significantly affected the seed cotton yield and iwue while water deficit at the cutout late bloom and boll opening growth stage had relatively lesser effect on seed cotton yield and iwue overall based on these studies it can be reaffirmed that the yield reduction is less severe if water deficit is imposed in the initial growth stages as cotton plants have sufficient time to recover from the water deficit at the beginning of the crop cycle similarly imposing water deficit during the cutout late bloom and boll opening growth stages would have less negative effect on yield as cotton plants have lower water demand during these stages since most of the fruits are already formed by then and they not susceptible to shedding the timing of water deficit stress influences boll production and fiber quality schaefer et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 reported that high irrigation during early and late seasons did not increase boll number and it was often detrimental to yield however mid season irrigation improved yield and fiber quality jalota et al 2006 also found that water deficit during the blooming and boll opening stage can result in a reduction in seed cotton yield due to a decrease in leaf water potential the water deficit during the blooming and boll opening stage can also cause a reduction in the number of bolls and boll mass aujla et al 2005 gwathmey et al 2011 found that water deficit at the first flower stage increased the shedding while water deficit at the end of the flowering stage tended to reduce boll retention and flowering rate snowden et al 2014 also found that imposing a water deficit for three weeks from the beginning of the cotton flowering stage resulted in the highest shedding rate and thereby affecting the yield in addition sun et al 2015 reported that the tolerance of cotton to water deficit depends on the crop growth stages and water deficit at critical growth stages significantly affects the growth and development of the crop these findings corroborate the results obtained in this study the ideal gs vdi scenarios identified based on iwue had maximum iwue in wet years followed by normal and dry years interestingly the maximum iwue was achieved with the application of the lower amount of irrigation water in wet years 129 mm while it was achieved with the application of higher amounts of irrigation water in dry 235 mm and normal 244 mm years fig 8 these results support the findings of cheng et al 2021 who explored the responses of seed cotton yield and iwue to deficit irrigation using meta analysis and reported that iwue was oppositely related to seasonal precipitation while seed cotton yield was positively related to it the iwues during normal and wet years were substantially higher in identified ideal gs vdi scenarios as compared to the control scenario however the irrigation water used in identified ideal gs vdi scenarios was substantially low as compared to the control treatment in all weather conditions interestingly the amount of irrigation water used to achieve maximum iwue was less than the amount of irrigation water used to achieve maximum seed cotton yield under all weather conditions in a meta regression analysis fan et al 2018 also reported that the largest iwue could be obtained with lesser than full irrigation therefore by adopting gs vdi scenarios a substantial amount of irrigation water could be saved as iwue improved significantly with small reduction in seed cotton yield the findings from this study should only be used as a general guide by producers in the thp region as the effects of timing and amount of irrigation water application in different growth stages on yield and iwue vary with differences in climatic conditions soil characteristics such as water holding capacity and crop management factors such as cultivar used and planting density in addition irrigation scheduling not only depends on the amount of seasonal precipitation but also on seasonal distribution of precipitation and hence care should be exercised while adopting gs vdi strategies furthermore as the growing season progresses depending on the actual amount of precipitation received and based on weather forecasts it may be desirable to switch to different gs vdi strategies our future research efforts will focus on conducting these simulations at different sites with varying precipitation and temperature patterns across thp in order to strengthen the recommendations on gs vdi strategies for this important cotton growing region also we recommend considering crop water productivity in addition to iwue for identifying efficient gs vdi strategies in the future studies so that the contribution from all sources of water including rainfall soil water and irrigation to crop yields will be accounted for 4 conclusions the dssat csm cropgro cotton model was used to evaluate the effects of gs vdi strategies on cotton production at halfway in the thp region under varying climatic conditions the results indicated that the extent and timing of water deficit stress in different cotton growth stages had a substantial effect on seed cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue overall gs2 flower initiation early bloom and gs3 peak bloom growth stages were found to be the most sensitive stages to water stress the gs4 cutout late bloom and boll opening growth stage was found to be the least sensitive stage to water stress and water deficit during this stage did not significantly affect yield and iwue it was also found that the amount of irrigation water required to achieve maximum iwue was less than the amount of irrigation water required to achieve maximum seed cotton yield under all weather conditions overall it was found that by adopting gs vdi strategies a substantial amount of irrigation water could be saved and it is possible to achieve high seed cotton yields and iwue with less irrigation water the results from this study could be useful for producers in the thp region in optimizing the application of limited available irrigation water to achieve higher iwue and cotton yields our future efforts will focus on simulating the effects of gs vdi strategies at different

9019,irrigated agriculture in the texas high plains thp region faces severe challenges due to rapidly declining groundwater levels in the underlying ogallala aquifer recurring droughts and projected warmer and drier future climatic conditions scheduling irrigation with appropriate deficits in different crop growth stages could improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue and thereby enable additional savings in valuable groundwater without severely compromising the crop yield our objective was to identify efficient growth stage based variable deficit irrigation gs vdi strategies for cotton production in the thp region for this purpose we used an evaluated decision support system agrotechnology transfer dssat cropgro cotton model based on measured data from a cotton iwue field experiment conducted at texas a m agrilife research center at halfway tx in the thp region this study considered four growth stages i first leaf to first square gs1 ii flower initiation early bloom gs2 iii peak bloom gs3 and iv cutout late bloom and boll opening stage gs4 long term 1977 2019 simulations were conducted with four deficit levels 30 50 70 and 90 evapotranspiration et replacements implemented in the above described four different growth stages resulting in 256 combinations of deficit irrigation scenarios based on the results of simulated seed cotton yield and iwue efficient gs vdi strategies were suggested for dry normal and wet years for example a strategy of 90 et replacement in gs1 to gs3 and of 30 et replacement in gs4 was found to be an ideal strategy in normal years to achieve higher seed cotton yield 8 less than that for the baseline scenario with 100 et replacement implemented in all growth stages while saving 65 mm of irrigation water results from this

introduction rapid decline in groundwater levels poses a threat to irrigated agriculture especially in semi arid and arid regions hoogesteger 2022 the semi arid texas high plains thp is one of the usa s most intensive irrigated agricultural areas primarily due to the underlying ogallala aquifer that is spread over 41 counties chen et al 2021 the southern portion of the ogallala aquifer has been mined extensively for agricultural irrigation for more than half a century colaizzi et al 2009 approximately 90 of the total water requirements and 95 of the total irrigation requirement in this region are met from this aquifer weinheimer et al 2013 himanshu et al 2021a however the well capacities in most parts of the southern ogallala aquifer region have declined due to withdrawals that exceed the natural recharge leading to difficulty in supplying water to meet the crop needs chaudhuri and ale 2014 scanlon et al 2012 ale et al 2021 these water shortages might exacerbate in the future due to projected increase in ambient temperature and changes in precipitation patterns as reported in climate change studies for this region islam et al 2012 modala et al 2017 as a result water districts in the thp have introduced restrictions on groundwater withdrawals to help sustain an agriculture based economy and prolong the life of the aquifer for example an annual groundwater extraction limit of 460 mm 18 in or 1 5 acre ft per acre is set by the high plains water district hpwd 2015 and the north plains underground water conservation district north plains gcd 2015 declining well capacities and groundwater pumping restrictions along with the recurring droughts and projected warmer and drier future climatic conditions in this region necessitate implementing efficient irrigation management strategies that could potentially reduce water use while sustaining agricultural productivity and profitability production of cotton gossypium hirsutum l a major irrigated cash crop in the thp region with about 52 of the total crop area usda nass 2022 is facing challenges from irrigation water shortages due to a rapid depletion in the groundwater level in the southern ogallala aquifer mcguire 2017 crop water stress is a common occurrence in this semi arid region that can be mitigated using efficient irrigation strategies zou et al 2021 fan et al 2022 although cotton plants can adapt well to water deficit irrigation ale et al 2020 himanshu et al 2021b there is a need to explore alternate irrigation strategies that could further reduce cotton irrigation demand and to sustain irrigated cotton production a growth stage based deficit irrigation strategy could be one such approach that can ensure improvements in irrigation water use efficiency iwue and crop water productivity kirda et al 2007 greaves and wang 2017 schaefer et al 2018 himanshu et al 2019 2021b several studies reported the benefits of optimal irrigation water allocation during different growth stages in water savings in cotton production systems bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 himanshu et al 2019 2021b li et al 2019 water deficit at specific growth stages of cotton can cause intense damage to crops reducing reproductive structures and affecting physiological processes with subsequent lint yield loss bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 recent studies reported that imposing water deficit during the peak bloom growth stage resulted in the lowest iwue and seed cotton yield while deficits during the early and late growth stages caused minimal effects on yield schaefer et al 2018 himanshu et al 2019 2021b the water requirement of cotton varies substantially during different growth stages and precipitation distribution and amount also significantly affects cotton growth and lint yield fisher and udeigwe 2012 himanshu et al 2021b therefore by imposing manageable variable deficits during different growth stages with consideration of growing season precipitation additional savings in valuable groundwater could be achieved without compromising the cotton lint yield comprehensive studies focusing on assessing the effects of growth stage based variable deficit irrigation gs vdi on cotton yield irrigation water use iwue are not reported in the literature and this study aims to identify such efficient gs vdi strategies for the thp region evaluating efficient irrigation strategies through long term experimental studies alone is difficult and limited by both cost and time crop simulation models serve as cost and time efficient tools to evaluate various crop growing environments and assess their long term effects on crop production and enable the development of efficient irrigation strategies for different agro climatic conditions thorp et al 2014 attia et al 2016 greaves and wang 2017 ale et al 2021 mauget et al 2021 himanshu et al 2022 however these models require a thorough calibration and evaluation based on measured data before their application himanshu et al 2019 2021a the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm is an effective tool for simulating crop growth and yield under varied soil crop management and weather conditions jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 the cropgro cotton module pathak et al 2007 2012 within the dssat csm has been used extensively to test the cotton yield outcomes of alternative irrigation and crop management practices and determine strategies for sustainable cotton production in the thp region ale et al 2020 2021 mauget et al 2017 2022 himanshu et al 2019 2021a b adhikari et al 2016 garibay et al 2019 kothari et al 2019 2021 in this study the dssat csm cropgro cotton model that was evaluated for halfway tx in the thp region in a prior study himanshu et al 2021a was used to achieve three main objectives i develop and evaluate efficient growth stage based variable deficit irrigation gs vdi strategies for cotton production in the thp ii assess the impacts of climate variability on cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue under simulated gs vdi strategies and iii suggest efficient gs vdi strategies for dry normal and wet years results from this study can provide valuable information to optimize cotton water use in the regions with limited irrigation water availability while avoiding water deficits during the critical periods of crop cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 cotton irrigation water use efficiency experiment at halfway tx a cotton iwue field experiment was conducted during the years 2017 2019 at the texas a m agrilife research center at halfway latitude 34 10 n longitude 101 56 w elevation 1075 m in the thp region fig 1 the thp is one of the world s most productive agricultural regions due to its fertile soils favorable growing conditions and availability of irrigation water from the underlying ogallala aquifer weinheimer et al 2013 this semi arid relatively flat and windy region with considerable variability in daily ambient temperature hashem et al 2020 himanshu et al 2021a is one of the most intensively irrigated agricultural areas and also a major cotton growing region contributing to about 25 and 64 of the us and texas cotton production respectively mauget et al 2017 usda nass 2022 other major irrigated crops in this region include grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l winter wheat triticum aestivum l and corn zea mays l during the summer growing season the thp region typically receives about 200 300 mm of rainfall weinheimer et al 2013 typical soil types in this thp region are clay loams and sandy loams the soil at the study site is deep well developed pullman clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustolls measured data from six treatments in this cotton iwue field experiment were used for evaluating the dssat cropgro cotton model himanshu et al 2021a the treatments included hhh lmh lmm hhh lmh and lmm where l is low 0 mm d 1 m is medium 3 2 mm d 1 and h is high 6 4 mm d 1 irrigation applications during vegetative reproductive and maturation growth stages and a plus symbol indicate additional irrigation applications in september the treatments were labeled according to the relative amount of irrigation water applied during different growth stages e g lmh treatment means low medium and high irrigation application rates during vegetative reproductive and maturation growth stages respectively accumulated growing degree days gdds at a threshold temperature of 15 6 c were used to define the irrigation periods bordovsky et al 2015 the in season crop physiological data canopy height and dates of onset of cotton phenological stages and end of the season lint yield data were measured during the 2017 2019 growing seasons cotton was planted at a density of 13 3 plants m 2 and irrigation was applied using a four span center pivot low energy precision application lepa irrigation system actuated using signals from a variable rate irrigation controller bordovsky and lyle 1996 bordovsky et al 2015 additional details about this field experiment can be found in bordovsky et al 2015 and himanshu et al 2021a 2 2 crop growth simulation model the dssat csm cropgro cotton model version 4 7 5 hoogenboom et al 2019 was used in this study the dssat operates on a daily time step the model uses soil weather and crop management data as well as genetic parameters to simulate crop growth development and lint yield in response to the soil plant atmosphere dynamics jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 dssat is used in a wide range of agricultural studies at various spatial and temporal scales at the field scale this model adequately captures the effect of weather and climatic variability on crop growth and it is extensively used in climate change impact assessment studies amnuaylojaroen and chanvichit 2022 dssat can be used in iwue studies to develop strategies for optimum utilization of limited available water resources the daily maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation and solar irradiance are the minimum weather data required to run the model while relative humidity wind speed and dew point temperature are optional weather inputs required genetic parameters include cultivar cul species spe and ecotype eco coefficients the soil parameters e g water holding capacity ph bulk density texture and nutrients and crop management inputs e g tillage planting harvesting fertilizer chemical applications and irrigation management were decided based on measurements from the field experiment as summarized in adhikari et al 2016 and himanshu et al 2021b 2 3 weather input data long term 1977 2019 daily weather data maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation solar irradiance wind speed and relative humidity were obtained from an on site weather station at the experimental farm the meteorological datasets provided by the west texas mesonet weather stations plainview 1 s and olton 6 s were used to fill the missing weather data schroeder et al 2005 there are large variations in daily air temperature at the experimental site and the recorded minimum temperature was 21 3 c and maximum temperature was 44 4 c the average 1977 2019 annual and growing season apr oct rainfall at the experimental site was 459 mm and 374 mm respectively the simulation years 1977 2019 were classified into i dry ii normal and iii wet years based on growing season precipitation to assess the impacts of environmental conditions during the growing season on seed cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue under different gs vdi strategies the first two years of simulation 1977 and 1978 were excluded from the analysis considering it as the model warm up period years 2011 and 2015 were extremely dry and wet years respectively and were found to be outliers hence they were also excluded from the analysis out of the remaining 39 years years with 385 mm 66th percentile and 265 mm 33rd percentile growing season precipitation were considered as wet and dry years respectively fig 2 years with growing season precipitation between the 33rd and 66th percentile were considered normal years with the above criteria years 1980 1983 1984 1990 1993 1994 1996 1998 2000 2001 2002 2003 2018 were classified as dry years and the years 1979 1981 1985 1986 1988 1989 1992 1995 1997 2004 2010 2014 2017 were classified as wet years the remaining years in the simulation period were classified as normal years each class ended up with thirteen years a similar approach for identifying weather variability classes has been adopted by various researchers kothari et al 2019 ale et al 2020 2021 himanshu et al 2021a 2021b this approach was validated with the long term observed weather records for this region this analysis resulted in a similar number of years under different weather variability classes each class consisted of about a third of total number of years considered 2 4 model evaluation the dssat cropgro cotton model was previously evaluated for the study site by himanshu et al 2021a based on the measured data from the halfway cotton iwue experiment over a period of three years from 2017 to 2019 and it was used in this study the model was calibrated and evaluated based on measured data from high irrigation hhh and hhh and deficit irrigation lmm lmh lmm and lmh treatments respectively the measured and simulated dates of onset of cotton phenological stages canopy height and seed cotton yield matched closely during the model calibration and evaluation as indicated by the evaluated model comparison statistics himanshu et al 2021a for the seed cotton yield calculation the index of agreement average percent error and coefficient of determination were 0 96 4 and 0 93 respectively during the calibration and 0 95 5 and 0 88 respectively during the evaluation himanshu et al 2021a the evaluated model responded well to different irrigation levels applied in six treatments over three growing seasons along with varying precipitation amounts and distribution patterns more details about the parameters adjusted during the model calibration and the model evaluation are given by himanshu et al 2021a 2 5 simulation of growth stage based variable deficit irrigation gs vdi strategies the evaluated cropgro cotton module himanshu et al 2021a was used to run long term 1977 2019 simulations for halfway tx with four levels of irrigation deficits 30 50 70 and 90 evapotranspiration et replacement implemented during four growth stages of cotton which resulted in 256 combinations of deficit irrigation strategies fig 3 the four growth stages considered in this study were i first leaf to first square gs1 ii flower initiation early bloom gs2 iii peak bloom gs3 and iv cutout late bloom and boll opening stage gs4 a control scenario 100 et replacement implemented in all four growth stages was also simulated to compare the results and assess the effects of simulated gs vdi strategies on iwue and seed cotton lint yield the iwue was estimated as the ratio of the difference in irrigated and dryland seed cotton lint yields and seasonal irrigation water applied himanshu et al 2019 ale et al 2020 for long term simulations a dssat seasonal project was established for the years 1977 2019 under a seasonal project the model initializes the initial soil conditions on january 1 each year and runs each year s simulation independently to ensure that there are no residual effects from previous years tovihoudji et al 2019 considering the observed soil moisture in early january in the study region and based on calibration results an initial soil water of 0 16 cm3 cm 3 was considered in this study since there is a substantial period between the simulation start date 1 january and the simulated planting date 11 may each year the impact of residual soil moisture from a previous year even under wet normal dry year transitions is expected to be minimal and the rainfall received during this spring period will replenish soil water to field capacity or higher levels starting simulations at the same initial soil moisture conditions would also enable more accurate evaluation of the specific effects of gs vdi strategies on cotton yield and irrigation water use while keeping the other factors the same similar to himanshu et al 2021a the priestley taylor method priestley et al 1972 was used for calculating the et the priestley taylor option was also used in several other dssat cotton modeling studies guerra et al 2007 gérardeaux et al 2018 himanshu et al 2021a ale et al 2021 and is recommended under limited soil water conditions flint and childs 1991 soil water evaporation was calculated based on surface soil water content and potential evaporation of the soil using the suleiman ritchie method ritchie et al 2009 detailed information on root water uptake soil water balance plant growth et estimation and partitioning of soil water evaporation and transpiration can be found in boote et al 2008 and thorp et al 2020 automatic irrigation option using the growth stage based controls using et as a trigger was adopted in this study kisekka et al 2022 this approach allows implementation of different et based triggers in different growth stages the et replacement indicates the et demand estimated as the accumulation of actual soil water evaporation plus daily potential plant transpiration minus infiltration from rainfall rain runoff himanshu et al 2021a kisekka et al 2022 the growth stage based irrigation controls are not supported by the dssat xbuild user interface therefore the simulation controls were created by manually editing the dssat cox experiment file in the text editor in this approach for et based automatic irrigation irrig in the cox file was set to e most of the user inputs in the cox file were similar to other methods of automatic irrigation but the variables ithru and imdep have different meanings variable ithru indicates the et demand supplied as irrigation water allowing deficit irrigation amounts to be applied whereas imdep indicates the threshold accumulation of et which triggers an irrigation event kisekka et al 2022 the minimum irrigation interval of three days with an irrigation efficiency of 0 95 was assumed for all gs vdi strategies the cropgro cotton module simulation runs were automated through the use of batch files in the r programming language all 257 combinations 256 gs vdi strategies and a control were run in batches and the outputs were generated in the text files the output text files were analyzed later using the r programming language venables and smith 2002 to evaluate different gs vdi strategies the simulated seed cotton yield and iwue under different gs vdi strategies were analyzed separately for dry normal and wet categories of years for each weather category strategies with 95th percentile of seed cotton yield and iwue were identified as efficient irrigation strategies out of the 256 gs vdi strategies 14 strategies each were identified as efficient strategies based on simulated seed cotton yield and iwue all efficient irrigation strategies under each category were further analyzed and compared for simulated seed cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue to identify ideal irrigation strategies finally a total of six ideal gs vdi strategies three based on seed cotton yield for dry normal and wet years and three based on iwue for dry normal and wet years were identified and suggested potential water savings and yield compromises with the identified gs vdi strategies were quantified under varying weather conditions in comparison to the control scenario 100 et replacement 3 results and discussion 3 1 seed cotton yield and iwue under different irrigation scenarios simulated median seed cotton yields and iwues for all 256 gs vdi scenarios grouped into different weather categories and associated irrigation water use are given in fig 4 with an increase in irrigation water applied seed cotton lint yield increased from 50 to 300 mm of irrigation water for the dry normal and wet years fig 4a this increase was nearly linear in normal years and the response for wet and dry years was different in wet years the median seed cotton lint yield per unit of irrigation water declines with increasing irrigation water and the opposite holds in dry years a severe water deficit can therefore lead to a significant reduction in seed cotton yield while the application of higher amounts of irrigation can lead to substantial yield gains in dry years these results are in agreement with the findings of himanshu et al 2019 2021b who reported lower water stress in wet years as compared to normal and dry years ale et al 2020 also reported that applying excess irrigation did not contribute to an increase in yield especially during wet years for a given amount of irrigation water the median seed cotton yield was always higher in wet years followed by normal and dry years within the range of irrigation water application considered in this study fig 4b the main reason for this trend could be that the semi arid thp region receives relatively low seasonal precipitation which is insufficient to meet cotton water needs especially under deficit irrigation therefore with an increase in precipitation amount the median seed cotton yield increased under deficit irrigation the simulated seed cotton yields were minimum when severe water deficits especially 30 and 50 et replacement were imposed in all growth stages under all weather conditions these results are consistent with the findings of jalota et al 2006 and cheng et al 2021 who reported that the regions with higher seasonal precipitation achieved higher seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation cheng et al 2021 reviewed the responses of seed cotton yield to deficit irrigation using a global meta analysis based on 74 published papers and reported that imposing water deficit throughout the growing season is the most undesirable measure simulated median iwue in wet years increased up to a certain limit about 120 150 mm with an increase in irrigation water and after that started declining fig 4b the median iwue became stable at relatively higher irrigation amount 250 mm in normal years in contrast in the case of dry years median iwue increased continuously with an increase in irrigation water a possible reason for higher iwue at lower irrigation water during wet years could be due to a decline in crop et at lower water availability cheng et al 2021 the median iwues were higher in wet years followed by normal and dry years especially under lower up to 200 mm irrigation water use however for higher irrigation water use 200 mm the iwues were higher in normal years than the wet years fig 4b the iwues were consistently lower in dry years irrespective of the amounts of irrigation water use fig 4b these results are consistent with the findings of other researchers in this region garibay et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 ale et al 2020 snowden et al 2013 suggested that different cultivars respond differently to amount of irrigation and therefore appropriate cultivars should be selected based on management and environmental factors 3 2 identification of efficient gs vdi scenarios the gs vdi scenarios with 95th percentile seed cotton yield table 1 fig 4a and iwue table 2 fig 4b were identified as efficient irrigation strategies simulated seed cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue under identified efficient gs vdi scenarios were then compared with those under the baseline scenario in dry fig 5 normal fig 6 and wet fig 7 years finally one ideal irrigation strategy was identified for each category i e based on yield or iwue criteria and for dry normal and wet years for example in dry years scenario 253 90 90 90 and 30 et replacement in gs1 gs2 gs3 and gs4 stages was identified as the ideal irrigation scenario based on yield and scenario 189 70 90 90 and 30 et replacement in gs1 gs2 gs3 and gs4 stages was identified as the ideal irrigation scenario based on iwue as expected in dry and normal years a higher yield was achieved based on the simulated seed cotton yield in scenarios with higher irrigation water s 253 s 254 s 255 s 256 table 1 figs 5a and 6a it is interesting to see that in all these four scenarios irrigation water use varied 30 et to 90 et replacement in gs4 only similarly in identified efficient gs vdi scenarios under wet years irrigation water use varied from 30 to 90 et replacement in gs4 table 1 fig 7a this indicates that imposing a water deficit during the gs4 did not significantly affect the seed lint yield these results are consistent with the findings of himanshu et al 2019 2021b who reported that cutout late bloom boll opening growth stage is less sensitive to water stress and imposing water deficit during this stage did not result in yield loss other researchers have also reported that applying irrigation towards the end of the growing season could reduce productivity due to an increase in boll rotting difficulty in defoliation and excessive vegetative growth grimes and dickens 1974 reba et al 2014 ale et al 2020 himanshu et al 2021a simulated median seed cotton yield in all identified efficient gs vdi scenarios under wet years was higher as compared to dry and normal years fig 4a however the irrigation water use in all efficient gs vdi scenarios under all weather conditions dry normal and wet was comparable fig 4a interestingly simulated seed cotton yield in all efficient gs vdi scenarios under wet weather conditions was similar fig 4a this indicates that the application of additional irrigation water 250 mm in this case did not contribute to an increase in yield and therefore it could significantly reduce the iwue in wet years maximum yield was achieved in the s 189 scenario 70 90 90 and 30 et replacement during gs1 gs2 gs3 and gs4 respectively these results again reiterate the findings of himanshu et al 2019 2021b who reported that imposing water deficit during initial and final growth stages especially in wet years resulted in minimum yield loss simulated median iwue in all identified gs vdi scenarios was higher in wet years as compared to dry and normal years fig 4b interestingly the irrigation water use for maximizing the iwue in wet years was significantly lower as compared to that for dry and normal years fig 4b these results agree with the findings of himanshu et al 2019 and indicated that maximum iwue could be achieved with comparatively less irrigation water under wet weather conditions results also indicated that a significant reduction in yield can be expected when efficient gs vdi scenarios based on iwue criteria are adopted in dry fig 5b normal fig 6b and wet fig 7b years however in the case of limited water availability the adoption of these efficient gs vdi scenarios could help in efficiently using the limited available water and a substantial amount of irrigation water could be saved with a relatively small reduction in yield 3 3 identification of ideal deficit irrigation scenarios seed cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue based on both seed cotton yield and iwue criteria for identified ideal irrigation scenarios for dry normal and wet years are summarized and compared with the control scenario in fig 8 as expected in wet years the seed cotton yields under the ideal irrigation scenarios and the control scenario were higher as compared to dry and normal years fig 8 simulated seed cotton yield under the ideal gs vdi scenarios based on seed cotton yield criteria was very close to seed cotton yield simulated under full irrigation control scenario especially during normal and wet years these results are consistent with the findings of basal et al 2009 and hussein et al 2011 who reported that a reduction in irrigation water within the range of 80 100 of full irrigation did not have a significant impact on seed cotton yield however in the case of dry years the yield gap between ideal gs vdi scenarios based on seed cotton yield criteria and the control scenario was much higher even iwue in the control scenario 0 7 was found to be slightly higher than that of the ideal scenario based on iwue criteria 0 7 during dry years therefore the implementation of 100 et replacement could be beneficial in dry years if there is enough irrigation water available the amount of irrigation water applied under all weather conditions in identified ideal gs vdi scenarios was much lesser during gs4 30 or 50 et replacement as compared to that applied during gs2 and gs3 stages 90 et replacement except in wet years these results are consistent with the finding of himanshu et al 2019 2021b who found that water deficit at the flower initiation early bloom and peak bloom growth stages significantly affected the seed cotton yield and iwue while water deficit at the cutout late bloom and boll opening growth stage had relatively lesser effect on seed cotton yield and iwue overall based on these studies it can be reaffirmed that the yield reduction is less severe if water deficit is imposed in the initial growth stages as cotton plants have sufficient time to recover from the water deficit at the beginning of the crop cycle similarly imposing water deficit during the cutout late bloom and boll opening growth stages would have less negative effect on yield as cotton plants have lower water demand during these stages since most of the fruits are already formed by then and they not susceptible to shedding the timing of water deficit stress influences boll production and fiber quality schaefer et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 reported that high irrigation during early and late seasons did not increase boll number and it was often detrimental to yield however mid season irrigation improved yield and fiber quality jalota et al 2006 also found that water deficit during the blooming and boll opening stage can result in a reduction in seed cotton yield due to a decrease in leaf water potential the water deficit during the blooming and boll opening stage can also cause a reduction in the number of bolls and boll mass aujla et al 2005 gwathmey et al 2011 found that water deficit at the first flower stage increased the shedding while water deficit at the end of the flowering stage tended to reduce boll retention and flowering rate snowden et al 2014 also found that imposing a water deficit for three weeks from the beginning of the cotton flowering stage resulted in the highest shedding rate and thereby affecting the yield in addition sun et al 2015 reported that the tolerance of cotton to water deficit depends on the crop growth stages and water deficit at critical growth stages significantly affects the growth and development of the crop these findings corroborate the results obtained in this study the ideal gs vdi scenarios identified based on iwue had maximum iwue in wet years followed by normal and dry years interestingly the maximum iwue was achieved with the application of the lower amount of irrigation water in wet years 129 mm while it was achieved with the application of higher amounts of irrigation water in dry 235 mm and normal 244 mm years fig 8 these results support the findings of cheng et al 2021 who explored the responses of seed cotton yield and iwue to deficit irrigation using meta analysis and reported that iwue was oppositely related to seasonal precipitation while seed cotton yield was positively related to it the iwues during normal and wet years were substantially higher in identified ideal gs vdi scenarios as compared to the control scenario however the irrigation water used in identified ideal gs vdi scenarios was substantially low as compared to the control treatment in all weather conditions interestingly the amount of irrigation water used to achieve maximum iwue was less than the amount of irrigation water used to achieve maximum seed cotton yield under all weather conditions in a meta regression analysis fan et al 2018 also reported that the largest iwue could be obtained with lesser than full irrigation therefore by adopting gs vdi scenarios a substantial amount of irrigation water could be saved as iwue improved significantly with small reduction in seed cotton yield the findings from this study should only be used as a general guide by producers in the thp region as the effects of timing and amount of irrigation water application in different growth stages on yield and iwue vary with differences in climatic conditions soil characteristics such as water holding capacity and crop management factors such as cultivar used and planting density in addition irrigation scheduling not only depends on the amount of seasonal precipitation but also on seasonal distribution of precipitation and hence care should be exercised while adopting gs vdi strategies furthermore as the growing season progresses depending on the actual amount of precipitation received and based on weather forecasts it may be desirable to switch to different gs vdi strategies our future research efforts will focus on conducting these simulations at different sites with varying precipitation and temperature patterns across thp in order to strengthen the recommendations on gs vdi strategies for this important cotton growing region also we recommend considering crop water productivity in addition to iwue for identifying efficient gs vdi strategies in the future studies so that the contribution from all sources of water including rainfall soil water and irrigation to crop yields will be accounted for 4 conclusions the dssat csm cropgro cotton model was used to evaluate the effects of gs vdi strategies on cotton production at halfway in the thp region under varying climatic conditions the results indicated that the extent and timing of water deficit stress in different cotton growth stages had a substantial effect on seed cotton yield irrigation water use and iwue overall gs2 flower initiation early bloom and gs3 peak bloom growth stages were found to be the most sensitive stages to water stress the gs4 cutout late bloom and boll opening growth stage was found to be the least sensitive stage to water stress and water deficit during this stage did not significantly affect yield and iwue it was also found that the amount of irrigation water required to achieve maximum iwue was less than the amount of irrigation water required to achieve maximum seed cotton yield under all weather conditions overall it was found that by adopting gs vdi strategies a substantial amount of irrigation water could be saved and it is possible to achieve high seed cotton yields and iwue with less irrigation water the results from this study could be useful for producers in the thp region in optimizing the application of limited available irrigation water to achieve higher iwue and cotton yields our future efforts will focus on simulating the effects of gs vdi strategies at different sites across the thp region to strengthen the recommendations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
