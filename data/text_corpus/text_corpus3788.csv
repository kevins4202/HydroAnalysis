eps during mn ⅶ fe ⅱ conditioning flocs disintegration and cell disruption macro and micro physicochemical properties of activated sludge especially of eps were investigated relationships between protein molecular structures in eps fractions of three layers and sludge dewaterability were also determined besides factor analysis was used to explain the variances of functional protein secondary structures which may have an important effect on sludge dewaterability results showed that sludge filterability cst0 cst increased by 2 40 times and partial bound water was released at 2 min oxidation of 120 mg g kmno4 with subsequent fecl2 termination at equivalent molar ratio of 1 3 during this strategy eps wrapping on cells surface was disintegrated and a limited influence occurred on cells it was also found that cst and bound water content were strongly correlated with aggregated strands random coil and β turn percentages in slime r 2 0 82 p 0 05 moreover the dewaterability also presented strong negative correlations with aggregated strands β sheet and β turn in tb eps r 2 0 78 p 0 05 this suggested that unfolding and despiralization of slime protein and moderate weakening rigidity of

wwtps due to the increase of sludge production and high cost of sludge treatment cao et al 2018 during the management sludge dewatering is a key procedure mahmoud et al 2013 wei et al 2018 which can reduce volume of sludge and facilitate subsequent processes like storage transport and disposal masihi et al 2018 however it is not easy to dewater these sludge because of the fine particles porous fractal network wu et al 2002 chung and lee 2003 yuan et al 2014 qian et al 2015 and gel like structure dursun and dentel 2009 dentel 2010 mahmoud et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 it has been reported that extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microorganism in sludge was considered to act as a biological glue which was the one of main factors influence sludge rheological properties and gel like structure dong et al 2011 yuan et al 2014 thus understanding about the effects of eps on sludge dewaterability has become an important topic sheng et al 2010 many efforts have been focused on the qualitative and quantitative contributions of eps in sludge dewaterability aggregation in the past decade yu et al 2008 divided eps into slime loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps and analyzed sludge dewaterability of 14 wwtps founding that the normalized capillary suction time cst correlated with protein pn contents in slime and lb eps rather than polysaccharides ps this result was further confirmed by their subsequent study using fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem combined with parallel factor parafac analysis yu et al 2010 meanwhile liu et al 2010 quantitatively described the contributions of lb eps and tb eps in sludge aggregation which suggested the lb eps always displayed an attractive effect but the function of tb eps depended on the separation distance between sludge cells however it may be relatively easier to dewater after weakening or destroying the gel like structure of eps or sludge thus yuan et al 2014 discussed the contributions of different eps fractions in the gel like structure of sludge and results showed that tb eps played a key role with the development of conditioning methods several biological conditioners chemical oxidants or physical equipment were applied in the sludge conditioning which could disrupt eps and cells to release bound water and improve sludge dewaterability chen et al 2015 diak and örmeci 2016 liu et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 2017a 2017b wu et al 2017a chen et al 2015 reported that sludge filterability was mainly dependent on the properties of protein like materials in seps slime during enzymatic lysis and chemical re flocculation process whereas it was also suggested that molecular weight fractionation may affect sludge dewaterability niu et al 2013 liu et al 2016 and a series of studies were carried out to elucidate the key or most important organic compounds in different eps fractions in xiao et al 2016 2017a 2017b their reports implied that tryptophan like proteins and microbial by product like materials at molecular weight of 106 5 107 da in lb eps were the key compounds related to sludge filterability during ultrasonication us acidification treatment xiao et al 2016 while strong and positive correlation was presented between increased sludge filterability and the removal of low molecular weight 20 kda proteins and neutrals in lb eps during oxone activation treatment process xiao et al 2017a obviously it is widely accepted that extracellular proteins have an important effect on determining sludge dewaterability thus isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation itraq proteomics technology was employed for the first time to determine the representative extracellular proteins in sludge during cao2 oxidation process in wu et al 2017a then the molecular structure transformation of these pure representative extracellular proteins was tracked to analyze the water binding mechanism and the results implied that the water affinity depended on the spatial distribution of hydrophilic functional groups in protein wu et al 2017a however the studies on the relationships between sludge dewaterability and protein molecular structures in eps need to be extended and the effects of molecular structure of proteins in different eps layers on sludge dewaterability need to be further investigated in addition these conditioning processes mentioned above can extremely destroy activated sludge microbial cells and release intracellular substances xiao et al 2017a which may limit the understanding of true effects of eps on sludge dewaterability recently kmno4 has been used to restrain algae in surface water and drinking water ma et al 2012 xie et al 2013 qi et al 2016 2018 and it has been reported that kmno4 oxidation had a limit effect on cell integrity even increasing dosage and contact time with algae xie et al 2013 furthermore ma et al 2012 proposed a novel kmno4 fe ⅱ process namely induction fe ⅱ after pre oxidation by kmno4 for certain period during this process moderate oxidation of surface adsorbed organic matter s aom on algal cells was achieved to destroy the stability of cells and improve the coagulation by in situ formed fe ⅲ in fact due to the safe and non toxic properties of kmno4 some reports have been investigated the feasibility of excess activated sludge disintegration by kmno4 in anaerobic digestion wu et al 2014 and the micro disintegration floc reconstruction process in kmno4 conditioning wu et al 2017b however controlling kmno4 oxidation was difficult ma et al 2012 during conditioning if sludge is slight or over oxidation not only triggers unpleasant color but also inhibits coagulation due to the high levels or insufficient molecular weight of eps bernhardt et al 1985 chen et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge few study has focused on the kmno4 fe ⅱ process in sludge conditioning to release the water bound in eps and improve sludge filterability as well as understanding variations of sludge properties especially of eps thus the sludge was treated by the moderate oxidation in situ fe ⅲ coagulation process and the relevant dewatering effect was systematically discussed in this study the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the feasibility of kmno4 fe ⅱ process in activated sludge conditioning 2 identify the variations of activated sludge properties especially of eps 3 reveal the role of protein molecular structure for eps fractions in activated sludge dewaterability 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples and reagents activated sludge samples were harvested from urban municipal wwtp in beijing china this wwtp treats approximately 1 000 000 m3 daily by combined membrane bioreactor mbr and ozonation process during the study period the cod n p ratios of the influent were about 36 10 1 and the relative standard deviations were about 10 the collected samples were transported to the laboratory within 2 h then concentrated as raw sludge by setting 4 h finally these raw sludge samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before use the properties of the sludge were listed in table 1 to ensure the accuracy all experiments were completed within a week cao et al 2018 the reagents in this study were all analytical ars and used without further purification ferrous chloride fecl2 4h2o was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd other reagents were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent of china 2 2 experimental procedure in the conditioning procedure an appropriate amount of potassium permanganate was added into 250 ml raw sludge contained in a 500 ml beaker under a continuous agitation at 300 rpm and the pre oxidation treatment occurred and continued for several minutes then ferrous chloride was dosed and the agitation was maintained for 1 min at 300 rpm and 10 min at 50 rpm the pre oxidation was stopped and coagulation happened with in situ fe ⅲ ma et al 2012 qi et al 2018 during the experiment equivalent molar ratio of mn ⅶ to fe ⅱ and dosage of mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ were optimized using single factor experiments to achieve the suitable sludge filterability at the optimum dosing conditions different mn ⅶ reaction times being represented by the addition time intervals of mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ were optimized the conditioned sludge was collected for dewatering performance evaluation physicochemical properties and eps analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 dewatering performance bound water was analyzed according to jin et al 2004 which was defined bound water as the sum of interstitial water internal water and surface water in brief 50 ml sludge samples were centrifuged at 1057 g for 10 min and the supernatant was gently discarded then the remaining sludge sediments were dried at 105 c for 24 h the bound water content was the difference between the weight of centrifuged biomass before and after drying cst is a common used parameter to evaluate sludge filterability it was tested by a commercial cst meter 304b triton 127 electronic co ltd uk with a stainless steel funnel and chromatography papers 17 chr whatman international ltd uk meanwhile the reciprocal ratio of conditioned sludge cst to its initial value cst0 cst was resorted to represent the filterability variations a higher cst0 cst value exhibits a better filterability according to kim et al 2016 besides 30 ml sludge was dewatered by centrifugation following kim et al 2016 and the drainage filtrate mass was measured 2 3 2 sludge disintegration degree analysis sludge disintegration degree ddcod was defined as follows wu et al 2014 1 ddcod scod scod0 tcod scod0 where scod0 is the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod of sludge samples without conditioning glueose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pdh is a kind of intracellular enzyme whose activity is commonly used as an indicator of cell lysis frølund et al 1996 the detailed method applied for g6pdh activity measurement in the supernatant of sludge samples can be found in supplementary material text s1 2 3 3 sludge flocs characterization the sludge microstructure was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem fei the netherlands during the observation sludge samples were firstly dried under vacuum at 60 c and then sputter coated with carbon finally sem images were collected with several magnifications guo et al 2017 particle size distributions psds of sludge samples were assessed by a small angle light scattering test with a laser scattering instrument malvern mastersizer malvern uk median particle size d 50 could be derived from the psd curves zeta potential was recorded by a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk before measurement sludge samples were settled for 15 min and supernatant was collected for analysis xu et al 2018 2 3 4 eps extraction and analysis 2 3 4 1 eps extraction eps extraction of sludge samples was implemented by centrifugation and ultrasound method as yu et al 2008 the detailed procedure was provided in supplementary material text s2 2 3 4 2 analytical methods of pn ps and humic acid ha in eps pn ps and ha concentrations of extracted eps were determined according to li et al 2018 briefly pn and ha were quantified by a modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin and has as standards respectively ps was measured using an anthrone method with glucose as standard 2 3 4 3 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence spectra 3deem fluorescence spectra of eps layers were recorded using a fluorescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan with scanning emission spectra from 220 to 600 nm at 5 nm increments by varying excitation wavelengths from 200 nm to 400 nm at 5 nm increments the spectra were measured at a scan rate of 12000 nm min before measurement samples of eps fractions were diluted to avoid the fluorescence quenching a parafac model was conducted to decompose the 3deem spectra details were described in supplementary material text s3 2 3 4 4 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and protein secondary structures analysis the extracted eps samples were firstly lyophilized at 60 c then major functional groups of these samples were characterized by a ftir spectrometer bruker germany and protein secondary structures were observed by the second derivative analysis and curve fitting procedure lin et al 2018 in the supplementary material text s4 2 3 5 surface thermodynamic analysis using edlvo analysis the contributions of slime and tb eps to total interaction energy of sludge flocs were calculated based on liu et al 2007 2010 and qian et al 2015 2 3 6 other analytical methods total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss and water content wc of sludge samples were determined with the standard method apha 2005 sludge ph value was recorded by a ph meter pb 10 sartorius stedim biotech co ltd china conductivity was measured by a conductivity meter ec215 beijing kanggaote science and technology co ltd china scod was analyzed with a spectrophotometer dr2000 hach usa contact angle was determined by a contact angle measurement device jc2000a powereach co china according to the method of liu et al 2010 2 4 statistical analysis in this study variances of sludge and eps physicochemical properties such as zeta potential particle size pn ps and fluorophores in eps were considered to be resulted from the mn ⅶ fe ⅱ conditioning process thus a factor analysis in ibm spss statistics 17 was used to conduct the information classification dimensionality reduction and simplification of further analysis after that each extracted factor was given a corresponding role in sludge conditioning and the factor score was obtained before factor analysis all variables were standardized the linear correlations between protein molecular structures and the following parameters of bound water content cst and factor score were evaluated with pearson s correlation coefficient r 2 the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval to ensure the reproducibility all tests were conducted in at least duplicate and the standard error was calculated by origin 8 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge dewatering performance single factor experiments were carried out to determine the optimum equivalent molar ratio and dosage of mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ the corresponding results were shown in fig s1 namely n kmno4 n fecl2 1 3 and 0 12 g g ds kmno4 based on these results sludge dewaterability was explored at different intervals between fe ⅱ and mn ⅶ addition and the filterability variations represented as cst0 cst and bound water content were described in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 sludge filterability increased by 2 07 2 40 1 88 1 67 and 1 38 times at the mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition intervals of 0 2 5 10 and 30 min respectively it is noted that even mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ added simultaneously the slight oxidation of mn ⅶ also occurred and lasted for a few seconds because of dissolution and mixing in terms of bound water content however a continuous downward trend was obtained as mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition interval mn ⅶ oxidation time increased which demonstrated that the network was destroyed and the sludge flocs were disintegrated after mn ⅶ oxidation in the reports of cao et al 2016 and xu et al 2018 traditional inorganic coagulants were ineffective in removing bound and intercelluar water in sludge these findings can also support our hypothesis that mn ⅶ oxidation may play an important role in bound water release but overoxidation may decreased sludge filterability thus a moderate oxidation coupled with in situ coagulation conditioning strategy was proposed namely 2 min mn ⅶ oxidation with subsequent fe ⅱ termination based on this strategy a better filterability was obtained and partial bound water was released table 2 while a slight improvement even decline of filterability was observed by mn ⅶ oxidation alone or fe ⅲ coagulation alone as shown in table s1 additionally the drainage filtrate by centrifuging the conditioned sludge with aforementioned strategy was lower than that for fenton like conditioning this is mainly because moderate oxidation can disintegrate eps wrapping on cells surface while it may have limited influence on cells xie et al 2013 qi et al 2016 during fenton like conditioning the peroxidation led to eps dissolution and sludge cell lysis and more bound water converted into free water he et al 2015 however the current study was different from the report of wu et al 2017b which suggested that sludge specific resistance to filtration srf decreased by 51 56 through only 5 min oxidation at 20 g kg mn ⅶ alone this difference may be attributed to the different characteristics of activated sludge 3 2 characteristics of sludge disintegration variances of sludge disintegration characteristics with mn ⅶ fe ⅱ conditioning were shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 sludge disintegration degree almost increased with the extension of mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition interval after 2 min mn ⅶ oxidation a slow rise remained these results indicated that the sludge flocs were disintegrated and eps was disrupted and released to supernatant however as shown in fig s2 there was no significant reduction in particle size along with prolonging the oxidation time even mn ⅶ oxidation alone for 30 min this phenomenon was in agreement with wu et al 2014 and implied that structural integrity of cells in activated sludge was largely retained liu et al 2016 it was also confirmed by the g6pdh activity fig 2 in sludge supernatant as shown in fig 2 the g6pdh activity in the sludge samples with mn ⅶ fe ⅱ conditioning 2 min mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition interval was basically comparative to the us 2w ml treatment which was considered to only cause eps elution wu et al 2018 however the g6pdh activity increased dramatically when cell structure was destroyed by expanding us power to 10w ml these results revealed that mn ⅶ fe ⅱ treatment can disintegrate sludge flocs and induce the change of eps but have a slight effect on cells in addition g6pdh activity was not detected in the samples of mn ⅶ oxidation for 30 min which can be ascribed to the long time oxidation and enzyme deactivation mcswain et al 2005 3 3 zeta potential and particle size the sludge zeta potential and flocs size were provided in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the zeta potential of raw sludge was 7 27 mv while all the zeta potentials increased after sludge was conditioned at different mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition intervals this may be caused by the strong coagulation of in situ formed fe ⅲ which has more reactive sites than pre formed fe ⅲ ma et al 2012 moreover there was a general decline in zeta potential as mn ⅶ oxidation time increased during conditioning it has been reported that the ionization of anionic groups in eps like carboxyl groups and amino groups accounted for the floc surface electronegativity xu et al 2018 mikkelsen 2003 also found that disintegrating the floc caused more exposure surfaces in floc interior which also promoted the surface electronegativity thus the change in zeta potential may be due to the synergistic effects between fe ⅲ coagulation and the variation of eps components in addition the zeta potential of 0 73 mv was more closer to 0 mv at 2 min mn ⅶ oxidation which suggested that the electrostatic repulsion among sludge flocs was weaker after the moderate oxidation in situ coagulation conditioning with regard to the particle size there was no noticeable change in particle size after mn ⅶ fe ⅱ conditioning which was also observed in the cao2 pre oxidation combined with fecl3 re flocculation process chen et al 2016 in their reports the particle size of pre oxidized sludge was even slightly reduced with the increase of fecl3 dosage then the explanation of this phenomenon was stated that small organic compounds transformed from high molecular weight organic matters in sludge eps by pre oxidation alleviated the electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interactions between hydrolyzed products of coagulants and eps components however the reasons in this study need to be further explored 3 4 floc morphological characteristics the sem images of sludge flocs at typical mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition intervals were presented in fig 4 as illustrated in fig 4 there were some intact cells and round microorganisms intertwined with each other which may block water flow in sludge samples after mn ⅶ added even reaction termination used fe ⅱ immediately 0 min interval some loose and complexity pores occurred in these winding structures when the oxidation time increased to 2 min the winding structures were significantly destroyed then re agglutinated together this resulted in a polyporous structure in the presence of in situ formed fe ⅲ and promoted bound water release and provided the access for water removal guo et al 2017 however as the oxidation time increased to 5 min a higher fragmentation degree on sludge flocs can be seen and the smaller fragmentation aggregated and some smaller wrinkle zones on the sludge surface appeared this structure may elevate the resistance for water flow and reduce the filterability of sludge 3 5 responses of eps 3 5 1 pn ps and ha in eps the variations of the pn ps and ha contents of sludge eps layers at different mn ⅶ fe ⅱ addition intervals were shown in fig 5 among the eps components pn is the predominant one and has a higher water containing capacity hu et al 2018 during mn ⅶ fe ⅱ treatment the total pn in eps increased with prolonging the addition interval at first then gradually approached stable as the interval extended to over 5 min the same trend occurred in pn of tb eps however pn in slime and lb eps rapidly increased as the interval extended to 5 min and gradually rose at other oxidation durations this phenomenon suggested that some proteins in tb eps may migrate to slime and lb eps which has a crucial influence on sludge filterability kim et al 2016 li et al 2018 hu et al 2018 in accordance with pn the similar trend was also shown in ha of tb eps and lb eps for ps its rise in eps was pronounced with the extension of mn ⅶ fe ⅱ addition interval the same trend was also presented in lb and tb eps this increase was resulted from the disintegration of sludge flocs more eps released and was easily extracted by the centrifugation and ultrasound method on the other hand the ps in slime decreased at 0 min interval and increased at other intervals the initial ps decrease could be owing to the mn ⅶ oxidation li et al 2018 indicated that ps was more easily oxidized than pn 3 5 2 3d eem it has been reported that it was difficult to accurately analyze the main eps compounds by colorimetric methods le et al 2016 thus the variations of organic compounds in different eps layers were characterized by eem shown in fig s3 parafac analysis was used to decompose the 3deem spectra and four components named c1 c2 c3 and c4 were derived which were presented in fig 6 a in fig 6a c1 c2 c3 and c4 were tryptophan protein like humic acid like fulvic acid like and tyrosine protein like materials respectively peak recognition of eem fluorescence spectra was presented in supplementary material text s5 the fluorescence intensity distributions of these four components in eps fractions were demonstrated in fig 6b as shown in fig 6b the typical fluorophores in tb and lb eps were mainly identified as tryptophan protein like substances c1 and these substances almost increased with the increase of oxidation time however in slime the predominant materials were transformed into tyrosine protein like materials c4 which also presented the same rising trend as c1 in tb and lb eps generally a blue shift from c1 to c4 revealed that the numbers of unsaturated functional groups such as conjugated systems and double bonds which may form complicated structures in c4 decreased thus simple biopolymers increased in slime this also agreed with the eps migration phenomenon described in fig 5 moreover the decrease of total fluorophores including tryptophan protein like substances in tb eps at 0 min interval was probably caused by mn ⅶ oxidation even for only several seconds the subsequent increase of all fluorophores in eps layers also revealed the disruption of sludge flocs besides the 3deem spectra may be more sensitive than colorimetric methods which presented a different variation of protein like fluorophores from that of pn components 3 5 3 ftir and protein secondary structures the eps components were further analyzed by ftir technology and the corresponding spectra were displayed in fig s4 the band assignments for ftir spectra 1000 cm 1 features were shown in table s2 the detailed description of ftir spectra was provided in supplementary material text s6 to access more subtle differences in protein structure amide ⅰ region was further resolved into protein secondary structure peaks using second derivative analysis and curve fitting procedure the fitted peaks were depicted in fig s5 and the variances of protein secondary structures in different eps layers were shown in table 3 typically the percentages of aggregated strands in slime were only 8 48 at 0 min interval and increased to 12 98 15 54 after 2 or 5 min oxidation the same trend was also manifested in random coil during 0 5 min oxidation furthermore as the oxidation time was prolonged the percentages of aggregated strands increased to 23 79 27 71 but a slight decline was shown in random coil for protein secondary structures in tb eps the percentages of aggregated strands rose firstly from 4 79 to about 11 and then decreased to 8 07 8 85 while β turn percentages continued to rise from 21 08 to 38 31 these results demonstrated that the oxidation degree slight moderate and over oxidation may influence the percentages of protein secondary structures in eps in addition there was no obvious amide ⅰ peak in eps of raw sludge this was different from badireddy et al 2010 yin et al 2015 and you et al 2017 in their reports sludge samples were collected from a glucose controlled condition a sbr in laboratory or an anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process in wwtp respectively in this study sludge samples were harvested from a mbr which has a longer srt affecting the consumption and secretion of some organic matters in eps zhang et al 2015 3 6 influence of eps protein molecular structure on as dewaterability table 4 showed the pearson correlations between protein molecular structures and bound water content cst strong negative correlations were found between bound water content and aggregated strands r 2 0 821 p 0 05 random coil r 2 0 910 p 0 01 β turn r 2 0 900 p 0 01 in slime meanwhile same correlations were shown between cst and these protein secondary structures in slime aggregated strands r 2 0 788 p 0 05 random coil r 2 0 974 p 0 01 β turn r 2 0 997 p 0 01 moreover the protein secondary structures like aggregated strands β sheet and β turn in tb eps also presented strong negative correlations with bound water content and cst shown in table 4 previous studies have been reported that random coil could lead to a loose structure and decreased aggregation of sludge and biofilm badireddy et al 2010 you et al 2017 however aggregated strands have been found that are main structures in eps of sludge at the beginning of culture in glucose controlled condition badireddy et al 2010 which may have a weak binding capacity on water meanwhile the turn structure percentages were lower in the eps of both anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria than those in activated sludge and the former two bacteria species showed a strong tendency to form granules yin et al 2015 in the molecular structure of β turn there are several peptoid residues along the main chain rainaldi et al 2002 in these peptoid residues commonly the c o in the first residue and the nh in the fourth residue join to form a tight ring through hydrogen bond this turn structure may enwrap inner hydrophobic groups of amino acids and weaken hydrophobic force wang et al 2014 suggested that entanglement and hydrophobic interactions of long chains in eps were important in microcolony level cohesion thus the unfolding and despiralization in slime such as increase of aggregated strands random coil and β turn in this study table 3 may induce a loose structure and water flow resistance reduction as well as a corresponding improvement of filterability fig 1 in the report of jia et al 2017 β sheet had a unique structure like the twisted and pleated sheet due to this structure more hydrophobic sites were easily to be exposed and promoted cell to cell aggregation similar results were found in badireddy et al 2010 moreover it was also reported that tb eps had a key effect on gel like structures of sludge in our previous study yuan et al 2014 thus the relationships between eps protein secondary structures and sludge dewaterability can be proposed at a slight oxidation in situ fe ⅲ coagulation stage some protein secondary structures were unfolded and despiraled in slime but the cells were still closely bounded to tb eps as well as the bound water during a moderate oxidation in situ coagulation stage protein secondary structures were also unfolded and despiraled in slime and some entangled and folded structures in tb eps transported into aggregated strands and β turn which may also migrate to outer eps layers this process may promote bound water release thus the sludge filterability and free water contents were improved however after overoxidation these weakening aggregation structures like β turn sharply increased or promoting aggregation structures like β sheet decreased this will lead to the decrease of cell to cell aggregation as well as sludge filterability the aforementioned proposal was further confirmed by the surface thermodynamic calculation of slime and tb eps fig s6 the details can be found in supplementary material text s7 factor analysis was used to further explain the variances of functional protein secondary structures in different eps layers as shown in table s3 three factors were extracted giving a cumulative variance of 96 571 afterwards the rotation of these principal components was carried out by the varimax method to better explain the actual meaning of these three factors the results were shown in table s4 factor 1 2 and 3 were considered as the role of eps migration the impact of eps disintegration and the function of particle size increase respectively detailed factor recognition was shown in supplementary material text s8 pearson correlations between scores of these factors and percentages of protein secondary structures were presented in table 4 interestingly percentages of typical functional protein secondary structures like aggregated strands β turn in slime and tb eps presented positive correlations with factor 1 score r 2 0 85 p 0 05 whereas few of these structures were correlated with factor 2 and 3 scores these correlations suggested that eps migration rather than only eps disintegration may have a key impact on the formation of some protein secondary structures in slime and tb eps meanwhile the observed protein secondary structures which may affect sludge dewaterability probably derive from inner eps this result is also in agreement with our previous study qian et al 2016 guo et al 2017 li et al 2018 4 conclusion in this study a moderate mn ⅶ oxidation coupled with in situ fe ⅲ coagulation conditioning strategy was proposed under conditioning a better sludge filterability was obtained and partial bound water was released meanwhile eps wrapping on cells surface was disrupted and a limited influence occurred on cells it was also revealed that the unfolding and despiralization in slime such as the increase of aggregated strands random coil and β turn and moderate weakening rigidity of tb eps with a certain proportion between β sheet and β turn were beneficial for improvement of sludge dewaterability factor analysis was used to further explain the variances of functional protein secondary structures in different eps layers the correlations between percentages of protein secondary structures and factor 1 score demonstrated that eps migration rather than only eps disintegration may have a key impact on some protein secondary structures formation in slime and tb eps the observed protein secondary structures which may affect sludge dewaterability probably derive from inner eps declaration of interests the authors declare that they

fractal network wu et al 2002 chung and lee 2003 yuan et al 2014 qian et al 2015 and gel like structure dursun and dentel 2009 dentel 2010 mahmoud et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 it has been reported that extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microorganism in sludge was considered to act as a biological glue which was the one of main factors influence sludge rheological properties and gel like structure dong et al 2011 yuan et al 2014 thus understanding about the effects of eps on sludge dewaterability has become an important topic sheng et al 2010 many efforts have been focused on the qualitative and quantitative contributions of eps in sludge dewaterability aggregation in the past decade yu et al 2008 divided eps into slime loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps and analyzed sludge dewaterability of 14 wwtps founding that the normalized capillary suction time cst correlated with protein pn contents in slime and lb eps rather than polysaccharides ps this result was further confirmed by their subsequent study using fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem combined with parallel factor parafac analysis yu et al 2010 meanwhile liu et al 2010 quantitatively described the contributions of lb eps and tb eps in sludge aggregation which suggested the lb eps always displayed an attractive effect but the function of tb eps depended on the separation distance between sludge cells however it may be relatively easier to dewater after weakening or destroying the gel like structure of eps or sludge thus yuan et al 2014 discussed the contributions of different eps fractions in the gel like structure of sludge and results showed that tb eps played a key role with the development of conditioning methods several biological conditioners chemical oxidants or physical equipment were applied in the sludge conditioning which could disrupt eps and cells to release bound water and improve sludge dewaterability chen et al 2015 diak and örmeci 2016 liu et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 2017a 2017b wu et al 2017a chen et al 2015 reported that sludge filterability was mainly dependent on the properties of protein like materials in seps slime during enzymatic lysis and chemical re flocculation process whereas it was also suggested that molecular weight fractionation may affect sludge dewaterability niu et al 2013 liu et al 2016 and a series of studies were carried out to elucidate the key or most important organic compounds in different eps fractions in xiao et al 2016 2017a 2017b their reports implied that tryptophan like proteins and microbial by product like materials at molecular weight of 106 5 107 da in lb eps were the key compounds related to sludge filterability during ultrasonication us acidification treatment xiao et al 2016 while strong and positive correlation was presented between increased sludge filterability and the removal of low molecular weight 20 kda proteins and neutrals in lb eps during oxone activation treatment process xiao et al 2017a obviously it is widely accepted that extracellular proteins have an important effect on determining sludge dewaterability thus isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation itraq proteomics technology was employed for the first time to determine the representative extracellular proteins in sludge during cao2 oxidation process in wu et al 2017a then the molecular structure transformation of these pure representative extracellular proteins was tracked to analyze the water binding mechanism and the results implied that the water affinity depended on the spatial distribution of hydrophilic functional groups in protein wu et al 2017a however the studies on the relationships between sludge dewaterability and protein molecular structures in eps need to be extended and the effects of molecular structure of proteins in different eps layers on sludge dewaterability need to be further investigated in addition these conditioning processes mentioned above can extremely destroy activated sludge microbial cells and release intracellular substances xiao et al 2017a which may limit the understanding of true effects of eps on sludge dewaterability recently kmno4 has been used to restrain algae in surface water and drinking water ma et al 2012 xie et al 2013 qi et al 2016 2018 and it has been reported that kmno4 oxidation had a limit effect on cell integrity even increasing dosage and contact time with algae xie et al 2013 furthermore ma et al 2012 proposed a novel kmno4 fe ⅱ process namely induction fe ⅱ after pre oxidation by kmno4 for certain period during this process moderate oxidation of surface adsorbed organic matter s aom on algal cells was achieved to destroy the stability of cells and improve the coagulation by in situ formed fe ⅲ in fact due to the safe and non toxic properties of kmno4 some reports have been investigated the feasibility of excess activated sludge disintegration by kmno4 in anaerobic digestion wu et al 2014 and the micro disintegration floc reconstruction process in kmno4 conditioning wu et al 2017b however controlling kmno4 oxidation was difficult ma et al 2012 during conditioning if sludge is slight or over oxidation not only triggers unpleasant color but also inhibits coagulation due to the high levels or insufficient molecular weight of eps bernhardt et al 1985 chen et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge few study has focused on the kmno4 fe ⅱ process in sludge conditioning to release the water bound in eps and improve sludge filterability as well as understanding variations of sludge properties especially of eps thus the sludge was treated by the moderate oxidation in situ fe ⅲ coagulation process and the relevant dewatering effect was systematically discussed in this study the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the feasibility of kmno4 fe ⅱ process in activated sludge conditioning 2 identify the variations of activated sludge properties especially of eps 3 reveal the role of protein molecular structure for eps fractions in activated sludge dewaterability 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples and reagents activated sludge samples were harvested from urban municipal wwtp in beijing china this wwtp treats approximately 1 000 000 m3 daily by combined membrane bioreactor mbr and ozonation process during the study period the cod n p ratios of the influent were about 36 10 1 and the relative standard deviations were about 10 the collected samples were transported to the laboratory within 2 h then concentrated as raw sludge by setting 4 h finally these raw sludge samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before use the properties of the sludge were listed in table 1 to ensure the accuracy all experiments were completed within a week cao et al 2018 the reagents in this study were all analytical ars and used without further purification ferrous chloride fecl2 4h2o was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd other reagents were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent of china 2 2 experimental procedure in the conditioning procedure an appropriate amount of potassium permanganate was added into 250 ml raw sludge contained in a 500 ml beaker under a continuous agitation at 300 rpm and the pre oxidation treatment occurred and continued for several minutes then ferrous chloride was dosed and the agitation was maintained for 1 min at 300 rpm and 10 min at 50 rpm the pre oxidation was stopped and coagulation happened with in situ fe ⅲ ma et al 2012 qi et al 2018 during the experiment equivalent molar ratio of mn ⅶ to fe ⅱ and dosage of mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ were optimized using single factor experiments to achieve the suitable sludge filterability at the optimum dosing conditions different mn ⅶ reaction times being represented by the addition time intervals of mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ were optimized the conditioned sludge was collected for dewatering performance evaluation physicochemical properties and eps analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 dewatering performance bound water was analyzed according to jin et al 2004 which was defined bound water as the sum of interstitial water internal water and surface water in brief 50 ml sludge samples were centrifuged at 1057 g for 10 min and the supernatant was gently discarded then the remaining sludge sediments were dried at 105 c for 24 h the bound water content was the difference between the weight of centrifuged biomass before and after drying cst is a common used parameter to evaluate sludge filterability it was tested by a commercial cst meter 304b triton 127 electronic co ltd uk with a stainless steel funnel and chromatography papers 17 chr whatman international ltd uk meanwhile the reciprocal ratio of conditioned sludge cst to its initial value cst0 cst was resorted to represent the filterability variations a higher cst0 cst value exhibits a better filterability according to kim et al 2016 besides 30 ml sludge was dewatered by centrifugation following kim et al 2016 and the drainage filtrate mass was measured 2 3 2 sludge disintegration degree analysis sludge disintegration degree ddcod was defined as follows wu et al 2014 1 ddcod scod scod0 tcod scod0 where scod0 is the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod of sludge samples without conditioning glueose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pdh is a kind of intracellular enzyme whose activity is commonly used as an indicator of cell lysis frølund et al 1996 the detailed method applied for g6pdh activity measurement in the supernatant of sludge samples can be found in supplementary material text s1 2 3 3 sludge flocs characterization the sludge microstructure was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem fei the netherlands during the observation sludge samples were firstly dried under vacuum at 60 c and then sputter coated with carbon finally sem images were collected with several magnifications guo et al 2017 particle size distributions psds of sludge samples were assessed by a small angle light scattering test with a laser scattering instrument malvern mastersizer malvern uk median particle size d 50 could be derived from the psd curves zeta potential was recorded by a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk before measurement sludge samples were settled for 15 min and supernatant was collected for analysis xu et al 2018 2 3 4 eps extraction and analysis 2 3 4 1 eps extraction eps extraction of sludge samples was implemented by centrifugation and ultrasound method as yu et al 2008 the detailed procedure was provided in supplementary material text s2 2 3 4 2 analytical methods of pn ps and humic acid ha in eps pn ps and ha concentrations of extracted eps were determined according to li et al 2018 briefly pn and ha were quantified by a modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin and has as standards respectively ps was measured using an anthrone method with glucose as standard 2 3 4 3 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence spectra 3deem fluorescence spectra of eps layers were recorded using a fluorescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan with scanning emission spectra from 220 to 600 nm at 5 nm increments by varying excitation wavelengths from 200 nm to 400 nm at 5 nm increments the spectra were measured at a scan rate of 12000 nm min before measurement samples of eps fractions were diluted to avoid the fluorescence quenching a parafac model was conducted to decompose the 3deem spectra details were described in supplementary material text s3 2 3 4 4 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and protein secondary structures analysis the extracted eps samples were firstly lyophilized at 60 c then major functional groups of these samples were characterized by a ftir spectrometer bruker germany and protein secondary structures were observed by the second derivative analysis and curve fitting procedure lin et al 2018 in the supplementary material text s4 2 3 5 surface thermodynamic analysis using edlvo analysis the contributions of slime and tb eps to total interaction energy of sludge flocs were calculated based on liu et al 2007 2010 and qian et al 2015 2 3 6 other analytical methods total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss and water content wc of sludge samples were determined with the standard method apha 2005 sludge ph value was recorded by a ph meter pb 10 sartorius stedim biotech co ltd china conductivity was measured by a conductivity meter ec215 beijing kanggaote science and technology co ltd china scod was analyzed with a spectrophotometer dr2000 hach usa contact angle was determined by a contact angle measurement device jc2000a powereach co china according to the method of liu et al 2010 2 4 statistical analysis in this study variances of sludge and eps physicochemical properties such as zeta potential particle size pn ps and fluorophores in eps were considered to be resulted from the mn ⅶ fe ⅱ conditioning process thus a factor analysis in ibm spss statistics 17 was used to conduct the information classification dimensionality reduction and simplification of further analysis after that each extracted factor was given a corresponding role in sludge conditioning and the factor score was obtained before factor analysis all variables were standardized the linear correlations between protein molecular structures and the following parameters of bound water content cst and factor score were evaluated with pearson s correlation coefficient r 2 the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval to ensure the reproducibility all tests were conducted in at least duplicate and the standard error was calculated by origin 8 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge dewatering performance single factor experiments were carried out to determine the optimum equivalent molar ratio and dosage of mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ the corresponding results were shown in fig s1 namely n kmno4 n fecl2 1 3 and 0 12 g g ds kmno4 based on these results sludge dewaterability was explored at different intervals between fe ⅱ and mn ⅶ addition and the filterability variations represented as cst0 cst and bound water content were described in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 sludge filterability increased by 2 07 2 40 1 88 1 67 and 1 38 times at the mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition intervals of 0 2 5 10 and 30 min respectively it is noted that even mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ added simultaneously the slight oxidation of mn ⅶ also occurred and lasted for a few seconds because of dissolution and mixing in terms of bound water content however a continuous downward trend was obtained as mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition interval mn ⅶ oxidation time increased which demonstrated that the network was destroyed and the sludge flocs were disintegrated after mn ⅶ oxidation in the reports of cao et al 2016 and xu et al 2018 traditional inorganic coagulants were ineffective in removing bound and intercelluar water in sludge these findings can also support our hypothesis that mn ⅶ oxidation may play an important role in bound water release but overoxidation may decreased sludge filterability thus a moderate oxidation coupled with in situ coagulation conditioning strategy was proposed namely 2 min mn ⅶ oxidation with subsequent fe ⅱ termination based on this strategy a better filterability was obtained and partial bound water was released table 2 while a slight improvement even decline of filterability was observed by mn ⅶ oxidation alone or fe ⅲ coagulation alone as shown in table s1 additionally the drainage filtrate by centrifuging the conditioned sludge with aforementioned strategy was lower than that for fenton like conditioning this is mainly because moderate oxidation can disintegrate eps wrapping on cells surface while it may have limited influence on cells xie et al 2013 qi et al 2016 during fenton like conditioning the peroxidation led to eps dissolution and sludge cell lysis and more bound water converted into free water he et al 2015 however the current study was different from the report of wu et al 2017b which suggested that sludge specific resistance to filtration srf decreased by 51 56 through only 5 min oxidation at 20 g kg mn ⅶ alone this difference may be attributed to the different characteristics of activated sludge 3 2 characteristics of sludge disintegration variances of sludge disintegration characteristics with mn ⅶ fe ⅱ conditioning were shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 sludge disintegration degree almost increased with the extension of mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition interval after 2 min mn ⅶ oxidation a slow rise remained these results indicated that the sludge flocs were disintegrated and eps was disrupted and released to supernatant however as shown in fig s2 there was no significant reduction in particle size along with prolonging the oxidation time even mn ⅶ oxidation alone for 30 min this phenomenon was in agreement with wu et al 2014 and implied that structural integrity of cells in activated sludge was largely retained liu et al 2016 it was also confirmed by the g6pdh activity fig 2 in sludge supernatant as shown in fig 2 the g6pdh activity in the sludge samples with mn ⅶ fe ⅱ conditioning 2 min mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition interval was basically comparative to the us 2w ml treatment which was considered to only cause eps elution wu et al 2018 however the g6pdh activity increased dramatically when cell structure was destroyed by expanding us power to 10w ml these results revealed that mn ⅶ fe ⅱ treatment can disintegrate sludge flocs and induce the change of eps but have a slight effect on cells in addition g6pdh activity was not detected in the samples of mn ⅶ oxidation for 30 min which can be ascribed to the long time oxidation and enzyme deactivation mcswain et al 2005 3 3 zeta potential and particle size the sludge zeta potential and flocs size were provided in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the zeta potential of raw sludge was 7 27 mv while all the zeta potentials increased after sludge was conditioned at different mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition intervals this may be caused by the strong coagulation of in situ formed fe ⅲ which has more reactive sites than pre formed fe ⅲ ma et al 2012 moreover there was a general decline in zeta potential as mn ⅶ oxidation time increased during conditioning it has been reported that the ionization of anionic groups in eps like carboxyl groups and amino groups accounted for the floc surface electronegativity xu et al 2018 mikkelsen 2003 also found that disintegrating the floc caused more exposure surfaces in floc interior which also promoted the surface electronegativity thus the change in zeta potential may be due to the synergistic effects between fe ⅲ coagulation and the variation of eps components in addition the zeta potential of 0 73 mv was more closer to 0 mv at 2 min mn ⅶ oxidation which suggested that the electrostatic repulsion among sludge flocs was weaker after the moderate oxidation in situ coagulation conditioning with regard to the particle size there was no noticeable change in particle size after mn ⅶ fe ⅱ conditioning which was also observed in the cao2 pre oxidation combined with fecl3 re flocculation process chen et al 2016 in their reports the particle size of pre oxidized sludge was even slightly reduced with the increase of fecl3 dosage then the explanation of this phenomenon was stated that small organic compounds transformed from high molecular weight organic matters in sludge eps by pre oxidation alleviated the electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interactions between hydrolyzed products of coagulants and eps components however the reasons in this study need to be further explored 3 4 floc morphological characteristics the sem images of sludge flocs at typical mn ⅶ and fe ⅱ addition intervals were presented in fig 4 as illustrated in fig 4 there were some intact cells and round microorganisms intertwined with each other which may block water flow in sludge samples after mn ⅶ added even reaction termination used fe ⅱ immediately 0 min interval some loose and complexity pores occurred in these winding structures when the oxidation time increased to 2 min the winding structures were significantly destroyed then re agglutinated together this resulted in a polyporous structure in the presence of in situ formed fe ⅲ and promoted bound water release and provided the access for water removal guo et al 2017 however as the oxidation time increased to 5 min a higher fragmentation degree on sludge flocs can be seen and the smaller fragmentation aggregated and some smaller wrinkle zones on the sludge surface appeared this structure may elevate the resistance for water flow and reduce the filterability of sludge 3 5 responses of eps 3 5 1 pn ps and ha in eps the variations of the pn ps and ha contents of sludge eps layers at different mn ⅶ fe ⅱ addition intervals were shown in fig 5 among the eps components pn is the predominant one and has a higher water containing capacity hu et al 2018 during mn ⅶ fe ⅱ treatment the total pn in eps increased with prolonging the addition interval at first then gradually approached stable as the interval extended to over 5 min the same trend occurred in pn of tb eps however pn in slime and lb eps rapidly increased as the interval extended to 5 min and gradually rose at other oxidation durations this phenomenon suggested that some proteins in tb eps may migrate to slime and lb eps which has a crucial influence on sludge filterability kim et al 2016 li et al 2018 hu et al 2018 in accordance with pn the similar trend was also shown in ha of tb eps and lb eps for ps its rise in eps was pronounced with the extension of mn ⅶ fe ⅱ addition interval the same trend was also presented in lb and tb eps this increase was resulted from the disintegration of sludge flocs more eps released and was easily extracted by the centrifugation and ultrasound method on the other hand the ps in slime decreased at 0 min interval and increased at other intervals the initial ps decrease could be owing to the mn ⅶ oxidation li et al 2018 indicated that ps was more easily oxidized than pn 3 5 2 3d eem it has been reported that it was difficult to accurately analyze the main eps compounds by colorimetric methods le et al 2016 thus the variations of organic compounds in different eps layers were characterized by eem shown in fig s3 parafac analysis was used to decompose the 3deem spectra and four components named c1 c2 c3 and c4 were derived which were presented in fig 6 a in fig 6a c1 c2 c3 and c4 were tryptophan protein like humic acid like fulvic acid like and tyrosine protein like materials respectively peak recognition of eem fluorescence spectra was presented in supplementary material text s5 the fluorescence intensity distributions of these four components in eps fractions were demonstrated in fig 6b as shown in fig 6b the typical fluorophores in tb and lb eps were mainly identified as tryptophan protein like substances c1 and these substances almost increased with the increase of oxidation time however in slime the predominant materials were transformed into tyrosine protein like materials c4 which also presented the same rising trend as c1 in tb and lb eps generally a blue shift from c1 to c4 revealed that the numbers of unsaturated functional groups such as conjugated systems and double bonds which may form complicated structures in c4 decreased thus simple biopolymers increased in slime this also agreed with the eps migration phenomenon described in fig 5 moreover the decrease of total fluorophores including tryptophan protein like substances in tb eps at 0 min interval was probably caused by mn ⅶ oxidation even for only several seconds the subsequent increase of all fluorophores in eps layers also revealed the disruption of sludge flocs besides the 3deem spectra may be more sensitive than colorimetric methods which presented a different variation of protein like fluorophores from that of pn components 3 5 3 ftir and protein secondary structures the eps components were further analyzed by ftir technology and the corresponding spectra were displayed in fig s4 the band assignments for ftir spectra 1000 cm 1 features were shown in table s2 the detailed description of ftir spectra was provided in supplementary material text s6 to access more subtle differences in protein structure amide ⅰ region was further resolved into protein secondary structure peaks using second derivative analysis and curve fitting procedure the fitted peaks were depicted in fig s5 and the variances of protein secondary structures in different eps layers were shown in table 3 typically the percentages of aggregated strands in slime were only 8 48 at 0 min interval and increased to 12 98 15 54 after 2 or 5 min oxidation the same trend was also manifested in random coil during 0 5 min oxidation furthermore as the oxidation time was prolonged the percentages of aggregated strands increased to 23 79 27 71 but a slight decline was shown in random coil for protein secondary structures in tb eps the percentages of aggregated strands rose firstly from 4 79 to about 11 and then decreased to 8 07 8 85 while β turn percentages continued to rise from 21 08 to 38 31 these results demonstrated that the oxidation degree slight moderate and over oxidation may influence the percentages of protein secondary structures in eps in addition there was no obvious amide ⅰ peak in eps of raw sludge this was different from badireddy et al 2010 yin et al 2015 and you et al 2017 in their reports sludge samples were collected from a glucose controlled condition a sbr in laboratory or an anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process in wwtp respectively in this study sludge samples were harvested from a mbr which has a longer srt affecting the consumption and secretion of some organic matters in eps zhang et al 2015 3 6 influence of eps protein molecular structure on as dewaterability table 4 showed the pearson correlations between protein molecular structures and bound water content cst strong negative correlations were found between bound water content and aggregated strands r 2 0 821 p 0 05 random coil r 2 0 910 p 0 01 β turn r 2 0 900 p 0 01 in slime meanwhile same correlations were shown between cst and these protein secondary structures in slime aggregated strands r 2 0 788 p 0 05 random coil r 2 0 974 p 0 01 β turn r 2 0 997 p 0 01 moreover the protein secondary structures like aggregated strands β sheet and β turn in tb eps also presented strong negative correlations with bound water content and cst shown in table 4 previous studies have been reported that random coil could lead to a loose structure and decreased aggregation of sludge and biofilm badireddy et al 2010 you et al 2017 however aggregated strands have been found that are main structures in eps of sludge at the beginning of culture in glucose controlled condition badireddy et al 2010 which may have a weak binding capacity on water meanwhile the turn structure percentages were lower in the eps of both anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria than those in activated sludge and the former two bacteria species showed a strong tendency to form granules yin et al 2015 in the molecular structure of β turn there are several peptoid residues along the main chain rainaldi et al 2002 in these peptoid residues commonly the c o in the first residue and the nh in the fourth residue join to form a tight ring through hydrogen bond this turn structure may enwrap inner hydrophobic groups of amino acids and weaken hydrophobic force wang et al 2014 suggested that entanglement and hydrophobic interactions of long chains in eps were important in microcolony level cohesion thus the unfolding and despiralization in slime such as increase of aggregated strands random coil and β turn in this study table 3 may induce a loose structure and water flow resistance reduction as well as a corresponding improvement of filterability fig 1 in the report of jia et al 2017 β sheet had a unique structure like the twisted and pleated sheet due to this structure more hydrophobic sites were easily to be exposed and promoted cell to cell aggregation similar results were found in badireddy et al 2010 moreover it was also reported that tb eps had a key effect on gel like structures of sludge in our previous study yuan et al 2014 thus the relationships between eps protein secondary structures and sludge dewaterability can be proposed at a slight oxidation in situ fe ⅲ coagulation stage some protein secondary structures were unfolded and despiraled in slime but the cells were still closely bounded to tb eps as well as the bound water during a moderate oxidation in situ coagulation stage protein secondary structures were also unfolded and despiraled in slime and some entangled and folded structures in tb eps transported into aggregated strands and β turn which may also migrate to outer eps layers this process may promote bound water release thus the sludge filterability and free water contents were improved however after overoxidation these weakening aggregation structures like β turn sharply increased or promoting aggregation structures like β sheet decreased this will lead to the decrease of cell to cell aggregation as well as sludge filterability the aforementioned proposal was further confirmed by the surface thermodynamic calculation of slime and tb eps fig s6 the details can be found in supplementary material text s7 factor analysis was used to further explain the variances of functional protein secondary structures in different eps layers as shown in table s3 three factors were extracted giving a cumulative variance of 96 571 afterwards the rotation of these principal components was carried out by the varimax method to better explain the actual meaning of these three factors the results were shown in table s4 factor 1 2 and 3 were considered as the role of eps migration the impact of eps disintegration and the function of particle size increase respectively detailed factor recognition was shown in supplementary material text s8 pearson correlations between scores of these factors and percentages of protein secondary structures were presented in table 4 interestingly percentages of typical functional protein secondary structures like aggregated strands β turn in slime and tb eps presented positive correlations with factor 1 score r 2 0 85 p 0 05 whereas few of these structures were correlated with factor 2 and 3 scores these correlations suggested that eps migration rather than only eps disintegration may have a key impact on the formation of some protein secondary structures in slime and tb eps meanwhile the observed protein secondary structures which may affect sludge dewaterability probably derive from inner eps this result is also in agreement with our previous study qian et al 2016 guo et al 2017 li et al 2018 4 conclusion in this study a moderate mn ⅶ oxidation coupled with in situ fe ⅲ coagulation conditioning strategy was proposed under conditioning a better sludge filterability was obtained and partial bound water was released meanwhile eps wrapping on cells surface was disrupted and a limited influence occurred on cells it was also revealed that the unfolding and despiralization in slime such as the increase of aggregated strands random coil and β turn and moderate weakening rigidity of tb eps with a certain proportion between β sheet and β turn were beneficial for improvement of sludge dewaterability factor analysis was used to further explain the variances of functional protein secondary structures in different eps layers the correlations between percentages of protein secondary structures and factor 1 score demonstrated that eps migration rather than only eps disintegration may have a key impact on some protein secondary structures formation in slime and tb eps the observed protein secondary structures which may affect sludge dewaterability probably derive from inner eps declaration of interests the authors declare that they

18941,studying the abundance characteristics and removal of microplastics mps in wastewater treatment plants wwtps in coastal cities is of great significance for understanding the impacts of human activities on the marine environment but currently little information on this topic is available in china therefore the abundance characteristics and removal of mps in seven wwtps of xiamen a typical coastal city in china are studied sixty samples were collected using an improved sampling method involving an electromagnetic flowmeter and a fast digital camera the influent mps concentration is 1 57 13 69 items l and it is reduced to 0 20 1 73 items l in the effluent indicating that 79 3 97 8 mps is removed based on the daily effluent discharge and mps removal rate it is estimated that 6 5 108 mps are released from the seven wwtps into the xiamen bay each day the light microscopic and micro raman spectroscopic analysis indicates that 62 68 of particles are plastic polymers including polypropylene 31 6 polyethylene 21 9 polystyrene 10 1 propylene ethylene copolymer 9 2 and polyethylene terephthalate 7 5 the color of mps is mainly composed of white 27 3 and clears 25 8 our results show that granules 41 1 are the dominant shape of mps followed by fragments 31 3 fibers 23 7 and pellet 3 9 the characteristics of mps such as sizes shapes and types affect the mps removal in wwtps our findings show that mps concentration in the influent is positively correlated with the suspended solids ss however in the effluent it is associated with the wwtps operating load as reflected by obviously higher mp abundance in overloaded ones graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment plant microplastic abundance characteristics removal 1 introduction microplastics mps are defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm in diameter arthur et al 2009 law and thompson 2014 focuses have been on the small plastic particle pollution in the ocean since the 1970s carpenter et al 1972 carpenter and smith 1972 wong et al 1974 however the attention wasn t paid on the distribution and ecological impacts of the tiny plastic particles in the marine environment until thompson et al 2004 first proposed the term microplastic in 2004 recently mounting mps studies have been focused on the freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems rochman 2018 since 80 of the plastics in the ocean come from lands andrady 2011 frias et al 2016 mps have been concentrated in the coastal regions where is mainly influenced by plastic debris input from terrestrial sources desforges et al 2014 frias et al 2014 the land derived plastics enter the coastal waters through rivers wastewater pipes or rainwater scouring and wind action jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 ryan et al 2009 in particular mps from industrial and domestic products for instance surfaces of buildings and facial cleansers that use mps as abrasive scrubbers are likely to get transported through wastewater treatment plants wwtps ending up in aquatic environments browne 2015 browne et al 2007 gies et al 2018 and it may lead to further contamination prata 2018 in coastal cities most wastewater effluents directly discharge into the adjacent coastal waters rendering one of the significant land based point sources of mps the coast of china has become one of the most mps polluted regions across the world lebreton et al 2017 sherman and van sebille 2016 in mainland china there are 3340 operational wwtps 56 07 of which n 1873 are located in coastal regions with an actual treatment capacity of 0 78 108 m3 d jin et al 2014 however little research has been done on the abundance characteristics and removal of mps in wwtps in china especially in coastal regions only a few studies on the estimated emission of plastic microbeads cheung and fok 2017 and mps in sewage sludge from the wwtps li et al 2018 are available most prior studies were concerned about mps loadings in the effluent of wwtps and then confirmed wwtps as one mps source in the receiving environment gies et al 2018 mason et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 sutton et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017a ziajahromi et al 2016 2017 however the abundance and characteristics of mps in the influent have an essential implication of the urban mps pollution loadings and sources as such it is worthwhile to study the mps abundance and characteristics both in the influent and effluent of wwtps to acquire holistic baseline understandings and behaviors of mps in wwtps mason et al 2016 raju et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2016 due to facile blockage of sampling screens by the massive amount of organic pollutants in the influent it is a challenge to collect a sufficient volume of influent samples talvitie et al 2015 2017b the volume of the influent samples is generally several orders of magnitude lower than that of the effluent the discrepancy in the sampling volume between influents and effluents may lead to underestimation of mps abundance in the influent currently wastewater is commonly sampled using submersible pumps carr et al 2016 mason et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 or plastic free grab samplers magni et al 2019 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b in some studies non plastic grab samplers were used for taking influents while pumps were used for effluent sampling talvitie et al 2017b different sampling gears used for influent and effluent sampling in one study may result in incomparability in final results to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of a sampling approach effective in capturing a sufficient volume of influent and effluent samples as well as accurate sample volume recording to this end the sampling in this study is optimized by combining an electromagnetic flowmeter and a fast digital camera this study aims to investigate the abundance characteristics and behaviors of mps in the influents and effluents from seven wwtps in xiamen city the removal rate of mps and treatment efficiency of wwtps are evaluated furthermore mps flux entering into the xiamen bay following wastewater treatment is estimated additionally sources of mps in the influents and effluent are analyzed to gain an overview of the mp fate in wwtps 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling sites xiamen a typical coastal city is located in the southeast of china facing taiwan across the strait fig 1 as a special economic zone in china xiamen is famous as a harbor city and a tourism destination there are seven secondary wwtps in xiamen treating domestic wastewater generated by 3 5 million people in the six urban districts table s1 and undertaking industrial wastewater that has been preliminarily treated in the industrial plans the effluents of wwtps are discharged into the xiamen bay directly for the hc plant 60 and 40 of the influent is contributed by industrial wastewater and domestic wastewater respectively as such samples of industrial and domestic wastewater were collected at the influent of hc in total 60 samples were collected from the influents n 32 and effluents n 28 of the seven wwtps table 1 2 2 sampling the sampling was conducted in the seven wwtps from september 18 to 20 2017 a multi use pump newa nj4500 italy connecting to an intelligent electromagnetic flowmeter sin ldg dn20 flow range 2 180 226 l min error range 0 3 china through the hose was used for sampling fig 2 the influent effluent samples were filtered under gravity by passing through four removable stainless steel mesh screens narcissus china with 355 125 63 and 43 μm apertures respectively the steel mesh screens were stacked and fastened on a self designed stainless steel support frame fig 2 the influents were collected after passing through a 2 cm coarse screening which was used to prevent larger debris blocking and damaging the pump the effluents were collected before discharging into the xiamen bay the flow rates were set in 10 20 l min and 6 20 l min for effluent and influent sampling respectively to ensure smooth filtering prior to taking samples the pump was on for several minutes to remove air from the pipe and to allow for a stable flow meanwhile the channel of pump flowmeter and hose were washed using onsite wastewater to eliminate background contamination subsequently samples passed through the steel mesh screens and the starting flow was immediately recorded using the fast digital camera canon eos 5d mark ⅲ japan to photograph the electromagnetic flowmeter generally 63 μm and 43 μm mesh screens were easily blocked by the highly concentrated organic matters in the influents thus visual check was needed when sampling once the mesh screens were blocked the hose was immediately removed from the steel mesh screens and the ending flow was quickly recorded using the fast digital camera the photographing can be completed in such a short time that may prevent the failure of sampling caused by the wastewater overflowing from the steel mesh screens the blocked mesh screens were removed and the unblocked ones were kept running as necessary following the same procedure table 1 shows that the sampling time is about 8 20 min for all samplings the volume of the sample is calculated by eq 1 and the results are showed in table 1 1 v i 1 n e n d i n g f l o w i s t a r t i n g f l o w i where v is the volume of sample n is the number of filtering per sample all materials on the steel mesh screen were immediately flushed into a 400 ml glass bottle with milli q water using a fine spray then the bottle was capped and brought to the laboratory for further analysis 2 3 sample processing materials in the bottle were transferred into a clean and dry 500 ml beaker residues in the bottle wall and cap were transferred into the beaker with milli q water using a fine spray the beaker was covered with aluminum foil to minimize the contamination the beaker was placed in a drying oven at 90 c for 24 h masura et al 2015 wet peroxide oxidation wpo was adopted to digest the labile organic materials in the samples which has been demonstrated as an effective way to extract the mps from the wastewater mason et al 2016 masura et al 2015 sutton et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 20 50 ml 30 hydrogen peroxide and an equal volume of 0 05 m feso4 solution were added to the beaker the mixture was heated at 60 70 c on a stirring hotplate super nuova thermo usa as some influents contained concentrated organic matters the drying and wpo processes were repeated 1 times as necessary after wpo 100 ml saturated sodium chloride solution 360 g l was transferred to a 500 ml separation funnel and left overnight for density separation the particles on the surface were vacuum filtered onto the qualitative filter paper with 9 cm in diameter and 15 20 μm in apertures model 102 new star china following which it was stored in a clean and dry glass petri dish 2 4 analysis first the representative particles were selected using a dissection microscope leica zoom 2000 10 5 45 objective germany after careful sorting of the shapes pellet fibers fragments granules color black yellow red blue green white and clear and quantity their type of polymer was identified using micro raman spectroscopy bruker senterra ii germany the selected particles cover as many shapes and colors as possible in particular the particles of the same color are selected as much as possible if the number of particles is 48 all particles are identified by micro raman spectroscopy if it is 48 24 48 particles were selected for micro raman spectroscopic measurement to ensure the representativeness of the detected particles the selection was made by two persons to reduce individual preferential bias all identified particles were collected and stored in clean centrifuge tubes for further use while other natural materials such as wood pieces and mineral particles were discarded due to numerous particles on the filter paper especially from the influent it was neither practical nor viable to identify all particles murphy et al 2016 it was therefore necessary to take subsamples from each filter paper as such 20 circles d 8 mm were counted per filter paper randomly under 40 magnification the microscope can exactly focus on the area of the circle the shapes color and quantity of all suspected mps in the 20 circles were estimated an averaged number of mps in the 20 circles was used to estimate the rest amount of mps on the whole filter paper the total counted area of 20 circles was 20 of effective area of the filter paper the total number of mps on each filter paper was calculated as follows 2 n a b 3 b c φ 4 c i 1 20 n i π d 2 20 π d 2 where n the total number of mps a the number of mps identified by micro raman spectroscopy b the number of mps estimated by statistical analysis c the number of remaining suspected mps on the filter paper φ the proportion of confirmed mps by micro raman spectroscopy n i the number of remaining suspected mps in each circle d the effective diameter of the filter paper in this study d 70 mm d the diameter of the circle d 8 mm micro raman spectroscopy has been proved as a reliable tool for identifying the type of polymer collard et al 2015 enders et al 2015 frère et al 2016 käppler et al 2015 oβmann et al 2017 robin lenz 2015 zhao et al 2017 with the aid of a dissection microscope the particles were selected and put on an alum ez spot micro mount p n 0042 545 thermo fisher scientific usa following which it was placed on the microscope stage for further measurement the measurements were performed with a 785 nm laser of 10 100 mw a 50 objective olympus japan with aperture of 50 1000 μm and a pectoral range of 400a 50 4280 cm 1 with a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 spectra were collected with 10 coadditions of an integration time of 1000 ms for each measurement selected linearly arranged or randomly arranged patterns were applied as the defining measurement points for a mapping measurement at least three points were measured to eliminate the influence of local impurities such as organic matters or mineral particles robin lenz 2015 all spectroscopic mapping measurement information including the snapshot and micro raman spectra was saved for spectrum search for the chemical fingerprints 2 5 quality assurance and quality control cares were taken during the field sampling and sample treatments to circumvent the contamination from the environment cotton laboratory coats masks and plastic free gloves were used throughout the entire sampling and laboratory processes before sampling steel mesh screens were rinsed three times using milli q water after sampling steel mesh screens were carefully washed three times using tap water and stored in a clean bucket additionally the pump flowmeter and connecting hose were flushed with tap water after each sampling to prevent cross contamination during the sampling process the effluent samples were collected first followed by the influent sampling to reduce the background residues in the sampling for collecting a blank sample pre cleaned steel mesh screens were placed on the ground at a sampling site for 20 min which were the maximum sampling time in this work table 1 then the four steel mesh screens were flushed three times with milli q water and the water was collected in a 400 ml glass bottle three blank samples were collected randomly to assess the atmospheric mps contamination at the sampling sites and to test the cleanliness of steel mesh screens before sampling for background correction the recovery experiment following the same procedure as wastewater sampling and processing was conducted and repeated three times using polystyrene ps microspheres with a diameter of 1000 μm ps150 k youngling tech china and 90 μm fluoresbrite yellow green microspheres usa to test the sample process efficiency the recovery rates of 1000 μm and 90 μm ps are 99 02 and 89 34 respectively which showed a good quality control during the experiment three blank samples are conducted as controls the results show that 6 4 and 2 particles are found in the three blanks respectively and only two of them are confirmed as polymers implying that contamination from the processes of sampling and experiment is negligible 3 results and discussion 3 1 method validation the combined use of an electromagnetic flowmeter and a digital camera improves the accuracy in recording sampling volume namely they can accurately capture a wide range of filtered volumes for different mesh screens from 2 98 l in 63 and 43 μm to 348 71 l in 355 and 125 μm table 1 the electromagnetic flowmeter is characteristic of no pressure loss good accuracy stable measurement wide rangeability perovic and higham 2002 it is widely used in the flow measurement of impurity rich wastewater with a certain conductivity and corrosion granata and de marinis 2017 watral et al 2015 the mean auditory reaction time of adult is 0 28 s shelton and kumar 2010 whereas the shutter speed of a fast digital camera can be set as fast as 1 200 s in this regard the recording of the starting or ending flow could be accomplished within 1 2 s or less without shutting off the ball valve or pump the flow error range in this way is estimated as about 1 2 ml s based on the maximum flow rate of 23 03 l min during the sampling process table 1 it not only meets the time requirement of the sampling procedure but also prevents an unacceptable flow error about 380 ml s under the same flow rate above that may be caused by shutting off the ball valve or pump our results table 1 consistent with previous studies mason et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b ziajahromi et al 2017 show that the volume of influent samples is commonly a few orders of magnitude lower than that of the effluent due to the high loading of organic matters in the influent the advantages of combined use of an electromagnetic flowmeter and a digital camera entail simple operation accurate measurement and wide flow range in the sampling process these are fully reflected during our sampling process especially for the influent sampling the combined use of an electromagnetic flowmeter and a digital camera requires good cooperation and coordination among field workers air bubbles should be eliminated before collecting samples as they may compromise the accuracy of the electromagnetic flowmeter 3 2 the abundance of mps a total of 1782 plastic like particles were analyzed using micro raman spectroscopy the results show that 62 68 of them n 1117 are identified as mps fig s1 eqs 3 and 4 estimate that the number of undetected plastic like particles remaining on the filter papers is 2125 34 12 of them n 725 are determined as mps therefore eq 2 gives the total number of identified mps of 1117 725 1842 in all samples our findings suggest that the abundance of mps of 43 μm in the studied wwtps is 1 57 13 69 items l in the influent with an average of 6 55 items l while it is 0 20 1 73 items l in the effluent with an average of 0 59 items l table 2 fig 3 in the ta and xa the influent sample volume is relatively small being 2 98 l and 4 48 l respectively table 1 this generates relatively high mps abundance being 13 69 items l and 9 68 items l respectively conversely the effluent sample volume in the hc and jm is relatively large with 348 71 l and 285 38 l respectively this gives the abundance of mps with 0 20 items l and 0 35 items l respectively the consistency in the sampling protocol for influent and effluent sampling ensures the data comparability and reliability which aids in the understanding of the ultimate fate of mps in the wwtps compared with previous studies on secondary treatment process of wwtps in different countries the mp concentration measured in the influent and effluent herein is at a moderate level table 3 although the maximum abundance of mps in the influent of the seven wwtps is 13 69 items l which is relatively lower than that in other studies for instance it was reported that the mps in the influent can reach up to 567 80 items l talvitie et al 2017b or even 7216 items l simon et al 2018 which is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that in our study the average mps concentration in the effluent in our study 0 59 items l table 2 is one order of magnitude higher than that in the usa 0 05 items l mason et al 2016 twice as high as that in the scotland 0 25 items l murphy et al 2016 comparable with that in the canada 0 53 items l gies et al 2018 and australia 0 48 items l ziajahromi et al 2017 however it is less than that in italy 0 90 items l magni et al 2019 and finland 1 43 items l talvitie et al 2017b there is a lack of harmonized sampling and processing methods in wwtps especially the sampling volumes and mesh sizes table 3 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017b ziajahromi et al 2016 comparison of the abundance and revomal rate of mps in different wwtps of different countries is not satisfactory however it provides us a strong implication on the role of wwtps as the source and sink of mps therefore developing a standard procedure for the mps sampling and processing in wwtps is recommended to prioritize in future work despite that wwtps in coastal cities of china play an important role in mitigating mps discharge into the sea there is still an estimated amount of mps with 6 50 108 items per day discharging from the seven wwtps into the xiamen bay based on the large effluent volume table s1 and the removal rate of mps the results suggest that wwtps could be an important sink as well as a significant point source of mps entering into the ocean mintenig et al 2017 and this gives us a wake up call that the mps in the effluent of wwtps cannot be neglected there is a highly linear correlation between mps abundance and ss concentration in the influent y 0 051x 3 62 r2 0 966 p 0 002 the mps abundance increases with ss concentration in the influent which may be due to that the majority of mps is contained in the ss table 2 fig 3a the linear relationship between mps and ss needs further field observations and experimental simulations to clarify and validate based on the correlation between mps and ss in the influent the abundance of mps can be estimated by measuring the concentration of ss in the influent the monitoring of ss is relatively easier and more time saving in contrast to the mps measurement this provides a potential alternative way in estimating the influent mps abundance of wwtps when direct measurement of mps in the influent is unavailable for some reasons in our study the concentration of mps in the qp site is estimated at 22 91 items l as shown by the gray bar in fig 3 a due to interference from a large number of organic pollutants two influent samples in the qp site formed dense foam in the process of repeated wpo digestion reducing the abundance of mps to 1 00 items l table 2 fig 3 by causing mps been wrapped and to stick to inner wall of the beaker avio et al 2015 mathalon and hill 2014 which may be an outlier therefore the predicted concentration of mps in the qp site influent using the method mentioned above may well reflect the actual value however it is impossible to establish a similar correlation between mps abundance and ss concentration in the effluent table 2 the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant in china gb 18918 2002 requires that the ss concentration in the effluent of wwtps should be less than 10 mg l thus the ss detection limit in the effluent lies in the level of mg l in china and no accurate measurement of ss concentration has been made the inaccurate data of ss in the effluent cannot better reflect the relationship with the mps than in the influent our results indicate that the mp concentration in the influent is in relation to the number of plastic related manufacturers in the xiamen area y 9 54x 46 49 r2 0 71 p 0 001 table s1 fig s2 though the seven studied wwtps receiving domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater both as shown in fig s2 the mp abundance in the influent of the wwtps increases as increasing number of plastics related manufacturers in the regions where the wwtps are located this suggests that plastic related industrial discharge may be main sources of mps in wwtps as an extensive economic growth in china mps are not well regulated in industrial wastewater therefore a large number of mps from plastic related manufacturers enter the wwtps through the sewage pipes this leads to the presence of a raised number of mps in the influent of wwtps around which there is a more concentrated plastic related industry for example about 163 and 315 plastic related manufacturers are located near ta and qp respectively and the corresponding concentrations of mps in the influent of ta and qp are 13 69 and 22 91 items l respectively in contrast less dense plastic related industry near hc and yd leads to smaller concentration of mps in the influent of hc and yd fig 3a table s1 furthermore we specifically analyzed the sources of the mps in the influent of the hc and found that they are collectively contributed from industrial and domestic wastewater the results show that mps concentration in the industrial wastewater 2 56 items l exhibits 1 8 times higher than that in the domestic one 1 44 items l fig 3c which further indicates that industrial wastewater plays a more important role in the mps flux into the influent of the wwtps unlike the influent the operating load rate of wwtps is one of the main factors influencing the concentration of mps in the effluent y 0 29x 0 78 r2 0 69 p 0 038 fig 3b shows that the mps concentration in the effluents increases with increasing operating load of the corresponding wwtps when the wwtps are in overloaded operation operating load rate above 1 the mps in the effluents are relatively more abundant for instance mps in the effluents of xl xa and qp are more concentrated than those in other wwtps fig 3b the mps in the effluent of qp are most abundant due to its highest operating load rate it is possible that mps are not the priority pollutants e g heavy metals nutrients chemical oxygen demand etc which the current wwtps operation is designed to remove as such full operation in the wwtps may not warrant a high mps removal conversely overloaded operation in wwtps shortens the hydraulic retention time and increases the flow rate of wastewater thereby reducing the time of wastewater in the grease removal stage murphy et al 2016 biofouling clark et al 2016 lusher 2015 and microbial degradation time it follows that the mps cannot be sufficiently removed by physical and biological processes which increase the concentration of mps in the effluent 3 3 the characteristics of mps fig 3 illustrates the shapes type of polymer and color of mps in the influent and effluent of the wwtps fig 4 a indicates that the most substantial proportion shapes of mps in the influent is granules 49 8 followed by fragments 30 0 fibers 17 7 and pellets 2 5 in the effluent the fractions of granules fibers fragments and pellets are 36 0 30 3 28 0 and 5 6 respectively proportions of granules and fragments decrease from 49 8 to 30 0 in the influent to 36 0 and 28 0 in the effluent respectively in contrast the percentage of fibers and pellets increases from 17 7 to 2 5 in the influent to 30 3 and 5 6 in the effluent respectively in the present study the proportion of pellets which are generally associated with cosmetic and personal care products cheung and fok 2017 is small while the proportions of granules and fragments which have a twisted curved character and are generally related to the commercial activity helm 2017 are large therefore we believe that mps in our study mainly come from industrial inputs rather than domestic sources fig 3c this is in good agreement with our earlier finding mentioned above that plastic industry near wwtps makes a significant contribution to the mps abundance of the investigated wwtps fig s2 in addition there is a lack of evidence correlating the mp concentrations with the population density this is consistent with mahon et al 2017 who claimed that there is no correlation between mp abundance and the population equivalents on the sludge for example population near yd is more than one million table s1 however the consequent concentration of mps in the influent of yd is the lowest in the seven studied wwtps and apparently the mps abundance in the yd is not directly affected by the large population it is clear that in a particular phase of economic development the amount of pollution produced per capita is relatively stable therefore the population density influences the flux of mps rather than the concentration of mps in the influent of wwtps the polymer type of mps in the influent and effluent is shown in fig 4 b in the influent the main type of polymer is polypropylene pp 30 2 followed by polyethylene pe 26 9 polystyrene ps 10 3 polyethylene terephthalate pet 7 5 ethylene propylene copolymer pe pp 6 3 propylene ethylene copolymer pp pe 5 1 polyether sulfone pes 3 3 and polyamide pa 0 3 in addition 9 9 of total mps are identified as other polymer materials which cannot be located in the micro raman spectra library such as demolib ramdemo ichem raman and raman organics in the effluent pp pe pp pe ps pet and pe pp account for 34 8 17 9 13 9 9 6 7 5 and 4 7 of the total mps respectively about 10 1 of particles are diagnosed as other polymer materials a slight change in the diversity of polymeric composition is observed for all the wwtps pp pe ps and pet dominate in the influent and effluent yet the proportion of polymer type differs in the various studied wwtps in china pe pp and ps are the main consumed type of polymer the annual consumption of them accounts for 22 6 19 4 and 3 3 of the total production of polymers in 2015 respectively china plastics processing industry association 2016 thus the plastic polymer consumption structure in china may mirror the polymer type in wwtps the white and clear mps account for 55 1 and 50 3 of the total mps in the influent and effluent and the other half is made up of black yellow red blue and green mps this indicates that white and clear is the primary colors of mps in wastewater fig 4 c our result is consistent with previous studies which reported that white and clear mps are more common than plastics of other colors li et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 a variety of colors except green are distributed evenly for the detected mps no significant change in the color diversity is observed by comparisons of color composition of mps in the influent and effluent this suggests that wastewater treatment processes play a minor role in the mps colors it is interesting that our micro raman spectroscopic analysis shows that only 27 1 of black and 21 5 of yellow particles are confirmed as mps which implies that the majority of the black and yellow particles may be misidentified as mps by visual observation in contrast about 54 6 80 2 of the particles with other colors are detected as mps fig s3 rendering a relatively small misidentification rate during visual classification this suggests that caution is required when processing mps samples of various colors in the future study the dominant size of mps in the influent is 63 125 μm which represents 43 5 of the total mps followed by the ones with 43 63 μm and 355 μm accounting for 23 7 and 12 1 of the total mps fig 4 d fig s4 respectively in the effluent mps with 355 μm 125 355 μm and 43 63 μm account for 28 3 29 4 and 14 4 of the total mps respectively relative to mps size in the influent proportions of large sized mps with 355 μm and 125 355 μm increase in the effluent by comparison the percentage of small sized mps with 43 63 μm undergoes a significant drop from 23 7 in the influent to 14 4 in the effluent large variations of large sized mps with 63 125 μm are observed in different sites fig 4 d fig s4 3 4 the removal rate of mps our results show that the mps removal by the seven wwtps is 79 33 97 84 with a mean value of 90 52 table 2 which is lower than those in countries e g canada scotland and finland gies et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b and higher than those in australia and italy magni et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2017 as mps are an emerging class of contaminants current secondary treatment process of wwtps are not specifically designed to eliminate mps the average removal rate of mps in the seven wwtps is not efficient enough comparing with the tertiary advanced treatment processes such as membrane bio reactor post filtration rapid sand filtration whose removal efficiency for mps can reach 97 99 9 mintenig et al 2017 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017a however some studies reported that tertiary treatment process has no effect on reducing mps concentration talvitie et al 2017b the removal of mps by the secondary treatment is a complex process which is not only affected by the process designs of the wwtps but also associated with the physical and chemical properties of mps even the same sampling and experimental protocols are used in this study the removal efficiency of mps in different wwtps varies greatly table 2 previous studies showed that the removal rate of mps by the secondary treatment process ranges from 64 to 99 56 magni et al 2019 talvitie et al 2017b regardless of differences in sampling and experimental methods in our study the influence of particle size type of polymer shape and color of mps on its removal rate in wwtps is evaluated fig 5 a suggests that the removal rate of mps increases with decreasing size the average removal rates of the small mps with 63 125 μm and 43 63 μm are 95 1 and 95 5 respectively in contrast the large mps with 355 μm and 125 355 μm show lower average removal rate of 78 5 and 80 5 respectively the higher removal rate of smaller sized mps may be due to their short residence time caused by the fast fragmentation and degradation rates this dovetails in nicely with earlier studies which report that small mps fragment and degrade faster than the large ones so that the small mps has a lower residence time than larger plastic debris in the ocean surface layer enders et al 2015 moreover the small mps are more likely to get aggregated van leussen 1988 and settled into the sludge so quickly that the vertical distribution of mps increases as their size decreases enders et al 2015 nevertheless the large mps may be removed from the wastewater mainly through biofouling and fragmentation both of which need sufficient time the wwtps processes may provide insufficient time for high and complete removal of large sized mps therefore discrepancies in the removal mechanisms of mps with various sizes may be responsible for different removal rates of mps fig 5 b 5 d also show that the effects of polymer type shapes and color of mps on its removal rate the density of pp pe ps and pet the four dominant types of polymer in wwtps are 0 91 0 91 0 97 1 05 and 1 37 g cm3 respectively and the corresponding mean removal rate are 92 0 87 8 94 8 96 4 respectively fig 5 b this indicates that the mps removal rate increases with increasing density the removal rate of pe like its density fluctuates within a larger range than other three polymers the density of the polymer plays an important role in its rising or sinking velocity in the environmental matrix ballent et al 2013 mps which are denser than wastewater e g pet are easily removed from wastewater by physical sedimentation thus exhibiting higher removal efficiency however the low density mps e g pp pe and the moderate density mps e g ps will float at the surface of wastewater or suspend in the wastewater column thus relatively fewer mps of these classes are captured by the ss and eventually removed in addition the wastewater is rich in nitrogen phosphorus and microbes those mps with low density preferentially attract the encrusting foulants which have a ballasting effect increasing their specific density as neutrally drifting or slowly sinking particles cózar et al 2014 porter et al 2018 the mps settled in the sludge especially the low density ones may get resuspended to the wastewater column or surface under the turbulent mixing action but still show a net output state from the wastewater ballent et al 2013 lattin et al 2004 the average removal rate of fibers pellets fragments and granules are 78 9 82 8 91 3 and 91 4 respectively fig 5 c this indicates that the wwtps are more effective in eliminating fragments and granules than fibers and pellets to some extent it can be partly explained by the morphology of mps the surface of fibers and pellets is relatively smooth which makes them have less resistance in the wastewater column this is consistent with that mps fibers have a roughly smooth and non weathered surface via scanning electron microscopic images anderson et al 2018 however fragments and granules often have angular and bifurcate some even have twisted curved character helm 2017 which makes them easily captured during the skimming and sedimentation processes in wwtps at the same time the complex morphology of fragments and granules is conducive to the colonization of microbes and increases the degree of biofouling this causes sedimentation or degradation thus facilitating the removal from the wastewater for example fibers have a high length to width ratio in morphology ziajahromi et al 2017 which allows them to pass through small pore sizes more easily than other shapes talvitie et al 2017a in our study the abundance of fibers in the influent is 17 7 and it is significantly increased to 30 4 in the effluent fig 4 a confirming that wwtps is ineffective in removing fibers claessens et al 2013 found that the fiber capture rate is lower than that of microspheres in the laboratory simulation study our results are in agreement with that fibers are the dominant species of mps in the freshwater and treated wastewater eerkes medrano et al 2015 primpke et al 2017 sutton et al 2016 wang et al 2017 however the color difference of mps has no obvious influence on its removal rate in wwtps from fig 5 d we find that the yellow mps show a relatively stable removal rate but the influence of other colors on it in wwtps is not remarkable this suggests that the color diversity may not cause the differences in mps buoyancy sedimentation biofouling and fragmentation in wwtps 4 conclusions the abundance characteristics and removal of mps in the influent and the effluent and its influencing factors in wwtps were studied by analyzing 60 samples from the seven wwtps in a coastal city of china mps sampling is improved using an electromagnetic flowmeter and a fast digital camera differences in shapes sizes and types of the mps have a profound influence on their fate in wwtps wwtps play an important role in reducing the urban mp pollutants entering the aquatic environment but there are still a large number of mps from wwtps releasing into the ocean the operating load of the wwtps has a great influence on the mp removal rate which is reduced under the overloaded operation the results may provide technical support to improve the operation and management of wwtps in coastal cities in china thus assisting in the prevention and control of mp pollution in coastal waters the migration and transformation behaviors of mps in the environment become complicated by multiple factors and complex wang et al 2016 thus future work could be focused on the comprehensive mechanism of the influences of characteristics of mps such as morphology type of polymer particle size and density on its fate in wwtps acknowledgments this study was supported by grants

18941,studying the abundance characteristics and removal of microplastics mps in wastewater treatment plants wwtps in coastal cities is of great significance for understanding the impacts of human activities on the marine environment but currently little information on this topic is available in china therefore the abundance characteristics and removal of mps in seven wwtps of xiamen a typical coastal city in china are studied sixty samples were collected using an improved sampling method involving an electromagnetic flowmeter and a fast digital camera the influent mps concentration is 1 57 13 69 items l and it is reduced to 0 20 1 73 items l in the effluent indicating that 79 3 97 8 mps is removed based on the daily effluent discharge and mps removal rate it is estimated that 6 5 108 mps are released from the seven wwtps into the xiamen bay each day the light microscopic and micro raman spectroscopic analysis indicates that 62 68 of particles are plastic polymers including polypropylene 31 6 polyethylene 21 9 polystyrene 10 1 propylene ethylene copolymer 9 2 and polyethylene terephthalate 7 5 the color of mps is mainly composed of white 27 3 and clears 25 8 our results show that granules 41 1 are the dominant shape of mps followed by fragments 31 3 fibers 23 7 and pellet 3 9 the characteristics of mps such as sizes shapes and types affect the mps removal in wwtps our findings show that mps concentration in the influent is positively correlated with the suspended solids ss however in the effluent it is associated with the wwtps operating load as reflected by obviously higher mp abundance in overloaded ones graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment plant microplastic abundance characteristics removal 1 introduction microplastics mps are defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm in diameter arthur et al 2009 law and thompson 2014 focuses have been on the small plastic particle pollution in the ocean since the 1970s carpenter et al 1972 carpenter and smith 1972 wong et al 1974 however the attention wasn t paid on the distribution and ecological impacts of the tiny plastic particles in the marine environment until thompson et al 2004 first proposed the term microplastic in 2004 recently mounting mps studies have been focused on the freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems rochman 2018 since 80 of the plastics in the ocean come from lands andrady 2011 frias et al 2016 mps have been concentrated in the coastal regions where is mainly influenced by plastic debris input from terrestrial sources desforges et al 2014 frias et al 2014 the land derived plastics enter the coastal waters through rivers wastewater pipes or rainwater scouring and wind action jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 ryan et al 2009 in particular mps from industrial and domestic products for instance surfaces of buildings and facial cleansers that use mps as abrasive scrubbers are likely to get transported through wastewater treatment plants wwtps ending up in aquatic environments browne 2015 browne et al 2007 gies et al 2018 and it may lead to further contamination prata 2018 in coastal cities most wastewater effluents directly discharge into the adjacent coastal waters rendering one of the significant land based point sources of mps the coast of china has become one of the most mps polluted regions across the world lebreton et al 2017 sherman and van sebille 2016 in mainland china there are 3340 operational wwtps 56 07 of which n 1873 are located in coastal regions with an actual treatment capacity of 0 78 108 m3 d jin et al 2014 however little research has been done on the abundance characteristics and removal of mps in wwtps in china especially in coastal regions only a few studies on the estimated emission of plastic microbeads cheung and fok 2017 and mps in sewage sludge from the wwtps li et al 2018 are available most prior studies were concerned about mps loadings in the effluent of wwtps and then confirmed wwtps as one mps source in the receiving environment gies et al 2018 mason et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 sutton et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017a ziajahromi et al 2016 2017 however the abundance and characteristics of mps in the influent have an essential implication of the urban mps pollution loadings and sources as such it is worthwhile to study the mps abundance and characteristics both in the influent and effluent of wwtps to acquire holistic baseline understandings and behaviors of mps in wwtps mason et al 2016 raju et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2016 due to facile blockage of sampling screens by the massive amount of organic pollutants in the influent it is a challenge to collect a sufficient volume of influent samples talvitie et al 2015 2017b the volume of the influent samples is generally several orders of magnitude lower than that of the effluent the discrepancy in the sampling volume between influents and effluents may lead to underestimation of mps abundance in the influent currently wastewater is commonly sampled using submersible pumps carr et al 2016 mason et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 or plastic free grab samplers magni et al 2019 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b in some studies non plastic grab samplers were used for taking influents while pumps were used for effluent sampling talvitie et al 2017b different sampling gears used for influent and effluent sampling in one study may result in incomparability in final results to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of a sampling approach effective in capturing a sufficient volume of influent and effluent samples as well as accurate sample volume recording to this end the sampling in this study is optimized by combining an electromagnetic flowmeter and a fast digital camera this study aims to investigate the abundance characteristics and behaviors of mps in the influents and effluents from seven wwtps in xiamen city the removal rate of mps and treatment efficiency of wwtps are evaluated furthermore mps flux entering into the xiamen bay following wastewater treatment is estimated additionally sources of mps in the influents and effluent are analyzed to gain an overview of the mp fate in wwtps 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling sites xiamen a typical coastal city is located in the southeast of china facing taiwan across the strait fig 1 as a special economic zone in china xiamen is famous as a harbor city and a tourism destination there are seven secondary wwtps in xiamen treating domestic wastewater generated by 3 5 million people in the six urban districts table s1 and undertaking industrial wastewater that has been preliminarily treated in the industrial plans the effluents of wwtps are discharged into the xiamen bay directly for the hc plant 60 and 40 of the influent is contributed by industrial wastewater and domestic wastewater respectively as such samples of industrial and domestic wastewater were collected at the influent of hc in total 60 samples were collected from the influents n 32 and effluents n 28 of the seven wwtps table 1 2 2 sampling the sampling was conducted in the seven wwtps from september 18 to 20 2017 a multi use pump newa nj4500 italy connecting to an intelligent electromagnetic flowmeter sin ldg dn20 flow range 2 180 226 l min error range 0 3 china through the hose was used for sampling fig 2 the influent effluent samples were filtered under gravity by passing through four removable stainless steel mesh screens narcissus china with 355 125 63 and 43 μm apertures respectively the steel mesh screens were stacked and fastened on a self designed stainless steel support frame fig 2 the influents were collected after passing through a 2 cm coarse screening which was used to prevent larger debris blocking and damaging the pump the effluents were collected before discharging into the xiamen bay the flow rates were set in 10 20 l min and 6 20 l min for effluent and influent sampling respectively to ensure smooth filtering prior to taking samples the pump was on for several minutes to remove air from the pipe and to allow for a stable flow meanwhile the channel of pump flowmeter and hose were washed using onsite wastewater to eliminate background contamination subsequently samples passed through the steel mesh screens and the starting flow was immediately recorded using the fast digital camera canon eos 5d mark ⅲ japan to photograph the electromagnetic flowmeter generally 63 μm and 43 μm mesh screens were easily blocked by the highly concentrated organic matters in the influents thus visual check was needed when sampling once the mesh screens were blocked the hose was immediately removed from the steel mesh screens and the ending flow was quickly recorded using the fast digital camera the photographing can be completed in such a short time that may prevent the failure of sampling caused by the wastewater overflowing from the steel mesh screens the blocked mesh screens were removed and the unblocked ones were kept running as necessary following the same procedure table 1 shows that the sampling time is about 8 20 min for all samplings the volume of the sample is calculated by eq 1 and the results are showed in table 1 1 v i 1 n e n d i n g f l o w i s t a r t i n g f l o w i where v is the volume of sample n is the number of filtering per sample all materials on the steel mesh screen were immediately flushed into a 400 ml glass bottle with milli q water using a fine spray then the bottle was capped and brought to the laboratory for further analysis 2 3 sample processing materials in the bottle were transferred into a clean and dry 500 ml beaker residues in the bottle wall and cap were transferred into the beaker with milli q water using a fine spray the beaker was covered with aluminum foil to minimize the contamination the beaker was placed in a drying oven at 90 c for 24 h masura et al 2015 wet peroxide oxidation wpo was adopted to digest the labile organic materials in the samples which has been demonstrated as an effective way to extract the mps from the wastewater mason et al 2016 masura et al 2015 sutton et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 20 50 ml 30 hydrogen peroxide and an equal volume of 0 05 m feso4 solution were added to the beaker the mixture was heated at 60 70 c on a stirring hotplate super nuova thermo usa as some influents contained concentrated organic matters the drying and wpo processes were repeated 1 times as necessary after wpo 100 ml saturated sodium chloride solution 360 g l was transferred to a 500 ml separation funnel and left overnight for density separation the particles on the surface were vacuum filtered onto the qualitative filter paper with 9 cm in diameter and 15 20 μm in apertures model 102 new star china following which it was stored in a clean and dry glass petri dish 2 4 analysis first the representative particles were selected using a dissection microscope leica zoom 2000 10 5 45 objective germany after careful sorting of the shapes pellet fibers fragments granules color black yellow red blue green white and clear and quantity their type of polymer was identified using micro raman spectroscopy bruker senterra ii germany the selected particles cover as many shapes and colors as possible in particular the particles of the same color are selected as much as possible if the number of particles is 48 all particles are identified by micro raman spectroscopy if it is 48 24 48 particles were selected for micro raman spectroscopic measurement to ensure the representativeness of the detected particles the selection was made by two persons to reduce individual preferential bias all identified particles were collected and stored in clean centrifuge tubes for further use while other natural materials such as wood pieces and mineral particles were discarded due to numerous particles on the filter paper especially from the influent it was neither practical nor viable to identify all particles murphy et al 2016 it was therefore necessary to take subsamples from each filter paper as such 20 circles d 8 mm were counted per filter paper randomly under 40 magnification the microscope can exactly focus on the area of the circle the shapes color and quantity of all suspected mps in the 20 circles were estimated an averaged number of mps in the 20 circles was used to estimate the rest amount of mps on the whole filter paper the total counted area of 20 circles was 20 of effective area of the filter paper the total number of mps on each filter paper was calculated as follows 2 n a b 3 b c φ 4 c i 1 20 n i π d 2 20 π d 2 where n the total number of mps a the number of mps identified by micro raman spectroscopy b the number of mps estimated by statistical analysis c the number of remaining suspected mps on the filter paper φ the proportion of confirmed mps by micro raman spectroscopy n i the number of remaining suspected mps in each circle d the effective diameter of the filter paper in this study d 70 mm d the diameter of the circle d 8 mm micro raman spectroscopy has been proved as a reliable tool for identifying the type of polymer collard et al 2015 enders et al 2015 frère et al 2016 käppler et al 2015 oβmann et al 2017 robin lenz 2015 zhao et al 2017 with the aid of a dissection microscope the particles were selected and put on an alum ez spot micro mount p n 0042 545 thermo fisher scientific usa following which it was placed on the microscope stage for further measurement the measurements were performed with a 785 nm laser of 10 100 mw a 50 objective olympus japan with aperture of 50 1000 μm and a pectoral range of 400a 50 4280 cm 1 with a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 spectra were collected with 10 coadditions of an integration time of 1000 ms for each measurement selected linearly arranged or randomly arranged patterns were applied as the defining measurement points for a mapping measurement at least three points were measured to eliminate the influence of local impurities such as organic matters or mineral particles robin lenz 2015 all spectroscopic mapping measurement information including the snapshot and micro raman spectra was saved for spectrum search for the chemical fingerprints 2 5 quality assurance and quality control cares were taken during the field sampling and sample treatments to circumvent the contamination from the environment cotton laboratory coats masks and plastic free gloves were used throughout the entire sampling and laboratory processes before sampling steel mesh screens were rinsed three times using milli q water after sampling steel mesh screens were carefully washed three times using tap water and stored in a clean bucket additionally the pump flowmeter and connecting hose were flushed with tap water after each sampling to prevent cross contamination during the sampling process the effluent samples were collected first followed by the influent sampling to reduce the background residues in the sampling for collecting a blank sample pre cleaned steel mesh screens were placed on the ground at a sampling site for 20 min which were the maximum sampling time in this work table 1 then the four steel mesh screens were flushed three times with milli q water and the water was collected in a 400 ml glass bottle three blank samples were collected randomly to assess the atmospheric mps contamination at the sampling sites and to test the cleanliness of steel mesh screens before sampling for background correction the recovery experiment following the same procedure as wastewater sampling and processing was conducted and repeated three times using polystyrene ps microspheres with a diameter of 1000 μm ps150 k youngling tech china and 90 μm fluoresbrite yellow green microspheres usa to test the sample process efficiency the recovery rates of 1000 μm and 90 μm ps are 99 02 and 89 34 respectively which showed a good quality control during the experiment three blank samples are conducted as controls the results show that 6 4 and 2 particles are found in the three blanks respectively and only two of them are confirmed as polymers implying that contamination from the processes of sampling and experiment is negligible 3 results and discussion 3 1 method validation the combined use of an electromagnetic flowmeter and a digital camera improves the accuracy in recording sampling volume namely they can accurately capture a wide range of filtered volumes for different mesh screens from 2 98 l in 63 and 43 μm to 348 71 l in 355 and 125 μm table 1 the electromagnetic flowmeter is characteristic of no pressure loss good accuracy stable measurement wide rangeability perovic and higham 2002 it is widely used in the flow measurement of impurity rich wastewater with a certain conductivity and corrosion granata and de marinis 2017 watral et al 2015 the mean auditory reaction time of adult is 0 28 s shelton and kumar 2010 whereas the shutter speed of a fast digital camera can be set as fast as 1 200 s in this regard the recording of the starting or ending flow could be accomplished within 1 2 s or less without shutting off the ball valve or pump the flow error range in this way is estimated as about 1 2 ml s based on the maximum flow rate of 23 03 l min during the sampling process table 1 it not only meets the time requirement of the sampling procedure but also prevents an unacceptable flow error about 380 ml s under the same flow rate above that may be caused by shutting off the ball valve or pump our results table 1 consistent with previous studies mason et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b ziajahromi et al 2017 show that the volume of influent samples is commonly a few orders of magnitude lower than that of the effluent due to the high loading of organic matters in the influent the advantages of combined use of an electromagnetic flowmeter and a digital camera entail simple operation accurate measurement and wide flow range in the sampling process these are fully reflected during our sampling process especially for the influent sampling the combined use of an electromagnetic flowmeter and a digital camera requires good cooperation and coordination among field workers air bubbles should be eliminated before collecting samples as they may compromise the accuracy of the electromagnetic flowmeter 3 2 the abundance of mps a total of 1782 plastic like particles were analyzed using micro raman spectroscopy the results show that 62 68 of them n 1117 are identified as mps fig s1 eqs 3 and 4 estimate that the number of undetected plastic like particles remaining on the filter papers is 2125 34 12 of them n 725 are determined as mps therefore eq 2 gives the total number of identified mps of 1117 725 1842 in all samples our findings suggest that the abundance of mps of 43 μm in the studied wwtps is 1 57 13 69 items l in the influent with an average of 6 55 items l while it is 0 20 1 73 items l in the effluent with an average of 0 59 items l table 2 fig 3 in the ta and xa the influent sample volume is relatively small being 2 98 l and 4 48 l respectively table 1 this generates relatively high mps abundance being 13 69 items l and 9 68 items l respectively conversely the effluent sample volume in the hc and jm is relatively large with 348 71 l and 285 38 l respectively this gives the abundance of mps with 0 20 items l and 0 35 items l respectively the consistency in the sampling protocol for influent and effluent sampling ensures the data comparability and reliability which aids in the understanding of the ultimate fate of mps in the wwtps compared with previous studies on secondary treatment process of wwtps in different countries the mp concentration measured in the influent and effluent herein is at a moderate level table 3 although the maximum abundance of mps in the influent of the seven wwtps is 13 69 items l which is relatively lower than that in other studies for instance it was reported that the mps in the influent can reach up to 567 80 items l talvitie et al 2017b or even 7216 items l simon et al 2018 which is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that in our study the average mps concentration in the effluent in our study 0 59 items l table 2 is one order of magnitude higher than that in the usa 0 05 items l mason et al 2016 twice as high as that in the scotland 0 25 items l murphy et al 2016 comparable with that in the canada 0 53 items l gies et al 2018 and australia 0 48 items l ziajahromi et al 2017 however it is less than that in italy 0 90 items l magni et al 2019 and finland 1 43 items l talvitie et al 2017b there is a lack of harmonized sampling and processing methods in wwtps especially the sampling volumes and mesh sizes table 3 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017b ziajahromi et al 2016 comparison of the abundance and revomal rate of mps in different wwtps of different countries is not satisfactory however it provides us a strong implication on the role of wwtps as the source and sink of mps therefore developing a standard procedure for the mps sampling and processing in wwtps is recommended to prioritize in future work despite that wwtps in coastal cities of china play an important role in mitigating mps discharge into the sea there is still an estimated amount of mps with 6 50 108 items per day discharging from the seven wwtps into the xiamen bay based on the large effluent volume table s1 and the removal rate of mps the results suggest that wwtps could be an important sink as well as a significant point source of mps entering into the ocean mintenig et al 2017 and this gives us a wake up call that the mps in the effluent of wwtps cannot be neglected there is a highly linear correlation between mps abundance and ss concentration in the influent y 0 051x 3 62 r2 0 966 p 0 002 the mps abundance increases with ss concentration in the influent which may be due to that the majority of mps is contained in the ss table 2 fig 3a the linear relationship between mps and ss needs further field observations and experimental simulations to clarify and validate based on the correlation between mps and ss in the influent the abundance of mps can be estimated by measuring the concentration of ss in the influent the monitoring of ss is relatively easier and more time saving in contrast to the mps measurement this provides a potential alternative way in estimating the influent mps abundance of wwtps when direct measurement of mps in the influent is unavailable for some reasons in our study the concentration of mps in the qp site is estimated at 22 91 items l as shown by the gray bar in fig 3 a due to interference from a large number of organic pollutants two influent samples in the qp site formed dense foam in the process of repeated wpo digestion reducing the abundance of mps to 1 00 items l table 2 fig 3 by causing mps been wrapped and to stick to inner wall of the beaker avio et al 2015 mathalon and hill 2014 which may be an outlier therefore the predicted concentration of mps in the qp site influent using the method mentioned above may well reflect the actual value however it is impossible to establish a similar correlation between mps abundance and ss concentration in the effluent table 2 the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant in china gb 18918 2002 requires that the ss concentration in the effluent of wwtps should be less than 10 mg l thus the ss detection limit in the effluent lies in the level of mg l in china and no accurate measurement of ss concentration has been made the inaccurate data of ss in the effluent cannot better reflect the relationship with the mps than in the influent our results indicate that the mp concentration in the influent is in relation to the number of plastic related manufacturers in the xiamen area y 9 54x 46 49 r2 0 71 p 0 001 table s1 fig s2 though the seven studied wwtps receiving domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater both as shown in fig s2 the mp abundance in the influent of the wwtps increases as increasing number of plastics related manufacturers in the regions where the wwtps are located this suggests that plastic related industrial discharge may be main sources of mps in wwtps as an extensive economic growth in china mps are not well regulated in industrial wastewater therefore a large number of mps from plastic related manufacturers enter the wwtps through the sewage pipes this leads to the presence of a raised number of mps in the influent of wwtps around which there is a more concentrated plastic related industry for example about 163 and 315 plastic related manufacturers are located near ta and qp respectively and the corresponding concentrations of mps in the influent of ta and qp are 13 69 and 22 91 items l respectively in contrast less dense plastic related industry near hc and yd leads to smaller concentration of mps in the influent of hc and yd fig 3a table s1 furthermore we specifically analyzed the sources of the mps in the influent of the hc and found that they are collectively contributed from industrial and domestic wastewater the results show that mps concentration in the industrial wastewater 2 56 items l exhibits 1 8 times higher than that in the domestic one 1 44 items l fig 3c which further indicates that industrial wastewater plays a more important role in the mps flux into the influent of the wwtps unlike the influent the operating load rate of wwtps is one of the main factors influencing the concentration of mps in the effluent y 0 29x 0 78 r2 0 69 p 0 038 fig 3b shows that the mps concentration in the effluents increases with increasing operating load of the corresponding wwtps when the wwtps are in overloaded operation operating load rate above 1 the mps in the effluents are relatively more abundant for instance mps in the effluents of xl xa and qp are more concentrated than those in other wwtps fig 3b the mps in the effluent of qp are most abundant due to its highest operating load rate it is possible that mps are not the priority pollutants e g heavy metals nutrients chemical oxygen demand etc which the current wwtps operation is designed to remove as such full operation in the wwtps may not warrant a high mps removal conversely overloaded operation in wwtps shortens the hydraulic retention time and increases the flow rate of wastewater thereby reducing the time of wastewater in the grease removal stage murphy et al 2016 biofouling clark et al 2016 lusher 2015 and microbial degradation time it follows that the mps cannot be sufficiently removed by physical and biological processes which increase the concentration of mps in the effluent 3 3 the characteristics of mps fig 3 illustrates the shapes type of polymer and color of mps in the influent and effluent of the wwtps fig 4 a indicates that the most substantial proportion shapes of mps in the influent is granules 49 8 followed by fragments 30 0 fibers 17 7 and pellets 2 5 in the effluent the fractions of granules fibers fragments and pellets are 36 0 30 3 28 0 and 5 6 respectively proportions of granules and fragments decrease from 49 8 to 30 0 in the influent to 36 0 and 28 0 in the effluent respectively in contrast the percentage of fibers and pellets increases from 17 7 to 2 5 in the influent to 30 3 and 5 6 in the effluent respectively in the present study the proportion of pellets which are generally associated with cosmetic and personal care products cheung and fok 2017 is small while the proportions of granules and fragments which have a twisted curved character and are generally related to the commercial activity helm 2017 are large therefore we believe that mps in our study mainly come from industrial inputs rather than domestic sources fig 3c this is in good agreement with our earlier finding mentioned above that plastic industry near wwtps makes a significant contribution to the mps abundance of the investigated wwtps fig s2 in addition there is a lack of evidence correlating the mp concentrations with the population density this is consistent with mahon et al 2017 who claimed that there is no correlation between mp abundance and the population equivalents on the sludge for example population near yd is more than one million table s1 however the consequent concentration of mps in the influent of yd is the lowest in the seven studied wwtps and apparently the mps abundance in the yd is not directly affected by the large population it is clear that in a particular phase of economic development the amount of pollution produced per capita is relatively stable therefore the population density influences the flux of mps rather than the concentration of mps in the influent of wwtps the polymer type of mps in the influent and effluent is shown in fig 4 b in the influent the main type of polymer is polypropylene pp 30 2 followed by polyethylene pe 26 9 polystyrene ps 10 3 polyethylene terephthalate pet 7 5 ethylene propylene copolymer pe pp 6 3 propylene ethylene copolymer pp pe 5 1 polyether sulfone pes 3 3 and polyamide pa 0 3 in addition 9 9 of total mps are identified as other polymer materials which cannot be located in the micro raman spectra library such as demolib ramdemo ichem raman and raman organics in the effluent pp pe pp pe ps pet and pe pp account for 34 8 17 9 13 9 9 6 7 5 and 4 7 of the total mps respectively about 10 1 of particles are diagnosed as other polymer materials a slight change in the diversity of polymeric composition is observed for all the wwtps pp pe ps and pet dominate in the influent and effluent yet the proportion of polymer type differs in the various studied wwtps in china pe pp and ps are the main consumed type of polymer the annual consumption of them accounts for 22 6 19 4 and 3 3 of the total production of polymers in 2015 respectively china plastics processing industry association 2016 thus the plastic polymer consumption structure in china may mirror the polymer type in wwtps the white and clear mps account for 55 1 and 50 3 of the total mps in the influent and effluent and the other half is made up of black yellow red blue and green mps this indicates that white and clear is the primary colors of mps in wastewater fig 4 c our result is consistent with previous studies which reported that white and clear mps are more common than plastics of other colors li et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 a variety of colors except green are distributed evenly for the detected mps no significant change in the color diversity is observed by comparisons of color composition of mps in the influent and effluent this suggests that wastewater treatment processes play a minor role in the mps colors it is interesting that our micro raman spectroscopic analysis shows that only 27 1 of black and 21 5 of yellow particles are confirmed as mps which implies that the majority of the black and yellow particles may be misidentified as mps by visual observation in contrast about 54 6 80 2 of the particles with other colors are detected as mps fig s3 rendering a relatively small misidentification rate during visual classification this suggests that caution is required when processing mps samples of various colors in the future study the dominant size of mps in the influent is 63 125 μm which represents 43 5 of the total mps followed by the ones with 43 63 μm and 355 μm accounting for 23 7 and 12 1 of the total mps fig 4 d fig s4 respectively in the effluent mps with 355 μm 125 355 μm and 43 63 μm account for 28 3 29 4 and 14 4 of the total mps respectively relative to mps size in the influent proportions of large sized mps with 355 μm and 125 355 μm increase in the effluent by comparison the percentage of small sized mps with 43 63 μm undergoes a significant drop from 23 7 in the influent to 14 4 in the effluent large variations of large sized mps with 63 125 μm are observed in different sites fig 4 d fig s4 3 4 the removal rate of mps our results show that the mps removal by the seven wwtps is 79 33 97 84 with a mean value of 90 52 table 2 which is lower than those in countries e g canada scotland and finland gies et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b and higher than those in australia and italy magni et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2017 as mps are an emerging class of contaminants current secondary treatment process of wwtps are not specifically designed to eliminate mps the average removal rate of mps in the seven wwtps is not efficient enough comparing with the tertiary advanced treatment processes such as membrane bio reactor post filtration rapid sand filtration whose removal efficiency for mps can reach 97 99 9 mintenig et al 2017 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017a however some studies reported that tertiary treatment process has no effect on reducing mps concentration talvitie et al 2017b the removal of mps by the secondary treatment is a complex process which is not only affected by the process designs of the wwtps but also associated with the physical and chemical properties of mps even the same sampling and experimental protocols are used in this study the removal efficiency of mps in different wwtps varies greatly table 2 previous studies showed that the removal rate of mps by the secondary treatment process ranges from 64 to 99 56 magni et al 2019 talvitie et al 2017b regardless of differences in sampling and experimental methods in our study the influence of particle size type of polymer shape and color of mps on its removal rate in wwtps is evaluated fig 5 a suggests that the removal rate of mps increases with decreasing size the average removal rates of the small mps with 63 125 μm and 43 63 μm are 95 1 and 95 5 respectively in contrast the large mps with 355 μm and 125 355 μm show lower average removal rate of 78 5 and 80 5 respectively the higher removal rate of smaller sized mps may be due to their short residence time caused by the fast fragmentation and degradation rates this dovetails in nicely with earlier studies which report that small mps fragment and degrade faster than the large ones so that the small mps has a lower residence time than larger plastic debris in the ocean surface layer enders et al 2015 moreover the small mps are more likely to get aggregated van leussen 1988 and settled into the sludge so quickly that the vertical distribution of mps increases as their size decreases enders et al 2015 nevertheless the large mps may be removed from the wastewater mainly through biofouling and fragmentation both of which need sufficient time the wwtps processes may provide insufficient time for high and complete removal of large sized mps therefore discrepancies in the removal mechanisms of mps with various sizes may be responsible for different removal rates of mps fig 5 b 5 d also show that the effects of polymer type shapes and color of mps on its removal rate the density of pp pe ps and pet the four dominant types of polymer in wwtps are 0 91 0 91 0 97 1 05 and 1 37 g cm3 respectively and the corresponding mean removal rate are 92 0 87 8 94 8 96 4 respectively fig 5 b this indicates that the mps removal rate increases with increasing density the removal rate of pe like its density fluctuates within a larger range than other three polymers the density of the polymer plays an important role in its rising or sinking velocity in the environmental matrix ballent et al 2013 mps which are denser than wastewater e g pet are easily removed from wastewater by physical sedimentation thus exhibiting higher removal efficiency however the low density mps e g pp pe and the moderate density mps e g ps will float at the surface of wastewater or suspend in the wastewater column thus relatively fewer mps of these classes are captured by the ss and eventually removed in addition the wastewater is rich in nitrogen phosphorus and microbes those mps with low density preferentially attract the encrusting foulants which have a ballasting effect increasing their specific density as neutrally drifting or slowly sinking particles cózar et al 2014 porter et al 2018 the mps settled in the sludge especially the low density ones may get resuspended to the wastewater column or surface under the turbulent mixing action but still show a net output state from the wastewater ballent et al 2013 lattin et al 2004 the average removal rate of fibers pellets fragments and granules are 78 9 82 8 91 3 and 91 4 respectively fig 5 c this indicates that the wwtps are more effective in eliminating fragments and granules than fibers and pellets to some extent it can be partly explained by the morphology of mps the surface of fibers and pellets is relatively smooth which makes them have less resistance in the wastewater column this is consistent with that mps fibers have a roughly smooth and non weathered surface via scanning electron microscopic images anderson et al 2018 however fragments and granules often have angular and bifurcate some even have twisted curved character helm 2017 which makes them easily captured during the skimming and sedimentation processes in wwtps at the same time the complex morphology of fragments and granules is conducive to the colonization of microbes and increases the degree of biofouling this causes sedimentation or degradation thus facilitating the removal from the wastewater for example fibers have a high length to width ratio in morphology ziajahromi et al 2017 which allows them to pass through small pore sizes more easily than other shapes talvitie et al 2017a in our study the abundance of fibers in the influent is 17 7 and it is significantly increased to 30 4 in the effluent fig 4 a confirming that wwtps is ineffective in removing fibers claessens et al 2013 found that the fiber capture rate is lower than that of microspheres in the laboratory simulation study our results are in agreement with that fibers are the dominant species of mps in the freshwater and treated wastewater eerkes medrano et al 2015 primpke et al 2017 sutton et al 2016 wang et al 2017 however the color difference of mps has no obvious influence on its removal rate in wwtps from fig 5 d we find that the yellow mps show a relatively stable removal rate but the influence of other colors on it in wwtps is not remarkable this suggests that the color diversity may not cause the differences in mps buoyancy sedimentation biofouling and fragmentation in wwtps 4 conclusions the abundance characteristics and removal of mps in the influent and the effluent and its influencing factors in wwtps were studied by analyzing 60 samples from the seven wwtps in a coastal city of china mps sampling is improved using an electromagnetic flowmeter and a fast digital camera differences in shapes sizes and types of the mps have a profound influence on their fate in wwtps wwtps play an important role in reducing the urban mp pollutants entering the aquatic environment but there are still a large number of mps from wwtps releasing into the ocean the operating load of the wwtps has a great influence on the mp removal rate which is reduced under the overloaded operation the results may provide technical support to improve the operation and management of wwtps in coastal cities in china thus assisting in the prevention and control of mp pollution in coastal waters the migration and transformation behaviors of mps in the environment become complicated by multiple factors and complex wang et al 2016 thus future work could be focused on the comprehensive mechanism of the influences of characteristics of mps such as morphology type of polymer particle size and density on its fate in wwtps acknowledgments this study was supported by grants

18942,the physical states of water are crucial for the dewatering efficiency of waste activated sludge was however to date there is still lack of promising methods for the distinct differentiation of water states in colloidal microbial aggregates this study proposed that the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 distribution of low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr could be a useful tool to unravel the occurrence state of water in was due to the different interaction strengths of protons with the surrounding environment the three water states with different t2 ranges were identified the water strongly trapped on the surface of solid phase through hydrogen bound could be classified as vicinal water interstitial water refers to the water physically trapped in bio floc by steric hindrance or adsorption and the water that is least affected by solid compositions is categorized as moderately mobile water the potential ways of typical conditioning approaches for shifting water states were also investigated the removal of hydrophilic compounds in extracellular polymeric substances eps and surface charge neutralization were both found to be possible ways to influence the percentage of vicinal water pearson correlation coefficient rp 0 950 p value 0 05 the disintegration or compaction of colloidal microbial aggregates could induce the transformation of interstitial water into moderately mobile water all the above results are believed to deepen the mechanism insights into the differentiation and interactive transformation of water states in bio floc of was graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge bound water dewatering eps nmr aop 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment based on activated sludge process is by far the most widely applied technical means to control water pollution worldwide christensen et al 2015a but a large amount of waste activated sludge was is inevitably generated and its management concerns a major portion of operation cost and environmental impact of wastewater treatment plants wwtps dewatering is the widely used treatment step to reduce the volume of handled sludge aid in the solidification and improve the calorific value christensen et al 2015b however was is a complex colloidal system in which lots of water is trapped and cannot be easily released due to the colloidal stability of highly hydrated microbial aggregation it is generally difficult to dewater sludge without conditioning operations cationic polyacrylamide cpam polyferric chloride polymeric aluminum chloride pacl and some advanced oxidation process aop reagents represented by fenton fenton like reagents neyens et al 2004 and persulfate kim et al 2016 zhen et al 2012 have been widely reported as effective conditioning chemicals several physical conditioning processes including ultrasound khanal et al 2007 microwave appels et al 2013 and cavitation gogate and kabadi 2009 were also applied to enhance the efficiencies of dewatering and anaerobic digestion in addition many efforts have been devoted to investigating the influencing factors on was dewaterability generally the larger floc size is more favorable for the gravity settling or centrifugation and the proportion of supracolloidal solid 1 10 μm negatively correlated with the filterability karr and keinath 1978 shao et al 2009 the low compressibility would maintain the channels for water flow and improve the performance of mechanical press filtration besides extracellular polymeric substances eps were widely found to be closely associated the presence of soluble eps and loosely bound eps dispersing with a colloidal state deteriorates was dewaterability comparing with polysaccharides and humic substances extracellular proteins are more essential to the water holding capacities of bio floc although the above physiochemical properties of was were confirmed to have correlations with the dewaterability yet it is widely accepted that the relevant influencing factors take effects through reforming the water states in was he et al 2015 katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 wu et al 2018 and the dewatering limit by mechanical methods should actually be determined and predicted by the status of water states according to the interactions between the water and the solid phase the states of water in was were theoretically refined as the four states including free or bulk water vicinal or interfacial water interstitial water and water of hydration vesilind 1994 the sum of vicinal water and interstitial water accounts for the major portion of bound water which cannot be removed from the sludge body singly using mechanical means of dewatering therefore the conversion of bound water into bulk water is regarded as the key point to improve dewatering efficiencies in terms of water reduction limit and energy consumption he et al 2015 lee 1996 wu et al 1998 however there is still lack of the direct evidence to support the above hypothesis about water differentiation centrifugal settling test katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 lee and hsu 1995 drying rate measurement lee and hsu 1995 dilatometry smith and vesilind 1995 and differential scanning calorimetry dsc he et al 2015 lee and lee 1995 were ever used for bound water analysis but these methods can only obtain the total amount of bound water with high uncertainty and not be able to realize the relative quantification of different bound water states furthermore very limited previous studies specifically focused on the potential correlations among water state alteration and physiochemical properties of bio floc during conditioning stages in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the carr purcell cp pulse sequence is a signal acquisition technique using a 90 radio frequency pulse followed by a train of evenly spaced 180 radio frequency pulses therefore a series of echoes which have alternating signs are produced the first echo is negative the second echo is positive the third echo is negative etc meiboom and gill 1958 the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence technique is a modification of the carr purcell technique the cpmg technique applies the 180 radio frequency pulses along the y axis of the rotating frame rather than the x axis as in the cp pulse sequence each echo signal is positive in the cpmg pulse sequence the transverse spin spin relaxation is the mechanism by which the transverse component of the magnetization vector exponentially decays towards its equilibrium value in cpmg pulse sequence of nmr nyman et al 2008 schweiger and jeschke 2001 it is characterized by the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 which is the time it takes for the magnetic resonance signal to irreversibly decay to 37 1 e of its initial value after its generation by tipping the longitudinal magnetization towards the magnetic transverse plane schweiger and jeschke 2001 by applying cpmg pulse sequence the transverse spin spin relaxation rates differ because of the interactions among protons with the environment and with each other carneiro et al 2013 therefore t2 derived from cpmg decay could be particularly sensitive to changes in the states of protons jepsen et al 1999 and may be used to characterize the structural information of protons in different water states of was this study aimed at tracking the water state alteration of bio floc based on the t2 distribution measurement of low field nmr the differentiation and quantification of water states in typical dewatering conditioning processes were primarily conducted then the potential roles of different water states in the dewaterability improvement was separately evaluated lastly the reaction pathways of typical conditioning approaches for the water state alteration were investigated through the systematical analysis on the bio floc physiochemical properties all the above results are integrated to provide a promising way of distinct water state differentiation and also deepen the understanding of mechanisms involved in the water state alteration accordingly based on the influence paths for water state alteration the novel high performance conditioning approaches can be developed and the dosing strategies of composite conditioning reagents can be also optimized for the highly efficient operation of dewatering units 2 materials and methods 2 1 was was was collected from the secondary settling tank of a typical municipal wastewater treatment plant located at shanghai china which adopts anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process the sampling interval for the triplicate samples was 24 h the collected sludge was concentrated by gravitational settling at 4 c for 12 h after that the basic properties of sludge samples were analyzed according to american water works association standard methods for the examination of water and sewage apha 2009 the concentrated samples had a ph of 6 56 0 05 water content of 98 11 0 03 total solid ts of 18 94 0 33 g l volatile solid vs of 12 50 0 44 g l and capillary suction time cst of 94 0 2 1 s the raw sludge samples and all the sludge derived samples e g eps were stored at 4 c in order to eliminate any possible change of physiochemical properties the analysis on basic properties of sludge samples dewatering conditioning of sludge dewaterability evaluation and eps extraction were conducted within 24 h after sampling wu et al 2017a the other analytical experiments were finished within the subsequent 3 5 d 2 2 typical procedures for sludge conditioning coagulant flocculant are commonly used as dewatering conditioning chemicals wei et al 2018 and aop is widely reported to have excellent performance in sludge dewaterability improvement kim et al 2016 neyens et al 2004 zhen et al 2012 therefore in order to reveal the universal mechanism of water state alteration caused by conditioning operations coagulation flocculation and aop were studied as the three typical conditioning approaches in this paper pacl and cpam were selected as coagulant and flocculant respectively comparing with the liquid h2o2 cao2 can pose a superior effect on dewatering was due to the higher reaction efficiency of regulated released nonselective hydroxyl radical oh with water holding organics neyens and baeyens 2003 wu and chai 2016 thus cao2 was selected as the aop reagent in this study the addition ratio of the homogeneous catalyst fe ii and cao2 was set as 12 5 mmol g according to the typical value in fenton reaction neyens and baeyens 2003 the detailed procedure of sludge conditioning can be found in text s1 of supplementary materials the dewaterability of pretreated sludge was evaluated in terms of cst according to the standard method apha 2009 2 3 differentiation of water states based on low field nmr the sludge samples pretreated by the above conditioning approaches were further concentrated by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min to discard the supernatant and increase the relative percentages of water states potentially linked with solid phase so the refined bound water states could be prominent the pellet obtained from the centrifugation was subjected to the t2 measurement by low field nmr nmi20 030h 1 nmr system niumag electric corporation shanghai china which is equipped with a 0 5 t permanent magnet corresponding to a proton resonance frequency of 23 2 mhz at 32 c the sludge sample was placed in an 18 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene cylindrical tube and a 30 mm diameter radio frequency coil was used to collect cpmg decay signals with 90 and 180 pulses of 13 ms and 26 ms respectively and a s value time between 90 and 180 pulses of 100 ms the data from 8000 echoes were acquired as 8 scan repetitions the repetition time between subsequent scans was 8 s and each measurement was performed in duplicate the different t2 values could be calculated at the cpmg decay envelope curve of each echo amplitudes and reflected the different relaxation decay rates of protons with different states nyman et al 2008 accordingly a t2 distribution spectrum was obtained and the y axis amplitude of t2 distribution spectrum represented the occurrence frequency of the corresponding t2 values calculated from the 8000 echo amplitudes the distributed multi exponential fitting of cpmg decay envelope curves and the calculation of t2 values were performed by using multiexp inv analysis software niumag electric corporation shanghai china according to the previous literature geng et al 2015 nyman et al 2008 the area under each peak of t2 distribution spectrum was determined by cumulative integration for the relative quantification of protons with different states 2 4 eps extraction and composition analysis the eps extraction using the sonication method was based on the procedures reported in previous studies bo et al 1996 wu et al 2017a except for the eps composition analysis the amount of extracted eps under a certain sonication power would also reflect the stability of microbial aggregates after conditioning processes li et al 2012 sludge was firstly centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was termed as soluble eps s eps 0 5 wt nacl solution was added to re suspend the sludge pellets to the original volumes to prevent cell lysis afterwards the re suspended sludge samples were subjected to the sonication with the power of 120 w for 2 min simultaneously the 0 c ice bath was used to prevent the sludge samples from the excessive heat induced by sonication therefore the heat effect of sonication on protein denaturation could be eliminated khanal et al 2007 the released bound eps were harvested in the supernatant by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 20 min polysaccharide and protein levels of the extracted bound eps hereinafter referred to as eps were measured by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard and the modified lowry folin method with bovine serum albumin as the standard bo et al 1996 gaudy 1962 neyens et al 2004 respectively the eps extraction and composition analysis were conducted in triplicate and the standard deviations are shown by the error bars at all the data points in fig 2 2 5 zeta potential and floc size analysis zeta potential and floc size distribution of sludge samples were measured by electrophoresis zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern united kingdom and dynamic laser scattering mastersizer 3000 malvern united kingdom respectively 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using the software originpro 9 0 64 bit originpro lab corp northampton ma usa pearson correlation coefficient rp was used to evaluate the potential relationships among percentages of water states sludge dewaterability and physiochemical properties of bio floc pearson coefficient is always between 1 and 1 where 1 denotes a perfect negative correlation 1 a perfect positive correlation and 0 the absence of a relationship the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 water states tracked by t2 distribution of low field nmr 3 1 1 differentiation of water states due to the different interactions with the surrounding environment t2 of protons differs under the radio frequency pulse of low field nmr therefore nmr relaxometry could be a nondestructive method that enables probing the mobility of protons the differentiation of water states in bio floc is based on the different binding strengths among water molecules and solid phase in general a longer t2 time indicates a lower binding energy and higher mobility of water on the contrary the shorter t2 shows a tight linkage between water and structure of surrounding materials rudi et al 2008 the t2 distribution spectra with four discrete peaks are shown as fig 1 suggesting the existence of four distinct states of protons t21 should be assigned as the protons at solid state gussoni et al 2007 t22 t23 and t24 correspond to the fixed water strongly bound to organic phase through hydrogen bound vicinal water the water physically trapped in bio floc by steric hindrance or adsorption interstitial water and the water that is least affected by solid compositions gussoni et al 2007 t21 and t22 remained in the range of 0 1 2 ms and 2 5 9 ms respectively indicating the mobility of solid state protons and vicinal water was not much influenced by conditioning processes the interaction between vicinal water and solid surface is dominated by hydrogen bound etzler and fagundus 1987 vesilind 1994 therefore the conditioning induced changes in bio floc microstructure would not influence the mobility of vicinal water and shift its t2 however even 4 or 6 fold variation was observed in the transverse spin spin relaxation time of t23 and t24 table 1 the interstitial water is certainly governed by the micro and macro capillary structure of bio floc the coagulation and flocculation may make bio floc dense and therefore left shift the corresponding t2 through enhancing the trapping strength of interstitial water cheng et al 2018 but on the other side the denser floc may increase the floc size and correspondingly extend the pore space among sludge floc particles wang et al 2013 the two above factors jointly determine the t23 peak positions as a result the interstitial water of pretreated sludge generally had lower t23 than that of raw sludge but several samples with high dosage of cpam 0 3 wt dry matter dm and 0 5 wt dm exhibited the substantial right shift of t23 according to previous studies vaxelaire and cézac 2004 vesilind 1994 the most mobile water is theoretically defined as free water that is unaffected by solid phase however this definition is unfeasible in practice because it is hard to only separate solid unaffected water state by experimental means actually the different water removal efficiency can be caused by different filtration pressure or centrifugation speed lee 1994 xiao et al 2017 during the mechanical solid liquid separation there is no clear boundary between the free water and the water mechanically trapped among sludge floc particles in this study the most mobile water state corresponding to t24 also responded to the conditioning induced alterations of solid phase which was reflected by the t24 variations table 1 therefore it should be more accurate to define the t24 water as moderately mobile water instead of free water the moderately mobile water can be interpreted as the water that is least influenced by solid phase and can be partially removed by mechanical means meanwhile the visualization result of was in our previous study also found that the removal efficiency of mobile water is inevitably affected by the migration of solid compositions during separation processes wu et al 2018 which is consistent with the definition of moderately mobile water in this work 3 1 2 relative quantification of water states the quantification of water states was based on the cumulative integration of peak area in t2 distribution spectra the proportion of each peak area in the total peak area represents the relative amount of corresponding water state aursand et al 2008 gummerson et al 1979 as the data summarized in table 1 a23 corresponding to interstitial water decreased with the increasing dosage of all the conditioning reagents compared with raw sludge a21 decreased substantially in cao2 pretreated sludge but increased in cpam and pacl added sludge this trend reflected that the oxidation transformed the protons with low mobility or solid state into the mobile state and the coagulation and flocculation enhanced the linkage of protons with the surrounding environment the variation trends of a21 and a23 could jointly reflect that fe ii catalyzed cao2 reduced interstitial water through the solubilization of solid phase and corresponding destruction of porous bio floc but cpam and pacl enhanced the aggregation of bio floc and eliminated the interstitial water hosted in porous microstructure meanwhile the reduction of interstitial water was also accompanied with the increase of moderately mobile water which was verified by the steadily increasing a24 of all the pretreated samples in terms of vicinal water the a22 state in cpam added sludge increased from 8 533 to 14 124 with the dosage of cpam increasing from 0 1 wt dm to 0 5 wt dm which should be due to the hydrophilic group e g nh2 introduced by cpam pambou et al 2016 and consistent with our previous study wu et al 2018 however the high dosage of cpam 1 wt dm and increasing dosage of pacl may agglomerate sludge floc particles decrease the surface area of solid phase and reduce the direct contact between water and insoluble macromolecules wei et al 2018 thus the content of vicinal water dropped at the dosage of 1 wt dm cpam on the other hand the addition of multi charged cations inhibited the brownian motion of colloidal particles through surface charge neutralization or repulsion reduction baldwin and dempsey 2001 zhang and buffle 1995 it is reasonable that the colloidal particles with less brownian motion is always accompanied with higher structured interfacial water because the weaken motions of surrounding particles would less drive the motion of surrounding water molecules baldwin and dempsey 2001 as a result more water with increased viscosity and decreased mobility could be included as vicinal water with higher enthalpy of surface hydration jungwirth 2015 accordingly the vicinal water contents in all the pacl added sludge samples were detected to be higher than that in raw sludge in addition according to our previous work wu et al 2017a fe ii catalyzed cao2 could introduce the hydrophilic groups oh and co but remove nh2 of eps therefore vicinal water first increased and then declined with the increasing dosage of cao2 that above inference was further verified by the bio floc physiochemical analysis described in section 3 2 3 1 3 interactive transformation of water states based on the relative quantification in section 3 1 2 the interactive transformation of water states was further investigated the results of pearson correlative analysis in table 2 indicated that the reductions of vicinal water and interstitial water in cao2 pretreated sludge both contributed to the increase of moderately mobile water the moderately mobile water of cpam added sludge should be significantly influenced by the interstitial water rp 0 956 p value 0 01 meanwhile the close correlation rp 0 994 p value 0 01 between vicinal water and moderately mobile water in pacl added sludge suggested that the coagulation may synergistically alter the vicinal water and moderately mobile water but there was no significant correlation between vicinal water and interstitial water which reflected that these two water states had different transformation pathways during coagulation the reduction of vicinal water and interstitial water would both increase the moderately mobile water but the different water states are linked to separated physiochemical properties of bio floc and different conditioning approaches have different trends towards bio floc modification niu et al 2013 wu et al 2018 a specific conditioning approach may therefore preferentially influence one of the two bound water states vicinal water or interstitial water as a result this dominantly regulated bound water state would well coordinate with the increase of moderately mobile water in the following section the above conversion relations are further discussed through investigating the influence paths of different conditioning approaches for the water state alteration 3 2 mechanism insights into water state alteration based on multivariate analysis of bio floc physiochemical properties eps of was are some high molecular weight substances distributing both outside of cells and in the interiors of microbial aggregates sheng et al 2010 the major compositions of eps are proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids and lipids derived from microorganisms due to the metabolism secretions cellular lysis and organic matters adsorbed from wastewater sheng et al 2010 the presence of eps plays important roles in protecting cells from harmful environmental effects responding to changes in environment and also various physicochemical characteristics of microbial aggregates such as hydrophilicity hydrophobicity charge characteristics and flocculation properties wu et al 2017a aop based conditioning was also verified to depolymerize eps through oh generation niu et al 2013 sun et al 2018 wu and chai 2016 wu et al 2017a yu et al 2019 therefore the mechanism of water state alteration can be mainly investigated in terms of eps characteristics in addition coagulation and flocculation are usually considered to improve the dewaterability through regulating the surface charge and floc size wei et al 2018 thus in order to reveal the influence paths for the water state alteration the analysis on zeta potential and floc size distribution were also included in this section the potential relationships among the above physiochemical properties of bio floc and percentages of water states were evaluated by pearson correlative analysis table 3 herein the bound water was quantified by the sum of vicinal water and interstitial water 3 2 1 influence path of aop for water state alteration according to the eps compositions shown in fig 2 a fe ii catalyzed cao2 decreased the protein and polysaccharide contents of eps substantially which was consistent with our previous studies wu and chai 2016 it was previously verified that extracellular proteins comprise of major hydrophilic compounds in eps and are more crucial for dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic substances cetin and erdincler 2004 shao et al 2009 xu et al 2018 yu et al 2010 the data in table 3 also indicted that protein content of eps positively correlated with vicinal water state in cao2 pretreated sludge which reflected that cao2 could reduce vicinal water through hydrophilic compound removal the close correlations among all the other water states and eps protein content could be also found in the sludge samples with cao2 added therefore it can be inferred that the removal of protein should be a key path for cao2 to induce the water state alteration except for the decrease of solid state protons a21 in table 1 the reduction of median floc size fig 2d with the increasing dosage of cao2 was also an indicator suggesting the disintegration of colloidal microbial aggregates that potentially contributed to the removal of interstitial water mechanically trapped in the net like microstructure of bio floc wang et al 2016 wu et al 2018 in addition the intracellular water is trapped in cells by the membrane structure so it can be also categorized as interstitial water the water physically trapped in the bio floc by steric hindrance the ph adjustment of aop based conditioning led to the cell lysis which further contributed to the partial reduction of interstitial water furthermore cao2 preteated sludge exhibited the reduction of absolute value of zeta potential but it had limited correlation with the increase of moderately mobile water therefore the complexation of fe2 fe3 or ca2 with eps or the oxidation induced removal of negative charged functional groups e g coo may be not the dominant effect of cao2 conditioning on water release from floc particle interiors 3 2 2 influence path of flocculation for water state alteration the addition of cpam would introduce the hydrophilic functional groups e g co and nh2 and also contribute to the water adhesion ramaraj and radhakrishnan 1994 xiong et al 2018 as a result the content of protein the major hydrophilic composition didn t show a clear correlation with the vicinal water percentage but the extracted amount of extracellular protein and polysaccharide was found to have close correlations with vicinal water and interstitial water the adsorption bridging effect of cpam would enhance the aggregation of eps layers li and yang 2007 tsuneda et al 2003 wang et al 2013 therefore the denser bio floc with a higher stability led to a lower extractable amount of protein and polysaccharide under the same intensity sonication fig 2b the compacted eps layers accordingly drove the transformation of interstitial water into moderately mobile water also the median floc size increased from 34 8 μm to 36 8 μm with the dosage of cpam increasing from 0 wt dm to 1 wt dm and negatively correlated with the interstitial water state which reflected again that the aggregation of fine sludge floc particles or bio floc compaction can be a possible way for the reduction of interstitial water 3 2 3 influence path of coagulation for water state alteration in terms of pacl added sludge samples zeta potential varied from 17 5 mv to 12 9 mv and the median floc size increased from 34 8 μm to 36 7 μm with the dosage increasing from 0 wt dm to 5 wt dm it is similar with cpam added sludge that the extracted contents of protein and polysaccharide from pacl added samples decreased with the increasing coagulant dosage by 76 and 35 3 fig 2c respectively which should be also related to the aggregation effect induced by coagulation li et al 2012 it is commonly recognized that the coagulation takes effects in dewaterability mainly through surface charge neutralization and particle agglomeration wei et al 2018 the negative correlation rp 0 907 p value 0 03 between zeta potential and bound water of pacl added sludge supported the above judgment again in addition the floc size of pacl added sludge strongly correlated with the percentage of vicinal water rp 0 995 p value 0 01 which corresponds to the inference proposed in section 3 1 2 namely the size of sludge floc could determine the sphere of influence on water adhesion the larger floc particle would have weaker brownian motions due to the reduced electrostatic repulsion and correspondingly exhibit lower driving force on surrounding water thus the more water with a relatively lower mobility could be detected as vicinal water dhinojwala and granick 1997 siboulet et al 2013 furthermore it is also notable that the extracted eps protein of pacl added sludge positively correlated both with the vicinal water and interstitial water therefore the way of pacl to transform water states might be also understood from the aspect of protein denaturation some previous studies have proved that the charge neutralization of proteins by multivalent cations reduces the repulsion among adjacent peptides and accordingly leads to the changes in the second level molecular configuration i e α helix and β sheet of extracellular proteins and the spatial distribution of hydrophilic groups collins 2006 sun et al 2018 wu et al 2017a as a result the orientation change of hydrophilic groups may alter the surface hydrophilicity and induce the content variation of vicinal water 3 3 role of water state alteration in was dewaterability according to the above discussion the different conditioning approaches had the different influence tendency for water state alteration but all the conditioning reagents were verified to be effective in the dewaterability improvement fig s1 of supplementary materials up to 83 cst reduction efficiency can be realized by fe ii catalyzed cao2 and pacl had a better conditioning performance than cpam at the same dosage therefore it is worth to investigate the specific roles of water states in the dewaterability improvement which would also help deeply understand the conditioning mechanism from the aspect of conditioning induced water state alteration it is widely accepted that the conversion of bound water into mobile water is the key point to improve the dewatering efficiency he et al 2015 lee 1996 wu et al 1998 xiao et al 2017 from pearson correlative coefficients listed in table 4 it can be found that the percentages of interstitial water had a significant correlation with cst of all the studied samples therefore the elimination of interstitial water can be further regarded as a dominant way of dewaterability improvement accordingly the disintegration or compaction of porous bio floc to reduce the capillary structures should be a promising means for dewatering conditioning in addition the cst measurement is actually a gravity induced process of water seepage flow out from the microbial aggregates thus the increase of water state less affected by solid phase should positively correlated with the cst reduction however moderately mobile water significantly correlated with cst in cpam added samples but not in cao2 pretreated sludge and pacl added sludge these correlative results indicated that the dewaterability wasn t only determined by the amount of mobile water but also affected by the microstructure of bio floc for instance the aop produced fine particles may block filtration media and pose negative effects on cst reduction wu et al 2017b also the charge neutralization by calcium and aluminum cation regulated the hydrophilicity of solid liquid interface through modifying dissociations and configurations of adjacent functional groups the increased surface hydrophilicity would hinder the water seepage in pores among floc particles baldwin and dempsey 2001 bratby 2006 verrelli et al 2009 as a result the increase of moderately mobile water didn t simply correlate with cst furthermore there was no clear correlation between vicinal water and dewaterability either which indicates that although the vicinal water is hard to be removed due to the high binding strength with solid phase but it has limited effects on the dewaterability of was 4 conclusion in this study the t2 distribution of low field nmr was proposed to be a promising tool for understanding the water speciation in was according to the different binding strengths of water molecules with the surrounding environment the three major water states vicinal water the water strongly bound to the organic phase through hydrogen bound interstitial water the water physically trapped in the bio floc by steric hindrance or adsorption and moderately mobile water the water that is least affected by solid compositions were identified with different t2 ranges the mechanism investigation on water phase modification suggested that the vicinal water and interstitial water both closely correlated with the moderately mobile water in cao2 pretreated sludge rp 0 970 p value 0 02 the removal of hydrophilic compounds in eps and the disintegration of colloidal microbial aggregates were the main paths for aop to regulate water states but in terms of coagulation and flocculation pretreated sludge the compaction of bio flocs and the enhanced stability of microbial aggregates were significant features jointly reflected by the reduction of zeta potential and the increase of floc size consequently the release of interstitial water mainly contributed to the increase of moderately mobile water furthermore the surface charge neutralization was also found to affect the vicinal water the inhibited electrostatic repulsion would weaken the structured water mobility driven by fine floc particles in motion and the regulating surface charge could re configure hydrophilic groups of extracellular proteins to reduce the hydrophilicity those two processes were also potential influence paths of coagulation to shift water states in was declarations of interest none acknowledgments this study was

18942,the physical states of water are crucial for the dewatering efficiency of waste activated sludge was however to date there is still lack of promising methods for the distinct differentiation of water states in colloidal microbial aggregates this study proposed that the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 distribution of low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr could be a useful tool to unravel the occurrence state of water in was due to the different interaction strengths of protons with the surrounding environment the three water states with different t2 ranges were identified the water strongly trapped on the surface of solid phase through hydrogen bound could be classified as vicinal water interstitial water refers to the water physically trapped in bio floc by steric hindrance or adsorption and the water that is least affected by solid compositions is categorized as moderately mobile water the potential ways of typical conditioning approaches for shifting water states were also investigated the removal of hydrophilic compounds in extracellular polymeric substances eps and surface charge neutralization were both found to be possible ways to influence the percentage of vicinal water pearson correlation coefficient rp 0 950 p value 0 05 the disintegration or compaction of colloidal microbial aggregates could induce the transformation of interstitial water into moderately mobile water all the above results are believed to deepen the mechanism insights into the differentiation and interactive transformation of water states in bio floc of was graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge bound water dewatering eps nmr aop 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment based on activated sludge process is by far the most widely applied technical means to control water pollution worldwide christensen et al 2015a but a large amount of waste activated sludge was is inevitably generated and its management concerns a major portion of operation cost and environmental impact of wastewater treatment plants wwtps dewatering is the widely used treatment step to reduce the volume of handled sludge aid in the solidification and improve the calorific value christensen et al 2015b however was is a complex colloidal system in which lots of water is trapped and cannot be easily released due to the colloidal stability of highly hydrated microbial aggregation it is generally difficult to dewater sludge without conditioning operations cationic polyacrylamide cpam polyferric chloride polymeric aluminum chloride pacl and some advanced oxidation process aop reagents represented by fenton fenton like reagents neyens et al 2004 and persulfate kim et al 2016 zhen et al 2012 have been widely reported as effective conditioning chemicals several physical conditioning processes including ultrasound khanal et al 2007 microwave appels et al 2013 and cavitation gogate and kabadi 2009 were also applied to enhance the efficiencies of dewatering and anaerobic digestion in addition many efforts have been devoted to investigating the influencing factors on was dewaterability generally the larger floc size is more favorable for the gravity settling or centrifugation and the proportion of supracolloidal solid 1 10 μm negatively correlated with the filterability karr and keinath 1978 shao et al 2009 the low compressibility would maintain the channels for water flow and improve the performance of mechanical press filtration besides extracellular polymeric substances eps were widely found to be closely associated the presence of soluble eps and loosely bound eps dispersing with a colloidal state deteriorates was dewaterability comparing with polysaccharides and humic substances extracellular proteins are more essential to the water holding capacities of bio floc although the above physiochemical properties of was were confirmed to have correlations with the dewaterability yet it is widely accepted that the relevant influencing factors take effects through reforming the water states in was he et al 2015 katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 wu et al 2018 and the dewatering limit by mechanical methods should actually be determined and predicted by the status of water states according to the interactions between the water and the solid phase the states of water in was were theoretically refined as the four states including free or bulk water vicinal or interfacial water interstitial water and water of hydration vesilind 1994 the sum of vicinal water and interstitial water accounts for the major portion of bound water which cannot be removed from the sludge body singly using mechanical means of dewatering therefore the conversion of bound water into bulk water is regarded as the key point to improve dewatering efficiencies in terms of water reduction limit and energy consumption he et al 2015 lee 1996 wu et al 1998 however there is still lack of the direct evidence to support the above hypothesis about water differentiation centrifugal settling test katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 lee and hsu 1995 drying rate measurement lee and hsu 1995 dilatometry smith and vesilind 1995 and differential scanning calorimetry dsc he et al 2015 lee and lee 1995 were ever used for bound water analysis but these methods can only obtain the total amount of bound water with high uncertainty and not be able to realize the relative quantification of different bound water states furthermore very limited previous studies specifically focused on the potential correlations among water state alteration and physiochemical properties of bio floc during conditioning stages in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the carr purcell cp pulse sequence is a signal acquisition technique using a 90 radio frequency pulse followed by a train of evenly spaced 180 radio frequency pulses therefore a series of echoes which have alternating signs are produced the first echo is negative the second echo is positive the third echo is negative etc meiboom and gill 1958 the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence technique is a modification of the carr purcell technique the cpmg technique applies the 180 radio frequency pulses along the y axis of the rotating frame rather than the x axis as in the cp pulse sequence each echo signal is positive in the cpmg pulse sequence the transverse spin spin relaxation is the mechanism by which the transverse component of the magnetization vector exponentially decays towards its equilibrium value in cpmg pulse sequence of nmr nyman et al 2008 schweiger and jeschke 2001 it is characterized by the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 which is the time it takes for the magnetic resonance signal to irreversibly decay to 37 1 e of its initial value after its generation by tipping the longitudinal magnetization towards the magnetic transverse plane schweiger and jeschke 2001 by applying cpmg pulse sequence the transverse spin spin relaxation rates differ because of the interactions among protons with the environment and with each other carneiro et al 2013 therefore t2 derived from cpmg decay could be particularly sensitive to changes in the states of protons jepsen et al 1999 and may be used to characterize the structural information of protons in different water states of was this study aimed at tracking the water state alteration of bio floc based on the t2 distribution measurement of low field nmr the differentiation and quantification of water states in typical dewatering conditioning processes were primarily conducted then the potential roles of different water states in the dewaterability improvement was separately evaluated lastly the reaction pathways of typical conditioning approaches for the water state alteration were investigated through the systematical analysis on the bio floc physiochemical properties all the above results are integrated to provide a promising way of distinct water state differentiation and also deepen the understanding of mechanisms involved in the water state alteration accordingly based on the influence paths for water state alteration the novel high performance conditioning approaches can be developed and the dosing strategies of composite conditioning reagents can be also optimized for the highly efficient operation of dewatering units 2 materials and methods 2 1 was was was collected from the secondary settling tank of a typical municipal wastewater treatment plant located at shanghai china which adopts anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process the sampling interval for the triplicate samples was 24 h the collected sludge was concentrated by gravitational settling at 4 c for 12 h after that the basic properties of sludge samples were analyzed according to american water works association standard methods for the examination of water and sewage apha 2009 the concentrated samples had a ph of 6 56 0 05 water content of 98 11 0 03 total solid ts of 18 94 0 33 g l volatile solid vs of 12 50 0 44 g l and capillary suction time cst of 94 0 2 1 s the raw sludge samples and all the sludge derived samples e g eps were stored at 4 c in order to eliminate any possible change of physiochemical properties the analysis on basic properties of sludge samples dewatering conditioning of sludge dewaterability evaluation and eps extraction were conducted within 24 h after sampling wu et al 2017a the other analytical experiments were finished within the subsequent 3 5 d 2 2 typical procedures for sludge conditioning coagulant flocculant are commonly used as dewatering conditioning chemicals wei et al 2018 and aop is widely reported to have excellent performance in sludge dewaterability improvement kim et al 2016 neyens et al 2004 zhen et al 2012 therefore in order to reveal the universal mechanism of water state alteration caused by conditioning operations coagulation flocculation and aop were studied as the three typical conditioning approaches in this paper pacl and cpam were selected as coagulant and flocculant respectively comparing with the liquid h2o2 cao2 can pose a superior effect on dewatering was due to the higher reaction efficiency of regulated released nonselective hydroxyl radical oh with water holding organics neyens and baeyens 2003 wu and chai 2016 thus cao2 was selected as the aop reagent in this study the addition ratio of the homogeneous catalyst fe ii and cao2 was set as 12 5 mmol g according to the typical value in fenton reaction neyens and baeyens 2003 the detailed procedure of sludge conditioning can be found in text s1 of supplementary materials the dewaterability of pretreated sludge was evaluated in terms of cst according to the standard method apha 2009 2 3 differentiation of water states based on low field nmr the sludge samples pretreated by the above conditioning approaches were further concentrated by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min to discard the supernatant and increase the relative percentages of water states potentially linked with solid phase so the refined bound water states could be prominent the pellet obtained from the centrifugation was subjected to the t2 measurement by low field nmr nmi20 030h 1 nmr system niumag electric corporation shanghai china which is equipped with a 0 5 t permanent magnet corresponding to a proton resonance frequency of 23 2 mhz at 32 c the sludge sample was placed in an 18 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene cylindrical tube and a 30 mm diameter radio frequency coil was used to collect cpmg decay signals with 90 and 180 pulses of 13 ms and 26 ms respectively and a s value time between 90 and 180 pulses of 100 ms the data from 8000 echoes were acquired as 8 scan repetitions the repetition time between subsequent scans was 8 s and each measurement was performed in duplicate the different t2 values could be calculated at the cpmg decay envelope curve of each echo amplitudes and reflected the different relaxation decay rates of protons with different states nyman et al 2008 accordingly a t2 distribution spectrum was obtained and the y axis amplitude of t2 distribution spectrum represented the occurrence frequency of the corresponding t2 values calculated from the 8000 echo amplitudes the distributed multi exponential fitting of cpmg decay envelope curves and the calculation of t2 values were performed by using multiexp inv analysis software niumag electric corporation shanghai china according to the previous literature geng et al 2015 nyman et al 2008 the area under each peak of t2 distribution spectrum was determined by cumulative integration for the relative quantification of protons with different states 2 4 eps extraction and composition analysis the eps extraction using the sonication method was based on the procedures reported in previous studies bo et al 1996 wu et al 2017a except for the eps composition analysis the amount of extracted eps under a certain sonication power would also reflect the stability of microbial aggregates after conditioning processes li et al 2012 sludge was firstly centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was termed as soluble eps s eps 0 5 wt nacl solution was added to re suspend the sludge pellets to the original volumes to prevent cell lysis afterwards the re suspended sludge samples were subjected to the sonication with the power of 120 w for 2 min simultaneously the 0 c ice bath was used to prevent the sludge samples from the excessive heat induced by sonication therefore the heat effect of sonication on protein denaturation could be eliminated khanal et al 2007 the released bound eps were harvested in the supernatant by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 20 min polysaccharide and protein levels of the extracted bound eps hereinafter referred to as eps were measured by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard and the modified lowry folin method with bovine serum albumin as the standard bo et al 1996 gaudy 1962 neyens et al 2004 respectively the eps extraction and composition analysis were conducted in triplicate and the standard deviations are shown by the error bars at all the data points in fig 2 2 5 zeta potential and floc size analysis zeta potential and floc size distribution of sludge samples were measured by electrophoresis zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern united kingdom and dynamic laser scattering mastersizer 3000 malvern united kingdom respectively 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using the software originpro 9 0 64 bit originpro lab corp northampton ma usa pearson correlation coefficient rp was used to evaluate the potential relationships among percentages of water states sludge dewaterability and physiochemical properties of bio floc pearson coefficient is always between 1 and 1 where 1 denotes a perfect negative correlation 1 a perfect positive correlation and 0 the absence of a relationship the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 water states tracked by t2 distribution of low field nmr 3 1 1 differentiation of water states due to the different interactions with the surrounding environment t2 of protons differs under the radio frequency pulse of low field nmr therefore nmr relaxometry could be a nondestructive method that enables probing the mobility of protons the differentiation of water states in bio floc is based on the different binding strengths among water molecules and solid phase in general a longer t2 time indicates a lower binding energy and higher mobility of water on the contrary the shorter t2 shows a tight linkage between water and structure of surrounding materials rudi et al 2008 the t2 distribution spectra with four discrete peaks are shown as fig 1 suggesting the existence of four distinct states of protons t21 should be assigned as the protons at solid state gussoni et al 2007 t22 t23 and t24 correspond to the fixed water strongly bound to organic phase through hydrogen bound vicinal water the water physically trapped in bio floc by steric hindrance or adsorption interstitial water and the water that is least affected by solid compositions gussoni et al 2007 t21 and t22 remained in the range of 0 1 2 ms and 2 5 9 ms respectively indicating the mobility of solid state protons and vicinal water was not much influenced by conditioning processes the interaction between vicinal water and solid surface is dominated by hydrogen bound etzler and fagundus 1987 vesilind 1994 therefore the conditioning induced changes in bio floc microstructure would not influence the mobility of vicinal water and shift its t2 however even 4 or 6 fold variation was observed in the transverse spin spin relaxation time of t23 and t24 table 1 the interstitial water is certainly governed by the micro and macro capillary structure of bio floc the coagulation and flocculation may make bio floc dense and therefore left shift the corresponding t2 through enhancing the trapping strength of interstitial water cheng et al 2018 but on the other side the denser floc may increase the floc size and correspondingly extend the pore space among sludge floc particles wang et al 2013 the two above factors jointly determine the t23 peak positions as a result the interstitial water of pretreated sludge generally had lower t23 than that of raw sludge but several samples with high dosage of cpam 0 3 wt dry matter dm and 0 5 wt dm exhibited the substantial right shift of t23 according to previous studies vaxelaire and cézac 2004 vesilind 1994 the most mobile water is theoretically defined as free water that is unaffected by solid phase however this definition is unfeasible in practice because it is hard to only separate solid unaffected water state by experimental means actually the different water removal efficiency can be caused by different filtration pressure or centrifugation speed lee 1994 xiao et al 2017 during the mechanical solid liquid separation there is no clear boundary between the free water and the water mechanically trapped among sludge floc particles in this study the most mobile water state corresponding to t24 also responded to the conditioning induced alterations of solid phase which was reflected by the t24 variations table 1 therefore it should be more accurate to define the t24 water as moderately mobile water instead of free water the moderately mobile water can be interpreted as the water that is least influenced by solid phase and can be partially removed by mechanical means meanwhile the visualization result of was in our previous study also found that the removal efficiency of mobile water is inevitably affected by the migration of solid compositions during separation processes wu et al 2018 which is consistent with the definition of moderately mobile water in this work 3 1 2 relative quantification of water states the quantification of water states was based on the cumulative integration of peak area in t2 distribution spectra the proportion of each peak area in the total peak area represents the relative amount of corresponding water state aursand et al 2008 gummerson et al 1979 as the data summarized in table 1 a23 corresponding to interstitial water decreased with the increasing dosage of all the conditioning reagents compared with raw sludge a21 decreased substantially in cao2 pretreated sludge but increased in cpam and pacl added sludge this trend reflected that the oxidation transformed the protons with low mobility or solid state into the mobile state and the coagulation and flocculation enhanced the linkage of protons with the surrounding environment the variation trends of a21 and a23 could jointly reflect that fe ii catalyzed cao2 reduced interstitial water through the solubilization of solid phase and corresponding destruction of porous bio floc but cpam and pacl enhanced the aggregation of bio floc and eliminated the interstitial water hosted in porous microstructure meanwhile the reduction of interstitial water was also accompanied with the increase of moderately mobile water which was verified by the steadily increasing a24 of all the pretreated samples in terms of vicinal water the a22 state in cpam added sludge increased from 8 533 to 14 124 with the dosage of cpam increasing from 0 1 wt dm to 0 5 wt dm which should be due to the hydrophilic group e g nh2 introduced by cpam pambou et al 2016 and consistent with our previous study wu et al 2018 however the high dosage of cpam 1 wt dm and increasing dosage of pacl may agglomerate sludge floc particles decrease the surface area of solid phase and reduce the direct contact between water and insoluble macromolecules wei et al 2018 thus the content of vicinal water dropped at the dosage of 1 wt dm cpam on the other hand the addition of multi charged cations inhibited the brownian motion of colloidal particles through surface charge neutralization or repulsion reduction baldwin and dempsey 2001 zhang and buffle 1995 it is reasonable that the colloidal particles with less brownian motion is always accompanied with higher structured interfacial water because the weaken motions of surrounding particles would less drive the motion of surrounding water molecules baldwin and dempsey 2001 as a result more water with increased viscosity and decreased mobility could be included as vicinal water with higher enthalpy of surface hydration jungwirth 2015 accordingly the vicinal water contents in all the pacl added sludge samples were detected to be higher than that in raw sludge in addition according to our previous work wu et al 2017a fe ii catalyzed cao2 could introduce the hydrophilic groups oh and co but remove nh2 of eps therefore vicinal water first increased and then declined with the increasing dosage of cao2 that above inference was further verified by the bio floc physiochemical analysis described in section 3 2 3 1 3 interactive transformation of water states based on the relative quantification in section 3 1 2 the interactive transformation of water states was further investigated the results of pearson correlative analysis in table 2 indicated that the reductions of vicinal water and interstitial water in cao2 pretreated sludge both contributed to the increase of moderately mobile water the moderately mobile water of cpam added sludge should be significantly influenced by the interstitial water rp 0 956 p value 0 01 meanwhile the close correlation rp 0 994 p value 0 01 between vicinal water and moderately mobile water in pacl added sludge suggested that the coagulation may synergistically alter the vicinal water and moderately mobile water but there was no significant correlation between vicinal water and interstitial water which reflected that these two water states had different transformation pathways during coagulation the reduction of vicinal water and interstitial water would both increase the moderately mobile water but the different water states are linked to separated physiochemical properties of bio floc and different conditioning approaches have different trends towards bio floc modification niu et al 2013 wu et al 2018 a specific conditioning approach may therefore preferentially influence one of the two bound water states vicinal water or interstitial water as a result this dominantly regulated bound water state would well coordinate with the increase of moderately mobile water in the following section the above conversion relations are further discussed through investigating the influence paths of different conditioning approaches for the water state alteration 3 2 mechanism insights into water state alteration based on multivariate analysis of bio floc physiochemical properties eps of was are some high molecular weight substances distributing both outside of cells and in the interiors of microbial aggregates sheng et al 2010 the major compositions of eps are proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids and lipids derived from microorganisms due to the metabolism secretions cellular lysis and organic matters adsorbed from wastewater sheng et al 2010 the presence of eps plays important roles in protecting cells from harmful environmental effects responding to changes in environment and also various physicochemical characteristics of microbial aggregates such as hydrophilicity hydrophobicity charge characteristics and flocculation properties wu et al 2017a aop based conditioning was also verified to depolymerize eps through oh generation niu et al 2013 sun et al 2018 wu and chai 2016 wu et al 2017a yu et al 2019 therefore the mechanism of water state alteration can be mainly investigated in terms of eps characteristics in addition coagulation and flocculation are usually considered to improve the dewaterability through regulating the surface charge and floc size wei et al 2018 thus in order to reveal the influence paths for the water state alteration the analysis on zeta potential and floc size distribution were also included in this section the potential relationships among the above physiochemical properties of bio floc and percentages of water states were evaluated by pearson correlative analysis table 3 herein the bound water was quantified by the sum of vicinal water and interstitial water 3 2 1 influence path of aop for water state alteration according to the eps compositions shown in fig 2 a fe ii catalyzed cao2 decreased the protein and polysaccharide contents of eps substantially which was consistent with our previous studies wu and chai 2016 it was previously verified that extracellular proteins comprise of major hydrophilic compounds in eps and are more crucial for dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic substances cetin and erdincler 2004 shao et al 2009 xu et al 2018 yu et al 2010 the data in table 3 also indicted that protein content of eps positively correlated with vicinal water state in cao2 pretreated sludge which reflected that cao2 could reduce vicinal water through hydrophilic compound removal the close correlations among all the other water states and eps protein content could be also found in the sludge samples with cao2 added therefore it can be inferred that the removal of protein should be a key path for cao2 to induce the water state alteration except for the decrease of solid state protons a21 in table 1 the reduction of median floc size fig 2d with the increasing dosage of cao2 was also an indicator suggesting the disintegration of colloidal microbial aggregates that potentially contributed to the removal of interstitial water mechanically trapped in the net like microstructure of bio floc wang et al 2016 wu et al 2018 in addition the intracellular water is trapped in cells by the membrane structure so it can be also categorized as interstitial water the water physically trapped in the bio floc by steric hindrance the ph adjustment of aop based conditioning led to the cell lysis which further contributed to the partial reduction of interstitial water furthermore cao2 preteated sludge exhibited the reduction of absolute value of zeta potential but it had limited correlation with the increase of moderately mobile water therefore the complexation of fe2 fe3 or ca2 with eps or the oxidation induced removal of negative charged functional groups e g coo may be not the dominant effect of cao2 conditioning on water release from floc particle interiors 3 2 2 influence path of flocculation for water state alteration the addition of cpam would introduce the hydrophilic functional groups e g co and nh2 and also contribute to the water adhesion ramaraj and radhakrishnan 1994 xiong et al 2018 as a result the content of protein the major hydrophilic composition didn t show a clear correlation with the vicinal water percentage but the extracted amount of extracellular protein and polysaccharide was found to have close correlations with vicinal water and interstitial water the adsorption bridging effect of cpam would enhance the aggregation of eps layers li and yang 2007 tsuneda et al 2003 wang et al 2013 therefore the denser bio floc with a higher stability led to a lower extractable amount of protein and polysaccharide under the same intensity sonication fig 2b the compacted eps layers accordingly drove the transformation of interstitial water into moderately mobile water also the median floc size increased from 34 8 μm to 36 8 μm with the dosage of cpam increasing from 0 wt dm to 1 wt dm and negatively correlated with the interstitial water state which reflected again that the aggregation of fine sludge floc particles or bio floc compaction can be a possible way for the reduction of interstitial water 3 2 3 influence path of coagulation for water state alteration in terms of pacl added sludge samples zeta potential varied from 17 5 mv to 12 9 mv and the median floc size increased from 34 8 μm to 36 7 μm with the dosage increasing from 0 wt dm to 5 wt dm it is similar with cpam added sludge that the extracted contents of protein and polysaccharide from pacl added samples decreased with the increasing coagulant dosage by 76 and 35 3 fig 2c respectively which should be also related to the aggregation effect induced by coagulation li et al 2012 it is commonly recognized that the coagulation takes effects in dewaterability mainly through surface charge neutralization and particle agglomeration wei et al 2018 the negative correlation rp 0 907 p value 0 03 between zeta potential and bound water of pacl added sludge supported the above judgment again in addition the floc size of pacl added sludge strongly correlated with the percentage of vicinal water rp 0 995 p value 0 01 which corresponds to the inference proposed in section 3 1 2 namely the size of sludge floc could determine the sphere of influence on water adhesion the larger floc particle would have weaker brownian motions due to the reduced electrostatic repulsion and correspondingly exhibit lower driving force on surrounding water thus the more water with a relatively lower mobility could be detected as vicinal water dhinojwala and granick 1997 siboulet et al 2013 furthermore it is also notable that the extracted eps protein of pacl added sludge positively correlated both with the vicinal water and interstitial water therefore the way of pacl to transform water states might be also understood from the aspect of protein denaturation some previous studies have proved that the charge neutralization of proteins by multivalent cations reduces the repulsion among adjacent peptides and accordingly leads to the changes in the second level molecular configuration i e α helix and β sheet of extracellular proteins and the spatial distribution of hydrophilic groups collins 2006 sun et al 2018 wu et al 2017a as a result the orientation change of hydrophilic groups may alter the surface hydrophilicity and induce the content variation of vicinal water 3 3 role of water state alteration in was dewaterability according to the above discussion the different conditioning approaches had the different influence tendency for water state alteration but all the conditioning reagents were verified to be effective in the dewaterability improvement fig s1 of supplementary materials up to 83 cst reduction efficiency can be realized by fe ii catalyzed cao2 and pacl had a better conditioning performance than cpam at the same dosage therefore it is worth to investigate the specific roles of water states in the dewaterability improvement which would also help deeply understand the conditioning mechanism from the aspect of conditioning induced water state alteration it is widely accepted that the conversion of bound water into mobile water is the key point to improve the dewatering efficiency he et al 2015 lee 1996 wu et al 1998 xiao et al 2017 from pearson correlative coefficients listed in table 4 it can be found that the percentages of interstitial water had a significant correlation with cst of all the studied samples therefore the elimination of interstitial water can be further regarded as a dominant way of dewaterability improvement accordingly the disintegration or compaction of porous bio floc to reduce the capillary structures should be a promising means for dewatering conditioning in addition the cst measurement is actually a gravity induced process of water seepage flow out from the microbial aggregates thus the increase of water state less affected by solid phase should positively correlated with the cst reduction however moderately mobile water significantly correlated with cst in cpam added samples but not in cao2 pretreated sludge and pacl added sludge these correlative results indicated that the dewaterability wasn t only determined by the amount of mobile water but also affected by the microstructure of bio floc for instance the aop produced fine particles may block filtration media and pose negative effects on cst reduction wu et al 2017b also the charge neutralization by calcium and aluminum cation regulated the hydrophilicity of solid liquid interface through modifying dissociations and configurations of adjacent functional groups the increased surface hydrophilicity would hinder the water seepage in pores among floc particles baldwin and dempsey 2001 bratby 2006 verrelli et al 2009 as a result the increase of moderately mobile water didn t simply correlate with cst furthermore there was no clear correlation between vicinal water and dewaterability either which indicates that although the vicinal water is hard to be removed due to the high binding strength with solid phase but it has limited effects on the dewaterability of was 4 conclusion in this study the t2 distribution of low field nmr was proposed to be a promising tool for understanding the water speciation in was according to the different binding strengths of water molecules with the surrounding environment the three major water states vicinal water the water strongly bound to the organic phase through hydrogen bound interstitial water the water physically trapped in the bio floc by steric hindrance or adsorption and moderately mobile water the water that is least affected by solid compositions were identified with different t2 ranges the mechanism investigation on water phase modification suggested that the vicinal water and interstitial water both closely correlated with the moderately mobile water in cao2 pretreated sludge rp 0 970 p value 0 02 the removal of hydrophilic compounds in eps and the disintegration of colloidal microbial aggregates were the main paths for aop to regulate water states but in terms of coagulation and flocculation pretreated sludge the compaction of bio flocs and the enhanced stability of microbial aggregates were significant features jointly reflected by the reduction of zeta potential and the increase of floc size consequently the release of interstitial water mainly contributed to the increase of moderately mobile water furthermore the surface charge neutralization was also found to affect the vicinal water the inhibited electrostatic repulsion would weaken the structured water mobility driven by fine floc particles in motion and the regulating surface charge could re configure hydrophilic groups of extracellular proteins to reduce the hydrophilicity those two processes were also potential influence paths of coagulation to shift water states in was declarations of interest none acknowledgments this study was

18943,denitrification is the stepwise microbial reduction of nitrate or nitrite no2 to nitrogen gas via the obligate intermediates nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o substantial n2o accumulation has been reported in denitrifying enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr bioreactors enriched in denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms dpaos but little is known about underlying mechanisms for n2o generation prevalence of complete versus truncated denitrification pathways or the impact of no2 feed on dpao enriched consortia to address this knowledge gap we employed genome resolved metagenomics to investigate nitrogen transformation potential in a no2 fed denitrifying ebpr bioreactor enriched in candidatus accumulibacter and prone to n2o accumulation our analysis yielded 41 near complete metagenome assembled genomes mags including two co occurring accumulibacter strains affiliated with clades ia and ic the first published genome from this clade and 39 non pao flanking bacterial genomes the dominant accumulibacter clade ia encoded genes for complete denitrification while the lower abundance accumulibacter clade ic harbored all denitrification genes except for a canonical respiratory no reductase analysis of the 39 non pao mags revealed a high prevalence of taxa harboring an incomplete denitrification pathway of the 27 mags harboring capacity for at least one step in the denitrification pathway 10 were putative n2o producers lacking n2o reductase 16 were putative n2o reducers that lacked at least one upstream denitrification gene and only one harbored a complete denitrification pathway we also documented increasing abundance over the course of reactor operation of putative n2o producers our results suggest that the unusually high levels of n2o production observed in this accumulibacter enriched consortium are linked in part to the selection for non pao flanking microorganisms with truncated denitrification pathways graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrifying pao denitrification enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr nitrous oxide metagenome assembled genomes mags 1 introduction enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr processes are widely used for phosphorus p removal and recovery during wastewater treatment the key functional group in ebpr processes is known as polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos he and mcmahon 2011 when subjected to alternating anaerobic oxic conditions paos take up dissolved p under oxic conditions and removal of microbial biomass can then lead to effective p removal a subset of paos termed denitrifying paos dpaos are also capable of p uptake under anoxic denitrifying conditions when integrated nitrogen n and p removal from wastewater is desired such anoxic p removal via dpao activity is considered advantageous compared to oxic p removal as both oxygen and therefore aeration energy and organic carbon requirements are curbed kuba et al 1994 dpao activity over nitrite no2 rather than nitrate no3 is of particular interest when integrating ebpr with shortcut n removal systems such as nitritation denitritation that promise oxygen and energy savings relative to conventional n removal systems gao et al 2014 complete microbial denitrification involves four enzymatic reactions catalyzed by nitrate reductase nap or nar no3 to no2 nitrite reductase nir no2 to no nitric oxide reductase nor no to n2o and nitrous oxide reductase nos n2o to n2 zumft 1997 denitrification is a modular pathway and the four nitrogen oxide reductases can be activated and regulated with a certain degree of independence zumft 1997 moreover microbes harboring incomplete truncated denitrification pathways that lack one or more of the core nitrogen oxide reductases have recently been revealed by genomic analyses anantharaman et al 2016 chen et al 2002 hanke et al 2015 philippot et al 2011 skennerton et al 2014 indeed n2o is an obligate intermediate in denitrification and a subset of currently available denitrifier genomes lack the gene for nos indicating that they are putative n2o producers hallin et al 2017 other genomes harboring nos with or without upstream denitrification genes indicate genomic capacity for n2o consumption hallin et al 2017 as of yet the prevalence of complete versus incomplete denitrification pathways and corresponding balance of putative n2o producers and consumers in both engineered bioprocesses and in natural systems is not well understood the capacity for n2o production and consumption by denitrifiers and nondenitrifying n2o reducers is relevant because n2o is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 310 times higher than that of carbon dioxide co2 it also catalyzes the destruction of stratospheric ozone us epa 2012 crutzen 2016 ravishankara et al 2009 microbial denitrification is known to be one of the primary biotic n2o producing processes beaulieu et al 2011 sanford et al 2012 and wastewater treatment processes that harbor denitrifiers including ebpr processes have been identified as a potential source of n2o emissions ahn et al 2010 kampschreur et al 2009 zhou et al 2016 in addition to the potential for n2o production by denitrifiers with truncated denitrification pathways exposure to elevated no2 or to electron donor limitation have been demonstrated to affect the accumulation of n2o by denitrifiers zhou et al 2007 2008a several studies have explored short term effects of no2 during denitrification pan et al 2012 scherson et al 2013 wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2008b however the long term impact of no2 rather than no3 on denitrifying microbial community structure and function has seen little exploration understanding these impacts is particularly important for emerging shortcut n removal bioprocesses that employ no2 as a key intermediate gao et al 2014 the predominant pao in most ebpr processes is affiliated with the as yet uncultivated candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis herein accumulibacter bond et al 1995 hesselmann et al 1999 phylogenetic analyses of the polyphosphate kinase gene ppk1 have resolved the accumulibacter genus into two major divisions type i and ii and 14 clades clades ia ie and clades iia ii i camejo et al 2016 flowers et al 2009 he et al 2007 mao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 denitrifying capabilities of these different accumulibacter clades are not fully understood and only specific accumulibacter clades are thought to be capable of denitrification camejo et al 2016 flowers et al 2009 kim et al 2013 an evolutionary model of accumulibacter clade iia was constructed recently to investigate the evolution of metabolic traits that discriminate non pao from pao through ancestral genome construction and the identification of horizontal gene transfer hgt oyserman et al 2016 however the evolution of denitrification traits within accumulibacter genotypes has not been well studied limiting the understanding of n transformations in denitrifying ebpr processes accumulation of n2o has been reported in several dpao enrichment cultures and bioreactors lemaire et al 2006 meyer et al 2005 zhou et al 2016 however the specific taxa responsible for n2o production as well as mechanisms underlying n2o generation are not clear due to the complexity of the associated microbial consortia gao et al 2017 while recent studies have compared potential for denitrification among currently available accumulibacter genomes flowers et al 2013 skennerton et al 2014 none of these genomes derive from dpaos enriched under long term anaerobic anoxic conditions with no2 supplied as the terminal electron acceptor and none derive from reactors or enrichments in which n2o is the dominant product of denitrification furthermore the relative abundance of accumulibacter in pao enriched systems can vary from 20 to 80 even in well controlled lab scale ebpr bioreactors with stable p removal he et al 2010 kampschreur et al 2009 zhou et al 2016 the function of the diverse non accumulibacter flanking community in denitrifying ebpr processes has not been well studied and the prevalence of complete versus truncated denitrification pathways in these bioprocesses as well as genomic potential for n2o production or consumption is not known this is due in part to the limited number of metagenomic sequencing studies and the difficulty in extracting genomes for minority community members below 1 relative abundance without deep sequencing albertsen et al 2013 the aim of this study was to investigate genomic potential for complete versus truncated denitrification by accumulibacter and non pao community members in a denitrifying ebpr process and to identify specific accumulibacter clades as well as other flanking microbial populations as potential sinks and sources of n2o when a high no2 feed was supplied to this end we applied genome resolved metagenomic analysis to study the composition and functional potential of a dpao enriched bioprocess previously shown to generate unusually high levels of n2o 70 of n gao et al 2017 we hypothesized that the n2o generation in this dpao enriched denitrifying ebpr process is linked to 1 selection for dpaos accumulibacter with truncated denitrification pathways that lack genomic capacity for n2o reduction and or 2 selection for non pao denitrifiers in the flanking microbial community that lack genomic capacity for n2o reduction and are therefore putative n2o producers 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation a 14l lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with 12l working volume was operated continuously as a denitrifying biological phosphorus removal system for 7 months under cyclic anaerobic and anoxic conditions with a short aerobic polishing step in order to enrich denitrifying paos the reactor was inoculated with activated sludge from the stickney water reclamation plant chicago il and operated under a feast famine feeding strategy with synthetic municipal wastewater detailed reactor operating conditions performance and experimental methods for key metabolite acetate propionate phas no2 n2o and po4 3

the electron donor was switched between acetate and propionate every two sbr cycles to enrich accumulibacter specific paos lu et al 2006 in the anoxic cod deplete phase high no2 feed intended to mimic effluent from a nitritation reactor was dosed as a terminal electron acceptor for denitrification with no ammonia added no2 was the sole n source for bacterial growth no inert gas was sparged during denitrification and anoxic conditions were confirmed via online monitoring of dissolved oxygen concentration with an ldo sensor hach usa the reactor operation was separated into three different phases

and annotation differential coverage binning was performed as previously described to bin metagenomic contigs into two accumulibacter metagenome assembled genomes mags albertsen et al 2013 a detailed description of the methodology for assembly orf calling and binning can be found in the si checkm was applied to validate the quality of assembled genomes parks et al 2015 a pair wise average nucleotide identity ani in percentage and the percentage of alignment between 13 publicly available accumulibacter genomes and genomes extracted in this study was calculated with the jspecies ws online server using blast anib richter et al 2016 all predicted orfs in type i accumulibacter genomes including the two mags obtained in this study and four additional reference genomes were blast searched against the ncbi nr database for gene annotation with an e value cut off of 10 5 annotation and functional analysis were performed in megan using the seed eggnog and kegg databases huerta

and similarity scores between protein sequences pearson and lipman 1988 2 4 orthologous gene family detection and gene flux analysis 24 draft genomes within the rhodocyclales order including 4 genomes within type i accumulibacter and 9 genomes within type ii accumulibacter were downloaded from ncbi and used with the two accumulibacter mags extracted from our study for orthologous gene family detection and gene flux analysis oyserman et al 2016 orthologous gene families were identified using proteinortho v5 15 with 75 coverage and 70 of identity lechner et al 2011 a phylogenetic analysis was then performed based on 59 aligned pan single copy genes as described previously oyserman et al 2016 identified orthologous gene families and the phylogeny of these 26 rhodocyclales genomes were used to conduct a gene flux analysis using count csuros 2010 orthologous gene family abundance with a gene gain loss pattern related to the denitrification pathway were extracted in order to study the evolution of the denitrification trait in accumulibacter a phylogenetic approach was applied to infer hgt ravenhall et al 2015 ancestral laterally derived flexible genes lineage specific as well as the core genome of the overall accumulibacter and the type i accumulibacter genomes were defined following methods in oyserman et al 2016 more detailed information related to downloaded rhodocyclales genomes core genome determination and hgt inference is provided in the si 2 5 ppk1 clone library construction and sequencing to characterize accumulibacter population structure a 1123bp fragment of the accumulibacter specific ppk1 gene was pcr amplified from bioreactor samples 05 19 2015 and 10 15 2015 with primers acc ppk1 254f and acc ppk1 1376r he et al 2007 detailed information about pcr

orfs 68 cloned ppk1 sequences and 781 reference ppk1 sequences were aligned using mafft and trimmed to 1007bp katoh and standley 2013 all trimmed sequences were used to construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree using fasttree 2 1 with the gtr model fig s5 because ppk1 genes extracted from assembled metagenomics contigs derive from composite genome bins that likely mask genomic microdiversity unassembled metagenomic sequence data was used to screen for accumulibacter ppk1 like fragments and resolve microdiversity of accumulibacter detailed methods for ppk1 screening from raw reads are described in the si 2 7 ppk1 gene qpcr quantification of clades ia ib ic and iic was carried out by qpcr using two distinct sets of primers targeting clade specific ppk1 gene variants qpcr reactions using a widely used primer set first reported by he et al were described previously gao et al 2017 he et al 2007 qpcr based quantification with a recently redesigned clade specific ppk1 primers that account for expanded database representation of accumulibacter diversity was performed in a biorad cfx thermal cycler biorad laboratories usa camejo et al 2016 for clade ia and ic primers

specific ppk1 failsafe premix f epicentre usa with 1x sybrgreen 1 invitrogen usa was employed in place of the itaq sybrgreen supermix the qpcr reaction volume was 20 μl with 10 μl of qpcr premix 0 35u expand hifi taq enzyme roche usa 1 μl each of 10 μm forward and reverse primer and 2 μl of genomic dna the thermal cycling protocol used for all clade specific ppk1 qpcr assays was as follows initial denaturation at 95 c for 4min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30s annealing at 65 c for 30s and extension at 72 c for 30s qpcr analysis of universal bacterial 16s rrna genes was used to normalize abundance all target genes burgmann et al 2011 all the primers applied are listed in table s5 2 8 flanking bacterial genome binning and genomic denitrification potential analysis scaffolds assembled from individual samples were binned using concoct with a minimal scaffold length of 1500bp alneberg et al 2014 the quality of genome bins was analyzed by checkm parks et al 2015 only genomes with completeness greater than 80 and contamination less than 10 were retained for downstream analysis all the flanking mags were deposited in kbase narrative cando flanking genome https narrative kbase us narrative ws 25540 obj 1 phylosift was used to taxonomically classify all extracted genome bins from different samples darling et al 2014 ani was calculated between genomes within the same bacterial family and genome bins with ani greater than 95 were considered to be the same species genome relative abundance was calculated based on the average coverage of all associated scaffolds normalized by the average coverage of 107 essential single copy genes finn et al 2011 a detailed summary of genome statistics can be found in table 1 and table s4 a combined blast and megan approach was applied to determine the genome specific metabolic potential for denitrification yu and zhang 2013 this approach is described in detail in the si to compare the genomic denitrification potential between the denitrifying ebpr process in this study and a conventional aerobic ebpr microbial system raw metagenomic reads from a previously described aerobic ebpr process were downloaded sra accession number srp038016 mao et al 2014 metagenomic assembly mapping and genome binning and annotation were performed following the protocol described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor characterization and metagenomic sequencing data collection a lab scale sbr fed with synthetic municipal wastewater was operated continuously as a denitrifying ebpr process for seven months under cyclic anaerobic anoxic phases with a short aerobic polishing phase to maximize p removal as described previously gao et al 2017 briefly a high no2 feed 35 45 mg l as n intended to mimic effluent from an upstream nitritation reactor was dosed as the sole external electron acceptor during anoxic phases over the entire operational period we observed stable and near complete n removal coupled to partial phosphate removal with similar rates of phosphate uptake under anoxic denitrifying and aerobic conditions gao et al 2017 we also observed robust dpao activity and high n2o production between 60 and 80 of no2 was converted to n2o during stable operation fig 1 to elucidate genomic potential for n transformations and n2o production and consumption in this dpao enriched bioreactor microbial consortium five samples representing biomass in different phases of reactor operation start up transition and stable phase were taken from the sbr for shotgun metagenomic sequencing fig 1 shows the initial in reactor no2 concentration start of anoxic phase percent conversion to n2o during anoxic period and the five corresponding sampling dates over 7 months of reactor operation the first sample was taken within one month of inoculation and the rest of the samples were taken after several months of no2 feeding in which we also observed high n2o accumulation 60 80 of n removed each sample was assembled separately for genome binning and functional profiling table s1 data from the last two sampling points 10 15 and 11 13 were also combined and co assembled to obtain longer contigs and higher quality accumulibacter genomes we leveraged shotgun metagenomes from this dpao enriched ebpr reactor to first assemble near complete mags of denitrifying accumulibacter strains in order to clarify denitrification capabilities and then to profile genomic potential for denitrification and n2o production consumption within the diverse non pao flanking community 3 2 accumulibacter genome assembly population characterization and assessment of microdiversity we assembled two composite accumulibacter mags cando 1 ia and cando 2 ic via analysis of shotgun metagenome data summary statistics for these two draft genomes are listed in table 1 ani scores in percentage between extracted genomes cando 1 ia and cando 2 ic and 13 accumulibacter reference genomes were calculated to assess the whole sequence similarities of the extracted genomes to previously published accumulibacter genomes fig s3 cando 1 ia ba 92 and uw 3 genomes the latter two were previously identified as clade ia genomes share an average ani of 99 indicating that they represent the same species goris et al 2007 richter and rosselló móra 2009 flowers et al 2013 skennerton et al 2014 in contrast cando 2 ic shows an ani less than 90 with all the other accumulibacter genomes the ba 92 genome was previously identified as a clade ic genome based on ppk1 gene phylogeny skennerton et al 2014 however phylogenetic analyses based on both a comprehensive ppk1 reference database and on a selected subset of cog clusters of orthologous groups families in accumulibacter genomes indicate that ba 92 more likely affiliates with clade ib fig 2 and figure s3 these results suggest that the cando 2 ic mag represents a novel accumulibacter strain distinct from currently available accumulibacter genomes and is the first published genome for accumulibacter clade ic mags are inherently composite population genomes that are known to mask strain level microdiversity to profile strain level accumulibacter diversity and to assess how representative extracted genomes were of accumulibacter community structure in the reactor we employed accumulibacter specific ppk1 gene amplification cloning and sequencing for two different samples 05 19 and 10 15 based on this analysis we identified five different accumulibacter clades ia ic iia iid and iig in the reactor with clades ia 37 clone sequences and ic 24 clone sequences being the two dominant accumulibacter clades based on relative abundance of ppk1 phylotypes throughout the operational period a phylogenetic analysis of clone sequences for the two major type i clades ia and ic is shown in fig 2 and phylogenetic inference for sequences affiliating with all five clades is shown in fig s5 type ii accumulibacter showed low abundance shortly after reactor inoculation 5 sequences for iia and singletons for both iid and iig on 05 19 and abundance declined further singleton for iia on 10 15 after six months of operation microdiversity within accumulibacter clades ia and ic was observed based on cloned sequences fig 2 labeled in orange and purple however only two accumulibacter like ppk1 sequences were screened from draft genomes fig 2 labeled in green while the ppk1 sequences recovered from draft genomes were nearly identical to ppk1 gene sequences from clone libraries the observed diversity in the clone libraries suggests that ppk1 genes extracted from assembled metagenomic contigs derive from composite genome bins that likely mask a certain amount of genomic microdiversity to further assess the dynamics of accumulibacter strains during reactor operation accumulibacter like partial ppk1 sequences were extracted directly pre assembly from merged pair end shotgun metagenome reads then assembled and clustered into phylotypes at the 99 identity level phylogenetic analysis indicated that these phylotypes affiliated with clades ia 4 phylotypes herein ia 1 to ia 4 and ic 3 phylotypes herein ic 1 to ic 3 fig 3 the relative abundances of all seven partial ppk1 phylotypes extracted from metagenomic sequencing data were calculated to explore the dynamics and diversity of accumulibacter phylotypes in the dpao enrichment reactor fig 3a among all accumulibacter ia phylotypes ia 1 ia 2 and ia 3 were nearly equally abundant initially fig s6 however ia 1 was selectively enriched from 3 to 15 35 after three months of operation while the abundance of the other clade ia phylotypes ia 2 and ia 3 increased slightly one ia phylotype ia 4 was maintained at low levels 0 3 in all samples over the course of reactor operation only one ic phylotype ic 1 was consistently present in the reactor over 7 months of operation 1 5 3 0 abundance while the other two phylotypes ic 2 and ic 3 nearly disappeared 0 5 4 months after inoculation overall the diversity within accumulibacter clade s decreased during the course of reactor operation the strong enrichment of ia 1 accounting for more than 60 of all accumulibacter suggests that this accumulibacter strain outcompeted the other accumulibacter phylotypes to utilize no2 as a terminal electron acceptor for denitrifying p uptake the two dominant phylotypes ia 1 and ic 1 representing each accumulibacter clade ia and ic were 99 identical to the two ppk1 sequences from accumulibacter mags cando 1 ia and cando 2 ic figs 2 and 3 indicating that these two accumulibacter phylotypes are representative of the two extracted composite genomes the relative abundances of two accumulibacter clades ia and ic were also calculated based on both the average coverage of the two composite genomes and the sum of the relative abundances of all ia and ic phylotypes based on ppk1 phylotypes extracted from metagenomic sequence data prior to assembly fig 3b the relative abundance of the two clades ia and ic were comparable between these two quantification methods and furthermore were consistent with quantification via qpcr using clade specific ppk1 gene primers figs s4 and si taken together phylogenetic analyses of ppk1 gene sequences from clone libraries and from unassembled metagenomic reads demonstrate microdiversity within the accumulibacter community in this reactor but also demonstrate that the draft clade ia and ic composite mags in this study are representative of the dominant accumulibacter phylotypes in this denitrifying ebpr reactor however the enrichment over time in this reactor of a single ia phylotype ia 1 over 3 other ia phylotypes ia 2 to ia 4 suggests the potential for niche differentiation at a phylogenetic scale finer than previously defined accumulibacter clades 3 3 comparative genomics of denitrification machinery in type i accumulibacter genomes to explore differences in genomic denitrification potential and the evolution of the denitrification trait within accumulibacter clades we compared denitrification associated gene homologues by performing a gene flux analysis fig 4 and table s2 oyserman et al 2016 denitrification associated gene homologues were classified as core common to all accumulibacter strains including ancestral as well as laterally derived genes with phylogenetic evidence of hgt flexible and lineage specific genes based on analysis of 13 accumulibacter genomes following methods described in oyserman et al 2016 among 28 denitrification associated gene homologues 11 were identified as core accumulibacter genes including one laterally derived gene napb and 10 ancestral genes nirlgh nirs nirnj nirbd no3 no2 transporter and napf interestingly one copy of a cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase nirs gene was found in cando 2 ic while cando 1 ia and other type i accumulibacter genomes contain two copies of nirs the nirs shared by both cando 1 ia and cando 2 1c was classified as an ancestral gene while the other copy was identified as a flexible gene with evidence of hgt it is possible that the second copy of nirs putatively acquired by hgt in cando 1 ia may provide a competitive advantage in terms of no2 utilization and lead to the enrichment of ia over ic it should be noted however that the cando 2 ic mag reported here is incomplete and additional nirs gene copies may be present in the 13 predicted to be missing a core motivation of this study was to test the hypothesis that n2o generation in this denitrifying ebpr reactor is caused by selection for dpaos accumulibacter that lack genomic capacity for n2o reduction however nosz was identified in our analysis as a core type i accumulibacter gene and is present in both the cando 1 ia and cando 2 ic mags first reported here both mags harbor clade ii atypical nosz a recently discovered nosz gene variant that is evolutionarily distinct from the typical clade i nosz jones et al 2013 sanford et al 2012 this finding indicates that accumulibacter strains present in this n2o generating reactor microbiome do in fact harbor the genomic potential for n2o consumption and therefore provides evidence against our hypothesis that n2o generation in this system is caused by selection of dpaos with truncated denitrification pathways however it is important to note that gene presence indicates functional potential but not necessarily a functional gene product as gene regulation controls the expression of genomic content differential gene expression among denitrification genes particularly the down regulation of nosz has been observed in some ebpr studies even under anaerobic aerobic conditions he and mcmahon 2010 mao et al 2014 oyserman et al 2015 in addition stop codons were detected within the assembled cando 2 ic nosz which may indicate a nonfunctional nosz in the cando 2 ic genome among the four steps of denitrification only the nir gene cluster linked to no2 reduction was identified as core to all accumulibacter genomes we examined however periplasmic nitrate reductase napagh and nitrous oxide reductase noszdfl gene clusters were also identified as core to all type i accumulibacter tables s2 a both clusters napagh and noszdf are predicted to be present in the last common ancestor lca of accumulibacter but were inferred as lost for some type ii accumulibacter genomes by gene flux analysis the loss of napagh and noszdf for type ii accumulibacter genomes indicates potentially limited denitrifying p uptake capability for type ii accumulibacter and a potential niche in anoxic systems for type i accumulibacter in support of this very limited denitrifying p uptake rates were recently reported for a type ii accumulibacter dominated pilot scale ebpr system camejo et al 2016 interestingly the membrane bound nitrate reductase gene cluster nar was only present in clade ic cando 2 ic genome recovered in this study clade iic sk 01 sk 02 and hku2 and clade iia aalborgensis iia genomes and all other type i accumulibacter genomes we examined harbored the periplasmic nitrate reductase gene cluster nap as no no3 was fed during the reactor operation the capabilities of no3 reduction for both accumulibacter clades warrant further investigation interestingly nitric oxide reductase was classified as a flexible gene acquired by hgt for type i and ii accumulibacter and it was not found in two of the six currently available type i accumulibacter draft genomes cando 2 ic retrieved in this study and hku 1 mao et al 2015 based on genome completeness estimation the likelihood of missing norb qnorb or cnorb in both genomes is only 1 9 in addition the complete accumibacter genome uw 3 ia carries an incomplete qnorb gene flowers et al 2013 other recent studies have also documented absent or unrecognized canonical nor genes in denitrifier genomes hallin et al 2017 speth et al 2016 indeed in their analysis of 652 available microbial genomes harboring denitrification genes graf et al 2014 found that 568 harbored either nirk or nirs but only 431 of these harbored a canonical nor gene this suggests that the presence of nitrite reductase but lack of a recognizable canonical nitric oxide reductase in denitrifier genomes is not uncommon generally for a typical denitrifier nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase gene clusters are located close together in the genome and are co expressed to minimize the accumulation of no heylen et al 2007 zumft 1997 however a qnorb homolog was not located upstream or downstream of the nirs genes in the cando 2 ic and hku 1 genomes the missing norb gene in the cando 2 ic draft genome could limit its capability for no2 utilization and denitrifying p uptake the mechanism and regulation of nitric oxide reduction in these accumulibacter phylotypes warrants further investigation 3 4 diversity of denitrification pathways among flanking genomes although accumulibacter is the dominant bacterial functional group in this denitrifying ebpr reactor non pao bacteria still account for over 50 of the overall microbial community this non pao flanking bacterial community besides accumulibacter could also be involved in n transformation pathways and act as a source of n2o in order to test the hypothesis that this flanking community harbored a prevalence of putative n2o producers lacking genomic capacity for n2o reduction we reconstructed individual flanking bacterial genomes for each time series sample excluding 05 19 due to low sequencing depth ultimately 39 mags were recovered with average completeness and contamination of 89 0 6 3 and 2 4 1 7 respectively detailed information including taxonomic classification and summary genome quality statistics are shown in table 1 and table s4 the sum of all mags for both accumulibacter and flanking non pao populations represents over 40 relative abundance of the overall microbial community in all samples except for 05 19 startup period fig s7 we next assessed which denitrification steps were encoded in each of the 39 high quality flanking genome bins fig 5 27 out of 39 the reconstructed genomes harbored at least one gene in the denitrification pathway surprisingly of these 27 mags only one genome encoded genes for complete denitrification based on relative abundance the 26 reconstructed genomes harboring at least one denitrification gene but not a complete denitrification pathway accounted for 75 3 8 0 of all flanking mags a similarly high prevalence of bacterial genomes with incomplete denitrification pathways was observed recently in an aquifer system and in a partial nitritation anammox bioreactor and has also been documented in complete genomes retrieved from public databases anantharaman et al 2016 graf et al 2014 hallin et al 2017 speth et al 2016 the prevalence of incomplete denitrifiers has not previously been reported in denitrifying wastewater treatment bioreactors nor in ebpr processes we identified 10 mags with capacity for no2 reduction e g harboring nirs or nirk but not for n2o reduction e g lacking nosz as putative n2o producers and 17 mags with nosz with or without upstream denitrification genes as putative n2o consumers fig 5 based on relative abundance 47 4 9 1 and 32 4 9 6 of all flanking mags were n2o consumers and producers respectively a large proportion 6 out of 10 of the putative n2o producers were assigned to the α β and γ proteobacteria in particular two n2o producing genomes assigned to the bacterial family xanthomonadaceae bins 24 and 26 were enriched in reactor samples and ranked as the two most abundant flanking bacterial genomes when relative abundance was averaged across all sampling dates this suggests that xanthomonadaceae affiliated taxa may be one of the sources of n2o in this system in agreement with this assessment pseudoxanthomonas taiwanensis sp within the family xanthomonadaceae was previously identified as a n2o producing species chen et al 2002 as shown in fig 5 the cumulative abundances of putative n2o producers with no nosz showed a strong and statistically significant increasing trend during this period relative abundance increased from 4 14 09 17 to 9 04 11 13 spearman ρ 1 p value 0 04 in addition to a high prevalence of putative n2o producers we also documented a surprisingly high number 17 of genomes harboring capacity for n2o reduction in this system despite observed stable and long term n2o accumulation in contrast to the observed statistically significant increase in abundance of putative n2o producers no clear pattern of increasing or decreasing abundance was observed for putative n2o reducers and nondenitrifiers over the course of reactor operation relative abundance 5 15 spearman p value 0 05 fig 5 two phylogenetically distinct groups of the nosz gene that catalyze n2o reduction clade i and ii nosz have been identified recently sanford et al 2012 however only clade ii nosz was identified in the reconstructed genomes in this study 14 of these genomes 82 affiliated with the phyla bacteroidetes chloroflexi ignavibacteriae proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia appear to be nondenitrifying n2o reducers with no capability for n2o production previous work with pure culture denitrifiers suggests higher growth yields but lower half saturation constants and lower maximum n2o consumption rates for clade ii nosz containing organisms compared with clade i nosz containing microorganisms yoon et al 2016 the higher growth yield could potentially have lead to the proliferation of bacteria with clade ii nosz relative to those with clade i nosz in this denitrifying ebpr process one possible explanation for the prevalence of incomplete truncated denitrification pathways in this community is that denitrification intermediates particularly n2o may be cross fed between bacterial taxa cross feeding has been hypothesized to be a useful adaptation to optimize enzyme concentrations and minimize the total concentration of intermediates hallin et al 2017 pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 for example benefits of cross feeding of no2 during denitrification have been demonstrated under controlled conditions in co cultures of isogenic mutants of the complete denitrifier pseudomonas stutzeri after deleting narg or nirs genes lilja and johnson 2016 interestingly the 14 mags of putative non denitrifying n2o reducers we assembled were incapable of no3 or no2 reduction and therefore could only obtain n2o through cross feeding under anoxic conditions however we observed stable and high n2o accumulation 60 80 no2 reduced throughout the operational period in this denitrifying ebpr process especially after the three month start up period gao et al 2017 this suggests very limited cross feeding of n2o between putative n2o producers and consumers the reasons for this aren t entirely clear but are very likely linked to the mode of reactor operation because the reactor was operated in a feast famine feeding mode as is typical of ebpr processes electron donor cod was only fed in the anaerobic phase of reactor in the later portions of the anoxic phase of the sbr cycle when n2o accumulated exogenous e g non pha or other intracellular storage polymer electron donor was thus extremely low concentration likely limiting activity of putative n2o consumers in order to compare patterns of putative n2o producers and consumers in this no2 fed denitrifying ebpr system to more conventional processes we obtained 8 mags from a previously described aerobic ebpr reactor fig s8 mao et al 2014 analysis of the denitrification associated gene complement in these genomes suggested a balanced distribution of putative n2o consumers and producers on two selected operational days day 75 10 36 and 13 97 and on day 180 3 37 and 4 90 respectively abundance for both potential n2o consumers and producers declined in this aerobic ebpr system over time compared with this ebpr system where oxygen was supplied as the electron acceptor the increasing abundance of putative n2o producers in our denitrifying ebpr system suggests that long term several months high no2 feeding may select for microbes with truncated denitrification pathways as a source of n2o 3 5 potential mechanisms of n2o accumulation in dpao enriched ebpr processes the prevalence of putative n2o producers with truncated denitrification pathways coupled to their enrichment over time in the dpao enriched process that is the focus of this study suggests that these incomplete denitrifiers in the flanking microbial community are likely a significant source of n2o accumulation in this system in addition the accumulation of n2o observed in this reactor could be partially due to the lower maximum n2o consumption rate of clade ii nosz containing bacteria compared to clade i nosz containing microorganisms yoon et al 2016 however it is notable that we also documented a complete denitrification pathway in the dominant accumulibacter strain in this system cando 1 1a and a relatively high prevalence also of putative n2o consumers in the non pao flanking community this suggests that the observed n2o accumulation in this system and in other dpao enriched systems may be driven by multiple mechanisms linked to not only to gene presence but also to gene regulation substrate electron donor or nitrogen oxide as electron acceptor availability and potentially also the presence of inhibitory compounds e g high hno2 concentration indeed in addition to activity of putative n2o producers several additional mechanisms have been proposed to explain the accumulation of n2o in both natural and engineered systems one hypothesis for accumulation of denitrification intermediates including n2o is that nitrogen oxide reductases compete for the same finite pool of intracellular electron donors pan et al 2013a 2013b thus electron donor limitation could suppress the reduction of n2o via competition for electrons among denitrification enzymes nar nir nor and nos however our reactor monitoring data showed slow n2o reduction rate even after no2 was completely consumed and n2o became the only available electron acceptor when pha was still abundant as an intercellular electron donor gao et al 2017 this suggests that electron competition is unlikely to be the primary reason for n2o accumulation in this dpao enriched bioprocess richardson et al 2009 and others have highlighted the fact that from a thermodynamic standpoint the bioenergetic penalty of a denitrifier or denitrifying community in failing to perform the final denitrification step of n2o reduction is relatively low it is possible that this relatively low energy availability provided little driving force for n2o crossfeeding and reduction in this dpao enriched bioprocess thereby leading to n2o accumulation an additional potential explanation for elevated n2o generation by bacterial taxa with complete denitrification pathways is high inhibitory no2 or hno2 concentrations or other environmental conditions that may have an impact on the expression and or the activity of nosz zhou et al 2007 2008a the free nitrous acid fna concentration in the sbr in this study was 1 5 μg hno2 n l 40 mg no2 n l at ph 7 8 at the start of the anoxic phase this level of fna was previously suggested to inhibit up to 40 of nitrous oxide reductase activity zhou et al 2007 in addition it is notable that all type i accumulibacter genomes including the two recovered in this study harbor clade ii nosz genes clade ii nosz has a different gene cluster organization and translocation pathway than clade i nosz genes sanford et al 2012 accumulibacter clade ii nos clusters lack nosr and nosx which have been implicated in regulation of the expression of clade i nosz moreover the clade i nosz promoter was not founded upstream of the assembled nosz in the cando 1 ia or cando 2 ic genomes suggesting that clade ii nosz might have a different regulatory mechanism compared with clade i nosz it is possible that for taxa harboring complete denitrification pathways like the accumulibacter clade ia strain we documented in this study the combination of elevated fna coupled to nosz gene regulation led to strong n2o accumulation as a denitrification intermediate while shotgun metagenomic data and associated comparative genomic analyses are not sufficient to test this possibility follow up metatranscriptomic analysis and or reverse transcription qpcr based measurements to clarify patterns of gene expression in this dpao enrichment culture are warranted to explore the regulation and activation of accumulibacter clade ii nosz and to assess the impact of no2 on clade ii nosz regulation and activation in the flanking non pao community these analyses could also be helpful to understand the relative contribution to nitrogen removal and n2o production of dpaos versus non pao flanking bacterial community members the modularity of the denitrification pathway and a non random co occurrence pattern between nirs nirk and nosz have been demonstrated previously graf et al 2014 hallin et al 2017 the genome centric metagenomic analysis presented here also highlights the diversity and modularity of denitrification pathways in a diverse denitrifying ebpr process and an increasing abundance of denitrifiers with truncated denitrification pathways over the course of reactor operation both potential n2o producers that lack nosz and nondenitrifying n2o reducers with clade ii nosz but no upstream structural denitrification genes were apparent in the reactor microbiome whereas only a single genome bin bin 14 in the non pao flanking community harbored a complete denitrification pathway the observation of such a high prevalence of organisms harboring at least one denitrification gene but not a complete denitrification pathway in an engineered wastewater treatment bioprocess is a novel and notable result in itself and has important implications for understanding and modeling of denitrifying processes accumulation of denitrification of intermediates and greenhouse gas production from engineered systems in particular while putative n2o producers and consumers are seeing increasing research in natural systems such as soils hallin et al 2017 there is very little available data about their prevalence or importance in engineered systems in addition the abundance and diversity of clade i versus clade ii nosz genes and associated implications for process performance in engineered systems are not well understood this study addresses these knowledge gaps but additional work is certainly warranted to evaluate the role of putative n2o producers and consumers harboring clade i and ii nosz in other denitrification bioprocesses under a variety of operational conditions scales and feed streams 4 conclusions two type i candidatus accumulibacter genomes representing clades ia and ic were assembled via whole community metagenomic analyses of a no2 fed denitrifying ebpr reactor the clade ic genome is the first published representative of this clade while the reactor inoculum harbored a diverse of accumulibacter community a single accumulibacter ia phylotype with denitrification capabilities was strongly enriched over seven months of reactor operation these additional accumulibacter genomes are invaluable for understanding niche adaptation and ecophysiology of this critically important but as yet uncultivated functional group our results demonstrate variation in genomic denitrification capabilities among accumulibacter strains based on comparative genomics of all available accumulibacter genomes with a potential advantage in denitrifying epbr systems for type i accumulibacter clades based on a comprehensive comparison of denitrification gene clusters a total of 39 flanking non pao bacterial genomes with diverse denitrification capabilities were also recovered via genome resolved metagenomic analysis 27 of these genomes harbored capacity for at least one step in the denitrification pathway but only 1 harbored a complete denitrification pathway 10 genomes associated with bacterial taxa that were enriched over the course of reactor operation harbored truncated denitrification pathways lacking nosz indicating that these taxa were putative n2o producers all genomes harboring capacity for n2o reduction putative n2o consumers harbored the recently discovered clade ii nosz these results reveal a diverse and prevalent community of flanking bacterial taxa incapable of mediating all four denitrification steps in this denitrifying ebpr process our results suggest that n2o production within this dpao enriched microbial consortium likely derives at least in part from flanking non pao denitrifying bacteria that harbor truncated denitrification pathways lack genomic capacity for n2o reduction and were enriched over the course of

18943,denitrification is the stepwise microbial reduction of nitrate or nitrite no2 to nitrogen gas via the obligate intermediates nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o substantial n2o accumulation has been reported in denitrifying enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr bioreactors enriched in denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms dpaos but little is known about underlying mechanisms for n2o generation prevalence of complete versus truncated denitrification pathways or the impact of no2 feed on dpao enriched consortia to address this knowledge gap we employed genome resolved metagenomics to investigate nitrogen transformation potential in a no2 fed denitrifying ebpr bioreactor enriched in candidatus accumulibacter and prone to n2o accumulation our analysis yielded 41 near complete metagenome assembled genomes mags including two co occurring accumulibacter strains affiliated with clades ia and ic the first published genome from this clade and 39 non pao flanking bacterial genomes the dominant accumulibacter clade ia encoded genes for complete denitrification while the lower abundance accumulibacter clade ic harbored all denitrification genes except for a canonical respiratory no reductase analysis of the 39 non pao mags revealed a high prevalence of taxa harboring an incomplete denitrification pathway of the 27 mags harboring capacity for at least one step in the denitrification pathway 10 were putative n2o producers lacking n2o reductase 16 were putative n2o reducers that lacked at least one upstream denitrification gene and only one harbored a complete denitrification pathway we also documented increasing abundance over the course of reactor operation of putative n2o producers our results suggest that the unusually high levels of n2o production observed in this accumulibacter enriched consortium are linked in part to the selection for non pao flanking microorganisms with truncated denitrification pathways graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrifying pao denitrification enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr nitrous oxide metagenome assembled genomes mags 1 introduction enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr processes are widely used for phosphorus p removal and recovery during wastewater treatment the key functional group in ebpr processes is known as polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos he and mcmahon 2011 when subjected to alternating anaerobic oxic conditions paos take up dissolved p under oxic conditions and removal of microbial biomass can then lead to effective p removal a subset of paos termed denitrifying paos dpaos are also capable of p uptake under anoxic denitrifying conditions when integrated nitrogen n and p removal from wastewater is desired such anoxic p removal via dpao activity is considered advantageous compared to oxic p removal as both oxygen and therefore aeration energy and organic carbon requirements are curbed kuba et al 1994 dpao activity over nitrite no2 rather than nitrate no3 is of particular interest when integrating ebpr with shortcut n removal systems such as nitritation denitritation that promise oxygen and energy savings relative to conventional n removal systems gao et al 2014 complete microbial denitrification involves four enzymatic reactions catalyzed by nitrate reductase nap or nar no3 to no2 nitrite reductase nir no2 to no nitric oxide reductase nor no to n2o and nitrous oxide reductase nos n2o to n2 zumft 1997 denitrification is a modular pathway and the four nitrogen oxide reductases can be activated and regulated with a certain degree of independence zumft 1997 moreover microbes harboring incomplete truncated denitrification pathways that lack one or more of the core nitrogen oxide reductases have recently been revealed by genomic analyses anantharaman et al 2016 chen et al 2002 hanke et al 2015 philippot et al 2011 skennerton et al 2014 indeed n2o is an obligate intermediate in denitrification and a subset of currently available denitrifier genomes lack the gene for nos indicating that they are putative n2o producers hallin et al 2017 other genomes harboring nos with or without upstream denitrification genes indicate genomic capacity for n2o consumption hallin et al 2017 as of yet the prevalence of complete versus incomplete denitrification pathways and corresponding balance of putative n2o producers and consumers in both engineered bioprocesses and in natural systems is not well understood the capacity for n2o production and consumption by denitrifiers and nondenitrifying n2o reducers is relevant because n2o is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 310 times higher than that of carbon dioxide co2 it also catalyzes the destruction of stratospheric ozone us epa 2012 crutzen 2016 ravishankara et al 2009 microbial denitrification is known to be one of the primary biotic n2o producing processes beaulieu et al 2011 sanford et al 2012 and wastewater treatment processes that harbor denitrifiers including ebpr processes have been identified as a potential source of n2o emissions ahn et al 2010 kampschreur et al 2009 zhou et al 2016 in addition to the potential for n2o production by denitrifiers with truncated denitrification pathways exposure to elevated no2 or to electron donor limitation have been demonstrated to affect the accumulation of n2o by denitrifiers zhou et al 2007 2008a several studies have explored short term effects of no2 during denitrification pan et al 2012 scherson et al 2013 wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2008b however the long term impact of no2 rather than no3 on denitrifying microbial community structure and function has seen little exploration understanding these impacts is particularly important for emerging shortcut n removal bioprocesses that employ no2 as a key intermediate gao et al 2014 the predominant pao in most ebpr processes is affiliated with the as yet uncultivated candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis herein accumulibacter bond et al 1995 hesselmann et al 1999 phylogenetic analyses of the polyphosphate kinase gene ppk1 have resolved the accumulibacter genus into two major divisions type i and ii and 14 clades clades ia ie and clades iia ii i camejo et al 2016 flowers et al 2009 he et al 2007 mao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 denitrifying capabilities of these different accumulibacter clades are not fully understood and only specific accumulibacter clades are thought to be capable of denitrification camejo et al 2016 flowers et al 2009 kim et al 2013 an evolutionary model of accumulibacter clade iia was constructed recently to investigate the evolution of metabolic traits that discriminate non pao from pao through ancestral genome construction and the identification of horizontal gene transfer hgt oyserman et al 2016 however the evolution of denitrification traits within accumulibacter genotypes has not been well studied limiting the understanding of n transformations in denitrifying ebpr processes accumulation of n2o has been reported in several dpao enrichment cultures and bioreactors lemaire et al 2006 meyer et al 2005 zhou et al 2016 however the specific taxa responsible for n2o production as well as mechanisms underlying n2o generation are not clear due to the complexity of the associated microbial consortia gao et al 2017 while recent studies have compared potential for denitrification among currently available accumulibacter genomes flowers et al 2013 skennerton et al 2014 none of these genomes derive from dpaos enriched under long term anaerobic anoxic conditions with no2 supplied as the terminal electron acceptor and none derive from reactors or enrichments in which n2o is the dominant product of denitrification furthermore the relative abundance of accumulibacter in pao enriched systems can vary from 20 to 80 even in well controlled lab scale ebpr bioreactors with stable p removal he et al 2010 kampschreur et al 2009 zhou et al 2016 the function of the diverse non accumulibacter flanking community in denitrifying ebpr processes has not been well studied and the prevalence of complete versus truncated denitrification pathways in these bioprocesses as well as genomic potential for n2o production or consumption is not known this is due in part to the limited number of metagenomic sequencing studies and the difficulty in extracting genomes for minority community members below 1 relative abundance without deep sequencing albertsen et al 2013 the aim of this study was to investigate genomic potential for complete versus truncated denitrification by accumulibacter and non pao community members in a denitrifying ebpr process and to identify specific accumulibacter clades as well as other flanking microbial populations as potential sinks and sources of n2o when a high no2 feed was supplied to this end we applied genome resolved metagenomic analysis to study the composition and functional potential of a dpao enriched bioprocess previously shown to generate unusually high levels of n2o 70 of n gao et al 2017 we hypothesized that the n2o generation in this dpao enriched denitrifying ebpr process is linked to 1 selection for dpaos accumulibacter with truncated denitrification pathways that lack genomic capacity for n2o reduction and or 2 selection for non pao denitrifiers in the flanking microbial community that lack genomic capacity for n2o reduction and are therefore putative n2o producers 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation a 14l lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with 12l working volume was operated continuously as a denitrifying biological phosphorus removal system for 7 months under cyclic anaerobic and anoxic conditions with a short aerobic polishing step in order to enrich denitrifying paos the reactor was inoculated with activated sludge from the stickney water reclamation plant chicago il and operated under a feast famine feeding strategy with synthetic municipal wastewater detailed reactor operating conditions performance and experimental methods for key metabolite acetate propionate phas no2 n2o and po4 3 measurements are available in the si and follow those described previously gao et al 2017 briefly acetate or propionate was dosed at the start of the anaerobic cod rich period as the electron donor the electron donor was switched between acetate and propionate every two sbr cycles to enrich accumulibacter specific paos lu et al 2006 in the anoxic cod deplete phase high no2 feed intended to mimic effluent from a nitritation reactor was dosed as a terminal electron acceptor for denitrification with no ammonia added no2 was the sole n source for bacterial growth no inert gas was sparged during denitrification and anoxic conditions were confirmed via online monitoring of dissolved oxygen concentration with an ldo sensor hach usa the reactor operation was separated into three different phases based on the concentration of c and n in reactor feed 1 start up phase 4 26 8 24 initial cod 80 mg l and no2 20 mg n l in the anaerobic and anoxic periods respectively with a 12 h sbr cycle length 2

preparation and metagenomic sequencing at the beijing genomics institute bgi shenzhen china using a 2 150bp paired end run on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform with an average library insert size of 380 bp in total 81 9 gbp of raw sequencing data was produced adaptor trimming and quality control was done by bgi with q20 90 and q30 85 generating roughly 75 8 gbp of clean data the quality of metagenomic sequencing data for each sample was checked by fastqc andrews 2011 metagenomic reads in each individual sample were de novo assembled in the clc genomics workbench v6 0 2 clcbio qiagen using a kmer of 63 minimal contig length of 500 bp and scaffolding enabled the quality for each assembled scaffold was checked by quast gurevich et al 2013 sequence coverage for each assembled

performed for each sample using the doe joint genome institute s integrated microbial genome database tool with biosample id of gb0150360 0150364 markowitz et al 2012 2 3 accumulibacter genome binning

used to conduct a gene flux analysis using count csuros 2010 orthologous gene family abundance with a gene gain loss pattern related to the denitrification pathway were extracted in order to study the evolution of the denitrification trait in accumulibacter a phylogenetic approach was applied to infer hgt ravenhall et al 2015 ancestral laterally derived flexible genes lineage specific as well as the core genome of the overall accumulibacter and the type i accumulibacter genomes were defined following methods in oyserman et al 2016 more detailed information related to downloaded rhodocyclales

phylogenetic tree using fasttree 2 1 with the gtr model fig s5 because ppk1 genes extracted from assembled metagenomics contigs derive from composite genome bins that likely mask genomic microdiversity unassembled metagenomic sequence data was used to screen for accumulibacter ppk1 like fragments and resolve microdiversity of accumulibacter detailed methods for ppk1 screening from raw reads are described in the si 2 7 ppk1 gene qpcr quantification of clades ia ib ic and iic was carried out by qpcr using two distinct sets of primers targeting clade specific ppk1 gene variants qpcr reactions using a widely used primer set first reported by he et al were described previously gao et al 2017 he et al 2007 qpcr based quantification with a recently redesigned clade specific ppk1

to normalize abundance all target genes burgmann et al 2011 all the primers applied are listed in table s5 2 8 flanking bacterial genome binning and genomic denitrification potential analysis scaffolds assembled from individual samples were binned using concoct with a minimal scaffold length of 1500bp alneberg et al 2014 the quality of genome bins was analyzed by checkm parks et al 2015 only genomes with completeness greater than 80 and contamination less than 10 were retained for downstream analysis all the flanking mags were deposited in kbase narrative cando flanking genome https narrative kbase us narrative ws 25540 obj 1 phylosift was used to taxonomically classify all extracted genome bins from different samples darling et al 2014 ani was calculated between genomes within

scaffolds normalized by the average coverage of 107 essential single copy genes finn et al 2011 a detailed summary of genome statistics can be found in table 1 and table s4 a combined blast and megan approach was applied to determine the genome specific metabolic potential for denitrification yu and zhang 2013 this approach is described in detail in the si to compare the genomic denitrification potential between the denitrifying ebpr process in this study and a conventional aerobic ebpr microbial system raw metagenomic reads from a previously described aerobic ebpr process were downloaded sra accession number srp038016 mao et al 2014 metagenomic assembly mapping and genome binning and annotation were performed following the protocol described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor characterization and metagenomic sequencing data collection a lab scale sbr fed with synthetic municipal wastewater was operated continuously as a denitrifying ebpr process for seven months under cyclic anaerobic anoxic phases with a short aerobic polishing phase to maximize p removal as described previously gao et al 2017 briefly a high no2 feed 35 45 mg l as n intended to mimic effluent from an upstream nitritation reactor was dosed as the sole external electron acceptor during anoxic phases over the entire operational period we observed stable and near complete n removal coupled to partial phosphate removal with similar rates of phosphate uptake under anoxic denitrifying and aerobic conditions gao et al 2017 we also observed robust dpao activity and high n2o production between 60 and 80 of no2 was converted to n2o during stable operation fig 1 to elucidate genomic potential for n transformations and n2o production and consumption in this dpao enriched bioreactor microbial consortium five samples representing biomass in different phases of reactor operation start up transition and stable phase were taken from the sbr for shotgun metagenomic sequencing fig 1 shows the initial in reactor no2 concentration start of anoxic phase percent conversion to n2o during anoxic period and the five corresponding sampling dates over 7 months of reactor operation the first sample was taken within one month of inoculation and the rest of the samples were taken after several months of no2 feeding in which we also observed high n2o accumulation 60 80 of n removed each sample was assembled separately for genome binning and functional profiling table s1 data from the last two sampling points 10 15 and 11 13 were also combined and co assembled to obtain longer contigs and higher quality accumulibacter genomes we leveraged shotgun metagenomes from this dpao enriched ebpr reactor to first assemble near complete mags of denitrifying accumulibacter strains in order to clarify denitrification capabilities and then to profile genomic potential for denitrification and n2o production consumption within the diverse non pao flanking community 3 2 accumulibacter genome assembly population characterization and assessment of microdiversity we assembled two composite accumulibacter mags cando 1 ia and cando 2 ic via analysis of shotgun metagenome data summary statistics for these two draft genomes are listed in table 1 ani scores in percentage between extracted genomes cando 1 ia and cando 2 ic and 13 accumulibacter reference genomes were calculated to assess the whole sequence similarities of the extracted genomes to previously published accumulibacter genomes fig s3 cando 1 ia ba 92 and uw 3 genomes the latter two were previously identified as clade ia genomes share an average ani of 99 indicating that they represent the same species goris et al 2007 richter and rosselló móra 2009 flowers et al 2013 skennerton et al 2014 in contrast cando 2 ic shows an ani less than 90 with all the other accumulibacter genomes the ba 92 genome was previously identified as a clade ic genome based on ppk1 gene phylogeny skennerton et al 2014 however phylogenetic analyses based on both a comprehensive ppk1 reference database and on a selected subset of cog clusters of orthologous groups families in accumulibacter genomes indicate that ba 92 more likely affiliates with clade ib fig 2 and figure s3 these results suggest that the cando 2 ic mag represents a novel accumulibacter strain distinct from currently available accumulibacter genomes and is the first published genome for accumulibacter clade ic mags are inherently composite population genomes that are known to mask strain level microdiversity to profile strain level accumulibacter diversity and to assess how representative extracted genomes were of accumulibacter community structure in the reactor we employed accumulibacter specific ppk1 gene amplification cloning and sequencing for two different samples 05 19 and 10 15 based on this analysis we identified five different accumulibacter clades ia ic iia iid and iig in the reactor with clades ia 37 clone sequences and ic 24 clone sequences being the two dominant accumulibacter clades based on relative abundance of ppk1 phylotypes throughout the operational period a phylogenetic analysis of clone sequences for the two major type i clades ia and ic is shown in fig 2 and phylogenetic inference for sequences affiliating with all five clades is shown in fig s5 type ii accumulibacter showed low abundance shortly after reactor inoculation 5 sequences for iia and singletons for both iid and iig on 05 19 and abundance declined further singleton for iia on 10 15 after six months of operation microdiversity within accumulibacter clades ia and ic was observed based on cloned sequences fig 2 labeled in orange and purple however only two accumulibacter like ppk1 sequences were screened from draft genomes fig 2 labeled in green while the ppk1 sequences recovered from draft genomes were nearly identical to ppk1 gene sequences from clone libraries the observed diversity in the clone libraries suggests that ppk1 genes extracted from assembled metagenomic contigs derive from composite genome bins that likely mask a certain amount of genomic microdiversity to further assess the dynamics of accumulibacter strains during reactor operation accumulibacter like partial ppk1 sequences were extracted directly pre assembly from merged pair end shotgun metagenome reads then assembled and clustered into phylotypes at the 99 identity level phylogenetic analysis indicated that these phylotypes affiliated with clades ia 4 phylotypes herein ia 1 to ia 4 and ic 3 phylotypes herein ic 1 to ic 3 fig 3 the relative abundances of all seven partial ppk1 phylotypes extracted from metagenomic sequencing data were calculated to explore the dynamics and diversity of accumulibacter phylotypes in the dpao enrichment reactor fig 3a among all accumulibacter ia phylotypes ia 1 ia 2 and ia 3 were nearly equally abundant initially fig s6 however ia 1 was selectively enriched from 3 to 15 35 after three months of operation while the abundance of the other clade ia phylotypes ia 2 and ia 3 increased slightly one ia phylotype ia 4 was maintained at low levels 0 3 in all samples over the course of reactor operation only one ic phylotype ic 1 was consistently present in the reactor over 7 months of operation 1 5 3 0 abundance while the other two phylotypes ic 2 and ic 3 nearly disappeared 0 5 4 months after inoculation overall the diversity within accumulibacter clade s decreased during the course of reactor operation the strong enrichment of ia 1 accounting for more than 60 of all accumulibacter suggests that this accumulibacter strain outcompeted the other accumulibacter phylotypes to utilize no2 as a terminal electron acceptor for denitrifying p uptake the two dominant phylotypes ia 1 and ic 1 representing each accumulibacter clade ia and ic were 99 identical to the two ppk1 sequences from accumulibacter mags cando 1 ia and cando 2 ic figs 2 and 3 indicating that these two accumulibacter phylotypes are representative of the two extracted composite genomes the relative abundances of two accumulibacter clades ia and ic were also calculated based on both the average coverage of the two composite genomes and the sum of the relative abundances of all ia and ic phylotypes based on ppk1 phylotypes extracted from metagenomic sequence data prior to assembly fig 3b the relative abundance of the two clades ia and ic were comparable between these two quantification methods and furthermore were consistent with quantification via qpcr using clade specific ppk1 gene primers figs s4 and si taken together phylogenetic analyses of ppk1 gene sequences from clone libraries and from unassembled metagenomic reads demonstrate microdiversity within the accumulibacter community in this reactor but also demonstrate that the draft clade ia and ic composite mags in this study are representative of the dominant accumulibacter phylotypes in this denitrifying ebpr reactor however the enrichment over time in this reactor of a single ia phylotype ia 1 over 3 other ia phylotypes ia 2 to ia 4 suggests the potential for niche differentiation at a phylogenetic scale finer than previously defined accumulibacter clades 3 3 comparative genomics of denitrification machinery in type i accumulibacter genomes to explore differences in genomic denitrification potential and the evolution of the denitrification trait within accumulibacter clades we compared denitrification associated gene homologues by performing a gene flux analysis fig 4 and table s2 oyserman et al 2016 denitrification associated gene homologues were classified as core common to all accumulibacter strains including ancestral as well as laterally derived genes with phylogenetic evidence of hgt flexible and lineage specific genes based on analysis of 13 accumulibacter genomes following methods described in oyserman et al 2016 among 28 denitrification associated gene homologues 11 were identified as core accumulibacter genes including one laterally derived gene napb and 10 ancestral genes nirlgh nirs nirnj nirbd no3 no2 transporter and napf interestingly one copy of a cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase nirs gene was found in cando 2 ic while cando 1 ia and other type i accumulibacter genomes contain two copies of nirs the nirs shared by both cando 1 ia and cando 2 1c was classified as an ancestral gene while the other copy was identified as a flexible gene with evidence of hgt it is possible that the second copy of nirs putatively acquired by hgt in cando 1 ia may provide a competitive advantage in terms of no2 utilization and lead to the enrichment of ia over ic it should be noted however that the cando 2 ic mag reported here is incomplete and additional nirs gene copies may be present in the 13 predicted to be missing a core motivation of this study was to test the hypothesis that n2o generation in this denitrifying ebpr reactor is caused by selection for dpaos accumulibacter that lack genomic capacity for n2o reduction however nosz was identified in our analysis as a core type i accumulibacter gene and is present in both the cando 1 ia and cando 2 ic mags first reported here both mags harbor clade ii atypical nosz a recently discovered nosz gene variant that is evolutionarily distinct from the typical clade i nosz jones et al 2013 sanford et al 2012 this finding indicates that accumulibacter strains present in this n2o generating reactor microbiome do in fact harbor the genomic potential for n2o consumption and therefore provides evidence against our hypothesis that n2o generation in this system is caused by selection of dpaos with truncated denitrification pathways however it is important to note that gene presence indicates functional potential but not necessarily a functional gene product as gene regulation controls the expression of genomic content differential gene expression among denitrification genes particularly the down regulation of nosz has been observed in some ebpr studies even under anaerobic aerobic conditions he and mcmahon 2010 mao et al 2014 oyserman et al 2015 in addition stop codons were detected within the assembled cando 2 ic nosz which may indicate a nonfunctional nosz in the cando 2 ic genome among the four steps of denitrification only the nir gene cluster linked to no2 reduction was identified as core to all accumulibacter genomes we examined however periplasmic nitrate reductase napagh and nitrous oxide reductase noszdfl gene clusters were also identified as core to all type i accumulibacter tables s2 a both clusters napagh and noszdf are predicted to be present in the last common ancestor lca of accumulibacter but were inferred as lost for some type ii accumulibacter genomes by gene flux analysis the loss of napagh and noszdf for type ii accumulibacter genomes indicates potentially limited denitrifying p uptake capability for type ii accumulibacter and a potential niche in anoxic systems for type i accumulibacter in support of this very limited denitrifying p uptake rates were recently reported for a type ii accumulibacter dominated pilot scale ebpr system camejo et al 2016 interestingly the membrane bound nitrate reductase gene cluster nar was only present in clade ic cando 2 ic genome recovered in this study clade iic sk 01 sk 02 and hku2 and clade iia aalborgensis iia genomes and all other type i accumulibacter genomes we examined harbored the periplasmic nitrate reductase gene cluster nap as no no3 was fed during the reactor operation the capabilities of no3 reduction for both accumulibacter clades warrant further investigation interestingly nitric oxide reductase was classified as a flexible gene acquired by hgt for type i and ii accumulibacter and it was not found in two of the six currently available type i accumulibacter draft genomes cando 2 ic retrieved in this study and hku 1 mao et al 2015 based on genome completeness estimation the likelihood of missing norb qnorb or cnorb in both genomes is only 1 9 in addition the complete accumibacter genome uw 3 ia carries an incomplete qnorb gene flowers et al 2013 other recent studies have also documented absent or unrecognized canonical nor genes in denitrifier genomes hallin et al 2017 speth et al 2016 indeed in their analysis of 652 available microbial genomes harboring denitrification genes graf et al 2014 found that 568 harbored either nirk or nirs but only 431 of these harbored a canonical nor gene this suggests that the presence of nitrite reductase but lack of a recognizable canonical nitric oxide reductase in denitrifier genomes is not uncommon generally for a typical denitrifier nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase gene clusters are located close together in the genome and are co expressed to minimize the accumulation of no heylen et al 2007 zumft 1997 however a qnorb homolog was not located upstream or downstream of the nirs genes in the cando 2 ic and hku 1 genomes the missing norb gene in the cando 2 ic draft genome could limit its capability for no2 utilization and denitrifying p uptake the mechanism and regulation of nitric oxide reduction in these accumulibacter phylotypes warrants further investigation 3 4 diversity of denitrification pathways among flanking genomes although accumulibacter is the dominant bacterial functional group in this denitrifying ebpr reactor non pao bacteria still account for over 50 of the overall microbial community this non pao flanking bacterial community besides accumulibacter could also be involved in n transformation pathways and act as a source of n2o in order to test the hypothesis that this flanking community harbored a prevalence of putative n2o producers lacking genomic capacity for n2o reduction we reconstructed individual flanking bacterial genomes for each time series sample excluding 05 19 due to low sequencing depth ultimately 39 mags were recovered with average completeness and contamination of 89 0 6 3 and 2 4 1 7 respectively detailed information including taxonomic classification and summary genome quality statistics are shown in table 1 and table s4 the sum of all mags for both accumulibacter and flanking non pao populations represents over 40 relative abundance of the overall microbial community in all samples except for 05 19 startup period fig s7 we next assessed which denitrification steps were encoded in each of the 39 high quality flanking genome bins fig 5 27 out of 39 the reconstructed genomes harbored at least one gene in the denitrification pathway surprisingly of these 27 mags only one genome encoded genes for complete denitrification based on relative abundance the 26 reconstructed genomes harboring at least one denitrification gene but not a complete denitrification pathway accounted for 75 3 8 0 of all flanking mags a similarly high prevalence of bacterial genomes with incomplete denitrification pathways was observed recently in an aquifer system and in a partial nitritation anammox bioreactor and has also been documented in complete genomes retrieved from public databases anantharaman et al 2016 graf et al 2014 hallin et al 2017 speth et al 2016 the prevalence of incomplete denitrifiers has not previously been reported in denitrifying wastewater treatment bioreactors nor in ebpr processes we identified 10 mags with capacity for no2 reduction e g harboring nirs or nirk but not for n2o reduction e g lacking nosz as putative n2o producers and 17 mags with nosz with or without upstream denitrification genes as putative n2o consumers fig 5 based on relative abundance 47 4 9 1 and 32 4 9 6 of all flanking mags were n2o consumers and producers respectively a large proportion 6 out of 10 of the putative n2o producers were assigned to the α β and γ proteobacteria in particular two n2o producing genomes assigned to the bacterial family xanthomonadaceae bins 24 and 26 were enriched in reactor samples and ranked as the two most abundant flanking bacterial genomes when relative abundance was averaged across all sampling dates this suggests that xanthomonadaceae affiliated taxa may be one of the sources of n2o in this system in agreement with this assessment pseudoxanthomonas taiwanensis sp within the family xanthomonadaceae was previously identified as a n2o producing species chen et al 2002 as shown in fig 5 the cumulative abundances of putative n2o producers with no nosz showed a strong and statistically significant increasing trend during this period relative abundance increased from 4 14 09 17 to 9 04 11 13 spearman ρ 1 p value 0 04 in addition to a high prevalence of putative n2o producers we also documented a surprisingly high number 17 of genomes harboring capacity for n2o reduction in this system despite observed stable and long term n2o accumulation in contrast to the observed statistically significant increase in abundance of putative n2o producers no clear pattern of increasing or decreasing abundance was observed for putative n2o reducers and nondenitrifiers over the course of reactor operation relative abundance 5 15 spearman p value 0 05 fig 5 two phylogenetically distinct groups of the nosz gene that catalyze n2o reduction clade i and ii nosz have been identified recently sanford et al 2012 however only clade ii nosz was identified in the reconstructed genomes in this study 14 of these genomes 82 affiliated with the phyla bacteroidetes chloroflexi ignavibacteriae proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia appear to be nondenitrifying n2o reducers with no capability for n2o production previous work with pure culture denitrifiers suggests higher growth yields but lower half saturation constants and lower maximum n2o consumption rates for clade ii nosz containing organisms compared with clade i nosz containing microorganisms yoon et al 2016 the higher growth yield could potentially have lead to the proliferation of bacteria with clade ii nosz relative to those with clade i nosz in this denitrifying ebpr process one possible explanation for the prevalence of incomplete truncated denitrification pathways in this community is that denitrification intermediates particularly n2o may be cross fed between bacterial taxa cross feeding has been hypothesized to be a useful adaptation to optimize enzyme concentrations and minimize the total concentration of intermediates hallin et al 2017 pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 for example benefits of cross feeding of no2 during denitrification have been demonstrated under controlled conditions in co cultures of isogenic mutants of the complete denitrifier pseudomonas stutzeri after deleting narg or nirs genes lilja and johnson 2016 interestingly the 14 mags of putative non denitrifying n2o reducers we assembled were incapable of no3 or no2 reduction and therefore could only obtain n2o through cross feeding under anoxic conditions however we observed stable and high n2o accumulation 60 80 no2 reduced throughout the operational period in this denitrifying ebpr process especially after the three month start up period gao et al 2017 this suggests very limited cross feeding of n2o between putative n2o producers and consumers the reasons for this aren t entirely clear but are very likely linked to the mode of reactor operation because the reactor was operated in a feast famine feeding mode as is typical of ebpr processes electron donor cod was only fed in the anaerobic phase of reactor in the later portions of the anoxic phase of the sbr cycle when n2o accumulated exogenous e g non pha or other intracellular storage polymer electron donor was thus extremely low concentration likely limiting activity of putative n2o consumers in order to compare patterns of putative n2o producers and consumers in this no2 fed denitrifying ebpr system to more conventional processes we obtained 8 mags from a previously described aerobic ebpr reactor fig s8 mao et al 2014 analysis of the denitrification associated gene complement in these genomes suggested a balanced distribution of putative n2o consumers and producers on two selected operational days day 75 10 36 and 13 97 and on day 180 3 37 and 4 90 respectively abundance for both potential n2o consumers and producers declined in this aerobic ebpr system over time compared with this ebpr system where oxygen was supplied as the electron acceptor the increasing abundance of putative n2o producers in our denitrifying ebpr system suggests that long term several months high no2 feeding may select for microbes with truncated denitrification pathways as a source of n2o 3 5 potential mechanisms of n2o accumulation in dpao enriched ebpr processes the prevalence of putative n2o producers with truncated denitrification pathways coupled to their enrichment over time in the dpao enriched process that is the focus of this study suggests that these incomplete denitrifiers in the flanking microbial community are likely a significant source of n2o accumulation in this system in addition the accumulation of n2o observed in this reactor could be partially due to the lower maximum n2o consumption rate of clade ii nosz containing bacteria compared to clade i nosz containing microorganisms yoon et al 2016 however it is notable that we also documented a complete denitrification pathway in the dominant accumulibacter strain in this system cando 1 1a and a relatively high prevalence also of putative n2o consumers in the non pao flanking community this suggests that the observed n2o accumulation in this system and in other dpao enriched systems may be driven by multiple mechanisms linked to not only to gene presence but also to gene regulation substrate electron donor or nitrogen oxide as electron acceptor availability and potentially also the presence of inhibitory compounds e g high hno2 concentration indeed in addition to activity of putative n2o producers several additional mechanisms have been proposed to explain the accumulation of n2o in both natural and engineered systems one hypothesis for accumulation of denitrification intermediates including n2o is that nitrogen oxide reductases compete for the same finite pool of intracellular electron donors pan et al 2013a 2013b thus electron donor limitation could suppress the reduction of n2o via competition for electrons among denitrification enzymes nar nir nor and nos however our reactor monitoring data showed slow n2o reduction rate even after no2 was completely consumed and n2o became the only available electron acceptor when pha was still abundant as an intercellular electron donor gao et al 2017 this suggests that electron competition is unlikely to be the primary reason for n2o accumulation in this dpao enriched bioprocess richardson et al 2009 and others have highlighted the fact that from a thermodynamic standpoint the bioenergetic penalty of a denitrifier or denitrifying community in failing to perform the final denitrification step of n2o reduction is relatively low it is possible that this relatively low energy availability provided little driving force for n2o crossfeeding and reduction in this dpao enriched bioprocess thereby leading to n2o accumulation an additional potential explanation for elevated n2o generation by bacterial taxa with complete denitrification pathways is high inhibitory no2 or hno2 concentrations or other environmental conditions that may have an impact on the expression and or the activity of nosz zhou et al 2007 2008a the free nitrous acid fna concentration in the sbr in this study was 1 5 μg hno2 n l 40 mg no2 n l at ph 7 8 at the start of the anoxic phase this level of fna was previously suggested to inhibit up to 40 of nitrous oxide reductase activity zhou et al 2007 in addition it is notable that all type i accumulibacter genomes including the two recovered in this study harbor clade ii nosz genes clade ii nosz has a different gene cluster organization and translocation pathway than clade i nosz genes sanford et al 2012 accumulibacter clade ii nos clusters lack nosr and nosx which have been implicated in regulation of the expression of clade i nosz moreover the clade i nosz promoter was not founded upstream of the assembled nosz in the cando 1 ia or cando 2 ic genomes suggesting that clade ii nosz might have a different regulatory mechanism compared with clade i nosz it is possible that for taxa harboring complete denitrification pathways like the accumulibacter clade ia strain we documented in this study the combination of elevated fna coupled to nosz gene regulation led to strong n2o accumulation as a denitrification intermediate while shotgun metagenomic data and associated comparative genomic analyses are not sufficient to test this possibility follow up metatranscriptomic analysis and or reverse transcription qpcr based measurements to clarify patterns of gene expression in this dpao enrichment culture are warranted to explore the regulation and activation of accumulibacter clade ii nosz and to assess the impact of no2 on clade ii nosz regulation and activation in the flanking non pao community these analyses could also be helpful to understand the relative contribution to nitrogen removal and n2o production of dpaos versus non pao flanking bacterial community members the modularity of the denitrification pathway and a non random co occurrence pattern between nirs nirk and nosz have been demonstrated previously graf et al 2014 hallin et al 2017 the genome centric metagenomic analysis presented here also highlights the diversity and modularity of denitrification pathways in a diverse denitrifying ebpr process and an increasing abundance of denitrifiers with truncated denitrification pathways over the course of reactor operation both potential n2o producers that lack nosz and nondenitrifying n2o reducers with clade ii nosz but no upstream structural denitrification genes were apparent in the reactor microbiome whereas only a single genome bin bin 14 in the non pao flanking community harbored a complete denitrification pathway the observation of such a high prevalence of organisms harboring at least one denitrification gene but not a complete denitrification pathway in an engineered wastewater treatment bioprocess is a novel and notable result in itself and has important implications for understanding and modeling of denitrifying processes accumulation of denitrification of intermediates and greenhouse gas production from engineered systems in particular while putative n2o producers and consumers are seeing increasing research in natural systems such as soils hallin et al 2017 there is very little available data about their prevalence or importance in engineered systems in addition the abundance and diversity of clade i versus clade ii nosz genes and associated implications for process performance in engineered systems are not well understood this study addresses these knowledge gaps but additional work is certainly warranted to evaluate the role of putative n2o producers and consumers harboring clade i and ii nosz in other denitrification bioprocesses under a variety of operational conditions scales and feed streams 4 conclusions two type i candidatus accumulibacter genomes representing clades ia and ic were assembled via whole community metagenomic analyses of a no2 fed denitrifying ebpr reactor the clade ic genome is the first published representative of this clade while the reactor inoculum harbored a diverse of accumulibacter community a single accumulibacter ia phylotype with denitrification capabilities was strongly enriched over seven months of reactor operation these additional accumulibacter genomes are invaluable for understanding niche adaptation and ecophysiology of this critically important but as yet uncultivated functional group our results demonstrate variation in genomic denitrification capabilities among accumulibacter strains based on comparative genomics of all available accumulibacter genomes with a potential advantage in denitrifying epbr systems for type i accumulibacter clades based on a comprehensive comparison of denitrification gene clusters a total of 39 flanking non pao bacterial genomes with diverse denitrification capabilities were also recovered via genome resolved metagenomic analysis 27 of these genomes harbored capacity for at least one step in the denitrification pathway but only 1 harbored a complete denitrification pathway 10 genomes associated with bacterial taxa that were enriched over the course of reactor operation harbored truncated denitrification pathways lacking nosz indicating that these taxa were putative n2o producers all genomes harboring capacity for n2o reduction putative n2o consumers harbored the recently discovered clade ii nosz these results reveal a diverse and prevalent community of flanking bacterial taxa incapable of mediating all four denitrification steps in this denitrifying ebpr process our results suggest that n2o production within this dpao enriched microbial consortium likely derives at least in part from flanking non pao denitrifying bacteria that harbor truncated denitrification pathways lack genomic capacity for n2o reduction and were enriched over the course of

18944,the stable operation of the partial nitritation and anammox pn a process is a challenge in the treatment of low strength ammonia wastewater like sewage mainstream this study demonstrated the feasibility of achieving stable operation in the treatment of 50 mg l ammonia wastewater with a micro granule based pn a reactor the long term operation results showed nitrogen removal efficiencies of 71 8 9 9 were stably obtained under a relatively short hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 h the analysis on the physicochemical properties of the granules indicated most of the granules were in a size in a range of 265 536 μm and the elementary composition of the granules was determined to be ch1 61o0 61n0 17s0 01p0 03 the microbial analysis revealed candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis anammox bacteria and nitrosomonas like aob were the two most dominant bacteria with 27 6 and 10 5 abundance respectively both of which formed spatially syntrophic co immobilization within the micro granules the ex situ activity tests showed the activity of nob was well limited through do regulation in the reactor these results provide an alternative pn a process configuration for low strength wastewater treatment by sustaining microstate granules optimization of the nitrogen sludge loading rate and do regulation are important for the successful performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords micro granule partial nitritation anammox aob low strength hrt 2h 1 introduction the nitrification denitrification process in the conventional activated sludge cas system for sewage treatment is an energy intensive endeavor in wastewater treatment plants wwtps which have adopted the cas system approximately half of the energy input is consumed for aeration clearly a new configuration of wwtps is urgently needed to achieve the energy efficient removal of nitrogen there has been a shift from the dominant paradigm to new generation wwtps which involve the front separation of organic carbon for bioenergy recovery and the subsequent autotrophic nitrogen removal through the synergy between nitritation by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob oxidizing part of nh4 to no2 and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox by anammox bacteria which convert nh4 and no2 to nitrogen gas liu et al 2017 many studies have been implemented on different scales to investigate the feasibility of achieving anammox based nitrogen removal from mainstream wastewater by the partial nitritation and anammox pn a process however the application of mainstream pn a remains challenging largely due to the unstable partial nitritation and inactivation of anammox resulting from both low nitrogen concentrations and low temperatures reino and eugenia 2016 in addition due to the long doubling time of around 19 days at 25 c of anammox bacteria sabine marie et al 2015 the retention of these microorganisms in the treatment systems is difficult to guarantee at levels required for process functionality the inadequate retention of anammox bacteria results in process bottleneck excellent anammox bacteria retention and biomass settleability can be obtained through biomass granulation ni et al 2010 vlaeminck et al 2010 granules with high cell density strengthen the information exchange and cooperation among bacteria in effect enhancing bacterial metabolism and activity cao et al 2017 lin and wang 2017 multiple investigations designed to evaluate the treatment performances and determine the specific properties of anammox granules have been reported however the attention of these studies tends to have been focused on granules formed in the high strength wastewater fed reactors nitrogen concentration 100 mg l gonzalez gil et al 2015 lin and wang 2017 ni et al 2010 vlaeminck et al 2010 in these studies the size of the majority of the granules is comparable to or larger than 1 mm in granule based anammox bioreactors the diameter size of granular sludge is an important parameter influencing the operation performance which is affected by the shape of the reactor hydraulic shear force and substrate loading rate and other factors ma et al 2013 tang et al 2011 a recent report by zhu et al 2018 demonstrated that it is not the bigger size granules that drive better performance in low strength wastewater treatment and that the optimal anammox granules sizes in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor are 0 5 0 9 mm it is to be questioned whether similarly sized granules could improve the performance of pn a reactors as well additionally high shear stress induced by complete mixing in pn a reactors may produce granules that are smaller than observed by zhu et al 2018 nonetheless studies associated with very small size anammox granules formed in low strength wastewater fed reactors are still scarce furthermore granules formed in a single stage pn a reactor are expected to comprise a consortium of anammox bacteria and aob embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps vlaeminck et al 2010 however the microbial abundance activity and community structure of very small size anammox granules co embedded with anammox bacteria and aob are not well understood the aim of this work was to optimize the operational conditions and syntrophic micro granule in pn a reactor for low strength ammonia wastewater treatment the specific objectives were to 1 investigate aob anammox bacteria co immobilization in very small size granules for low strength ammonia wastewater treatment 2 explore factors to achieve stable operation and efficient nitrogen removal performance 3 unravel the physicochemical properties of the micro granules formed through detection of particle sizes distribution and determining their elemental composition and microbial properties using fluorescent in situ hybridization fish 16s rrna gene sequencing and specific activity tests the results provide an alternative configuration for a pn a reactor and illustrate that the anammox granules with very small sizes still drive highly efficient performance in mainstream treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation a lab scale integrated reactor was developed to concurrently achieving pn a sedimentation and sludge circulation as shown in fig 1 an air lift completely mixed zone with 2 l of effective volume was used as reaction unit for pn a while an inclined plate zone with 0 4 l of volume was employed to serve as sedimentation unit in which the sediments can be returned to the reaction unit under the driving force by airlift air was supplied by a constant speed diaphragm pump apn 085 lv 1 iwaki japan to the bottom of the reaction area through a fixed glass tube to provide continuous air lift mixing and oxygen diffusion the continuous air lifting mixing performance can be seen in the supplementary video a rotameter was used to regulate the aeration rate a peristaltic pump fp 100 1515 as one japan was used to transfer synthetic influent to the reactor the temperature in the reactor was maintained by use of a water jacket at 25 c the do concentration in the reaction zone and the ph in the sedimentation zone was regularly measured using a portable do meter horiba om 70 japan and ph meter horiba d 72 japan while the ph was not controlled it remained at a constant 7 6 0 3 throughout the entire operation supplementary video

al 2017 the seed sludge was collected from an existing similar pn a reactor the reactor has been fed continuously by relatively high ammonia synthetic wastewater containing 250 mg nh4 n l for approximately 450 d at 25 1 c the ph ranged between 7 6 and 8 0 without any adjustment at the moment of inoculation the reactor was operated under a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 2 0 gn l d the initial mean size of the granules was 0 8 mm and the suspended solids ss and volatile suspended solids vss were 3 96 and 3 34 g l respectively hence the seed reactor had a nitrogen sludge loading rate nslr of 0 60 g n g vss d after inoculation the ammonium concentration in the influent was set at 100 mg l to enable the culture to adapt to the decreased ammonium content which took 43 days subsequently the influent ammonium concentration was changed to 50 mg l granule samples were collected on day 200 for microbial analysis using fish and 16s rrna gene sequencing for ex situ specific activities tests particle sizes distribution psd and element composition analyses granule samples were collected on day 220 2 2 analytic methods the psd of the granules formed in the air lift completely mixed reactor was analyzed using a laser granularity distribution analyzer ls 230 svm beckman coulter corporation usa with a detection range of 0 4 2000 μm in addition element composition was analyzed for the mixed liquor at the hrt 2 h granule samples were centrifuged iec61010 2 020 kubota japan for 20 min at 3000 rpm and the sediments were re suspended by 0 05m phosphate buffer afterwards the solution was re centrifuged and the final sediments were dried in an oven at 105 c and grinded to obtain dry biomass for the analysis of element composition which was implemented by using an organic element analyzer thermo fisher flash 2000 usa the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration was measured by capillary electrophoresis agilent 7100 agilent technologies usa during measurements a mixed solution 10 mm c3h4n2 5 mm ch3 2c oh cooh 2 mm c12h24o6 and 0 2w ch3cooh 99 purity made according to the manufacturer s instructions was used as running buffer for nh4 n detection while another solution 30 mm c7h5no4 and 0 5 mmc19h43no at ph 9 0 by tris adjustment was used as the running buffer for no2 n and no3 n detection all the chemicals were from wako japan 2 3 fish and confocal laser scanning microscope observation granules from the reactor were observed by the fish method granules were first washed by a freshly prepared phosphate buffer solution and then fixed in a 4 paraformaldehyde solution for 24 h at 4 c after fixation a dehydration series with 50 80 and 96 ethanol were conducted the granules were embedded in an optimum cutting temperature oct compound sakura finetek torrance ca overnight and the frozen samples were sectioned into 30 μm slices which could be fixed onto microscopic slides the probes for hybridization included eubmix equimolar mixture of eub338 eub338 ii eub338 iii and eub338iv for staining all bacteria appl and feeds 1990 daims et al 1999 schmid et al 2005 nso190 for staining aob mobarry et al 1996 and amx820 for anammox bacteria schmid et al 2001 2000 the fish samples were finally visualized with a zeiss lsm880 confocal laser scanning microscope clsm carl zeiss germany the target biovolume of active bacteria was calculated using image j software 2 4 dna extraction pcr amplification and 16s rrna gene sequencing the microbial community in the granules was analyzed by high throughput sequencing technique briefly dna was extracted and purified with isoil for the beads beating kit nippon gene japan the pcr amplification of prokaryotic 16s rrna gene was performed with the forward primer 515f and reverse primer 806r caporaso et al 2012 the dna sequencing was performed using miseq reagent kit v2 illumina usa of the miseq system 2 5 ex situ specific activities of anammox aob and nob once the reactor was deemed to have achieved the steady state operation condition under the final hrt of 2 h ex situ batch experiments were carried out to test the specific anammox activity saa ammonia oxidation activity saoa and nitrite oxidation activity snoa a volume of 40 ml mixed liquor was used for the batch experiments saa tests were performed in 120 ml serum bottles placed in a shaking bath bt300 yamato japan at 100 rpm at 25 c the nutrient medium consisted of nh4cl 150 mgn l and nano2 150 mgn l as the nitrogen source kh2po4 40 mg l nahco3 800 mg l cacl2 2h2o 36 mg l mgcl2 6h2o 26 mg l and 0 5 ml trace element the serum bottles were sealed and the headspace of the bottles was purged with n2 gas to remove oxygen when the bottle reached the set temperature in the water bath the headspace was vented to release the pressure caused by thermal expansion the n2 gas production and the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were monitored at regular intervals saoa and snoa tests were performed in 200 ml erlenmeyer flasks at a temperature of 25 c except for the nitrogen source the composition of the nutrient medium was the same as that used for saa nh4cl 150 mgn l and nano2 150 mgn l was used as the nitrogen source for the saoa and snoa tests respectively a gas pump was used to supply air into the solution and the gas flow rate was regulated to keep the do concentration ranged 0 1 0 2 mg l samples were taken every 30 min for a period of 3 h and the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured all of the analysis was conducted in two replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor operation performance the continuous experiment was operated for 250 days the entire operation period can be divided into 3 stages the start up period stage i the hrt decreasing period stage ii and the stable operation period stage iii as shown in fig 2 the startup was performed for 41 days in stage i by continuously feeding the influent with 100 mg nh4 n l at a hrt of 6 h to provide an adaptive phase for the seed sludge from treating high strength wastewater 250 mg nh4 n l to a low strength one from stage ii on the nh4 n concentration in the influent was lowered to 50 mg l in this stage the hrt was shortened stepwise from 3 h to 1 h with an increase in the nlr from 0 4 up to 1 2 gn l d as shown in fig 2a aeration rates of 0 3 l min at an hrt of 3 h and 0 35 l min at an hrt of 2 h resulted in a do range of 0 06 0 17 mg l and 0 06 0 21 mg l both which have been reported to be beneficial to the pn a process lackner et al 2014 at these two hrts the dominance of the no3 n over nh4 n in the effluent and the almost complete absence of no2 n remaining in the effluent fig 2b resulted in an average total nitrogen tn concentration in the effluent of 13 5 mg l this was maintained in a range of 7 95 18 0 mg l fig 2c and resulted in an average nitrogen removal efficiency of 72 5 with a range of 61 8 85 1 fig 2d when the hrt was shortened to 1 h stable performance was disrupted causing significant increases in concentrations of nh4 in the effluent fig 2b in order to enhance nh4 oxidization aeration was firstly increased from 0 35 to 0 40 l min but this caused only a minimal lowering of the effluent nh4 concentration subsequently the aeration was increased to 0 6 l min and as a result the do increased considerably approaching 0 6 mg l in the solution fig 2a to largely decrease the effluent nh4 to a reasonable level moreover the production of no2 was significantly enhanced resulting in an nh4 to no2 ratio of around 1 1 an appropriate mole ratio for anammox reaction lotti et al 2014 on days 114 120 however this condition could not be sustained because the increased do brought about a side effect of dramatic increases in the effluent no3 concentrations which exceeded 30 mg l in the later period at hrt 1 h fig 2b relatively high do is necessary for aob to consume nh4 under a high nlr but it contradictorily triggered nob overgrowth which outcompeted anammox by consuming no2 ma et al 2015 especially when the do concentration was more than 0 5 mg l lackner et al 2014 in addition the observed washing out of a large portion of the granules from the reactor when the hrt was extremely short also resulted in the deterioration of the reactor performance whereas the washout of granules resulted in a decrease in the vss concentration the decrease in hrt caused a notable increase in nlr the combined effects of which resulted in a significant increase in the food to microorganisms ratio as such the reactor performance deteriorated even further thus it seemed impractical to adjust aeration further to stabilize the performance at the extremely short hrt of 1 h consequently tn in the effluent increased to an average 36 1 mg l fig 2c and its removal efficiencies were down to an average 29 3 fig 2d at this hrt in stage iii the hrt was returned to 2 h and the aeration rate was lowered to 0 35 l min resulting in an average do concentration of 0 13 mg l fig 2a it took around 20 days to recover the performance the tn in the effluent was down to approximately 15 9 mg l and remained stable from the 167th day on fig 2c resulting in nitrogen removal efficiencies of 71 8 9 9 for treatment periods over 80 days fig 2d the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations in the effluent averaged 5 65 0 72 and 7 61 mg l respectively fig 2b when the stable performance was obtained table 1 compared the characteristics of single stage pn a processes using different kinds of reactors which were operated under the similar conditions with this study de clippeleir et al implemented pn a under relatively high nlrs of 0 85 kg n m3 day de clippeleir et al 2011 and 1 1 1 4 kg n m3 day de clippeleir et al 2013 using oland rbc oxygen limited autotrophic nitrogen denitrification rotating biofilm contactor but the tn removal efficiencies only reached 50 60 zhang et al 2013 achieved the tn removal efficiencies of around 70 under a nlr of 1 1 kg n m3 day using canon mbr completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite membrane bioreactor when the ammonium concentration was set as 88 mg l in the influent han et al 2016 and wang et al 2018 obtained 66 and 63 in average tn removal efficiencies respectively under relatively low nlr of 0 14 and 0 42 kg n m3 day these results suggest that stable operation performance with more than 70 tn removal efficiency is a challenge for pn a process in the treatment of low strength wastewater at 25 c in contrast this study showed integrally superior to the previously reported works with stable tn removal efficiencies of 71 8 9 9 low aeration energy 0 1 0 2 mg do l consumption relatively short hrt of 2 h and reasonably high nlr of 0 6 kg n m3 day burgeoning studies demonstrate that granule technology in low strength wastewater treatment commonly succeeded in the final stage of two stage pn a reactors like uasb cao et al 2017 but very few researchers mention the granules formed in single stage pn a reactors as shown in table 1 akaboci et al 2018 and pedrouso et al 2018 developed granule based single stage pn a processes by sbrs respectively at lab scale and pilot scale in these two studies the majority of the granules formed have sizes greater than 800 μm but the resulting tn removal efficiencies were less than 60 in contrast this study sustained very small size granules with a mean diameter of 338 μm that still drove efficient nitrogen removal performance in low ammonia wastewater treatment the stoichiometric relationship was investigated to provide a better understanding of the operating performance in the reactor as has been reported qiao et al 2013b approximately 65 of the influent nh4 in the pn a process is first oxidized to no2 shown in eq 1 by aob and then the residual nh4 and the produced no2 are converted to n2 shown in eq 2 by anammox bacteria thus the stoichiometric relationship of pn a can be expressed as eq 3 the presence of nob triggers the oxidation of no2 to no3 eq 4 therefore the stepwise nh4 oxidation by o2 referred to as nitrification can be expressed as eq 5 by combining eqs 1 and 4 in this analysis the newly found complete ammonia oxidization comammox process ma et al 2015 which oxidizes nh4 directly to no3 without no2 as intermediate were neglected and heterotrophic denitrification was also not considered because no organic matter was added to the synthetic influent 1 nitritation 1 3 n h 4 1 95 o 2 1 3 n o 2 2 6 h 1 3 h 2 o 2 anammox n h 4 1 3 n o 2 0 26 n o 3 1 02 n 2 2 h 2 o 3 pn a n h 4 0 85 o 2 0 11 n o 3 0 445 n 2 1 13 h 1 43 h 2 o 4 nitration n o 2 0 5 o 2 n o 3 5 nitrification 1 3 n h 4 2 6 o 2 1 3 n o 3 2 6 h 1 3 h 2 o while the no3 to nh4 ratio tends to be 0 11 if the influent nh4 is only bio converted through pn a process eq 3 that ratio is 1 00 if nh4 oxidation occurs only through nitrification process eq 5 fig 3 shows the stoichiometric no3 to nh4 ratio over the duration of the whole experiment it was found that the reactor operated under the stable operation when the no3 to nh4 ratio was maintained within the relatively narrow range of 0 0 3 except for the unstable condition under hrt 1 h in stage ii and the recovery phase in stage iii the no3 to nh4 ratios averaging 0 18 at both hrt 3 h and 2 h in stage ii and 0 17 at hrt 2 h in stage iii were a little bit higher than the theoretical value of 0 11 for pn a the higher nitrate production than that expected was likely related to the amount of nob growing in the reactor in contrast the no3 to nh4 ratio reached a peak value of 0 70 at an hrt of 1 h in stage ii over aeration at this extremely short hrt likely triggered the overgrowth of nob which caused nitrification to dominate the nh4 metabolism during this period 3 2 physicochemical properties of the granules 3 2 1 morphological properties of the granules as shown in fig 4 a the granules generally were elliptical in appearance with clear outlines and were bright red the psd curve fig 4b presented a sharp peak indicating the sizes of the majority of granules were maintained in a relatively narrow range the largely homogeneous diameter distribution of granules can be attributed to the operating condition of airlift induced complete mixing the mean size and median size of the granules were respective to be 338 3 and 388 μm these suspension growth granules are much smaller than those formed in many fixation growth granule reactors which are reported to have an average diameter comparative to or larger than 1 mm ni et al 2010 sabine marie et al 2015 vlaeminck et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 under low strength ammonia feeding condition mass transfer limitations inside the granules will induce small size granules in such scenario the influence of an adequate load of substrate per unit of biomass may stabilize the granular size and the nitrogen removal performance sánchez et al 2016 introduced nslr to explain the stabilization of size state of anammox granules nslr can be obtained by nlr dividing vss concentration when the nslr applied is comparable to the nslr capacity the size of the anammox granules can be stabilized that is to say the stabilization of the granule size cannot be sustained in case the difference between the nslr applied and nslr capacity is too high in this study the nlrs and vss concentrations at hrt 3 h 2 h and 1 h were 0 4 0 6 and 1 2 g n l d and 2 15 2 71 and 1 47 g l thus the nslrs at hrt 3 h 2 h and 1 h were determined to be 0 19 0 22 and 0 81 g n g vss d the nslr capacity should be defined as the ex situ specific activity of aob saoa of 0 24 g n g vss d see fig 7 b because the nitritation by aob was usually determined to be the rate limiting step in a single stage pn a reactor therefore the slight difference between the nslr applied and nslr capacity at hrt 3 h and 2 h resulted in the long term stabilization of granule size with a microstate even though the nitrogen concentration was relatively low in the influent however high differences between the nslr applied at hrt 1 h and nslr capacity largely disturb the tradeoff between granulation and degranulation which break the stabilization of the granule size fig 4c shows the major size range of micro granules more than 50 of the micro granules were in the size range of 265 536 μm 3 2 2 elementary composition of the granules the elemental biomass composition was measured on a dried sample taken on day 200 when the reactor could be deemed to have achieved its steady state operation under the final hrt of 2 h the c h o n s and p content were measured in two replicates and the elemental composition of the biomass was determined to be ch1 61o0 61n0 17s0 01p0 03 table 2 therefore the biomass molecular weight results in 27 0 gvs c mol the determined elementary composition of c h n and s were in good agreement with the results by lotti et al 2014 who obtained an elemental composition of ch1 74o0 31n0 20s0 01p0 01 from a highly enriched anammox suspension almost pure free cells in a membrane bioreactor however the o and p composition in this study were relatively higher in another published work an elemental composition of ch2o0 5n0 15s0 05 molecular weight 25 7 g c mol regardless element p was reported for a granule based sequencing batch reactor strous et al 1998 the results for the element o composition were close to those in this study the difference in the elemental composition in the granules and the suspended biomass likely lies in the linkages and backbones which support and maintain the stereoscopic morphology of the granules lin et al recently reported that α polysaccharides and proteins were considered the backbones of anammox granules while β polysaccharides concentrated at the outer rims of granules to form a buffer zone or protective barrier lin and wang 2017 regarding the metals fe is an essential element for synthesis of the key proteins inside anammox cells such as cytochrome c and heme c which are known to improve the activity of the anammox biomass qiao et al 2013a it has been reported that up to 20 of the total proteins in anammox cells are heme proteins sabine marie et al 2015 in a study clearly discriminating this biomass from other microbes it should be noted that both cytochromes and heme c require chelating fe ion to form the active regions van niftrik et al 2008 therefore it is possible that the fe element affects the intracellular ultrastructure of anammox cells which further impacts their metabolism and reddish appearance the divalent cations of mg2 and ca2 have been reported to serve as bridging for eps binding to form dense granules lin and wang 2017 gonzalez gil et al revealed that anammox bacteria may be embedded in the precipitates related to ca2 and po4 3 gonzalez gil et al 2015 through investigating the ultrastructure of granules in a full scale anammox reactor thus most of mg and ca likely function as extracellular metals for the building of linkages for cell aggregates which is a completely different role from that played by elemental fe 3 3 microstructural and microbial properties of the granules 3 3 1 spatial aob anammox association in the granules the spatial distribution of aob and anammox bacteria in the granules was visualized by fish four fish images are shown in fig 5 in these pictures all of the bacteria detected with eub338mix are shown in blue while the specific anammox detected with amx820 and aob population detected with nso190 are respectively indicated in red and green the bright blue signals result from the binding of eubmix and nso190 probes into one cell and the purple signals result from the binding of eubmix and the amx820 probes figs 5a and b show the images of the granule clusters a dozen granules coalesced in this cluster likely because the fish treatment and subsequent microtome slicing created a huddle of granules the granule size in this cluster of an averaged 200 400 μm is close to the results given by psd detection because most of the eub338mix probe hybridized cells fig 5a were simultaneously hybridized with either amx820 or nso190 fig 5b it can be concluded that anammox bacteria and aob were the two most dominant bacteria in the granules over 30 fish images were analyzed to determine the proportions of anammox bacteria and aob in the total bacteria the results showed anammox bacteria accounted for an average 37 7 6 2 of the total bacteria while aob accounted for 34 7 3 9 fig 5c and d shows the fish images of one granule the association of anammox bacteria and aob established a specific spatial structure like an olive 1 a majority of the anammox bacteria agglomerated and created a kernel of the granule and aob formed an outer thick rim 2 anammox cells agglomerated into several clusters while aob cells were distributed relatively evenly across the whole granule without any agglomeration and 3 the many fissures clearly observed within anammox clusters likely functioned as the tunnels through which substrates and waste flow with this specific structure a portion of influent nh4 was oxidized into no2 by aob at the surface layer of the granule and the residual nh4 and produced no2 were then used by the anammox in the kernel of the granule furthermore the surface coverage and o2 consumption by aob provided protection for the anammox bacteria from inhibition by o2 and other environmental factors 3 3 2 microbial community in the granules the phylogenetic trees of anammox bacteria lineages are shown in fig 6a since all of the 10 species of anammox bacteria determined to date belong to this family oshiki et al 2016 otus known to belong to the family brocadiaceae within phylum planctomycetes were considered as shown all the clone sequences grouped into two otus including otu3040 and otu852 the otu3040 with a relative abundance of 2 3 was closely related to the candidatus brocadia fulgida the other otu852 with a relative abundance of 27 6 was much more abundant than the otu3040 and they were closely related to the candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis fig 6b shows the phylogenetic trees of aob otus with a relative abundance of more than 1 belonging to the family nitrosomonadaceae were selected for analysis the otu373 with a relative abundance of 10 5 was very closely related to nitrosomonas europaea which is most common in sewage treatment plants green 2005 in addition nitrospira like nob otu133 with a relative abundance of 8 2 fig 6c were also detected it is highly similar to nitrospira defluvii which was reported to have the lowest half saturation constant determined for nitrospira so far and to be the main nitrite oxidizers in man made ecosystems like wastewater treatment plants nowka et al 2015 based on the amplicon sequencing analysis all the dominant bacteria with a relative abundance of more than 1 are listed in fig 6d anammox bacteria of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis were determined to be the most abundant species in the reactor with a relative abundance of 27 6 much higher than that of other bacteria hence with candidatus brocadia inclusion nearly 30 of the reads could be attributed to anammox bacteria regarding aob nitrosomonas like bacteria were the second most dominant microorganism in the reactor despite their relatively lower abundance than that of annamox the aforementioned reactor performance indicated their effect in the reactor is disproportionately high therefore the syntrophic co existing of anammox bacteria and aob was expected to have formed enabling anammox bacteria to be fed no2 produced by aob oxidizing nh4 thus ammonia oxidation was likely be the limiting rate step in the pn a process and aob inhibition may lead to process failure this statement was also previously proposed by several other related works li et al 2017 2016 morales et al 2016 yang et al 2017 in addition relatively abundant nitrospira a common genus of nob in the wastewater treatment process yao and peng 2017 was detected because of the different growth rates at low temperatures trade off between nob and aob is always a challenge in the pn a process gilbert et al 2014 picioreanu and loosdrecht 2014 notably chloroflexi like bacteria were detected to be the fourth dominant microorganisms which was reported to probably help with the biodegradation of macromolecules and the reinforcement of the granule structure yang et al 2018 table 3 described the relative abundances of the dominant anammox aob and nob in some other pn a reactors it demonstrated that aob dominated by nitrosomonas and nob dominated by nitrospira in this study was quite similar with those in other researches for anammox bacteria ca kuenenia was much abundant than ca brocadia in this study but the situation was converse in most of other researches both ca brocadia and ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis have been previously reported to be enriched in sludge from wastewater treatment plants a recently published review article reported the half saturation constant k s for nh4 of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis is much smaller than that of ca brocadia indicating ca brocadia would prefer nh4 rich environments because this anammox bacterium has low affinities for nh4 conversely ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis has higher affinity constant for nh4 oshiki et al 2016 the kinetic difference between these two bacteria can reasonably explain the occurrence of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis prevailing ca brocadia to be predominant after the long term operation by feeding low strength nh4 influent 3 3 3 hypothetical microstructure and reaction kinetics in the micro granules in fig 7a a microstructure is hypothesized for the microgranules the grouping of anammox bacterial cells formed several clusters in the core of a granule which are enveloped by a thick layer of aob with relatively low cell density a thin layer of aob with relatively high cell density formed an outer cover which functioned as an oxygen barrier though consuming most of the do an extracellular polymeric substance eps functioned as the cementation of these groups together to form compact aggregates zhu et al 2018 do depletion from the surface to the kernel was considered to be the key driver of forming three layer structure of granule which implied optimized do regulation is crucial to formation of syntrophic micro granule in sustaining efficient partial nitritation anammox saa saoa and snoa were investigated on day 200 to reveal the reaction kinetics in the micro granules and the results were shown in fig 7b the saoa achieved by nitrosomonas like aob was determined to be 0 24 0 05 gn gvss d while the saa by both ca kuenenia and ca brocadia was 0 31 0 07 gn gvss d which is in the same order of magnitude to that reported for granule based anammox at a range of 0 2 1 1 gn gvss d at 25 c lotti et al 2015 the snoa 0 07 gn gvss d was rarely detected indicating the activity of nob was efficiently limited in the reactor a small amount of nob mainly composed of nitrospira nob fig 6 is probably expected to inhabit very close to aob in the surface of the granules cao et al 2017 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that very small granules formed in a pn a reactor can adequately drive stable and efficient low strength ammonia wastewater treatment performance at a relatively short hrt of 2 h through syntrophic association of aob and anammox in the microgranules an adequate load of substrate per unit of biomass under the low strength feeding condition favored the formation of microstate granules to stabilize operation and achieve nitrogen removal efficiencies of 71 8 9 9 candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis anammox bacteria and nitrosomonas like aob were the two most dominant bacteria throughout the long term operation both of which formed spatially syntrophic co immobilization within the micro granules these results provide an alternative pn a process configuration for low strength wastewater treatment by sustaining

18944,the stable operation of the partial nitritation and anammox pn a process is a challenge in the treatment of low strength ammonia wastewater like sewage mainstream this study demonstrated the feasibility of achieving stable operation in the treatment of 50 mg l ammonia wastewater with a micro granule based pn a reactor the long term operation results showed nitrogen removal efficiencies of 71 8 9 9 were stably obtained under a relatively short hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 h the analysis on the physicochemical properties of the granules indicated most of the granules were in a size in a range of 265 536 μm and the elementary composition of the granules was determined to be ch1 61o0 61n0 17s0 01p0 03 the microbial analysis revealed candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis anammox bacteria and nitrosomonas like aob were the two most dominant bacteria with 27 6 and 10 5 abundance respectively both of which formed spatially syntrophic co immobilization within the micro granules the ex situ activity tests showed the activity of nob was well limited through do regulation in the reactor these results provide an alternative pn a process configuration for low strength wastewater treatment by sustaining microstate granules optimization of the nitrogen sludge loading rate and do regulation are important for the successful performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords micro granule partial nitritation anammox aob low strength hrt 2h 1 introduction the nitrification denitrification process in the conventional activated sludge cas system for sewage treatment is an energy intensive endeavor in wastewater treatment plants wwtps which have adopted the cas system approximately half of the energy input is consumed for aeration clearly a new configuration of wwtps is urgently needed to achieve the energy efficient removal of nitrogen there has been a shift from the dominant paradigm to new generation wwtps which involve the front separation of organic carbon for bioenergy recovery and the subsequent autotrophic nitrogen removal through the synergy between nitritation by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob oxidizing part of nh4 to no2 and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox by anammox bacteria which convert nh4 and no2 to nitrogen gas liu et al 2017 many studies have been implemented on different scales to investigate the feasibility of achieving anammox based nitrogen removal from mainstream wastewater by the partial nitritation and anammox pn a process however the application of mainstream pn a remains challenging largely due to the unstable partial nitritation and inactivation of anammox resulting from both low nitrogen concentrations and low temperatures reino and eugenia 2016 in addition due to the long doubling time of around 19 days at 25 c of anammox bacteria sabine marie et al 2015 the retention of these microorganisms in the treatment systems is difficult to guarantee at levels required for process functionality the inadequate retention of anammox bacteria results in process bottleneck excellent anammox bacteria retention and biomass settleability can be obtained through biomass granulation ni et al 2010 vlaeminck et al 2010 granules with high cell density strengthen the information exchange and cooperation among bacteria in effect enhancing bacterial metabolism and activity cao et al 2017 lin and wang 2017 multiple investigations designed to evaluate the treatment performances and determine the specific properties of anammox granules have been reported however the attention of these studies tends to have been focused on granules formed in the high strength wastewater fed reactors nitrogen concentration 100 mg l gonzalez gil et al 2015 lin and wang 2017 ni et al 2010 vlaeminck et al 2010 in these studies the size of the majority of the granules is comparable to or larger than 1 mm in granule based anammox bioreactors the diameter size of granular sludge is an important parameter influencing the operation performance which is affected by the shape of the reactor hydraulic shear force and substrate loading rate and other factors ma et al 2013 tang et al 2011 a recent report by zhu et al 2018 demonstrated that it is not the bigger size granules that drive better performance in low strength wastewater treatment and that the optimal anammox granules sizes in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor are 0 5 0 9 mm it is to be questioned whether similarly sized granules could improve the performance of pn a reactors as well additionally high shear stress induced by complete mixing in pn a reactors may produce granules that are smaller than observed by zhu et al 2018 nonetheless studies associated with very small size anammox granules formed in low strength wastewater fed reactors are still scarce furthermore granules formed in a single stage pn a reactor are expected to comprise a consortium of anammox bacteria and aob embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps vlaeminck et al 2010 however the microbial abundance activity and community structure of very small size anammox granules co embedded with anammox bacteria and aob are not well understood the aim of this work was to optimize the operational conditions and syntrophic micro granule in pn a reactor for low strength ammonia wastewater treatment the specific objectives were to 1 investigate aob anammox bacteria co immobilization in very small size granules for low strength ammonia wastewater treatment 2 explore factors to achieve stable operation and efficient nitrogen removal performance 3 unravel the physicochemical properties of the micro granules formed through detection of particle sizes distribution and determining their elemental composition and microbial properties using fluorescent in situ hybridization fish 16s rrna gene sequencing and specific activity tests the results provide an alternative configuration for a pn a reactor and illustrate that the anammox granules with very small sizes still drive highly efficient performance in mainstream treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation a lab scale integrated reactor was developed to concurrently achieving pn a sedimentation and sludge circulation as shown in fig 1 an air lift completely mixed zone with 2 l of effective volume was used as reaction unit for pn a while an inclined plate zone with 0 4 l of volume was employed to serve as sedimentation unit in which the sediments can be returned to the reaction unit under the driving force by airlift air was supplied by a constant speed diaphragm pump apn 085 lv 1 iwaki japan to the bottom of the reaction area through a fixed glass tube to provide continuous air lift mixing and oxygen diffusion the continuous air lifting mixing performance can be seen in the supplementary video a rotameter was used to regulate the aeration rate a peristaltic pump fp 100 1515 as one japan was used to transfer synthetic influent to the reactor the temperature in the reactor was maintained by use of a water jacket at 25 c the do concentration in the reaction zone and the ph in the sedimentation zone was regularly measured using a portable do meter horiba om 70 japan and ph meter horiba d 72 japan while the ph was not controlled it remained at a constant 7 6 0 3 throughout the entire operation supplementary video

al 2017 the seed sludge was collected from an existing similar pn a reactor the reactor has been fed continuously by relatively high ammonia synthetic wastewater containing 250 mg nh4 n l for approximately 450 d at 25 1 c the ph ranged between 7 6 and 8 0 without any adjustment at the moment of inoculation the reactor was operated under a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 2 0 gn l d the initial mean size of the granules was 0 8 mm and the suspended solids ss and volatile suspended solids vss were 3 96 and 3 34 g l respectively hence the seed reactor had a nitrogen sludge loading rate nslr of 0 60 g n g vss d after inoculation the ammonium concentration in the influent was set at 100 mg l to enable the culture to adapt to the decreased ammonium content which took 43 days subsequently the influent ammonium concentration was changed to 50 mg l granule samples were collected on day 200 for microbial analysis using fish and 16s rrna gene sequencing for ex situ specific activities tests particle sizes distribution psd and element composition analyses granule samples were collected on day 220 2 2 analytic methods the psd of the granules formed in the air lift completely mixed reactor was analyzed using a laser granularity distribution analyzer ls 230 svm beckman coulter corporation usa with a detection range of 0 4 2000 μm in addition element composition was analyzed for the mixed liquor at the hrt 2 h granule samples were centrifuged iec61010 2 020 kubota japan for 20 min at 3000 rpm and the sediments were re suspended by 0 05m phosphate buffer afterwards the solution was re centrifuged and the final sediments were dried in an oven at 105 c and grinded to obtain dry biomass for the analysis of element composition which was implemented by using an organic element analyzer

granules from the reactor were observed by the fish method granules were first washed by a freshly prepared phosphate buffer solution and then fixed in a 4 paraformaldehyde solution for 24 h at 4 c after fixation a dehydration series with 50 80 and 96 ethanol were conducted the granules were embedded in an optimum cutting temperature oct compound sakura finetek torrance ca overnight and the frozen samples were sectioned into 30 μm slices which could be fixed onto microscopic slides the probes for hybridization included eubmix equimolar mixture of eub338 eub338 ii eub338 iii and eub338iv

finally visualized with a zeiss lsm880 confocal laser scanning microscope clsm carl zeiss germany the target biovolume of active bacteria was calculated using image j software 2 4 dna extraction pcr amplification and 16s rrna gene sequencing the microbial community in the granules was analyzed by high throughput sequencing technique briefly dna was extracted and purified with isoil for the beads beating kit nippon gene japan the pcr amplification of prokaryotic 16s rrna gene was performed with the forward primer 515f and reverse primer 806r caporaso et al 2012 the dna sequencing was performed using miseq reagent kit v2 illumina usa of the miseq system 2 5 ex situ specific activities of anammox aob and nob once the reactor was deemed to have achieved the steady state operation condition under the final hrt of 2 h ex situ batch experiments were carried out to test the specific anammox activity saa ammonia oxidation activity saoa and nitrite oxidation activity snoa a volume of 40 ml mixed liquor was used for the batch experiments saa tests were performed in 120 ml serum bottles placed in a shaking bath bt300 yamato japan at 100 rpm at 25 c the nutrient medium consisted of nh4cl 150 mgn l and nano2 150 mgn l as the nitrogen source kh2po4 40 mg l nahco3 800 mg l cacl2 2h2o 36 mg l mgcl2 6h2o 26 mg l and 0 5 ml trace element the serum bottles were sealed and the headspace of the bottles was purged with n2 gas to remove oxygen when the bottle reached the set temperature in the water bath the headspace was vented to release the pressure caused by thermal expansion the n2 gas production and the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were monitored at regular intervals saoa and snoa tests were performed in 200 ml erlenmeyer flasks at a temperature of 25 c except for the nitrogen source the composition of the nutrient medium was the same as that used for saa nh4cl 150 mgn l and nano2 150 mgn l was used as the nitrogen source for the saoa and snoa tests respectively a gas pump was used to supply air into the solution and the gas flow rate was regulated to keep the do concentration ranged 0 1 0 2 mg l samples were taken every 30 min for a period of 3 h and the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured all of the analysis was conducted in two replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor operation performance the continuous experiment was operated for 250 days the entire operation period can be divided into 3 stages the start up period stage i the hrt decreasing period stage ii and the stable operation period stage iii as shown in fig 2 the startup was performed for 41 days in stage i by continuously feeding the influent with 100 mg nh4 n l at a hrt of 6 h to provide an adaptive phase for the seed sludge from treating high strength wastewater 250 mg nh4 n l to a low strength one from stage ii on the nh4 n concentration in the influent was lowered to 50 mg l in this stage the hrt was shortened stepwise from 3 h to 1 h with an increase in the nlr from 0 4 up to 1 2 gn l d as shown in fig 2a aeration rates of 0 3 l min at an hrt of 3 h and 0 35 l min at an hrt of 2 h resulted in a do range of 0 06 0 17 mg l and 0 06 0 21 mg l both which have been reported to be beneficial to the pn a process lackner et al 2014 at these two hrts the dominance of the no3 n over nh4 n in the effluent and the almost complete absence of no2 n remaining in the effluent fig 2b resulted in an average total nitrogen tn concentration in the effluent of 13 5 mg l this was maintained in a range of 7 95 18 0 mg l fig 2c and resulted in an average nitrogen removal efficiency of 72 5 with a range of 61 8 85 1 fig 2d when the hrt was shortened to 1 h stable performance was disrupted causing significant increases in concentrations of nh4 in the effluent fig 2b in order to enhance nh4 oxidization aeration was firstly increased from 0 35 to 0 40 l min but this caused only a minimal lowering of the effluent nh4 concentration subsequently the aeration was increased to 0 6 l min and as a result the do increased considerably approaching 0 6 mg l in the solution fig 2a to largely decrease the effluent nh4 to a reasonable level moreover the production of no2 was significantly enhanced resulting in an nh4 to no2 ratio of around 1 1 an appropriate mole ratio for anammox reaction lotti et al 2014 on days 114 120 however this condition could not be sustained because the increased do brought about a side effect of dramatic increases in the effluent no3 concentrations which exceeded 30 mg l in the later period at hrt 1 h fig 2b relatively high do is necessary for aob to consume nh4 under a high nlr but it contradictorily triggered nob overgrowth which outcompeted anammox by consuming no2 ma et al 2015 especially when the do concentration was more than 0 5 mg l lackner et al 2014 in addition the observed washing out of a large portion of the granules from the reactor when the hrt was extremely short also resulted in the deterioration of the reactor performance whereas the washout of granules resulted in a decrease in the vss concentration the decrease in hrt caused a notable increase in nlr the combined effects of which resulted in a significant increase in the food to microorganisms ratio as such the reactor performance deteriorated even further thus it seemed impractical to adjust aeration further to stabilize the performance at the extremely short hrt of 1 h consequently tn in the effluent increased to an average 36 1 mg l fig 2c and its removal efficiencies were down to an average 29 3 fig 2d at this hrt in stage iii the hrt was returned to 2 h and the aeration rate was lowered to 0 35 l min resulting in an average do concentration of 0 13 mg l fig 2a it took around 20 days to recover the performance the tn in the effluent was down to approximately 15 9 mg l and remained stable from the 167th day on fig 2c resulting in nitrogen removal efficiencies of 71 8 9 9 for treatment periods over 80 days fig 2d the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations in the effluent averaged 5 65 0 72 and 7 61 mg l respectively fig 2b when the stable performance was obtained table 1 compared the characteristics of single stage pn a processes using different kinds of reactors which were operated under the similar conditions with this study de clippeleir et al implemented pn a under relatively high nlrs of 0 85 kg n m3 day de clippeleir et al 2011 and 1 1 1 4 kg n m3 day de clippeleir et al 2013 using oland rbc oxygen limited autotrophic nitrogen denitrification rotating biofilm contactor but the tn removal efficiencies only reached 50 60 zhang et al 2013 achieved the tn removal efficiencies of around 70 under a nlr of 1 1 kg n m3 day using canon mbr completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite membrane bioreactor when the ammonium concentration was set as 88 mg l in the influent han et al 2016 and wang et al 2018 obtained 66 and 63 in average tn removal efficiencies respectively under relatively low nlr of 0 14 and 0 42 kg n m3 day these results suggest that stable operation performance with more than 70 tn removal efficiency is a challenge for pn a process in the treatment of low strength wastewater at 25 c in contrast this study showed integrally superior to the previously reported works with stable tn removal efficiencies of 71 8 9 9 low aeration energy 0 1 0 2 mg do l consumption relatively short hrt of 2 h and reasonably high nlr of 0 6 kg n m3 day burgeoning studies demonstrate that granule technology in low strength wastewater treatment commonly succeeded in the final stage of two stage pn a reactors like uasb cao et al 2017 but very few researchers mention the granules formed in single stage pn a reactors as shown in table 1 akaboci et al 2018 and pedrouso et al 2018 developed granule based single stage pn a processes by sbrs respectively at lab scale and pilot scale in these two studies the majority of the granules formed have sizes greater than 800 μm but the resulting tn removal efficiencies were less than 60 in contrast this study sustained very small size granules with a mean diameter of 338 μm that still drove efficient nitrogen removal performance in low ammonia wastewater treatment the stoichiometric relationship was investigated to provide a better understanding of the operating performance in the reactor as has been reported qiao et al 2013b approximately 65 of the influent nh4 in the pn a process is first oxidized to no2 shown in eq 1 by aob and then the residual nh4 and the produced no2 are converted to n2 shown in eq 2 by anammox bacteria thus the stoichiometric relationship of pn a can be expressed as eq 3 the presence of nob triggers the oxidation of no2 to no3 eq 4 therefore the stepwise nh4 oxidation by o2 referred to as nitrification can be expressed as eq 5 by combining eqs 1 and 4 in this analysis the newly found complete ammonia oxidization comammox process ma et al 2015 which oxidizes nh4 directly to no3 without no2 as intermediate were neglected and heterotrophic denitrification was also not considered because no organic matter was added to the synthetic influent 1

o 3 5 nitrification 1 3 n h 4 2 6 o 2 1 3 n o 3 2 6 h 1 3 h 2 o while the no3 to nh4 ratio tends to be 0 11 if the influent nh4 is only bio converted through pn a process eq 3 that ratio is 1 00 if nh4 oxidation occurs only through nitrification process eq 5 fig 3 shows the stoichiometric no3 to nh4 ratio over the duration of the whole experiment it was found that the reactor operated under the stable operation when the no3 to nh4 ratio was maintained within the relatively narrow range of 0 0 3 except for the unstable condition under hrt 1 h in stage ii and the recovery phase in stage iii the no3 to nh4 ratios averaging 0 18 at both hrt 3 h and 2 h in stage ii and 0 17 at hrt 2 h in stage iii were a little bit higher than the theoretical value of 0 11 for pn a the higher nitrate production than that expected was likely related to the amount of nob growing in the reactor in contrast the no3 to nh4 ratio reached a peak value of 0 70 at an hrt of 1 h in stage ii over aeration at this extremely short hrt likely triggered the overgrowth of nob which caused nitrification to dominate the nh4 metabolism during this period 3 2 physicochemical properties of the granules 3 2 1 morphological properties of the granules as shown in fig 4 a the granules generally were elliptical in appearance with clear outlines and were bright red the psd curve fig 4b presented a sharp peak indicating the sizes of the majority of granules were maintained in a relatively narrow range the largely homogeneous diameter distribution of granules can be attributed to the operating condition of airlift induced complete mixing the mean size and median size of the granules were respective to be 338 3 and 388 μm these suspension growth granules are much smaller than those formed in many fixation growth granule reactors which are reported to have an average diameter comparative to or larger than 1 mm ni et al 2010 sabine marie et al 2015 vlaeminck et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 under low strength ammonia feeding condition mass transfer limitations inside the granules will induce small size granules in such scenario the influence of an adequate load of substrate per unit of biomass may stabilize the granular size and the nitrogen removal performance sánchez et al 2016 introduced nslr to explain the stabilization of size state of anammox granules nslr can be obtained by nlr dividing vss concentration when the nslr applied is comparable to the nslr capacity the size of the anammox granules can be stabilized that is to say the stabilization of the granule size cannot be sustained in case the difference between the nslr applied and nslr capacity is too high in this study the nlrs and vss concentrations at hrt 3 h 2 h and 1 h were 0 4 0 6 and 1 2 g n l d and 2 15 2 71 and 1 47 g l thus the nslrs at hrt 3 h 2 h and 1 h were determined to be 0 19 0 22 and 0 81 g n g vss d the nslr capacity should be defined as the ex situ specific activity of aob saoa of 0 24 g n g vss d see fig 7 b because the nitritation by aob was usually determined to be the rate limiting step in a single stage pn a reactor therefore the slight difference between the nslr applied and nslr capacity at hrt 3 h and 2 h resulted in the long term stabilization of granule size with a microstate even though the nitrogen concentration was relatively low in the influent however high differences between the nslr applied at hrt 1 h and nslr capacity largely disturb the tradeoff between granulation and degranulation which break the stabilization of the granule size fig 4c shows the major size range of micro granules more than 50 of the micro granules were in the size range of 265 536 μm 3 2 2 elementary composition of the granules the elemental biomass composition was measured on a dried sample taken on day 200 when the reactor could be deemed to have achieved its steady state operation under the final hrt of 2 h the c h o n s and p content were measured in two replicates and the elemental composition of the biomass was determined to be ch1 61o0 61n0 17s0 01p0 03 table 2 therefore the biomass molecular weight results in 27 0 gvs c mol the determined elementary composition of c h n and s were in good agreement with the results by lotti et al 2014 who obtained an elemental composition of ch1 74o0 31n0 20s0 01p0 01 from a highly enriched anammox suspension almost pure free cells in a membrane bioreactor however the o and p composition in this study were relatively higher in another published work an elemental composition of ch2o0 5n0 15s0 05 molecular weight 25 7 g c mol regardless element p was reported for a granule based sequencing batch reactor strous et al 1998 the results for the element o composition were close to those in this study the difference in the elemental composition in the granules and the suspended biomass likely lies in the linkages and backbones which support and maintain the stereoscopic morphology of the granules lin et al recently reported that α polysaccharides and proteins were considered the backbones of anammox granules while β polysaccharides concentrated at the outer rims of granules to form a buffer zone or protective barrier lin and wang 2017 regarding the metals fe is an essential element for synthesis of the key proteins inside anammox cells such as cytochrome c and heme c which are known to improve the activity of the anammox biomass qiao et al 2013a it has been reported that up to 20 of the total proteins in anammox cells are heme proteins sabine marie et al 2015 in a study clearly discriminating this biomass from other microbes it should be noted that both cytochromes and heme c require chelating fe ion to form the active regions van niftrik et al 2008 therefore it is possible that the fe element affects the intracellular ultrastructure of anammox cells which further impacts their metabolism and reddish appearance the divalent cations of mg2 and ca2 have been reported to serve as bridging for eps binding to form dense granules lin and wang 2017 gonzalez gil et al revealed that anammox bacteria may be embedded in the precipitates related to ca2 and po4 3 gonzalez gil et al 2015 through investigating the ultrastructure of granules in a full scale anammox reactor thus most of mg and ca likely function as extracellular metals for the building of linkages for cell aggregates which is a completely different role from that played by elemental fe 3 3 microstructural and microbial properties of the granules 3 3 1 spatial aob anammox association in the granules the spatial distribution of aob and anammox bacteria in the granules was visualized by fish four fish images are shown in fig 5 in these pictures all of the bacteria detected with eub338mix are shown in blue while the specific anammox detected with amx820 and aob population detected with nso190 are respectively indicated in red and green the bright blue signals result from the binding of eubmix and nso190 probes into one cell and the purple signals result from the binding of eubmix and the amx820 probes figs 5a and b show the images of the granule clusters a dozen granules coalesced in this cluster likely because the fish treatment and subsequent microtome slicing created a huddle of granules the granule size in this cluster of an averaged 200 400 μm is close to the results given by psd detection because most of the eub338mix probe hybridized cells fig 5a were simultaneously hybridized with either amx820 or nso190 fig 5b it can be concluded that anammox bacteria and aob were the two most dominant bacteria in the granules over 30 fish images were analyzed to determine the proportions of anammox bacteria and aob in the total bacteria the results showed anammox bacteria accounted for an average 37 7 6 2 of the total bacteria while aob accounted for 34 7 3 9 fig 5c and d shows the fish images of one granule the association of anammox bacteria and aob established a specific spatial structure like an olive 1 a majority of the anammox bacteria agglomerated and created a kernel of the granule and aob formed an outer thick rim 2 anammox cells agglomerated into several clusters while aob cells were distributed relatively evenly across the whole granule without any agglomeration and 3 the many fissures clearly observed within anammox clusters likely functioned as the tunnels through which substrates and waste flow with this specific structure a portion of influent nh4 was oxidized into no2 by aob at the surface layer of the granule and the residual nh4 and produced no2 were then used by the anammox in the kernel of the granule furthermore the surface coverage and o2 consumption by aob provided protection for the anammox bacteria from inhibition by o2 and other environmental factors 3 3 2 microbial community in the granules the phylogenetic trees of anammox bacteria lineages are shown in fig 6a since all of the 10 species of anammox bacteria determined to date belong to this family oshiki et al 2016 otus known to belong to the family brocadiaceae within phylum planctomycetes were considered as shown all the clone sequences grouped into two otus including otu3040 and otu852 the otu3040 with a relative abundance of 2 3 was closely related to the candidatus brocadia fulgida the other otu852 with a relative abundance of 27 6 was much more abundant than the otu3040 and they were closely related to the candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis fig 6b shows the phylogenetic trees of aob otus with a relative abundance of more than 1 belonging to the family nitrosomonadaceae were selected for analysis the otu373 with a relative abundance of 10 5 was very closely related to nitrosomonas europaea which is most common in sewage treatment plants green 2005 in addition nitrospira like nob otu133 with a relative abundance of 8 2 fig 6c were also detected it is highly similar to nitrospira defluvii which was reported to have the lowest half saturation constant determined for nitrospira so far and to be the main nitrite oxidizers in man made ecosystems like wastewater treatment plants nowka et al 2015 based on the amplicon sequencing analysis all the dominant bacteria with a relative abundance of more than 1 are listed in fig 6d anammox bacteria of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis were determined to be the most abundant species in the reactor with a relative abundance of 27 6 much higher than that of other bacteria hence with candidatus brocadia inclusion nearly 30 of the reads could be attributed to anammox bacteria regarding aob nitrosomonas like bacteria were the second most dominant microorganism in the reactor despite their relatively lower abundance than that of annamox the aforementioned reactor performance indicated their effect in the reactor is disproportionately high therefore the syntrophic co existing of anammox bacteria and aob was expected to have formed enabling anammox bacteria to be fed no2 produced by aob oxidizing nh4 thus ammonia oxidation was likely be the limiting rate step in the pn a process and aob inhibition may lead to process failure this statement was also previously proposed by several other related works li et al 2017 2016 morales et al 2016 yang et al 2017 in addition relatively abundant nitrospira a common genus of nob in the wastewater treatment process yao and peng 2017 was detected because of the different growth rates at low temperatures trade off between nob and aob is always a challenge in the pn a process gilbert et al 2014 picioreanu and loosdrecht 2014 notably chloroflexi like bacteria were detected to be the fourth dominant microorganisms which was reported to probably help with the biodegradation of macromolecules and the reinforcement of the granule structure yang et al 2018 table 3 described the relative abundances of the dominant anammox aob and nob in some other pn a reactors it demonstrated that aob dominated by nitrosomonas and nob dominated by nitrospira in this study was quite similar with those in other researches for anammox bacteria ca kuenenia was much abundant than ca brocadia in this study but the situation was converse in most of other researches both ca brocadia and ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis have been previously reported to be enriched in sludge from wastewater treatment plants a recently published review article reported the half saturation constant k s for nh4 of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis is much smaller than that of ca brocadia indicating ca brocadia would prefer nh4 rich environments because this anammox bacterium has low affinities for nh4 conversely ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis has higher affinity constant for nh4 oshiki et al 2016 the kinetic difference between these two bacteria can reasonably explain the occurrence of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis prevailing ca brocadia to be predominant after the long term operation by feeding low strength nh4 influent 3 3 3 hypothetical microstructure and reaction kinetics in the micro granules in fig 7a a microstructure is hypothesized for the microgranules the grouping of anammox bacterial cells formed several clusters in the core of a granule which are enveloped by a thick layer of aob with relatively low cell density a thin layer of aob with relatively high cell density formed an outer cover which functioned as an oxygen barrier though consuming most of the do an extracellular polymeric substance eps functioned as the cementation of these groups together to form compact aggregates zhu et al 2018 do depletion from the surface to the kernel was considered to be the key driver of forming three layer structure of granule which implied optimized do regulation is crucial to formation of syntrophic micro granule in sustaining efficient partial nitritation anammox saa saoa and snoa were investigated on day 200 to reveal the reaction kinetics in the micro granules and the results were shown in fig 7b the saoa achieved by nitrosomonas like aob was determined to be 0 24 0 05 gn gvss d while the saa by both ca kuenenia and ca brocadia was 0 31 0 07 gn gvss d which is in the same order of magnitude to that reported for granule based anammox at a range of 0 2 1 1 gn gvss d at 25 c lotti et al 2015 the snoa 0 07 gn gvss d was rarely detected indicating the activity of nob was efficiently limited in the reactor a small amount of nob mainly composed of nitrospira nob fig 6 is probably expected to inhabit very close to aob in the surface of the granules cao et al 2017 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that very small granules formed in a pn a reactor can adequately drive stable and efficient low strength ammonia wastewater treatment performance at a relatively short hrt of 2 h through syntrophic association of aob and anammox in the microgranules an adequate load of substrate per unit of biomass under the low strength feeding condition favored the formation of microstate granules to stabilize operation and achieve nitrogen removal efficiencies of 71 8 9 9 candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis anammox bacteria and nitrosomonas like aob were the two most dominant bacteria throughout the long term operation both of which formed spatially syntrophic co immobilization within the micro granules these results provide an alternative pn a process configuration for low strength wastewater treatment by sustaining microstate granules optimization of the nitrogen sludge loading rate and do regulation are important for the successful performance declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known
